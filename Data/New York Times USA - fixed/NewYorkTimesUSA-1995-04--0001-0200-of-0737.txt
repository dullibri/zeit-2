Players Ready to Return
After Court Issues Order
Baseball players said they were ready to return to work after a Federal judge issued an injunction ordering baseball owners to restore salary arbitration, competitive bidding for free agents and the anti-collusion provision of the free-agency rules.
 It was still not clear whether the owners would let the players return. A hearing was set for Tuesday on the owners' request for a stay and an expedited appeal. Page 1.

HEADLINE: Gas, Food, Laundry;
Entrepreneurs Seeking Heavy Traffic in Light Starch on the Parkway

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
This is Paul McDonald's vision of the future of laundry: A car rolls to a stop in the southbound Hutchinson River Parkway service area in the Bronx. A uniformed attendant scrambles. Ten seconds later, the driver accelerates back into traffic and a dozen dirty shirts head for the wash, to be picked up that night across the parkway on the commuter's trip home.
 If there is a business niche between the Daytona 500 and Botany 500, Mr. McDonald has staked a claim to it with a proposal to open what cleaning industry experts say would be the first business of its kind: a laundry and dry-cleaning service at two vacant service areas on the parkway just south of the Westchester County line. 
Commuters want speed, Mr. McDonald believes, but they also want clean suits, and he has promised, in a bid being considered by New York City parkway administrators, to deliver both.
 According to Mr. McDonald's calculations, 10 seconds is plenty of time to drop off dry cleaning, if he uses laser bar-code readers and old-fashioned hustle. He cautions, however, that the pickup portion of his laundry-a-go-go business, called Commuter Cleaners, could be slower than the drop-off portion, in which a receipt would be quickly dispensed.
 It could take up to 25 seconds for money to change hands, and even that pace is contingent on drivers being able to pop the trunk from inside the car in order for their clean clothes to be deposited.
 "There's a premium on time," said Mr. McDonald, 34, a former commuter from Stamford, Conn., who already operates six Commuter Cleaners sites at Metro-North Commuter Railroad stations in Westchester and Connecticut, where he has honed the transaction times to an average of about 40 seconds, he said. "Anything to save time," he said.
 As is often the case with projects involving the New York parkway system, Mr. McDonald's business idea has inspired debate about esthetics. The parkways, built in the 1920's and 1930's during the reign of Robert Moses, New York's legendary Parks Commissioner, were envisioned as pleasure-cruising greenswards where motorists could flee the urban thrum.
 And that mentality lingers, despite the reality of modern traffic volume, which in the case of the Hutch, as it is known, exceeds 50,000 vehicles a day. Parks officials in Westchester County turned Mr. McDonald down cold last year when he proposed a Commuter Cleaners on the Bronx River Parkway near Scarsdale. County officials said that a cleaner was not an "appropriate" use for parkland, Mr. McDonald said.
 Across the border in New York City, on the other hand, Mr. McDonald and his partner, Wayne T. Jeffers, a gas station operator, say they have heard nothing but encouragement, and they expect their plan to be approved shortly and to begin operations this summer.
 Henry J. Stern, the city's Parks Commissioner, who said he has the sole authority to sign off on the deal, asserted that with commuters increasingly pressed for time, new uses for the parkway service areas must be encouraged. Under its contract system, the city also has an economic incentive to encourage parkway businesses, with provisions that guarantee the city a minimum rent from a tenant, or a percentage of sales revenue, whichever is greater.
 Mr. Jeffers, who operates 75 gas stations around the New York City region, said that if the Hutchinson proposal proved successful, it could mean the launching of a new laundry and gasoline empire. He and Mr. McDonald are already planning their next project, at two long-closed service areas on the Saw Mill River Parkway in Hastings. Because one of the service areas is considered architecturally significant, that plan hinges on approval from New York State historic preservation officials.
 Mr. Jeffers said that at the Hutchinson business, he plans to sell gas and snacks, groceries and newspapers. But it is the dry cleaning and laundry service, he said, that will be the real hook.
 "Selling gas is not that brilliant an operation, but if we tie the necessity of gas to saving some time, then we think we've got a synergy," he said. "Conceptually, once the commuter is stopped at the cleaners, he's stopped, and he might as well stop for gas."
 Mr. McDonald said he plans to take advantage of bar codes on New York State vehicle registration stickers, which are placed on windshields. He would use a hand-held laser device to read the bar codes and spit out an instant receipt with the car owner's name and address. The laundry would be trucked 13 miles to Port Chester, where the Commuter Cleaners plant already handles the wash from its Metro-North Railroad stations in Rye, Chappaqua, Bronxville, Croton-Harmon and Port Chester, in New York, and its Connecticut station site, Greenwich.
 Then it will all go back to the parkway. But since dropoffs will be taken from both directions, each bundle will have to land on the opposite side of the parkway from where it started.
 "There's still some logistics to be worked out," Mr. McDonald said. "But they told me it wouldn't work at the train stations either."

HEADLINE: A Wild Day for the Markets as Dollar Resumes Its Plunge

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The dollar plunged to new post-World-War-II lows against the German mark and the Japanese yen yesterday, as stocks closed mixed after a tumultuous day that began with a fall of more than 60 points in the Dow Jones industrial average. After sharp swings of their own, long-term interest rates rose slightly.
 Although stock and bond prices rallied from their lows, analysts say the three-month-long decline in the dollar may finally be dragging down the stock and bond markets in the United States, as a weak dollar discourages foreign investors from buying American assets. 
"The dollar was in free fall and clearly starting to have an effect on the bond market," said Terrence Crowe, vice president for bond arbitrage at the Nikko Securities Company International.
 But the dollar was not the sole reason for the market volatility. In fact there seemed to be so many factors that it was hard to pinpoint what was most important. These included the lack of a decision by the Bank of Japan on the yen, a Wall Street analyst's downward reassessment of four technology stocks, a spike in the price of gold and silver, end-of-the-quarter "window dressing" by money managers, a rumor about a special Federal Reserve meeting and a general uneasiness that stock and bond prices might have simply risen too high.
 A revision of the estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth to 5.1 percent from 4.6 percent may have also helped send stock prices lower, while a decline in factory orders in February may have helped the rebound.
 The variety of factors that buffeted the markets, coming at the end of the quarter, exaggerated the price swings in the markets. Without the quarterly reckoning and especially the speculation about the Bank of Japan, analysts say, prices might still have dropped, but not as far and as fast.
 "Everything has been grossly, grossly exaggerated today," said Kevin Lawrie, manager of foreign exchange at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
 After dropping more than 60 points, the Dow Jones industrial average rallied to 4,157.69, finishing down just 14.87 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 1.51 points, to 500.71.
 After a steep drop in the morning, the Nasdaq composite index, rich in fast-rising technology stocks, rallied and finished at 817.21, up 0.35 point for the day.
 Bond prices rebounded some in the afternoon after falling sharply in the morning. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.43 percent from 7.41 percent.
 The angst started early. On Thursday, the German central bank, the Bundesbank, had surprised currency traders by cutting interest rates. Because some traders decided that this was a ploy to prop up the weak dollar, they concluded that it followed that the Japanese central bank, the Bank of Japan, would also cut rates.
 When the Japanese did nothing yesterday, currency traders around the world dumped dollars, sending the American currency to as low as 86.34 yen and 1.3649 German marks. In New York, the dollar settled at 86.55 yen, down 3.4 percent from 89.55 yen the day before, and settled at 1.3715 marks, down 2.6 percent from 1.4083 marks.
 The dollar has already lost 12 percent of its value against the mark this year and almost 14 percent against the yen. Since mid-1985, the dollar has fallen 65 percent against the yen and 55 percent against the mark.
 Moreover, markets in both Japan and the United States were unsettled by the end of the Japanese fiscal year.
 Japanese needed to settle their accounts after a sour three months, when the Nikkei 225 stock index dropped more than 18 percent. Because of the losses, Americans feared Japanese would liquidate some of their American assets in bonds and stocks and sell dollars for yen.
 The backdrop, therefore, was not good when the American markets opened yesterday. The Dow drop of more than 60 points set off the New York Stock Exchange's "circuit breaker" rules just 15 minutes into the trading day.
 The price of gold, a widely followed indicator of market nervousness that had crept up all month, jumped on Thursday and leaped $5.70 yesterday to $392.20 an ounce, approaching the $400 level that gold investors had long been looking for. In two days, gold has vaulted $9.30.
 The Commerce Department revision of the fourth quarter's economic growth came out an hour before the stock market opened. Moreover, just before 10 A.M. yesterday, an analyst at CS First Boston, lowered to "hold" from "buy" his assessments of four stocks favored by institutions -- Intel, Motorola, Advanced Micro Devices and LSI Logic, all of which ended lower for the day.
 "So a lot of portfolio managers were upset that he had to come out with this assessment on the last day of the quarter when everyone is rushing around," said Todd Clark, managing director of equity trading at Rodman & Renshaw.
 "Window dressing" also was a factor in yesterday's trading. Window dressing refers to the practice of institutional investors' buying and selling to maximize their portfolio's performance for the quarter. Yesterday, that buying helped stocks rebound in the afternoon.
 Capping the morning was a rumor that the Federal Reserve was to hold an emergency meeting at 11 A.M., when it supposedly planned to rescue the dollar by raising short-term interest rates by a full percentage point. Such a move would be a sharp departure from the Fed's usual practice of raising rates by a quarter or half a percentage point. The Fed denied the rumor.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above average, with 353.1 million shares changing hands, about 7 percent more than this year's daily average of 330 million shares.
 One indication of the window-dressing effect was the high volume of trading in the last hour of the session, some 80 million shares, or almost a quarter of the day's volume.
 Among the biggest gainers of the day was Electronics for Imaging, a computer software company, which rose 5 1/2, to 53 1/2, after it signed a large contract with Canon, the maker of copiers. Wackenhut Corrections, a manager of private prisons, rose 2 1/2, to 28 3/8, after it won a $35 million contract to continue managing a Louisiana prison.
 Among the biggest decliners was John Alden Financial, an insurance holding company, which fell 11 3/8, to 18 1/2, after announcing a $10 million charge against last year's fourth- quarter earnings of $18.9 million. Interdigital Communications, a telecommunications company, dropped 5 7/8, to 6 1/8. It has lost a patent infringement case against Motorola.
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.79 point, to 271.04, with advancing stocks lagging declining stocks by 994 to 1,232. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.60 point, to 464.41.
 In Tokyo, stocks ended lower yesterday on disappointment that interest rates were left unchanged. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed down 372.27 points, or 2.25 percent, at 16,139.95.

HEADLINE: Christopher Proposes Tighter Curbs on Trade With Iran

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has concluded that the American strategy for isolating Iran is not working and has recommended that the United States ban most trade with the country, senior Administration officials said today.
The recommendation, presented in a recent meeting at the White House by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, would prohibit American companies from buying Iranian oil on the open market and from investing in projects in Iran, the officials added. 
 American oil companies are allowed to buy Iran's oil as long as they sell it outside the United States. Last year American oil companies were the largest purchasers of Iranian oil, buying about one-fourth of its supplies, worth upward of $4 billion worth on the open market.
 Mr. Christopher's recommendation has met with fierce opposition from senior officials at the Defense, Commerce, Treasury and Energy departments. Representatives of those departments argued at the recent White House meeting that curbing American trade would have little effect on Iran and could hurt American companies instead.
The Commerce Department, which has aggressively promoted American business interests abroad, is urging only those actions that the allies can reasonably be persuaded to join, and Iran's European and Japanese trading partners have no interest in a trade ban.
The President's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, is expected to preside over a higher-level meeting next week in which the issue will be debated at the White House. The State Department's recommendation has a strong chance of succeeding, in part because Mr. Lake is also said to believe the current strategy needs to be strengthened.
Mr. Christopher's move reflects his belief that the Administration's international campaign to thwart Iran's ability to rebuild its military economy has been undercut by the oil companies, and that if the Administration does not impose a trade ban, Congress will do so.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, has introduced legislation to prohibit American companies or their foreign subsidiaries from doing business with Iran, arguing that the United States is "subsidizing Iranian terrorism by purchasing their oil."
The issue of the Iran trade ban poses a particularly difficult dilemma for the Administration because it represents a clash between two pillars of its foreign policy: its desire to promote American business around the world and its determination to punish countries it considers "rogue states."
The United States bans imports from Iran, but Iran is allowed to buy a wide range of nonlethal American goods, including consumer items, oil drilling and engineering equipment, chemicals and gas turbines. The United States is the eighth-largest exporter to Iran, far behind countries like Germany, Japan, France and Britain.
Nearly two years after it unveiled a policy of "dual containment" to isolate both Iran and Iraq, the Administration still considers Iran an "international outlaw" that sponsors terrorism worldwide, opposes Middle East peace efforts and is involved in a crash program to develop nuclear weapons.
Mr. Christopher has opened an international campaign to deprive Iran of equipment useful to its military and to oppose international lending and the rescheduling of Iran's debt. The Administration has also tried unsuccessfully to block a Russian deal to sell Iran two nuclear power reactors.
As for Iraq, the United States has successfully headed off efforts by France and Russia to ease economic sanctions imposed after the country's forces invaded Kuwait more than four years ago.
But acute economic deprivation has not eased President Saddam Hussein's firm grip on power in Iraq. And Mr. Hussein has challenged the international community once again by imprisoning two Americans who crossed into Iraqi territory this month.
The State Department recommendation comes after President Clinton's executive order this month to block a $1 billion project by Conoco Inc. to develop two offshore oil and gas fields with Iran. Mr. Christopher is asking for a broader executive order that could perhaps be followed by legislation, a senior official said.
The current rift in the Administration reflects the positions taken by various agencies last year over whether to sell Boeing 747's to Iran. The Commerce and Treasury departments and some senior officials in the Pentagon strongly favored the deal, but Mr. Christopher opposed it and ultimately prevailed. Iran bought European Airbus planes instead.
When Administration officials are asked why, if Iran is truly an outlaw state, the United States does business with it at all, the answer is a practical one: If we don't trade, someone else will.
The State Department has not decided whether to recommend a ban on exports to Iran, which totaled $328 million last year, down from $750 million in 1992. Nor has the department decided whether the trade ban should cover trade by foreign subsidiaries of American firms.
Over the last several months, Mr. Christopher and Martin S. Indyk, the new Ambassador to Israel and until recently the senior Middle East specialist at the White House, have become increasingly uncomfortable with the inconsistency in the current policy. They argue that it has complicated Washington's efforts to persuade its allies to weaken their ties to Iran.
Every time Mr. Christopher has raised the issue of Iran with Germany and Japan, they have cited the American oil purchases, officials said. Chancellor Helmut Kohl made that point publicly during his recent meeting at the White House with President Clinton, saying it was "American companies, not German oil companies" that were buying Iranian crude oil.
Japan is Iran's largest customer for crude oil, and Japanese officials have told their American counterparts that they would not take part in efforts to isolate Iran economically.
On the other hand, after intense American pressure, the Japanese have agreed to delay a loan for a dam project over the Karun River in Iran, and will send a senior emissary to Washington this weekend to inform Mr. Christopher of their decision, officials said.

HEADLINE: Clinton, in Haiti, Marks the Withdrawal of G.I.'s

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 31

 BODY:
Luxuriating in the cheers of thousands of Haitians, the praise of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the crisp salutes of soldiers from a score of nations, President Clinton today handed over the responsibility for the security of Haiti from American troops to a United Nations peacekeeping force.
Saying the restoration of Mr. Aristide to power after an American military intervention last fall represented "the triumph of freedom over fear," Mr. Clinton promised the United States would continue to support efforts to establish democracy here. But he also made it clear that Haitians must bear the primary burden of building a just and prosperous society. 
 "The tasks ahead will not be easy," he told a crowd that had begun gathering at dawn in the main square in front of the National Palace. They had amused themselves during a long wait under a blazing tropical sun by singing, dancing and donning free T-shirts emblazoned with images of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Aristide.
"You must work hard; you must have patience; you must move forward together with tolerance, openness and cooperation."
Mr. Clinton's arrival in Haiti came barely six months after more than 20,000 American troops landed here and brought an end to three years of military dictatorship. Beginning Saturday, Haiti's security will be guaranteed by 6,900 soldiers and police officers from more than 30 countries, including the United States, Bangladesh, Canada, Nepal, the Netherlands and Pakistan.
The warm, festive atmosphere stood in sharp contrast to the violence and political tension that dominated the days preceding Mr. Clinton's arrival. On Tuesday, a prominent opponent of Mr. Aristide, Mireille Durocher Bertin, was killed by three gunmen as she drove her car down a busy main street here.
Shortly afterward, American officials disclosed that they had warned Mr. Aristide last week both of a plot to kill Ms. Durocher Bertin and of the possible involvement of his Interior Minister, Gen. Mondesir Beaubrun. The issue threatened to derail the visit and make a mockery of Mr. Clinton's assertion that American troops have established a "safe and stable environment" here.
During a ceremony at the National Palace this morning, however, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Aristide were full of compliments for each other. Mr. Clinton, who towered over the slight Haitian leader when they stood side by side behind a bulletproof screen, called Mr. Aristide a man of "tremendous courage" whose "strength in the face of great challenge reflects the unbreakable will of the Haitian people."
"We respect him as the President you elected freely and fairly, and for his leadership of all Haitians since his return," Mr. Clinton said.
In his remarks, Mr. Aristide, turning to the preaching style he used as a Roman Catholic priest, led the crowd in a call-and-response chant that thanked the American President for sending troops here and ending three years of repression. "Has President Clinton been good to us?" he asked in Creole, to which the cheering multitude responded with a fervent "Oui!"
It was "thanks to the nonviolent resistance of the Haitian people and to you," he told Mr. Clinton, that "on Sept. 19 Haiti moved from death to life." The American presence here, he said, "has forged a tunnel of hope through the mountains of suffering" and made Haitians eager to offer the American President "the warmth of the light of a welcome never before seen."
Mr. Clinton's trip was the first to Haiti by an American President since Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Cap-Haitien, a northern port, on July 5, 1934, to take part in ceremonies mark the end of an American occupation that lasted of 19 years. No major agreements were reached during the 11-hour visit, but Mr. Clinton announced plans to help rebuild Haiti. He said the Peace Corps would come here later this year "to help to organize the planting of millions of trees" in the badly deforested country, and he also pledged assistance in paving 700 miles of Haiti's primitive roads.
During the ceremonies, no direct mention was made of Ms. Durocher Bertin's killing or the allegations against General Beaubrun. But at the start of a private meeting between the two leaders at the National Palace after the morning festivities, both men referred to the case in responding to reporters.
"They're doing an investigation," Mr. Clinton said, alluding to Mr. Aristide's request this week for an F.B.I. team to lead an inquiry into the killing. "I think we should applaud his quick and decisive action and let the investigation proceed and not presume its results."
"This is a day of celebration, and nothing can cast a cloud on it," he continued. "It's a day of mission accomplished for the United States, a day of celebration for Haitians."
After denying that General Beaubrun was in any way involved in the killing, Mr. Aristide took a similar cooperative tone. "We welcome help from the international community and from the United States, who is helping us find truth about violence," he said in English.
After the meeting, the American delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, said the two Presidents had "discussed the problem of having an event of this type take place" and the "necessity of investigating it." But she said that economic and political issues made up the "major part of what they talked about."
Haitian officials would not say if General Beaubrun had been ordered to stay away from the transition ceremonies to avoid embarrassing Mr. Clinton, though foreign officials said there was no sign of him in the section of the dais reserved for members of the Haitian Cabinet. In any case, American officials said, protocol required Mr. Clinton to shake hands only with Mr. Aristide, Prime Minister Smarck Michel, Foreign Minister Claudette Werleigh and the presidential chief of staff, Leslie Voltaire.
Early in the day, a large banner proclaiming, "President Clinton: Haitian people believe in you for a New Haiti," was strung on the main square. But by the time Mr. Clinton's helicopter landed on the lawn of the National Palace shortly after 11:00 A.M., the poster was removed.
The formal transfer of authority from American troops to the United Nations took place in the afternoon, after a lunch-hour meeting between Mr. Clinton and members of the Provision Electoral Council that will supervise elections here this year. Mr. Clinton strongly endorsed the multinational presence in Haiti, saying it "demonstrated the effectiveness and the benefits of international peacekeeping."
In his speech accepting the peacekeeping mission, the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, struck much the same tone that Mr. Clinton had earlier in the day. "The people of Haiti must maintain their commitment to rebuild their nation," he said, adding that "continued cooperation will bring later achievements."

Bond Prices Drop for 2d Consecutive Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for the second straight day in reaction to news of higher-than-expected economic growth late last year, soaring precious metals prices and a slide in the dollar.
 The 30-year bond fell 7/32 , to a price of 10211/32 for a yield of 7.43 percent, up from 7.41 percent on Thursday, and 7.36 percent a week ago. 
 The rate of growth in the gross domestic product in the final quarter of last year was revised upward yesterday to 5.1 percent, exceeding expectations of a 4.7 percent gain. Also, the report's implicit price deflator was up 1.3 percent, showing a slow but steady inflation.
 Elliott Platt, director of economic research at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, said the quarterly G.D.P. growth rate was the third highest since the recession ended in March 1991, while the growth of final sales was the second highest of any quarter in this expansion.
 Analysts noted that bond traders and dealers were particularly concerned about the dollar's slide because it was affecting precious metals and other markets, where it was seen as an inflationary signal.
 Yesterday's economic reports sent the same mixed signals that have kept yields on the 30-year bond between 7.35 percent and 7.50 percent in recent weeks. For example, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its March index of industrial activity fell to 55.0 from 62.7 in February; the forecast had been for a reading of 59.8.
 Another sign that manufacturing could soon cool came from the Government's monthly estimate of factory orders, which fell two-tenths of a percent in February after rising seven-tenths of a percent in January. Forecasts had called for a February decline of four-tenths of a percent.
 There were also signs that consumer optimism was fading a bit, as the University of Michigan's March consumer sentiment index dropped to 90.3, from 95.1 in February.
 Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said that of the many influences on the market yesterday, the most important were profit taking and positioning as the calendar quarter ended, and the renewed weakness in the dollar.
 "The unexpected upward revision to fourth-quarter G.D.P. produced a brief flutter of activity," he said, "but upon reflection the market realized it was interesting only to history buffs."
 About the only new information that came out of the report, he said, was that gross domestic product continued to be larger than gross national product in the fourth quarter. "This, of course, is a relatively new phenomenon, and results from the fact that foreign repatriation from America is now greater than American repatriation from abroad," he said, adding that it was "one of the major reasons why the dollar remains so weak."
 Many market analysts saw the Chicago purchasing management report and the University of Michigan sentiment index as favorable for the bond market, but these reports still took a back seat to the dollar and the end-of-quarter activity.
 "The market will now focus its attention toward the much more important national purchasing management report on Monday, motor vehicles sales and the labor market statistics due on Friday," Mr. Fine said.
 He considers the vehicle sales reports, expected on Monday and Tuesday, to be the most important because they will provide the first hard data from March on consumer demand, which, he says, is the ultimate driving force of the economy.
 Elsewhere, municipal bond market prices finished with losses of 3/8 to 1/2 point in spotty trading. The Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues put the average yield to maturity at 6.37 percent, up 3 basis points from the previous day.

HEADLINE: A Fretful Atlanta Awaits a Deluge

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 31

 BODY:
Like viewing azalea blossoms, agonizing over the annual April onslaught of thousands of black college students is becoming a rite of spring here.
The Atlanta Black College Spring Break, popularly known as Freaknik since it was first celebrated by local students in 1985, has attracted increasing numbers of black students from around the nation in the last few years. The event is a raucous three-day party in which the two central activities are lounging in Piedmont Park to the party rhythms and sexually explicit lyrics of rap music and cruising bumper to bumper, horns blaring, in a car caravan that renders streets around the park, just north of downtown, impassable. 
 Last year Freaknik drew a record 200,000 students, who spent $20 million, according to the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. But it also cost the city $250,000 for litter cleanup and Police Department overtime and resulted in a chorus of complaints from the largely white neighborhoods around the park about public drinking and rowdy behavior among the sometimes menacing crowds.
This year the event is scheduled for April 21-23. As the date approaches, City Hall is sending mixed signals to the students about whether they will be welcome, and neighborhood residents are pressing city officials to exercise strict control over a weekend that is characterized by spontaneity.
Perhaps inevitably, the debate has taken on racial overtones in this black-majority city that prides itself on being the cradle of the civil rights movement and is home to a progressive black middle class. But the debate is also emerging as a generational battle in which defiant young adults say they will assert their right to party regardless of what city elders say.
The Rev. Edward Branch, who heads the Catholic Center for the Atlanta University Center, said, "It is young adults acting accordingly and city fathers and city mothers acting like mothers and fathers period."
Adding to the concern this year is that the last day of Freaknik coincides with the first day of Atlanta's annual Comdex Spring show. One of the nation's largest annual gatherings of computer and software vendors, Comdex is a prized weeklong event that is expected to pump $40 million into the local economy. The specter of both events converging on Atlanta has Comdex officials worried.
Beginning last fall, Mayor Bill Campbell indicated that the city would discourage Freaknik, and he reiterated the position at meetings in January with Vincent Polito, the managing director of Comdex. But lately, Mr. Polito said, as local opposition to the Mayor's stand surfaced, Comdex officials detected some subtle shifts at City Hall.
"I was pretty confident about things in January and less confident now," he said. "If our event goes poorly as a result of the Freaknik crowd, it would seriously jeopardize my ability to come back. So Atlanta does have a lot riding on the success of this."
Last year, just days after Freaknik, Mr. Campbell said things had gone well, apart from midtown traffic gridlock, and he admonished Atlanta residents that they could not build a fence around their city.
But in October, a spokesman for the Mayor said Atlanta was not the right place for Freaknik. And in later meetings with community groups, the Mayor talked of "zero tolerance" for law breaking.
Then in January the Mayor persuaded the presidents of the six historically black colleges of the Atlanta University Center -- Morehouse, Spelman and Morris Brown colleges, Clark-Atlanta University, Morehouse Medical School and the Interdenominational Theological Center -- to sign a letter to the presidents of other historically black campuses urging them to discourage their students' participation. Atlanta, the letter said, "is not the proper site for an event of this scope and magnitude."
Finally, in a meeting last week requested by students at the local black colleges, the Mayor softened his tone, saying the students would be welcome but would be expected to obey the law.
Dr. Samuel DuBois Cook, the president of Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, said he was disturbed by the letter and added, "I wonder what would happen if they were white college students."
In some ways Atlanta is grappling with the same issues faced by other traditional spring break destinations, including Fort Lauderdale and Daytona Beach in Florida. In the 1980's, when the numbers of vacationing college students, mostly white, began to overwhelm these communities, officials responded by tightening traffic control and enforcing standards of public conduct. Such tactics cooled the party fervor of students and shrank their numbers over the years until they returned to more manageable levels.
For many people who live near Piedmont Park, Freaknik is less a racial issue than one of noise, gridlock and inconvenience. Steve Brinkley, president of Midtown Neighbors, a group of residents who live near the park, said that the Mayor might have "tempered his words" in recent days, but that his strategy remains the same and that is to try to deflate the event over time.
"The word is out," Mr. Brinkley said. "Freaknik will happen but it will not be of the same magnitude as in the past. The laws will be enforced."
The threats and the letter could backfire. Dr. Cook, for example, said he had suggested to some of his fellow college presidents that the letter "was the best way to insure that their students would come to Atlanta."
"It was like waving a red flag in front of a bull," he said in an interview.
Jamal Coleman, president of the Student Government Association at Clark-Atlanta University, said calls to his school from around the country indicated that "people are coming." He said he hoped that those who came understood the city's intention to strictly enforce the laws and were aware of the possibility that some police officers might feel "hostility" toward them.
"If they can't react properly," Mr. Coleman said, "hopefully they will stay home."
In the last week some local elected officials and ministers have tried to ease anxiety about Freaknik.
C. T. Martin, a member of the City Council from one of the more affluent sections of the city's largely black south side, noted on Wednesday that there were just 20 days remaining to turn the event into something positive. He said that he and residents of his district were pressing the Mayor to promote acceptable behavior by visiting students but also to come up with traffic plans to channel the car caravan rather than ban it from certain areas.
"I understand the Mayor's predicament," Mr. Martin said. "But this is the home of Martin Luther King and six black institutions of higher learning, and we owe it to the parents of these young people to cradle their children while they are here."

HEADLINE: For Half Century, Tradition Has Foiled Attempts to Clean Up Fulton Fish Market

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
Fifty years ago, the Government arrested and won the conviction of a ruthless gangster, Joseph (Socks) Lanza and confidently proclaimed victory in eradicating the Mafia's influence at the Fulton Fish Market.
 The proclamation was premature. 
 While prosecutors tried a variety of methods to attack the mob -- from criminal cases to court-appointed administrators -- they say organized crime still retains a stranglehold there, mainly because of the Genovese family's tight grip and the entrenched culture of suspicion that intimidates honest merchants and workers from testifying.
 Experts say that the fire that devastated one-third of the market on Wednesday was the most dramatic symbol yet of the crime and corruption problems that have plagued the market since the days of Mr. Lanza.
 Michael G. Cherkasky, a former prosecutor, said that the Government's most recent efforts to crack down on the mob's control of the market failed because the authorities were unable to gather significant evidence through traditional investigative methods: planting undercover agents, establishing phony businesses as sting operations and gaining testimony from victims.
 "It was impossible to do deep undercover work there," said Mr. Cherkasky who was the chief of the investigation division in the Manhattan District Attorney's office from 1988 to 1993. "Newcomers are viewed immediately with suspicion. And merchants would tell you everything about what is going on, but they were too terrified to testify or to allow anyone to wear a hidden mike in their business places."
 For half a century, Federal, state and city prosecutors tried to clean up the market by seeking convictions of mobsters on charges of extortion and labor racketeering. Some prosecutors relied on civil court remedies that exiled suspected mob figures from doing business at the market. Others hoped that a court-appointed administrator would prevent abuses.
 On Monday, the Giuliani administration and City Council leaders unveiled the latest plan, giving the city the right to investigate, fingerprint and conduct background checks of merchants and workers.
 Although investigators disagreed as to whether the mob was behind Wednesday's blaze, Mr. Giuliani said the fire would not delay quick approval of his plan and would not weaken his resolve to rid the market of the mob's influence.
 Located mainly on city property in lower Manhattan, the Fulton complex is the nation's largest wholesale fish market. About 50 wholesalers employ about 1,000 workers and generate gross sales of $800 million to $1 billion a year.
 Investigators say the mob is able to extract payoffs because of its threats to interfere with the transportation in and out of the market of quickly perishable seafood. They say the wholesalers, retailers and restaurants often must pay kickbacks to get their seafood loaded and unloaded quickly and that deliveries are not done on first come, first served.
 The market's history of violence and racketeering dates to the mid-1920's when Mr. Lanza organized a Sea Food Workers local. Ralph F. Salerno, who was the head of the organized-crime squad in the New York City Police Department from 1946 to 1967, said that Mr. Lanza acquired the nickname Socks for punching wholesalers and deliverers who refused to pay him for permission to do business.
 Mr. Lanza, who was called the czar of the Fulton market, was convicted in 1943 on Federal extortion charges. Even from prison, the authorities said, he continued to run the market's rackets.
 Investigators say that Carmine Romano succeeded Mr. Lanza as the head of Sea Food Workers Local 359 and as the Genovese family controller in the market.
 In 1981, Mr. Romano was convicted of extortion and racketeering at the market with his twin brother, Peter. After Mr. Romano's conviction, Federal prosecutors acknowledged that convictions of mob figures simply led to the Genovese family replacing them with new overseers.
 In 1987, Mr. Guiliani, who was the United States Attorney in the Southern District of the state and a vocal opponent of organized crime, tried a new approach. He brought a civil racketeering suit to seize administrative control of the market and Local 359.
 The suit led to the banning from the market of Vincent Romano, another brother of Carmine Romano, who prosecutors said was then the Genovese family's controller. Ten other men who were said to be linked to organized crime also were barred from doing business at the market.
 Frank H. Wohl, a former prosecutor, was appointed in 1988 as a Federal monitor with the authority to bring civil charges against companies in the market that committed business abuses. His main crackdown was fining six unlicensed unloading companies a total of $200,000 on charges that they dictated prices and determined how fast seafood could be delivered. The companies have appealed the fines and none have so far been paid.
 In 1989, the Federal campaign was dealt a setback when a judge ruled that prosecutors had failed to prove that Sea Food Workers Local 359 was run by the Genovese family and rejected a proposed government takeover of the local.
 Mr. Wohl's supervision of the market essentially ended in 1992 when Otto G. Obermaier, who was then the United States Attorney in Manhattan, said that the Government would no longer monitor conditions. He noted that the Government had spent $3.5 million and that it was the city's responsibility to manage the place.
 Mr. Wohl said that until recently the city had abdicated its responsibility for regulating and supervising businesses in the market.
 "The result is a frontier atmosphere," he asserted, "in which the prevailing attitude is that the market is a sovereign entitty where the laws of economic power and physical coercion, not the laws of New York, prevail."
 Investigators say that the Genovese rackets in the market are now controlled by two capos or captains, Ross Gangi and Alfonso Malangone. Both capos, officials said, were appointed by Vincent Gigante, the boss of the family and much of the loot from the market is funneled to Mr. Gigante.
 The sons of Mr. Gangi and Mr. Malangone are listed in business records as the owners of two of the wholesale companies in the market. Carmine Romano's son also is the owner of a wholesale firm.
 "The market is the most intractable organized crime problem in the Northeast," said Mr. Cherkasky, the former prosecutor. "Prosecutions alone will not work. You remove one guy and a whole set of two-bit hoods are lined up to replace him."
 Gerald J. McMahon, the lawyer for the loading and unloading companies, and leaders of Local 359 and two wholesale dealers' associations, said there was no evidence that mobsters controlled the market. They described the charges by city officials as exaggerated and promised court action to block the city's bill to regulate companies and workers.
 "My men don't want to be fingerprinted," said Anthony Cirillo, president of Local 359. "They don't want to wear photo identifications and they don't want to go through background checks."

HEADLINE: 11 Years, 11 Late Budgets: Divided Albany Misses the Deadline Again

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 31

 BODY:
As the midnight deadline for passing the New York State budget loomed, Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders conceded tonight that negotiations had collapsed and that the state would have a late budget for the 11th consecutive year.
 Clearly frustrated, Mr. Pataki blamed Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, for the deadlock. The Governor had made an on-time budget a major Republican campaign pledge. He said Mr. Silver, after weeks of negotiations, had not even released a plan showing how much the Democrats wanted to spend or how they would pay for it.
 Mr. Pataki said he would follow through with his threat to withhold paychecks on Wednesday for himself, the 211 legislators and their 4,462 aides unless the budget is passed by then. However, aides to State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, raised questions about whether the Governor had the legal authority to carry that out.
 That is because the April 5 paychecks will be for work performed in early March. And under one interpretation of state law favored by the Democrats, the Governor is required to honor all the state's financial obligations from the previous fiscal year, which ends tonight.
 "The Assembly has failed," Mr. Pataki said in a news conference after a brief negotiating session with Mr. Silver and the Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, ended bitterly. "They haven't passed my budget bills, they haven't passed the Senate's budget bills, they haven't passed their own budget bills and they continue to refuse to allow the people to see where they stand."
 In equally testy tones, Mr. Silver said the stalemate was a result of the Governor's refusal to consider any Democratic ideas for raising more revenue. The Assembly Democrats want to restore cuts to education, health care and mental health programs, among others, in the Governor's $32.4 billion proposed budget.
 As the talks between Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders stalled this evening, each house of the Legislature was trying to pass its own version of a budget bill. Because neither bill stands much chance of passing the other house, the votes were largely political exercises intended to inoculate the two sides against criticism for delaying the budget.
 The Republican-controlled Senate today finished passing most of a budget supported by Mr. Pataki. The Senate's version would increase spending by $335 million above Mr. Pataki's original plan, and the additional spending would be used to lighten the cuts to hospitals, nursing homes, higher education and local school districts.
 But illustrating the great division between the two sides, Mr. Silver called the Senate-Pataki budget "a sham" because it will not be the final version. "The people of this state want to know what kind of health care the senior citizens are going to have," Mr. Silver said. "What's the tuition of the state and city universities going to be?" The Senate bills, he said, "will be telling the public nothing in that regard."
 Nevertheless, Mr. Silver said the Assembly would begin amending the Republican budget, probably by adding spending opposed by Mr. Pataki. That process will probably continue throughout the weekend.
 Mr. Pataki has said that legislative aides will receive their checks only after a budget is passed. But Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for Mr. McCall, who issues state paychecks, said it was unclear what would happen on Wednesday.
 Mr. Greenberg said Mr. McCall has the legal authority to issue checks on Wednesday because he is required to pay the state's outstanding obligations from the 1994-95 fiscal year. Those paychecks would cover work done in early March, which was part of that fiscal year.
 On the other hand, Mr. Greenberg said Mr. Pataki could ask the Legislature to pass emergency appropriations bills that would forbid the Comptroller to pay the legislative employees. It is unlikely that Mr. Silver would support such a bill.
 There is a twist, however. Mr. Greenberg said that if Mr. Silver were to block Mr. Pataki's emergency appropriations bills, there would not be enough money available to pay thousands of other state workers. If legislative employees were paid while other state workers were not, it would place Mr. Silver in a politically awkward position.
 Throughout the day, legislative employees braced for the worst. Some said they planned to take emergency $500 loans at 12 percent interest from their credit union. Others plan to seek help from relatives.
 Late budgets have not always been the rule. . Former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, had Republican-controlled legislatures for most of his 14-year tenure, and most of his budgets passed on time.
 That all changed in 1974, when a Democrat, Hugh L. Carey, was elected governor and the Democrats took control of the Assembly. Democrats have held the Assembly ever since, while the Senate has remained controlled by Republicans.
 That history of divided Legislatures has made timely passage of the budget virtually impossible. Since 1975, Mr. Carey's first year in office, the budget has been late 17 times: 6 times under Mr. Carey, 10 times under Mario M. Cuomo and now once under Mr. Pataki.
 Though Mr. Bruno tried to show solidarity with Mr. Pataki by passing a budget the Governor supports, he also demonstrated some independence from the Governor by vowing to pass what he called an "economic development" plan that includes spending Mr. Pataki opposes.
 The Senate's budget bill, which is expected to pass on Monday, includes $77 million for stadiums and other athletic projects in mainly Republican districts, including a $24 million swimming center in Nassau County. "I think some of them are sound economic development projects," Mr. Pataki said. "Others of them are at best questionable."

HEADLINE: BACKED BY COURT, BASEBALL PLAYERS CALL STRIKE OVER

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
A Federal judge issued an injunction against major league baseball owners yesterday, setting the stage for their players to return to work after a nearly eight-month-old strike.
The players, who walked out last Aug. 12, have offered to end the longest work stoppage in professional sports history and revitalize a game that last year lost its signature, the World Series, for the first time in 90 years. 
 After the decision by Judge Sonia Sotomayor in United States District Court in Manhattan, the players were prepared to race to spring training camps in Florida and Arizona. But the 28 club owners did not immediately decide to accept their offer.
The owners scheduled a meeting tomorrow in Chicago and planned to vote on whether to welcome the players back or to lock them out while beginning the season with replacement teams. The season is scheduled to start tomorrow night with the Mets playing the Marlins in Florida.
A meeting scheduled for today could be an indication of how the owners are thinking. Lawyers for the clubs and the union planned to meet to discuss back-to-work issues, adding to the growing belief that there will be no lockout.
Reports from owners opposed to a lockout and conversations with people familiar with the owners' position and with lawyers advising them indicate they do not have the 21 votes required for a lockout. If that view holds true tomorrow, the players could begin preparing early next week for a delayed start to the 1995 season.
In a stern and swift ruling issued from the bench, Judge Sotomayor created that scenario by issuing the injunction and preventing the owners from establishing new work rules in the absence of a new collective bargaining agreement. After conducting a 98-minute hearing, she took an 18-minute recess, then read her opinion for 47 minutes. It was obvious that she had prepared most of her opinion before the hearing, having studied the lawyers' briefs on the National Labor Relation Board's request for an injunction.
The board contended that the owners had unlawfully made unilateral changes in the working terms and conditions they had told the board's general counsel eight weeks ago they would restore. The judge ordered them to reinstate salary arbitration, competitive bidding for free agents and the anti-collusion provision of the free-agency rules.
"This strike has placed the entire concept of collective bargaining on trial," Judge Sotomayor said. "It is critical, therefore, that the board assure and that I protect its assurance that the spirit and the letter of Federal labor law be scrupulously followed."
Her injunction did not rule on the merits of the unfair labor practice charges the players filed against the owners; nor did it order the players back to work. She was well aware, however, of the players' offer to go back.
The owners' lawyers immediately asked both Judge Sotomayor and Judge Roger Miner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for immediate stays of the injunction, but both rejected their request. A hearing was set for next Tuesday before a three-judge panel of the circuit court on the requests for a stay and an expedited appeal.
Asked what the players would do if they reported to training camp and then had the injunction stayed, Donald Fehr, the union chief, said, "The only way they would leave camp would be if the clubs forced them out."
The owners, of course, have to let them back first. At last count, six owners were said to be firmly in the no-lockout camp: the two New York teams, Baltimore, Toronto, Los Angeles and San Diego. They would need only two more votes to block a lockout, and some were confident they had them.
The dynamics could change when the owners meet tomorrow, but some of them simply have had enough of the strike and others fear the possible legal and economic consequences if they locked out the players and the lockout were found to be illegal because they hadn't bargained in good faith.
"Representatives of the 28 clubs will meet to discuss legal and practical options now available," Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said in a statement, "and will certainly give the players' union a timely answer to their offer to return to the field."
Fred Wilpon, the Mets' owner, said in Port St. Lucie, Fla., where the Mets' replacements have been working toward the scheduled start of the season tomorrow night, that he had a good idea how the vote would go, but he declined to say what it was.
But Mr. Wilpon, who wouldn't say but is known to oppose a lockout, said he would lobby for his position. "I would do anything necessary in a businesslike manner to explain my point of view to whomever would be willing to listen," he said after participating in a conference call of the executive council, the eight-owner group that rules Major League Baseball in the absence of a commissioner.
Mr. Selig clearly did not like the judge's ruling, saying the injunction "may represent a step backward in our negotiations for a meaningful agreement with the players' union." But Mr. Fehr emphasized the union's desire to negotiate an agreement.
"If both sides want it to be," he said at a news conference at a midtown Manhattan hotel, "this could be an opportunity to bargain this out. We ought to do our level best on both sides to seize that opportunity. We are and I hope the clubs will be, too."
While issuing Mr. Selig's statement publicly, the commissioner's office privately sent a list of nine talking points to the clubs.
"The two sides have to settle this between themselves," one point said. "We can't depend on some third party to pinch-hit for us."
"The clubs want to make a deal, but this injunction enables the union to keep dodging serious negotiations," said another.
And: "It means the regular season will be played under the threat of another player strike, possibly wiping out the playoffs and World Series for a second year in a row."
But Mr. Fehr noted that it was the owners who had been cited for unfair labor practices. "We believed for a long time," he said, "the owners were not complying with their obligation to bargain in good faith and that's the primary reason we weren't able to reach agreement."
When the hearing began, Judge Sotomayor, based on her comments and questions, appeared to be prepared to drop the salary arbitration element from the injunction. Early in her ruling, she even said it would be "more limited" than the board requested. But that was a phrase she evidently did not edit out once she changed her mind.
It was the arguments of George Cohen, the union's lawyer, that apparently won the judge over to the inclusion of salary arbitration. After Judge Sotomayor asked why players eligible for salary arbitration couldn't have their salaries remedied once the board found the owners to have violated the labor law, Mr. Cohen suggested it would be like "trying to unscramble the egg."
"We tried this kind of situation in the context of a settlement agreement in the so-called collusion cases," Mr. Cohen said. "We are five years into that process and we are still not even halfway done trying to reconstruct a system."
Not only did Judge Sotomayor rule for the labor board, but she also said the owners would have to come back to her before declaring an impasse in negotiations, if they do at some point in the future. The owners declared an impasse last Dec. 23, but the board found there was no legal basis for it and induced the owners to rescind their action.
That was when they also agreed to restore the status quo, but they omitted the elements the judge dealt with yesterday.
An administrative law judge will hold a hearing beginning May 22 on the merits of the board's complaint against the owners.

HEADLINE: Bank Business In Derivatives Leveling Off, Study Shows

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The derivatives holdings of American banks have abruptly leveled off after years of rapid growth, but the holdings remain large in comparison with banks' capital, a Federal agency said today.
 The study by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is part of the Treasury, provided the latest indication of a slowdown in one of the fastest-growing and most profitable businesses for big banks in the early 1990's. 
 Derivatives are synthetic securities that are based on other assets like bonds, stocks or oil; their prices vary with the underlying assets but tend to be far more volatile. Their popularity has faded over the last year as rising interest rates have produced heavy derivatives losses at industrial companies, local governments and mutual funds, and led to numerous lawsuits.
 The underlying assets of bank-held derivatives leveled off at $15.6 trillion during the third and fourth quarters of last year after soaring from $6.2 trillion in early 1990, the comptroller's office said.
 Such figures tend to overstate the actual credit risk to banks, which the comptroller's office estimated to be no more than 1 or 2 percent of the value of the underlying assets. But the derivatives-related credit risk at the nation's biggest banks, nonetheless, averaged 170 percent of their capital, the comptroller's office found.
 Douglas E. Harris, the senior deputy comptroller who handles derivatives issues, said that the percentage was "not a cause for concern" at the comptroller's office. But he added that the agency still wanted the banking industry to improve its risk management procedures for derivatives.
 "It is adequate but certainly we see now, based on examinations over the last year and a half, that there is some work to be done," he said.
 The national average is for banks to issue commercial and industrial loans equal to 158 percent of their capital. Today's figures showed that a half-dozen large banks have larger derivatives exposures.
 James D. McLaughlin, the director of Federal agency relations at the American Bankers Association, said that the large derivatives exposures were not surprising because the demand for commercial and industrial loans had faded as more and more companies raised money directly from financial markets by issuing notes and bonds. The shift toward large derivatives exposures "is really a reflection of the way some banks are serving their customers' needs," he said.
 Carolyn H. Jackson, the executive director of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a New York-based trade group, said the comptroller's office might have overstated the risk percentages, possibly doubling them, inasmuch as banks often hedge by buying multiple contracts with opposite financial effects.
 Mr. Harris said that the comptroller's office was still trying to determine the net effect of each bank's derivatives deals, and that the credit-risk exposures represented a "worst case scenario."
 Bert Ely, a financial consultant in Alexandria, Va., said that derivatives contracts tended to be safer than commercial and industrial loans because banks' partners in the derivatives deals were often big, stable corporations, while the banks' main loan clients were mainly small and medium-sized companies now. But some holders of money-losing derivatives have sued financial institutions, questioning whether the risks of their investments were fully disclosed.
 Bankers Trust had the largest exposure to derivatives, equal to nearly seven times its capital.
 The number of banks doing business in derivatives also dropped during the fourth quarter of last year, to 633 from 648 in the third quarter, according to today's review. "Some of it may have been as a result of mergers, and some of it may be because banks were scared away from derivatives because of the negative publicity," Mr. Harris said.
 The comptroller's office plans to issue detailed information on derivatives holdings every quarter, beginning with today's report on the fourth quarter of last year. Today's compilation covers off-balance-sheet derivatives like futures and options contracts, but not on-balance-sheet derivatives like certain mortgage-backed securities. Beginning with the first quarter of this year, the comptroller's office plans to begin counting the on-balance-sheet derivatives as well, Mr. Harris said.

HEADLINE: Fed Minutes Indicate Some Voiced Doubt on Rate Rise

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Federal Reserve officials were unanimous in deciding to raise short-term interest rates on Feb. 1, but some of them initially expressed concern that the central bank was moving too quickly, according to minutes of the meeting released today.
While the Fed's rate-setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee, remained united then, the minutes suggest that sentiment may be building that 7 rate increases over the last 14 months may have been enough to prevent rapid economic growth from leading to inflation. 
 While a majority of the committee wanted to raise rates immediately on Feb. 1 and prevailed in doing so, "a few preferred to delay such an action pending the receipt within the next few weeks of significant new information that could help the committee to evaluate whether and to what extent the economic expansion might be slowing," the minutes said. The Fed raised short-term rates by half a percentage point that day.
Paul L. Kasriel, a vice president and monetary economist at the Northern Trust Company, a Chicago bank, said that it remained possible that the Fed would raise rates again at the committee's next meeting on May 23. But based on the minutes released today, he said, "my suspicion is they won't be unanimous if they do."
The Federal Open Market Committee met Tuesday and left rates unchanged.
The committee's members are the 7 governors of the Federal Reserve Board, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and, taking turns, 4 of the presidents of the 11 other Federal Reserve regional banks.
Committee members who expressed reluctance to raise rates immediately on Feb. 1 wanted to wait for other Government agencies to finish tabulating various indicators of whether the economy was slowing, like January retail sales. Minutes show they also expressed concern that a tighter monetary policy might make Mexico's financial problems worse. The minutes did not identify the members.
But the members' concerns did not run deep enough to prompt votes against the rate increase. The minutes indicate that these members thought there was a less than even chance that any additional information would persuade them not to raise rates.
Two committee members did vote on Feb. 1 against portions of the Federal Reserve's contribution to the international bailout of Mexico, while the other 10 members voted in favor and approved the bailout, according to the minutes.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, and Thomas C. Melzer, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, both voted against increasing the Fed's line of credit for Mexico and against allowing certain foreign exchange transactions to help with Treasury Department loans to Mexico. "They did not believe that the committee had been provided sufficient information to assess whether developments in Mexico threatened U.S. financial stability, a possible justification for increased central bank lending on a short-term basis," the minutes said.
Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Melzer also worried that Fed action might compromise the central bank's independence, while Mr. Lindsey expressed concern that the risks of this were greater than usual because of the lack of Congressional authorization or general public support for the bailout, the minutes added.

HEADLINE: G.D.P. Growth in Late '94 Is Revised Sharply Higher

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The Government issued revised figures today indicating that the economy grew even faster in late 1994 than previously thought, with output expanding at an annual rate of 5.1 percent, a pace that raised concern on Wall Street.
 The surprisingly large upward revision in gross domestic product, which a month ago had been calculated to have grown at a 4.6 percent pace, weighed on the bond and stock markets as investors and analysts re-evaluated the prospects that the Federal Reserve would once again raise short-term interest rates to restrain the economy. 
 The Fed has already raised rates seven times since February 1994.
 "It clearly is a source of concern to the Fed," Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities in New York, said of today's report. He noted that most of the strength in the fourth quarter was attributable to final sales rather than a buildup of inventories.
 Most analysts say the central bank seeks to hold growth to a pace of about 2.5 percent, and it has appeared from nearly all statistics published in recent weeks that the economy has been rapidly cooling.
 Indeed, shortly after today's G.D.P. figures were issued the pattern resumed as the Government reported that orders for goods from factories declined in February and as corporate purchasing managers in Chicago and Milwaukee said that industrial growth had slackened in March.
 In addition, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment eased to 90.3 from its mid-March reading of 91.8, subscribers to its survey said.
 Still other figures today showed that corporate profits from current production climbed less than half as fast in the fourth quarter as in the third -- $4.3 billion compared with $9.6 billion. Much of the slowdown reflected lower profits at banks and other financial companies.
 Taken together, today's figures seemed to both confirm the economic slowdown and suggest that policy makers may need extra time to achieve their goal, which now involves cutting growth to a pace half that of the final months of 1994. In the four quarters that ended in December, gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services within the United States -- rose 4.1 percent, down only modestly from the 4.4 percent for the four quarters through September.
 "I have no doubt that the economy is returning to a more normal rate of growth," said Alan M. Gayle, senior vice president of Crestar Bank, based in Richmond. "But the question is getting it to slow far enough, fast enough to relieve the pressures that have built up" on capacity and in prices for various raw materials.
 James W. Coons, chief economist for the Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, said that he still expected "sharp deceleration" in the economy this year but that interest rates "will be under greater upward pressure" in coming months than during February and March.
 In raising fourth-quarter G.D.P. to a rate of 5.1 percent, the Commerce Department said the largest upward revisions were in business investments and in international trade. Revised figures on aircraft shipments and on prices helped raise the equipment category by $2.3 billion while the introduction of newly available source data cut imports by $2.4 billion, according to Carol S. Carson, director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
 The first G.D.P. estimate came Jan. 27, when the annual rate was put at 4.5 percent, with a buildup of inventories cited as a significant factor. A revision on March 1 raised the pace a notch, to 4.6 percent, and most analysts had expected little further change today.
 As for factory orders, also compiled by the Commerce Department, the February decline was the first since October and was dominated by the skid of eight-tenths of 1 percent in durable goods that was initially reported last week. Orders for nondurable factory goods climbed six-tenths of 1 percent as increases for oil, coal and paper products more than offset declines for leather goods and food.
 Shipments of manufactured goods rose five-tenths of 1 percent in February, the fourth consecutive increase, while unfilled orders rose four-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Bigger Roles for Suppliers of Temporary Workers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 31

 BODY:
As they have in every economic expansion, the ranks of temporary workers are swelling, but something is different this time. Now the giants of corporate America -- companies like AT&T, the Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson and Hewlett-Packard -- are getting serious about managing them.
 The number of temps supplied by agencies to American companies soared from 500,000 in 1983 to nearly 2 million, or 1.5 percent of the work force, last year. Large temp firms have hundreds of job categories from traditional secretaries and assembly workers to computer programmers, robotics specialists and chemists. Temporary professionals, from lawyers to accountants to surgeons, are also available. 
 More revealing than the sharp increase, though, is the trend among big companies to form close, sometimes exclusive, relationships with the giants of the temp industry like Manpower, Kelly Services, the Olsten Corporation and Adia Services.
 "The consolidation is taking place at every big company we know," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, chief executive of Manpower, of Glendale, Wis., the world's largest temp company.
 Once viewed as an incidental aspect of business to be handled by local managers, the hiring of temps is increasingly seen as a piece of the human resources pie big enough to command senior management attention.
 "We keep a close eye on it, and we don't want temps to be a second-class work force," said Margaret Johnson, who oversees Hewlett-Packard's worldwide use of temps. Hewlett decided in 1993 that temp compensation and performance had become impossible to monitor, with more than 60 agencies providing as many as 5,000 temps. After nearly a year of research and bid reviews, Hewlett designated Manpower and Volt Services Group, a subsidiary of Volt Information Sciences, based in New York, as its preferred suppliers throughout the United States.
 Since last fall, Manpower's and Volt's share of Hewlett's temporary worker business has jumped from less than 40 percent to more than 50 percent; it is expected to reach 80 percent in two years. Hewlett is considering the expansion of its Manpower contract to cover overseas operations, as well.
 National partnerships can allow manufacturers, banks and other heavy users of temps to bargain for better prices and extra services, like electronic billing and training programs tailored specifically to their needs. A national contract can be worth as much as $100 million annually -- a dazzling opportunity for temp agencies that until recently regarded even a $5 million deal as a plum.
 Temp agencies began promoting the partnership concept in the 1980's, a movement spearheaded by midsize companies like the Norrell Corporation of Atlanta and Talent Tree, a subsidiary of BET P.L.C., a British conglomerate, based in Houston. It did not catch on until a few years ago, when it became faddish to have corporate staff functions like security, information management and human resources handled by outside personnel.
 "Now it's the customers who are pushing this," said Peter Yessne, publisher of Staffing Industry Report, an industry newsletter.
 The trend could be good news for some temporary workers. The closer the relationships between big companies and agencies, the better the chances that the agencies can provide the kinds of training and placements that will lead to permanent jobs.
 Some companies have essentially turned over many of their recruiting and training functions to their biggest temp suppliers, either through the national contracts or exclusive local ones that put a temp agency employee in charge of the site's needs for temporary workers. Manpower controlled 330 client sites at the end of 1994, up from 15 in 1992.
 "Big customers now assume that whoever we send out is skilled," Mr. Fromstein of Manpower said. "They are now looking for better methods of inserting people, for how to make them more soluble."
 But labor economists say there is a dark side to the trend. Most of the nation's 8,000 or so temp companies are small concerns based in a single community, or they supply only one type of worker. With more companies demanding that local office and factory managers justify any departures from the national deal, doors once open to the small entrepreneurs are now all but shut.
 "Small vendors can compete effectively with the Manpowers locally for recruits, but not for national bids," Mr. Yessne said.
 The national contracts are also likely to increase the number of temps. Perhaps 30 to 40 percent of temps are not looking for permanent work, like retirees, students and homemakers with children. But most temps would prefer a permanent job. Turning millions of Americans into "economic shock absorbers" with no long-term ties to their employers is not sound policy, said Harley Shaiken, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
 The consensus is that the temporary work force will grow faster than the permanent one for years to come. Manpower, which earns about half of its revenues overseas, may have a slight advantage with companies looking toward global relationships. But the biggest contracts so far have been national in scope, and those that have become public are spread among the industry leaders. Manpower's longtime rival, Kelly, which is based in Troy, Mich., has big contracts with both Kraft General Foods and Johnson & Johnson.
 Olsten, which is based in Westbury, L.I., was chosen by AT&T to run its temporary staffing operation. Four Olsten managers were moved to AT&T's Morristown, N.J., offices, where their mandate was to fill job openings first with AT&T's internal temp staff, then with employees from Olsten or Unique Support Services, a minority-owned company based in New York. Revenues from that deal and national contracts with Bristol-Myers Squibb and the computer services unit of General Electric total about $200 million, said Gordon Bingham, Olsten's senior vice president for marketing.
 Bank of America chose Adia Services, which is controlled by Klaus Jacobs, a Swiss investor, to handle $45 million in temp assignments that were formerly scattered among more than 200 companies in California and other Western states. The bank specified that Adia, based in Redwood City, Calif., could keep half of the business and parcel out the rest among an approved list of backup suppliers, including several companies owned by women and members of minority groups.
 For temp agencies, profit margins are still higher in the small and midsize accounts -- long the industry's bread and butter. But the competition is fiercest for the big customers.
 "I wouldn't be surprised to see the relationships with the big clients become semipermanent over the next few years," John Rowberry, senior vice president at Adia, said, "like those they have with their accountants."

HEADLINE: Second Man Is Under Arrest In a Doctor's Killing in 1981

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
More than 13 years after a popular young resident in pediatric surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center was shot and killed in a struggle with muggers, a second suspect has been arrested by the Manhattan detective whose tenacity broke the long-dormant case with a first arrest last summer.
 The new suspect, Daryl Whitley, 32, has been in prison for 6 of the last 13 years on robbery and drug convictions and was to be released from an upstate prison in May after serving a term in a parole violation case. He was brought to New York from his cell on Thursday and charged with the murder of Dr. John Chase Wood Jr. 
 The detective, Jerry Giorgio of the 34th Precinct, who accumulated a 20-pound carton of evidence in the case over the years, said in an interview yesterday that he had found several new witnesses who linked Mr. Whitley to Dr. Wood's killing on Riverside Drive at 165th Street on the night of Nov. 2, 1981.
 "I keep thinking about the children he would have saved or helped," the detective said of Dr. Wood when asked about his determined pursuit in the case. And he told of "a special place in my heart" for Columbia-Presbyterian, where his own son, facing death as an infant with hydrocephaly 30 years ago, underwent three successful operations.
 Two muggers -- some witnesses said three -- accosted Dr. Wood as he returned to work after dinner with his wife, Diana, a nurse who was pregnant. There was a scuffle, and he was shot in the heart in a moment of madness that yielded the killers $5, destroyed a promising life, shattered a family, stunned friends and colleagues and stirred outrage across the city.
 The victim's widow gave birth to a boy, later became an anesthesiologist in Boston and recently remarried, said Detective Giorgio, who continued his investigation after the headlines faded, interviewing hundreds of potential witnesses and tracking countless leads.
 The detective finally broke the case last July 30 with the arrest of Patrick McDowell, 30, an unemployed janitor from Washington Heights who had spent 10 of the previous 13 years in prison for another slaying. He was accused of firing the 22-caliber bullet that killed Dr. Wood, but has not yet been brought to trial.
 Wayne Brison, a spokesman for District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, confirmed yesterday that Mr. Whitley had been indicted by a grand jury in Dr. Wood's death and that he would be arraigned on Monday. He said it was unclear whether Mr. McDowell and Mr. Whitley would be tried together.
 Both men had been suspects in the Wood case since early 1982, when they were arrested in the unrelated robbery and murder of a Manhattan woman. In that case, Mr. McDowell served 10 years for manslaughter and Mr. Whitley 2 years for robbery. Mr. Whitley also served four years, from 1986 to 1990, on a drug charge, was jailed for a minor offense in Raleigh, N.C., last year and was returned to the Franklin Correctional Facility in Malone, N.Y., last December for violating parole.
 The two arrests do not mean the Wood case is over, Detective Giorgio said.
 "There may be a third person," he said. "It's a suspicion I've always had. Two people approached the doctor, but there may have been a third, a lookout. I'm not giving up. I have to get rid of that doubt in my mind."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan Reports Plan on Economic Rules, and Criticism Is Swift

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 31

 BODY:
The Government disclosed a five-year plan today to abolish or relax hundreds of economic regulations, but both businessmen here and American officials immediately criticized the package as inadequate.
"There are some things that are hopeful," Walter F. Mondale, the American Ambassador to Japan, said in an interview today. "The rest of it is so general and delayed and vague that we just can't give it any weight." 
 The package, approved by the Cabinet this morning, affects a wide range of industries. Some of the rule changes should make it less expensive to import goods and transport them in Japan, while other rules might ease the use of American wood products in Japanese homes.
But the plan is vague in places, calling in some cases only for certain regulations to be reviewed, not necessarily to be revised or abolished. Many of the 1,100 items are steps that had already been announced. And the plan leaves out deregulatory steps proposed by both Japanese industry and foreign businesses.
The package does not relax a law that makes it difficult to open large stores, saying only that the law will be reviewed by the end of the plan's five-year period. Washington has complained that the law makes it difficult for American mass merchandisers to open outlets here in the world's second-largest economy.
The package also does not deal with deregulation of Japan's automobile inspection system because that is the subject of trade talks with the United States aimed at increasing sales of foreign automobile repair parts.
Deregulation has become a battle cry in Japan in the last two years. Economists say it would bring down high prices and help revitalize the economy by easing new business formation. The United States and Europe have been pressing for deregulation to ease the entry of foreign companies into Japan's markets.
Some businessmen here had hoped that a strong deregulation package, which would eventually help reduce Japan's trade surplus, would help stem the rapid rise of the yen against the dollar. Instead the yen soared to a new high today, threatening to choke off Japan's nascent economic recovery by making exports less competitive.
Shoichiro Toyoda, the chairman of Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business organization, said, "There is much room for improvement" in the plan, which includes only 211 of the 456 deregulatory measures the organization proposed.
Japan has introduced numerous deregulation and import-promotion packages over the years, often with great fanfare. But when put into effect the plans usually fall short. The new plan was ordered by Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, but his administration left decisions on what rules to eliminate to the very bureaucrats who have a vested interest in maintaining the rules.
Officials here say that this new five-year plan sets more specific timetables than past ones, calling for annual reviews that will be open to foreign suggestions.
One of the rule changes will enable air cargo to clear customs more quickly. Another change will allow standard-sized containers used on ships to be carried by trucks. Under current regulations, cargo shipped into Japan must be transferred to smaller containers for road travel, adding to costs.
Other measures would relax restrictions on sales promotions and would strengthen the agency that enforces antitrust laws.

HEADLINE: Italian Left Could Play Kingmaker Role

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Tell These Italians Communism Doesn't Work" (Reggio Emilia Journal, March 24), on the "consistency and even efficiency" a Communist administration has brought to the town of Reggio Emilia, highlights the increasingly prominent role the left is playing in the Italian social, political and economic arena. 
 For the Communists, "respectability" with the Italian electorate began roughly in the late 1980's and early 90's, when they renounced Marxism and adopted a less threatening name, the Party of the Democratic Left.
While they were kept out of the power structure (the executive branch) since the formation of the Italian Republic following World War II, the Communists directed their energies principally into hundreds of local administrations and the labor movement.
In both areas they were generally respected for their efficiency, sense of innovation and probity (the Party of the Democratic Left was the only major party not affected by the recent corruption scandals).
The amalgamation in the 80's of the three major labor unions was largely spearheaded by the Communist labor union. In its expanded, coordinated form the labor movement has gained considerable support from its membership and increased its impact on management.
The Party of the Democratic Left, after canvassing its membership, supported Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's interim "government of technocrats" in the March 16 vote of confidence. This in a sense ratified the austerity programs Mr. Dini has proposed to restore financial stability to Italy. By casting more than 50 percent of the "yes" vote, the party became the decisive political factor in extending and expanding the tenure of the Dini Government.
The Party of the Democratic Left bids fair to become a kingmaker in the general elections later this year.

HEADLINE: S.I. Port Sludge to Be Sent Out of State

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
Bowing to concerns of residents on both sides of New York Harbor, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have agreed on a plan to dump 150,000 tons of contaminated sediment in an out-of-state landfill rather than into underwater pits off Coney Island and Staten Island, despite the new plan's higher costs.
 The sediment would come from dredging the waters of the Howland Hook Marine Terminal, a cargo port that is to be deepened to about 40 feet from 31 feet so deep-hulled ships can start docking there. 
 The terminal, on the northwest shore of Staten Island, has been closed for almost a decade because it cannot accommodate the freighters now used in most major shipping. Two previous plans for disposing of the sludge -- involving an underwater pit a mile off Coney Island and another three miles from Staten Island -- met with vociferous opposition from residents, environmentalists and fishermen.
 Officials of New York City and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said a main reason for disposing of the contaminated material out of state was to avoid lawsuits over environmental permits that might delay reopening the terminal. City officials have long put pressure on the Port Authority to hasten the terminal's revitalization.
 "The plan offers a solution to an impasse over disposal of material that must be dredged from berths at Howland Hook before the 187-acre site, virtually unused since 1986, can again handle cargo," a statement by the Port Authority said.
 Two landfill sites are under consideration, one in New Milford, Conn., the other in East Carbon, Utah.
 The director of the Port Authority's port department, Lillian Liburdi, said the companies that operate the two landfills -- Waste Management Inc., which runs the one in New Milford, and the E.C.D.C. Laidlaw Corporation, which operates the landfill in Utah -- have already submitted bids for transporting and disposing of the dredged material. One bid is $15.7 million and the other is $29 million, Ms. Liburdi said, but she would not disclose which company had made which proposal. The higher bid is about four times the cost of using the harbor pits.
 Officials said the higher cost is justified because opening the harbor to deep-hulled vessels is essential to restoring economic vitality to what was once one of the world's premier cargo ports. The agreement, Mayor Giuliani said in a written statement, "shows our desire to bring jobs and activity back to our once-thriving waterfront."
 The dredging of Howland Hook, which could begin in June if all the government permits are obtained, is expected to create 300 jobs almost immediately, the Mayor said, "with a potential for up to 1,700 for the coming years." Eventually, he said, the terminal is expected to generate $230 million in economic activity.
 Initially, the sediment from the dredging was to be deposited in what is called the Mud Dump, a federally regulated site off Sandy Hook, N.J. But the Federal Environmental Protection Agency barred the use of the site after tests determined that the Howland Hook sediments fell into the highest category of toxins.
 The Port Authority then proposed dumping the material into the excavation pits left by sand-mining operations in the harbor and capping the pits with sand and clay.
 Among the contaminants found in the Howland Hook sediments are pesticides, trace metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's. There has been some debate whether there are also dioxin compounds in the sludge, with one biologist, Dr. Angela Cristini, saying that at least six studies have established their presence and New York City officials saying tests there have found only minute amounts that pose no hazard.
 "We took on the Port Authority, a $4.5 billion Goliath, and stopped them from cutting their costs at the expense of our health," Assemblyman Daniel L. Feldman, a Democrat from Brooklyn and a leader of the opposition to dumping the material in the harbor, said yesterday. "At the beginning of the struggle, I think they perceived us as a toothpick trying to topple the Washington Monument."
 More than 15,000 people eventually signed petitions opposing the harbor dumping plans.
 Ms. Liburdi said that if new dredging permits are approved by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the Army Corps of Engineers, the first berth area at Howland Hook could be ready by June. She said a tenant, Howland Hook Marine Terminal Inc., owned by Carmine Ragucci, a former manager of the terminal, is waiting to begin operations there.
 Dr. Cristini, a member of the Dredged Materials Management Team formed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, said she thought "it's a very good idea that they are planning to use upland disposal" in a landfill for the material.
 "I think it can be done environmentally soundly if the landfills where they are supposed to go are capable of receiving toxic sediments," she continued, "meaning that they have the appropriate lining, the proper containment so that the stuff doesn't get into the groundwater."
 When asked about the possibility that the landfill in New Milford might be used, Michele Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, said: "This is premature to us. The state will not accept any waste material that does not fit the criteria for the environment and public health.
 "To date, we have no permit application in front of us, and we have received no data on the dredge material."

Body Bags at 11

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
SIRENS BLEAT, BODIES float, suspects cringe, victims weep. Celebrities preen and promote. Anchors chat and emote. It's local news time: normally 30 minutes of hell and blather, ads and promos, weather and sports, starting at 9, 10 or 11 -- local television's most profitable time of night and its most disheartening use of the air.
There are exceptions, of course, here and there, one night or another. But in most of America, whatever channel you watch, the late news is obsessed with crime and disaster, encouraging fear or smug comfort, or both. It assails the mind but offers nothing much to think about -- not even about crime, war and disaster. No helpful assessments of the police or local hospital. Almost nothing about education except some school shooting. Nothing about housing except some landlord's venality. Nothing about traffic except some flaming collision. Much less anything reflective about politics, economics, foreign affairs. 
 We all know it's so, but local news being local, it's hard to document the dreary sameness from city to city, set to set, anchor to anchor. It's also been too easily excused: after all, didn't the nightly local news replace the local evening paper that thrived on crime and scandal, astrology and sports? Yes, but even the yellowest of the yellow sheets had a distinctive personality and point of view, style of writing and roster of stars. Most of the papers' TV descendants lack the confidence and talent to stray from the pitiful norm, and now I've got the proof.
The evidence is called "A Day in the Life of Local TV News in America." It's a pamphlet assessing the content of one night's local news on 50 stations in 29 cities, large and small. Volunteers in selected cities were recruited by the Rocky Mountain Media Watch of Denver to tape the Jan. 11 news shows (fussily called "programs" by The Times); Paul Klite, Robert A. Bardwell and Jason Salzman then ran the tapes past their stopwatches. It takes less than the time of one newscast to absorb their findings.
They began by defining an American television newscast: The average commercial station devoted 43 percent of its air time -- less than 13 minutes out of the typical 30 -- to what can be generously called general news. None offered more than 17 minutes of news in a half hour, and none less than 10. Sports and weather averaged a little more than 6 minutes. Commercials on average claimed nearly 8 1/2 minutes -- and more than 10 minutes at 10 of the stations.
The news segments, predictably, were dominated by "Mayhem" stories involving either crime or disaster. The stations' search for distress that January evening was helped along by vivid scenes of the devastation caused by California's rains and floods. But half the time devoted to purely local news (not counting the floods or O. J.) was also given over to mayhem. And the majority of the crime stories, mostly about murder, were plainly local:
Son shoots mother five times with bow and arrow. (Pittsburgh)
Boyfriend sets girlfriend on fire. (Chicago)
Body mutilated and put on display. (Austin)
City's first female drive-by gang shooting. (Tucson)
On to the "Fluff Index." This category encompasses trivial features, anchor chatter, celebrity items and teasers about the news to come after the commercial. Somewhat arbitrarily, the analysts had to decide how much O. J. was celebrity gossip and how much crime. (The next morning, which was two weeks before the start of the Simpson trial, The New York Times's O. J. article appeared on page 14: "Prosecution Says Simpson Abused Wife for 17 Years.")
The average newscast served up 1 minute of fluff for every 3 minutes of news:
Girl reunited with dog.
How to tango.
Ex-Mayor's portrait on beer bottle.
Today's daily trivia question.
Baby tamarins at the zoo.
Fluff seems to be a sensitive area for some stations. The Rocky Mountain monitors observed that WRC-TV in Washington, with an average fluff-to-news ratio of 1 to 3, was running a promo advertising "No fluff, no chit-chat, no nonsense." And KMGH-TV in Denver, promising "No filler, no fluff, no contests," was judged to be offering fluff to news in a ratio of nearly 1 to 2.
A station that stood out favorably with low scores on both the fluff and mayhem charts was WBBM-TV, the CBS property in Chicago. Surprise, surprise: it runs a distant third in the ratings behind ABC's WLS-TV (not covered in the survey) and NBC's WMAQ-TV (double the fluff and more than double the mayhem). Understandably, results like that frighten the managers of commercial stations.
But at least in some cities, viewers seem to be commendably restive. WCCO-TV, the CBS station in Minneapolis that scored high on the mayhem index but low on fluff, discovered last year that 4 out of 5 viewers clicked the Remote to switch channels during the 10 o'clock news -- and on average they clicked five times during the half hour! Thus was born an idea that may, in time, offer the local news everywhere a measure of redemption.
John Culliton, WCCO's general manager, decided to give the switchers a place to land. He began in January to produce a second, simultaneous newscast on an independent station that offers the same headline appetizer but a different main dish -- generally more local and life-style news in place of the sports and weather. By using the same commercials, the two programs qualify for a combined viewership rating.
Real distinction, however, would transcend such modest choice. It would offer journalistic expertise and showmanship to compete with the vivid pictures of maimed victims, burning buildings and distraught relatives. It would require reporters who know their subjects as well as the sports and weather people know theirs. It would put a premium on covering the cost of Medicare and the trickery in City Hall's budget. It would require hiring animators to turn out colorful, instructive graphics that explain the stories that don't photograph well.
The customary excuse for the low quality of local television news is that the viewers won't stay around for anything better. But hardly any stations employ enough talent to test that proposition. Hardly any are even willing to try analyzing urban violence instead of merely filming it and to make celebrities of worthy citizens instead of celebrating models of fluff. Yes, the attention span of the local news audience is scandalously short. But to find the juiciest scandal, local television news need only look at itself.

Step Right Up to Broadway's Revivals Museum

BYLINE: By MARGO JEFFERSON 

 BODY:
RIGHT NOW MUCH OF broadway is a Museum of the American Musical staffed by busy curator-directors eager to put their stamp on every show they mount.
Their handiwork includes the "revisal," as in the brand-new "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"; treatments of pre-existing musical texts, as in "Tommy" and "Smokey Joe's Cafe"; arduous restorations, like "Show Boat," and meticulous concert versions like "Call Me Madam." 
 Museums today are afraid of losing their audiences. And so these musical exhibits must be crowd pleasers as well as genuine attempts to do justice to a great American form -- one that has dwindled and diminished in recent years.
Harold Prince's "Show Boat" is a closely supervised, lavish restoration, involving research, scholarship and all the resources of present-day stagecraft. Actually, it is a curious amalgam of several versions -- the first one, in 1927, the 1936 film and the 1946 Broadway revival, among them -- made to look like a dream vision of the original. The aim is to seal up all the cracks in this gorgeous, awkward, daring, sickly sweet, eager-to-challenge yet eager-to-please musical: to buff and polish it till it looks like new. But to my mind, antiques that look too new lose some of their character.
The "Encores! Great American Musicals in Concert" series takes a very different approach. They almost completely discard the frippery of sets and costumes and pare the work down to its basic structure of words and music. "Encores!" did a terrific job with Irving Berlin's 1950 "Call Me Madam" last month. They will have done Cole Porter's "Out of This World" by the time you read this, and next month they will be doing Rodgers and Hart's "Pal Joey." The shows run for just three days at City Center and wouldn't look amiss in a small, pretty Broadway house. If they are all as good as "Call Me Madam," I'd like them to play for months.
The orchestra replaced the scenery in this cheerfully lightweight sendup of President Truman's appointment of Perle Mesta, Washington's most flamboyant hostess, as his Ambassador to Luxembourg. The cast, led by Tyne Daly as the hostess-with-the-mostest, dressed simply, sang winningly and performed while carrying their scores. Not that they weren't impeccably rehearsed by Charles Repole, the director -- of course they were. The scores were like certificates of authenticity, meant to remind us that these performers were getting down to the business of putting on a show. You saw the work and you saw the result of that work, the sparkle and the hard-won spontaneity, at the same time. It was as if you could view the land of Oz in all its illusory glamour while watching the Wizard work away backstage to produce those illusions.
The revue takes a simpler, more improvised approach to its material. It's a survey, a glance backward at music and manners that usually flourished outside Broadway's boundaries, in the neighborhoods of jazz, blues or, as in "Smokey Joe's Cafe: The Songs of Leiber and Stoller," currently playing at the Virginia Theater, 1950's and early 60's rock-and-roll. No plot is required. All the story we need is in the songs and the styles they recall: ways of walking, talking, dressing, flirting, yearning and showing off. The fact that these styles are being framed and mounted on Broadway now is proof of their staying power. They've lasted in our imaginations, so they can go legit.
The songs in "Smokey Joe's Cafe," songs like "There Goes My Baby," "Stand by Me," "Young Blood," "Kansas City," "Yakety Yak," "Hound Dog" and, yes, "On Broadway" (hail to the Drifters, Ben E. King, the Coasters, Wilbert Harrison, Big Mama Thornton and Elvis Presley), come across as good clean fun. But after all, this is still supposed to be rock-and-roll. A little less goodness and a little less ingratiating cleanliness would be a lot more fun.
The most ambitious approach to classic musical theater texts can be seen in the plush, showy revisal of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" that opened 10 days ago at the Richard Rodgers Theater. A revisal is part revision, part revival and part reappraisal. A revisal's director (in this case Des McAnuff, who also directed the plush, showy "Tommy") acts as a kind of anthropologist and social psychologist. Our dear ancestors, he seems to say of those who wrote the work he is staging: how vital and gifted you were, how much you gave us. But you were backward in certain ways too, a prisoner of your times. It is up to me to free you now, to enhance your virtues and to minimize, chastise or eradicate your faults.
"How to Succeed," which opened in 1961, was Frank Loesser's last musical. (It succeeded "Where's Charley?" "Guys and Dolls," "The Most Happy Fella" and "Greenwillow" in his canon.) Following one J. Pierrepont Finch from his job as a window washer to his position as chairman of the board of the World Wide Wicket Company in New York City, it manages to be both a satire and a fairy tale. It is satiric because it mocks American how-to-better-yourself instruction manuals stretching from Benjamin Franklin to Dale Carnegie and because it mocks the chicanery, nepotism and mediocrity that keep big business humming. It is a fairy tale because all those how-to-better-yourself dreams come true and because chicanery, nepotism and mediocrity are put to the service of a happy ending for all.
The score and the story are a perfect fit: in fact, the lyrics are so smart and so well served by the music that together they nearly carry the story and render the book (by Abe Burrows, Jack Weinstock and Willie Gilbert) superfluous. Loesser could submerge himself in a song the way certain actors can submerge themselves in their character. He had so many musical tricks and manners; he could write arias, anthems, ballads, hymns, swing songs and patter songs, and he could write them straight or as parodies.
The characters in "How to Succeed" are meant to be played straight and for parody. They get to have it both ways, and so do we. J. Pierrepont Finch (played by Matthew Broderick) is a boy ingenue and a shameless schemer. Rosemary Pilkington (Megan Mullally) is the secretary who loves him: a girl ingenue with a heart of brass. He has his eye on a company presidency; she has her eye on him and on a home in New Rochelle. For now, the company president is J. B. Biggley, an officious executive with a trifling nephew he keeps promoting and a big, gold-digging blond girlfriend he keeps finding jobs for. There is a male chorus of greedy executives and a female chorus of cynically vivacious secretaries.
"How to Succeed" is that rare thing in the annals of musical comedy, a man's show, for the perfectly good reason that the business world of 1961 was a man's world. The men's roles are bigger, better and easier to play well. Rudy Vallee played Biggley in the original, and he was both pompous and unctuous. (He had already given us a younger version of this figure in Preston Sturges's film comedy "The Palm Beach Story.") This time around, Ronn Carroll is louder, coarser, more unsure of himself and more bullying, which is fine. Charles Nelson Reilly turned Biggley's nephew Bud Frump into a smug, portly dweeb. To equally good effect, Jeff Blumenkrantz makes him a skinny, nervous and slightly foppish nerd, beset as much by ambition as by incompetence.
Robert Morse's inimitable Finch was a merry prankster, a kind of amoral Robin Hood, who robbed from the rich to make himself rich. Matthew Broderick is a shyer, slyer actor: his Finch manipulates with a clear conscience and a pure heart. I can't help it, it's my inner child, he seems to be saying every time he pulls a new trick on someone. The choreographer Wayne Cilento plays this up cleverly. Whenever Ponty is about to launch a new scheme, he breaks into eccentric dance movements, as if he were entering his own personal dream ballet. And when he actually dances, he looks like an infantilized Jerry Lewis who longs to be Fred Astaire.
MR. CILENTO TRIES TO DO the same thing for Megan Mullally's Rosemary. This 1990's revisal wants us to believe that Rosemary is mistress of her fate and future. She may sing like a doe-eyed ingenue, but that's just to soften us up; when she dances, she dances like a svelte Cyd Charisse. But this is a concept, not a characterization. The concept dictates that Rosemary and all of the secretaries at the World Wide Wicket Company be in command: though they may appear vulnerable, superficial or merely coquettish, they are really superb sexual tacticians with a feminist agenda.
But the year is 1961, and however smart they may be, secretaries are still babes in corporate toyland. "How to Succeed" depends on sexual hierarchies along with the social and economic ones. These working girls can no more triumph as feminists than the men they work for can turn into enlightened public servants.
Nothing makes the situation clearer than a song that the director of "How to Succeed" chose to drop. The song is "Cinderella, Darling," and the secretaries sing it to Rosemary at the moment she is about to resign from her position as Ponty's fiancee. "How often does it happen/ That a secretary's boss/ Wants to marry 'er?/ How often does the dream come true/ Without a sign of conflict/ Or barrier?" Smitty, the sharp-tongued leader of the typing pack intones. "How often can you fly/ From this land of carbon paper/ To the land of flower'd chintz?/ How often does a Cinderella/ Get a crack at the prince?"
And then the girls chime in: "Don't, don't, don't,/ Cinderella, darling/ Don't turn down the prince!" and unfurl a vision of Bergdorf Goodman, Elizabeth Arden and the New Rochelle P.T.A. "Why spoil our enjoyment;/ You're the fable,/ The symbol/Of glorified unemployment!" they chant. With Victoria Clark's Smitty in charge, this song would have worked. It is a shrewd capsule portrait of pink-collar femininity circa 1961, more accurate and therefore more biting than what Mr. McAnuff substitutes: a girl-group reprise of Ponty's "How to Succeed" anthem, in which they plot to marry tycoons and take over companies.
Trust the tale, not the teller, said D. H. Lawrence. Trust the audience too, one might add. Des McAnuff's revisal is a good-looking, fast-moving show. But if he had trusted the tale he would not have had to patronize the audience. "How to Succeed" could have been tough-minded then, instead of mealy-mouthed.

Air Pacts, Partnerships Bridging the Atlantic

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
MORE flights between Europe and North America should at least theoretically -- be the result of a spate of agreements between the United States and nine European Governments to open their skies to each other's airlines. Despite a warning in February by the European Union, which wants to negotiate a global accord on air service with Washington, several member countries, including Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria, and some nonmembers, like Switzerland and Iceland, have reached preliminary agreement to phase out restrictive treaties that have governed air travel. The others -- Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway -- are expected to do so this month.
"This will open up big business centers in Europe to direct traffic," predicts Tony Molinari, a United Airlines spokesman. But United, like other carriers canvassed, said it had no immediate plans to expand flights to Europe as a result of the new accords. 
 After signing a similar agreement with Canada in February, the United States has been seeking to achieve open skies over the major European countries, including France and Germany. So by reaching accords with the smaller countries, the hope is to gain access to the bigger markets as well.
Unlike the United States accord with Canada, which sparked a flurry of announcements by airlines in both countries, and some lower fares, the European agreements have not yet prompted any of the European national carriers to propose specific new flights. Partly, this is because most of them are grappling with cost-cutting measures needed to restore financial health after the recession of the last few years. It is also because many of the airlines involved already had plans to increase connections with North America through cooperative agreements with carriers there.
For example, Austrian Airlines, eager to serve American cities other than New York, began a three-way code sharing arrangement last month with Swissair and Delta to fly Vienna-to-Geneva-to-Washington and Vienna-to-Zurich-to-Chicago. Johann Jurceka, a spokesman for Austrian, said no reduction in existing fares was planned.
Code-sharing arrangements enable airlines to coordinate connecting flights and list them jointly in reservation systems as if the partners were one airline. For passengers, code-sharing can open up previously unavailable destinations. The result is to put more passengers on planes, making them more profitable for the airlines to run.
Last fall, for example, Sabena expanded its relationship with Delta, offering shared flights to and from Brussels and four American cities, Chicago, Boston, Atlanta and New York. Moreover, Delta travelers on Sabena aircraft can now connect through Brussels to German cities including Dusseldorf, Hanover, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart.
A Sabena spokesman, Ives Panneels, said the airline had no plans to increase flights to the United States because of Belgium's agreement with Washington.. A Swissair spokesman said any additional flights to the United States would be added through its code-sharing partner, Delta.
"We have always lobbied and spoken out in favor of open skies," said Todd Clay, manager of corporate communications at Delta. "And an integral part of that is code-sharing, where we now have 10 different arrangements."
Today, Atlanta-based Delta is scheduled to begin operating shared routes with Virgin Atlantic Airlines of Britain, affording Delta travelers access for the first time to Heathrow Airport outside London. Delta now flies into Gatwick, London's second airport, from several American cities, including Boston, Orlando, Miami, Cincinnati and Atlanta. Delta will also share Virgin flights to Heathrow from seven American points, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.

HEADLINE: A Foreclosed Co-op in Brooklyn Becoming a Rental

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
IT is every co-op owner's worst nightmare: The building falls into default on its underlying mortgage. Then the bank moves to foreclose. Then the co-op files for bankruptcy. Then the judge sells the building, effectively liquidating the shareholders' equity and turning every apartment owner into a renter.
Such a scenario is unfolding in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where a 106-unit co-op, Hamilton House, which was built as a co-op in 1986, was foreclosed on by Citibank last year after falling behind in payments on its $7.2 million underlying mortgage and filing for bankruptcy. 
 The six-story building, at 100-31 Fourth Avenue and 419 101st Street, was sold at an auction last month for $5 million. If the closing goes through as scheduled on Friday, the buyer would own it as a rental.
Among those who stand to lose their investment are nine apartment buyers who purchased their units for occupancy; the remaining buyers were investors who held the apartments as rentals.
Despite the well-publicized troubles of many co-ops that converted from rentals in recent years, only a few have failed to the point that they reverted to rentals. The precise number is not known, according to the New York State Attorney General's office, which oversees co-ops, because there may be some unpublicized cases.
Large banks like Citibank have usually not been involved in these deconversions. The mortgage holder has been either a small private lender or Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
In one case, Freddie Mac foreclosed in 1993 on 101 Lincoln Road, an 86-unit apartment building in Brooklyn in which 20 of the 86 apartments had been sold. The rest continued to be occupied by rent-stabilized tenants. The 20 shareholders, however, lost ownership of their apartments.
"It is very unusual, in general, when a co-op is successfully foreclosed on and even rarer when a building is foreclosed on and does not automatically fall under rent-stabilization," said Arthur I. Weinstein, vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
He added that the Hamilton House situation did not appear to portend similar problems elsewhere in the city. "Most people have negotiated solutions to their problems or are in the process of solving their problem," he said.
Hamilton House, which has an underground garage, was built by James C. Gherardi, who also built the nearby Water's View at Verrazano development. He owns several units in the co-op. Originally, apartments at Hamilton House sold at $80,000 to $103,000 for studios, $101,000 to $153,000 for one-bedrooms and $185,000 to $198,000 for two-bedrooms. Most of the units sold within the first two years, mainly to investors.
By 1993, though, it became apparent, said Thomas W. Smith, an attorney in Yonkers who represents the co-op corporation, that the underlying mortgage on the property was more than the co-op could afford and would grow even larger because of needed repairs. The co-op defaulted on the mortgage after failing to reach a workout agreement with Citibank. Because of the problems, one-bedroom units had been offered recently for as little as $5,000.
In a co-op, an underlying mortgage is the loan used to buy, renovate or maintain the building. It is obtained by the co-op corporation, which may be controlled by occupying shareholders, or by the builder or conversion sponsor in cases where they still control the board. This mortgage differs from a share or end loan, which is obtained to finance the purchase of an individual unit. The shareholder also has a lease from the corporation to occupy the apartment.
To pay off the underlying mortgage, the shareholders make maintenance payments, which are also used for taxes, repairs, cash reserves and operating expenses. If a co-op falls behind in mortgage payments, the holder of the underlying mortgage can move to foreclose on the building.
Generally, though, co-ops are not foreclosed on, even if they have been in default for months, because they would revert to rent-stabilized status, and few buyers would want to own them, not even the holders of the underlying mortgage.
WHAT made Hamilton House an appealing buy -- there were three bidders and more than 30 parties that expressed interest in bidding -- is that it was never a rental before it became a co-op; it was built as a co-op.
The prospective new owner, Lennard A. Katz of Manhattan, who runs a family real estate business, the Katz Realty Group, believes that the building will fall under the city's rent-stabilization laws for only one or two years -- and only because the developer accepted a Section 421a tax abatement. After that, he believes he can charge market rents.
Even if the building were to remain rent-stabilized, though, he believes that the rents would be high enough to make the building profitable. He believes that at the worst rents would be rolled back to the level of the shareholders' last maintenance payments. Maintenance payments in the building currently run from $650 to $1,100 a month.
"I'm in for the long haul," Mr. Katz said.
The 421a program was authorized by the State Legislature at New York City's behest in 1972 in an effort to stimulate residential construction at a time of recession. It has been used in the construction of more than 67,000 apartments in the city -- the total includes condominiums, co-ops and rental buildings.
Harry G. Ryttenberg, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal in Albany, which oversees rent stabilization in the city, said he was unsure how long or even if the building would qualify as rent-stabilized.
"We would have to examine all the circumstances carefully, and our legal department would render an option," he said.
AS it now stands, Mr. Katz is expected to take over the building this week and negotiate rents with the shareholders, many of whom have not only lost their equity in their apartments but also have share loans outstanding. Several lenders, according to Mr. Smith, are also calling in their share loans for immediate payment, citing the lack of equity backing them.
"A lot of people don't know what they are going to do," said Steven Schiesel, a lawyer, resident-shareholder and president of the Hamilton House five-member co-op board; he is also the only resident-shareholder on the board.
"I don't know what to do," he added, noting that he still owes $70,000 on his unit and plans to continue making payments of about $600 a month to the Dime Savings Bank just to preserve his credit.
"I do know, though, that I'll never buy another co-op again."
Even if the building becomes rent-stabilized, it is not clear what the rents would be. Some co-ops have argued that the rents should be the maintenance payments before the dissolution of the co-op. Some lenders, however, note that co-ops, as a pre-emptive way of dealing with this possibility, often reduce their maintenance payments to a bare minimum when a foreclosure is pending. The matter is pending in the courts.
If the building is made rent-stabilized, though, the shareholders would not be able to rent their units out for much more than the rent-stabilized level. The landlord would also not be obliged extend the leases if the units were occupied by subtenants, rather than former shareholders.
Mr. Schiesel speculated that the judge in the bankruptcy proceedings did not seek a workout of the defaulted mortgage because so many of the shareholders were investors rather than owner-occupants.
Mr. Smith also said that Mr. Katz has rebuffed his attempt to seek some sort of arrangement that would allow shareholders to keep ownership of their units.
"They are just not interested," he said.

HEADLINE: Hartford Mulls Stadium for All Seasons

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
STATE legislators, who agreed to build a $251 million stadium in an effort to lure the New England Patriots football team to Hartford -- only to have the Patriots decide to stay in Foxboro, Mass. -- may now be asked to help back a scaled-down complex with tenants that might include UConn football and basketball teams.
Though considerably smaller than the previously proposed stadium, the complex would have at least one additional feature: a dome that would enable it to house hockey and basketball games, concerts, circuses and other indoor events, in addition to football. 
 As envisioned by its main proponent, Lewis B. Rome, a Hartford lawyer and chairman of the University of Connecticut board of trustees, the stadium would become the home of the UConn football team -- which is expected to be elevated to Division I-A status -- and the home away from home of the Huskies men's basketball team. It also would replace the Hartford Civic Center as the home of the Hartford Whalers of the National Hockey League and would be host to other events now held at the Civic Center. Mr. Rome, the leading force behind the campaign to upgrade UConn's football program to Division I-A status, the top echelon of college football, is convinced that the stadium would lead to a renaissance for downtown Hartford, where it would be situated.
"The main question is whether such a stadium would produce sufficient revenue to justify it being built, and I'm convinced that the answer is yes," said Mr. Rome, a former State Senate majority leader.
Mr. Rome said some of the money would come from the private sector, but that, "the bulk would have to come from the state." Mr. Rome said he has had discussions with prospective investors but was not at liberty to discuss them. He did say he has received a commitment from William R. Berkley, a Greenwich businessman, to place a Canadian Football League team in Hartford if the stadium is built. Mr. Berkley, who has made a nonrefundable deposit of $100,000 for such a franchise, said in an interview he hoped to have the C.F.L. team play at the Yale Bowl in New Haven starting in the summer of 1996 if he receives assurances that the stadium will be built. The new stadium, he and Mr. Rome believe, could be ready for C.F.L. use by 1998.
As proposed by Mr. Rome, the stadium would have a capacity of about 42,000 for football, compared with the 65,000-seat stadium that had been promised the Patriots. Capacity would be about 30,000 for basketball, hockey, concerts and other events. He estimated that it would cost between $80 million and $120 million to build the complex on the same downtown site where the previously projected stadium was to have been built. (Some analysts say the stadium, as projected, could cost as much as $150 million).
As part of the overall project, Mr. Rome has suggested converting the Hartford Civic Center -- which would be within walking distance of the proposed stadium -- into a convention center at a cost of about $15 million. In the process, the coliseum, where hockey and basketball games and many other events are held, would probably be converted into an exhibition hall.
Such a plan would be far less costly than a new convention center, which has been proposed for a different site, and, Mr. Rome said, could cost as much as $250 million. Last December, UConn trustees approved a committee report calling for the upgrading of the Huskies' football program from Division I-AA to I-A. The report has been sent to the university's president, Harry Hartley, and to the UConn athletic director, Lew Perkins, who both favor the upgrading and are expected to move on it by November.
Far and away the biggest obstacle to upgrading the football program is the absence of a suitable stadium, one that seats at least 30,000 spectators, as required by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (Memorial Stadium, where the Huskies play their home football games on the Storrs campus, has a capacity of 16,200). The stadium proposed by Mr. Rome -- which some are already referring to as the "Rome Dome" -- would serve that purpose. Dr. Hartley said in an interview that the university is not in a position to build a larger stadium on its own, particularly in view of needed improvements on the Storrs campus.
But both the UConn president and Mr. Rome concede that another tenant, such as a C.F.L. team, could make a proposed stadium a more attractive and viable proposition to whoever might finance construction.
"There's no way it's going to be a UConn stadium," Dr. Hartley said. "We're adamant that it will not be a UConn budget decision. If it's built, it will have to be through private and public funding. But I think they'll be able to do it."
If UConn does move up to Division I-A in football -- a proposal that has met with strong resistance by many, if indeed not most, faculty members -- it would find itself playing such Big East football powers as Syracuse, Boston College, Pittsburgh and Miami, along with Notre Dame, West Virginia and Rutgers, which will join the conference as basketball members next year.
As for the new stadium, certainly not everyone favors the idea. Referring to what he called "the creative imagination that has gone into the Rome Dome concept," Denis Horgan, a columnist for The Hartford Courant, wrote, "If a small fraction of this imagination had gone into helping the university itself, maybe the place wouldn't have deteriorated the way it woefully has."
Gov. John G. Rowland has not expressed a view on the proposed stadium. But his spokesman, John Chapin, called it an "intriguing project."
"UConn 2000 has gotten our attention right now," Mr. Chapin said, referring to a comprehensive financial proposal now before the legislature to improve the university's infrastructure over a 10-year period. As the stadium proposal "becomes less hypothetical, we might have some thoughts on it."
But some legislative leaders are dubious about the stadium's chances. "Given the current fiscal condition of the state, it would be a tough sell," said William DiBella of Hartford, the State Senate minority leader.
"We have to take a look at anything that might create more revenue," he said. "However, I'd like to see private investment encouraged toward any stadium project.
Another Democratic legislator from Hartford, State Representative Thomas Ritter, the House Speaker, said, "It would be great to have a stadium in downtown Hartford, but I can't see that happening. First we have to take care of educational needs."
Both Mr. DiBella and Mr. Ritter expressed surprise when told that Mr. Rome's plan called for primarily state funding. "The bulk of the money can't come from the state," Mr. Ritter said. "That's just not going to happen."
State Senator James Fleming, a Republican from Simsbury who is the Senate majority leader, said legislators would be wary of such a proposal after having authorized bond money for the failed stadium plan for the New England Patriots. "The legislature is not about to move forward on a proposal like this unless we have real assurances that it makes sense economically," he said. "I personally would want to see a concrete, hard-core analysis."
Mr. Rome conceded that proponents of the stadium would have to be extremely persuasive in their arguments. "I realize it would be a tough sell unless a lot of things fall into place," said Mr. Rome. "But if it's built, the stadium would support itself easily."
Even if UConn decides against elevating its football program to Division I-A status, Mr. Rome said, the stadium could succeed. "We can do it without UConn football," he said. "but UConn football would be the frosting on the cake."
But some believe that is a bit disingenuous. Mr. Rome, an avid UConn sports booster, has been a major figure in pushing for the football upgrade.
Mr. Berkley, the head of W. R. Berkley Inc. in Greenwich, an insurance holding company, said he would place his Canadian Football League team elsewhere if the state declines to build a stadium in Hartford. "If no stadium is built, we'd have to look at other cities," he said.
Whether a C.F.L. team would draw sufficient spectators in Hartford is open to conjecture. For one thing, football has never had a strong hold on the Hartford area. And for another, the C.F.L. game differs in several ways from American football.
Furthermore, the only major league team that Hartford has had in modern times, the Whalers, have not drawn well, averaging fewer than 10,000 spectators in the 16,000-seat Hartford Civic Center Coliseum.
Another professional team, the Hartford Hellcats of the Continental Basketball Association, folded in January after not-quite-two losing seasons at the Civic Center Coliseum and after having received almost $1 million in loans from the Connecticut Development Authority.
Still, after including only Canadian cities for many years, the Canadian Football League has taken on an increasingly American look. When the season begins in July, six of the 14 teams will be in United States cities -- Baltimore, San Antonio, Memphis, Birmingham, Shreveport, La. and Jackson, Miss. Mr. Berkley's team would become one of two more expansion clubs that the league plans to add in the next few years.
Whether the league is able to place a team in Connecticut will depend largely on Governor Rowland and the State Legislature, along with any private investors who might think a new stadium in Hartford is a good investment.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Trinity Church as a Landlord;
Turning Hudson Square Area Into an Office Hub

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
GIVEN his druthers, the Rev. James G. Callaway Jr., the deputy for grants at Trinity Church, would probably rather talk about Trinity's good works. There are the interest-free loans for housing in the South Bronx. There are the new parishes it has helped set up. There are the community-based programs it supports.
But Father Jamie, as everyone calls him, does not flinch when the talk turns to Trinity Church as a tough commercial landlord. Over the years, the church has been as quick to evict deadbeats, as steadfast in keeping rents up and concessions down, as adamant about getting personal guarantees to back up leases, as any developer around. 
 Indeed, Father Jamie and the real estate folks sound a lot alike. "We find it difficult to evict tenants but we do it all the time," said Joseph T. Palombi, Trinity's executive vice president of real estate. Now hear Father Jamie: "In the grimmer days of the 90's, we cut grants in half and laid off 38 people, but we still put millions into the buildings. We have to preserve our patrimony."
And quite a patrimony it is. Trinity Church owns close to 6 million square feet, most of it in 27 buildings around Hudson Square, an area bounded roughly by Canal and West Houston Streets, Avenue of the Americas and the Hudson River. Over the last few years the church has pumped more than $100 million into its properties, all in hopes of converting the area, which Trinity got from Queen Anne of England in 1705, from a printing and manufacturing bastion to an office hub.
Now Trinity is looking at its retailing, too. It has asked New Spectrum Realty, a store leasing company, to study whether the old printing buildings should house fancy stores. "We need to know whether this area can develop the same cachet as the rest of SoHo," Mr. Palombi said.
That's pretty aggressive talk for a landlord that got into the active real estate business by default, in the literal sense of the word. By this century's turn, Trinity had given away or sold about 97 percent of Queen Anne's bequest. St. Luke's Hospital, Columbia College, numerous parishes, all sprang up on Trinity land.
Trinity rented most of the remaining land to developers, who built printing plants and other manufacturing buildings on it. The developers, with Trinity's permission, used the land to secure their mortgages. In the Great Depression, many of them defaulted. Trinity had a choice: Assume the mortgage payments, or lose its land.
It took Trinity until the mid-1950's to pay off its debts. And it was not until 1970 that Trinity formed a coherent strategy for the church itself, and for the part its patrimony would play. It decided to stop subsidizing affiliated chapels, and instead strengthen its own congregation and works program.
Slowly, Trinity redirected its real estate profits toward such church-owned programs as Trinity Institute, which trains clergy, and "Trinity Playhouse," a series of television dramas with religious underpinnings that run on cable channels. And it set up a grant program to help build housing and the like.
Off and on, Trinity thought about selling its buildings, "but we just never got a fair offer," recalled Walter F. Spardel, Trinity Real Estate's managing director. By the 1980's, Trinity had decided that real estate was a good long-term investment, provided the buildings generated more cash.
"The net profit from light industrial property is maybe $3 a square foot, and we knew offices would pay better than that," Mr. Palombi said.
In fact, Trinity began converting empty printing floors to office use in 1980. But since the printing plants still provided a fine cash flow for the buildings, Trinity felt little pressure to rush the process. And then the stock market collapsed in 1987, dragging the city's printing industry -- which, along with publishing, still made up about 80 percent of Trinity's tenancy -- down with it. In 1987, Trinity's buildings were almost full; by 1992 occupancy was down to 72 percent.
Increasingly, printing seemed a precarious basket to hold Trinity's financial nest egg. So the church decided to accelerate the conversion to offices.
"WE walked through Midtown South, looked at what they'd done with the old buildings, and said, 'Gosh, we can do this here,' " Mr. Spardel said.
Fortunately for Trinity, it had a small but elite tenant base to build on. In 1985, Saatchi & Saatchi Compton Worldwide, a huge London advertising agency, agreed to locate its New York office at 375 Hudson Street, a building at Houston Street that Tishman Speyer was erecting on Trinity land. In the ensuing three years, Della Femina, Travisano & Partners; Ephron, Raboy, Tsao & Kurnit; Cadwell Davis Partners, and several other ad agencies left midtown for Trinity-owned buildings like 345 and 350 Hudson and 100 Avenue of the Americas, all within a block or so of Saatchi's new home.
Today, Trinity has converted nearly two-thirds of its portfolio to offices. It has inspired other local landlords to do so as well.
"We converted to offices only after Trinity pioneered it," said Barry Gosin, a co-owner of 200 Varick Street, near West Houston, who says his building is fully rented. "They could take the chance first, because they don't borrow money. They can live with a 30-year or 40-year payback."
The payback will probably be quicker than that. Occupancy is back up to 80 percent, and Mr. Palombi expects it will be 85 percent by year end. He expects rents, which now still hover in the low teens, to go as high as $20 a square foot soon.
For now, Trinity is focusing on attracting advertising, entertainment and publishing companies, "that whole group of companies that really doesn't need stainless steel buildings and a Park Avenue address," Mr. Palombi said. And it is focusing on renting space it owns.
But those strategies are not set in stone. Five years ago Trinity happily let the developer Edward J. Minskoff build 101 Avenue of the Americas, on a parcel of Trinity land near Grand Street, as the headquarters of Local 32B-32J, the union of building-service employees. It came close to marketing 225 Varick Street, near West Houston, as a biotechnology center, then scuttled its plans when it realized that biotech companies need to be closer to research hospitals.
Nor is Trinity slamming the door on new construction. Mr. Spardel talks about building on the lot behind 345 Hudson Street, breaking through the walls, and creating 75,000-square-foot floors that could accommodate television studios. He even talks about building Trinity's first from-scratch project, on a parcel of land bounded by Varick, Canal, Grand and Sullivan Streets.
"We've already gotten the permits, we have lots of pretty pictures, we even have an offshore tenant in mind," said Mr. Spardel, who noted that the project was conceived before the recession made new construction unthinkable. "When the economy is finally right for this, we're ready to go for it."
IF word of mouth can help, Trinity may get some nice aid from past and former tenants, and even from some brokers. Some complain that negotiating with Trinity can be an excruciatingly slow process, because the real estate people do have to get approval for many things from the church leaders. But most also say that the church strikes fair deals, and that it sticks to the spirit as well as the letter of its contracts.
"They delivered a new lobby and everything else they said they would do to upgrade this building," said Ronald Fierman, chief financial officer of Warwick, Baker & Fiore, an advertising agency that signed on at 100 Avenue of the Americas when it was still being converted for office use.
"They are like any institutional landlord, you bring them a credit-worthy tenant and they'll respond to its needs," said James P. Quinn, an associate director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Even tenants Trinity has dislocated in its office-conversion process harbor little bitterness against the church. RPM Graphics had been at 100 Avenue of the Americas for several decades, and certainly intended to keep renewing its lease. The last time, about five years ago, Trinity refused.
"It cost us at least $1.5 million in renovations and such to move," said Robert Mastelone, RPM's owner. Mr. Mastelone remained loyal nonetheless. He has moved to 75 Varick Street, another Trinity building near Watts Street.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Agents Say That in Prime Areas, It's Like Early 1989;
For Large Co-ops, Prices Are Soaring

 BODY:
Bidding wars? Soaring prices? In Manhattan real estate?
No, this is not the mid- to late 1980's, but the city's top brokers all say it feels like it is, at least for apartments with more than eight rooms in blue-chip locations. 
 "People are paying top dollar -- to me, it feels like early 1989," said Will Hunt, co-owner of Hunt-Kennedy Real Estate. "Some poor guy just got outbid for the second time, and his agent is scrambling over the Upper East Side to find him another apartment."
According to statistics released last week by the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan real estate agency, there were 21 four-bedroom apartments for sale on Central Park West in December 1994; by mid-March, there were four left. On Park Avenue, there were 76 four-bedroom apartments available in December; now there are 34.
"Bidding wars are going on all the time," said Diane Ramirez, sales director of the Halstead Property Company. "We've had a couple of dozen already this year that sold over the asking price."
As an example, one broker told of a 12-room prewar apartment at Park Avenue and 77th Street that sold in May 1991 for $1.75 million. After $500,000 was spent to fix it up, the same apartment sold this year for $4.2 million.
It was on the market for less than 30 days. Other apartments sell even more quickly.
To find these scarce apartments, agents mail brochures to residents of posh buildings and call every friend-of-a-friend who might be selling. According to Ms. Ramirez, the apartments are bought by families that are planning to grow and by people with money who want to move to their "final" apartment before the interest rates, and the prices, go so high the big apartments are no longer a good investment.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY & CO.;
With Dreams of Croissants and Nova, South Orange Takes On the Malls

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

DATELINE: SOUTH ORANGE

 BODY:
Like other small towns across the nation, South Orange has been fighting a losing battle against shopping malls. Since the 1970's, when two malls were built nearby, business failures have turned the village's central business district into a checkerboard of shuttered storefronts.
But South Orange is fighting back with an offbeat approach to redevelopment. Anticipating a new commuter rail link that will open in 1996, and taking advantage of a 1992 state law giving greater clout to municipalities that want to finance their own urban renewal, it has begun what village officials hope will be a complete makeover. 
 "We understand that we will never compete with the malls for large stores," said Barbara Sacks, the South Orange village administrator. "What we can attract is the kind of small service businesses that you don't find in the malls."
That is the strategy behind the first phase of the village's plan. South Orange has raised $500,000 in low-interest financing for a developer to renovate its biggest commercial eyesore, a row of six blighted and mostly vacant stores on South Orange Avenue, directly under an elevated New Jersey Transit railroad station.
"The thing that makes this work, and could make things happen elsewhere in New Jersey, is that the village is using its own good credit to support redevelopment," said Cary Heller, the developer.
To be sure, the partnership between Mr. Heller and South Orange has not been without strife. The project was delayed for more than a month early this year, and nearly abandoned, when the village's Planning Board insisted that the developer seek several small tenants to provide a variety of services, and he refused to rule out the possibility of having only one tenant.
But that was resolved in late February, when Mr. Heller agreed to seek at least three tenants. Now, he says he is trying to lure a gourmet food store, a printing shop, a diner, a bakery and other small stores, and expects the first, the bakery, to move in by the end of June.
South Orange, meanwhile, has bigger plans. In January, the village trustees approved a blueprint for the blocks surrounding the train station, including a hotel, 220 new town house-style homes, a garage and a movie theater.
The cost, according to village officials, is projected at $57 million, all of it dependent on private investment at a time when the New Jersey economy remains weak.
But there are reasons the plan could work.
"This is a village with unusual advantages," said Patrick Henry, a partner in the Atlantic Group, an urban development consulting firm that has been advising South Orange. "There is reason to be enthusiastic that this will come together."
Although there is no single culprit in the decline of South Orange's business district, shopping mall culture has taken a huge toll. The Livingston Mall and the Short Hills Mall, both less than 20 miles from the village, have been luring shoppers for two decades, gradually pushing a furniture store, a shoe store, an art supply store and other retailers out of business.
But the village, with 16,000 residents, remains affluent. The median household income is over $65,000, according to the State Labor Department. Seton Hall University provides a tantalizing market for retailers, and many residents commute to high-paying jobs in Manhattan.
The village's link to Manhattan is about to become more convenient. New Jersey Transit is expected to begin operating the Kearny Connection, a rail line from Penn Station that will make its first westward stop in South Orange, next March. The new line will eliminate the need to make a connection in Hoboken, and could bring hundreds of additional commuters through town.
That prospect was what attracted Mr. Heller to the stores under the South Orange train station. Late last year, he formed a development concern called Lokko Motive Inc., and bought out the lease. To finance the deal, he persuaded South Orange to take advantage of the New Jersey Redevelopment Act, which lets villages underwrite development in a way used more commonly by states, by selling tax-free municipal bonds to extend low-interest loans.
With a $500,000 loan from the village, and with the new train service being readied over his stores, "my project makes sense even if none of the rest of the plan happens," Mr. Heller said. But Mrs. Sacks said the village was aggresively promoting its larger redevelopment scheme, with the new train link as its cornerstone. She said village officials had begun talks with New Jersey Transit to construct a parking garage near the station.

HEADLINE: New Jersey, Dateline America

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
OLD-TIMERS in New Jersey like to tell the story of the former Newark mayor who used to say that wherever American cities were going, Newark would surely get there first. These days, though, as the millennium looms, that principle may apply best to New Jersey's place in the nation. Wherever America is heading, New Jersey appears to be on the cutting edge.
People in New Jersey may have known all along that the jokes missed the point (that the mosquito was not, in fact, the state bird). But the truth is getting harder for everyone else to deny: New Jersey has become the nation's laboratory -- the field station where political and social solutions are tested, a barometer for our psychic weather, a prototype-in-progress for what America may become. 
 The anti-tax movement took the Democrats hostage here in the early 1990's. Welfare reform sailed through. Now New Jersey is the stage on which the national Republican Party intends to prove that its program works. Governor Whitman is a national celebrity, patron saint of moderate Republicans. The Mayor of Jersey City, Bret Schundler, is a G.O.P. poster boy, dreaming about devolution and school vouchers just off Manhattan's western shore.
From health care to telecommunications, New Jersey is busy sloughing regulatory skin, unleashing its hospitals to duke it out in a Darwinian free market, its phone companies to blast into the fiber-optic future.
Out of the embers of its industrial past, New Jersey has risen to become something of a Southern California of the Right Coast -- the prototypical post-industrial, service-oriented state, its work force among the highest-earning and most highly educated in the nation.
The Garden State is now truly the Suburb State, redefining the country's future on its exurban frontier, where deer haunt the corporate campuses and urban escapees find peace on three-acre lots. New Jersey may be the most densely populated state in the nation, but only 10 percent of its people now live in its largest cities, decaying urban dinosaurs punished for their obsolescence.
And out beyond the pockmarked stretches of Route 22, the aging strip malls, lube shops and suburban blight, planners are plotting a new life not in villages or hamlets but in gleaming "activity centers" and "smoke-free shopping environments."
These days, Michael Aaron Rockland, a Rutgers University professor who teaches a course in Jerseyana, finds himself called upon to ponder the once unimaginable question: What ever happened to the Jersey joke?
"Rather than being, as we used to say around here, the armpit of the universe, New Jersey is, well, you pick the body part," Professor Rockland observed, not without a trace of regret.
If the jokes ever bothered people in New Jersey, all is forgotten. Or at least almost all.
"Nobody's laughing at New Jersey anymore," Governor Whitman crowed earlier this year (suggesting, perhaps inadvertently, that at least a smidgen of the state's civic inferiority complex had survived the boom). And, that smidgen notwithstanding, a new poll by The New York Times finds New Jerseyans strikingly content.
Nearly three out of four say they believe that their state and town are excellent or good places to live. And 60 percent predict that their community will be as good or better in 10 or 15 years. Traveling out of state, they declare their home turf proudly. Six in 10 say crime is not a problem where they live.
In interviews, many praised the state for its humble virtues: cleanliness, friendliness, safety, a temperate climate. The highways are well maintained, they said, and New Jersey is always close to somewhere else.
"Kearny has just about everything -- a decent shopping center, movies, nice parks," said Joan Rodrigues, 44, who teaches fifth grade in the Hudson County town. "We're near the entrance to just about every major road."
Most were less enamored of the condition of their public schools (52 percent rated them fair or poor) and of local property taxes (53 percent considered them too high). In their political affiliations, 31 percent considered themselves independents, roughly echoing a national Times poll taken last month.
Many New Jerseyans seemed tickled by their Governor's rising star. "New Jersey's image has got to be real positive with what our new Governor is doing," said John F. Zelesnik, a retired gas station owner and registered Democrat from Woodbridge.
As for New York City, few New Jerseyans seem to feel that they live in its shadow. The fact is they simply don't think about it much. New York is at best a convenience -- a place to visit, but not a place to work or live. (Indeed only 8 percent of those who were employed said they worked outside New Jersey.)
Dr. Joel R. L. Ehrenkranz, a 43-year-old endocrinologist and scientific director of a burgeoning biotech company in Morristown, is convinced that he and his company are about as well situated as they could possibly be.
Dr. Ehrenkranz was a physician in private practice who happened to find a way of measuring body temperature through urine. Suddenly, in the late 1980's, his gizmo was in demand -- and he knew nothing about engineering or business. But he was in New Jersey. So he found researchers at Rutgers to help him set up a manufacturing line, and innumerable veterans of New Jersey's vast pharmaceutical industry to help him build a business and expand.
Now, his company, Franklin Diagnostics Inc., cranks out millions of dollars' worth of ovulation-predictor kits, pregnancy tests and more, and, according to Dr. Ehrenkranz, regularly turns down invitations to move out of state.
"All the resources that we need -- patent, financing, regulatory, manufacturing, quality control -- are in area code 201 or 908," he said.
What's more, Dr. Ehrenkranz gets to ride his bicycle 10 miles to work. Bluebirds nest in his yard. He lives within walking distance of two national parks -- and 22 minutes from Newark International Airport when he needs to fly around the world.
The Rush to Suburbanize
In many ways, of course, New Jersey has always been ahead of the curve. Its cities industrialized early and deteriorated first. Manufacturing jobs evaporated early, but a high-tech, information-based service economy took root.
Because of its population density, the state tackled many problems first. It is now a leader in environmental regulation and planning. Its turnpike antedated the Interstate system. It had to: traffic was choking the state.
But what it also did first, and furiously, was suburbanize. For more than a century, it has been chopping countryside into towns, laying communities like industrial carpet from the Delaware River to the George Washington Bridge.
Deep into the 1980's, New Jersey boomed. Fifty-six thousand new housing units went up in 1986 alone. In places like Somerset County, the state's "edge cities" have proved precursors of others now sprouting nationwide.
New Jersey's older cities, meanwhile, were left to waste away. One of the richest states, it houses some of the country's poorest cities.
In Newark, Msgr. William J. Linder has watched the population dwindle from 440,000 to 275,000 since he was assigned to his first parish in 1960. As jobs fled, people were left behind with no way to follow. Now the community-development corporation that he runs, New Community Corporation, operates 3,000 units of housing, a nursing home, seven day-care centers and the first new shopping center in the Central Ward in 30 years.
"We train people for jobs that don't exist," he said sadly. "It's the most pitiful situation in the world." He described Newark as "probably one of the worst cases of abandonment of a city."
Some argue that the reasons were as much racial as economic.
"White folks walked away from the cities," said Mark Fury, the 37-year-old Mayor of Plainfield. His city, he said, was 80 percent white and Republican when he was growing up; now it is 65 percent black and 10 percent Hispanic, and is controlled by the Democrats.
"What happened in Plainfield happened in Newark, Trenton, Camden," Mayor Fury said. "While we like to cast it politely in terms of what happened to the cities, the reality is white people walked away from black people because they were afraid."
In the end, power and money shifted firmly to the suburbs -- just as they are doing, more gradually, nationwide. And that shift underlies the anti-tax and anti-government mood that carried in a Republican Legislature and Ms. Whitman.
Why it happened first in New Jersey is partly a quirk of the electoral calendar: New Jersey holds off-year elections. So Republicans wrested control of New Jersey in 1993. A year later, much of the country followed.
But New Jersey's voters are also in many ways the quintessential suburban voters, according to political analysts. They are fiscally, but not socially, conservative; many are baby boomers, feeling economically pinched.
Their party loyalty is weak. And polling shows they tend to know less about their candidates than voters elsewhere, in part because most of their television news comes from out-of-state stations that neglect New Jersey news.
"We're not a bad barometer," said Cliff Zukin, who did polling in New Jersey for many years. "We've got a larger floating middle which can react more quickly to any passions of the moment."
Take Jeanette Kohler, an account manager from Montclair. She had always voted Democratic. But she found herself shifting her allegiance and voting for Mrs. Whitman, for reasons she admits she cannot fully explain.
Now Ms. Kohler, who says she was "never political," is president of a newly formed citizens' group in Montclair dedicated to stopping the town's property taxes from rising any further.
"Whitman seemed to be more in touch with the present and the future," Ms. Kohler said. "I can't even think what it was. I felt New Jersey needed some new blood in that position. I felt she was a forward-thinking politician."
Mrs. Whitman emerged from that election and her tax-cutting first year in office as a model for Republican gubernatorial candidates throughout the Northeast (though in recent days predictions of a large revenue shortfall has given the Democrats new ammunition). And the state has emerged as a kind of laboratory for Republican ideas.
In Jersey City, Mr. Schundler is ensconced as the first Republican elected Mayor since 1917, elected by 69 percent of the vote in a city where a tiny fraction of the voters are registered Republicans.
At age 36, he has become a darling of Speaker Newt Gingrich. Party leaders hold him up as a harbinger of a new generation of Republican politicians with inner-city appeal. In his wood-paneled office in City Hall, he sits in suspenders and shirt sleeves, a computer purring at his side, as he beats the drum for devolving power to municipalities and for regulatory revolution.
"My own proposal would be to take a machete to the regulations," he said, sketching schemes to use welfare money for "neighborhood improvement districts" and school vouchers.
The Republican-controlled Legislature, meanwhile, has begun dismantling one of the country's more elaborate systems of hospital regulation in an attempt to subject the state's hospitals to what it hopes will be healthy competition. As a result, hospitals across the state are engaged in a frenzy of affiliating and "networking," scrambling to survive by lowering costs and being able to compete for contracts with insurers.
Inner-city hospitals, however, are feeling left out. Cathedral Health Care Systems, which runs hospitals in Newark and Orange, says it is facing a loss of $33 million in uncompensated care for the poor as a result of deregulation.
"How are we going to insure that those safety-net institutions that take care of the poor and underserved are still going to be there?" wondered Frank Fumai, the president and chief executive officer of Cathedral.
Worries on the Edge
 Other questions loom in the new cutting-edge state.
Suburban living, as it turns out, comes at a high social cost. New Jersey residents spend more time than ever in their cars. Traffic is frequently jammed, even though the state tops all others in road miles per square mile.
Farmland is dwindling. The air is polluted. People fear that the state's water supply will be the next to go if suburbia continues its relentless march outward, leapfrogging its way toward the New Jersey Highlands.
"We're like early pastoral people," said Richard C. Leone of Princeton, the former New Jersey Treasurer and former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "We slash and burn and move on."
Others worry that the state's new centers lack a sense of community, that it is impossible to go on foot from office park to mall, that edge cities will never be places to, say, hold a parade on the Fourth of July.
Meanwhile, property taxes climb relentlessly upward in support of services that people have grown to expect, and towns find themselves lured into the game of "ratable chase" -- the competition for big property-tax generators -- just to pay their bills.
At the same time, city living strikes many as no option.
Barbara L. Lawrence made a conscious decision to leave the suburbs for a city, moving from Plainsboro in search of "a real community." She found it on a narrow Hoboken street where butcher shops bookend row-house blocks.
But she and her husband pay for it. Their property taxes come to nearly $8,000 for an 1,800-square-foot house on a 14-by-100-foot lot. And they avoid the public schools by sending their son to private school, 25 minutes away.
"We've allowed our cities to deteriorate to such a point where they are no longer an alternative," said Ms. Lawrence, in the kitchen of her 100-year-old house. "I don't think people are wrong. They are making absolutely rational choices."
As a result, Ms. Lawrence now works as executive director of New Jersey Future, a group that works to implement New Jersey's land-use plan, which was intended to avoid further sprawl by concentrating growth in certain areas.
But even state officials admit the plan has "gums, not teeth." And there are many who prefer it that way, convinced planners are trying to dictate a life style that people reject.
"You cannot straitjacket society," said Patrick J. O'Keefe, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Builders Association. "Planning should be steeped in the reality of contemporary life."
For the time being, that reality in New Jersey includes the impulse to go ever West, to build a house on a three-acre lot, to glimpse wild turkey at the bird feeder and a coyote crossing the next field.
Ned Ward tells a story about building his first house. He chose a steep, rock-strewn site in New Vernon. He bought brick from Bayonne. When the truck pulled up, the driver got out and said, "Christ, who'd want to live here?"
"And I thought, 'My God, isn't this wonderful?' " recalled Mr. Ward, a real-estate agent in New Vernon. "We all think we have a little piece of paradise where we live. And I think it's wonderful that we all don't like vanilla."
Now Mr. Ward sells his version of paradise to bank presidents pursuing privacy. And Morris County is no longer what it was when Mr. Ward was growing up there, trapping mink and muskrat and shooting pheasant with a BB gun.
Does it worry him, what is happening to his slice of New Jersey?
"Compared to the way it was in 1945? Yup," he said. "But I suspect it's quite rural compared to what it will be in 2025."
Cheerfully, he concluded: "The only thing that's constant is change."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY & CO.;
Megastores are Making Over the Highway Retailing Landscape

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Until last summer, shoppers looking for pet supplies along Route 10 in East Hanover had one choice: NJ Pets. It was a modest 1,500-square-foot store for all seasons, stocked with a limited selection of pet food, dog and cat toys, and a nail-clipping and bathing service.
But suddenly, there are five pet stores in a two-mile stretch. Hanover Pet Center opened last July about a quarter-mile from NJ Pets. Petland Discounts arrived in February in the shopping center next to Hanover. And Petco, an 18,000-square-foot megastore, opened a half-mile away in December. For shoppers who can wait until July, Pet Food Giant will unveil an 18,000-square-foot store half a mile down the road in Livingston. 
 Even NJ Pets has undergone a change, expanding into an 11,000-square-foot space last August.
The growth in size and numbers of those stores is a window into recent changes in retailing in New Jersey.
Along six major highways in the northern half of the state, retailers are moving in and getting bigger. "For Lease" signs in front of vacant stores have been replaced by signs that say "Opening Soon" on hangar-sized buildings.
Retail vacancies fell to 3.2 percent in 1995 from 5.3 percent the previous year, according to a recent survey conducted by R.J. Brunelli and and Company, a retail leasing firm in Old Bridge.
Many analysts agree that the retail sector has rebounded somewhat after several years of slugishness. But they point out that shoppers' appetite for bargains has favored the proliferation of "big boxes," giant stores of more than 15,000 square feet with no frills and discount prices.
"If someone were to survey the new space that's been built across the country, they'd probably find that over 75 percent is big-box centers as opposed to neighborhood centers, which would typically be anchored by a supermarket or a small-strip center," said Richard Brunelli, president of the Old Bridge firm.
Those big stores have long been a staple for shoppers in the West and the South. But for years, they were absent from New Jersey because of high rents and tight space.
Then came the economic recession of the late 1980's. Numerous retailers, including the McCrory's discount chain, Herman's sporting goods, and National Brands Outlet men's clothing, filed for bankruptcy and vacated thousands of square feet of retail space. Real estate prices slumped.
That paved the way for the giants.
On Route 10, Bradlees, Sports Authority, Office Max and Computer City have built stores in the last year. On Route 46 between West Paterson and Dover, Home Depot, BJ's Wholesale Club and Comp USA have appeared. And on Route 22 between Union and Somerville, Tops Appliance City, Sneaker Stadium, Staples and Pet Food Giant are the newest tenants.
This is good news for shoppers who like one-stop bargain shopping and don't miss the personal service that shops in small downtown areas often provide.
"Value is what I look for, whether it's service or price," said Diane Bowser of Morristown, who was reviewing Petco's selection of more than 50 kinds of fish food (including frozen) on a recent evening.
But some of the success of the big discounters comes at the expense of merchants in the middle -- stores in the 10,000-square-foot range that occupy strip malls or neighborhood shopping centers.
The owner of NJ Pets, the first of the pet stores on Route 10, has felt the squeeze. "Like any retailer, you're concerned when anyone opens up," said Tom Measday, who with his brother, Jim, opened the store in 1987. Now, "the consumer gets overloaded," he said. "I wouldn't be surprised if someone had to fold."
"Before, you had department stores, off-price stores, specialty stores, discount stores, and people operated within their own niches and there wasn't much crossover," said Gene Kosack, president and chief executive officer of NBO, the Fair Lawn-based store which is closing 21 of its 34 stores. "Today, you can take the walls down and just write down 'Price.' "
The trend toward bigger stores has not translated into new retail development, however. Instead, "it's the recycling of the properties that have been sitting vacant on the market for a while," said Milt Meyerson, retail director of Weichert Commercial Realtors in Morris Plains.
With the megastores occupying more storefronts, smaller merchants have had to adjust, with lower prices, more advertising, better-looking displays and improved service.
In Roseland, Rogers & Sheldon Inc.-Lumber Barn decided to open on Sundays, renovate its showroom, and offer "best everyday pricing" to compete with Home Depot. "They woke a lot of people up in our industry," said John Misko Jr., the company president.
In East Hanover, the Hanover Pet Center will drop its dog and cat supplies when Pet Food Giant opens this summer, and specialize instead in imported coral and exotic rodents like Chilean dwarf opossums and gerbils from Egypt. "The market is definitely finite, said Mark Gaglioti, a co-owner. "We're all vying for the same customers."

HEADLINE: JERSEY;
In Lincoln Park, the Symbolism of the Siren

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey 

 BODY:
IN TOWNS with volunteer fire departments, the cricket chirp of the electronic beeper has decisively replaced the primal howl of the municipal siren.
Yet in Lincoln Park, in the northeast corner of Morris County, those Cold War-vintage sirens came wailing back full force last week, even though all 60 of the town's volunteer firefighters carry beepers. 
 In recent years, the town's six sirens had fallen into disrepair. Occasionally , they went off on their own, triggered by a vagrant microwave from a cellular phone or garage-door opener.
"Some people have expressed extreme dismay," said the Mayor, David G. Baker Jr. On a couple of occasions, some people even shimmied up telephone poles to snip a wire or two to get some sleep.
The Mayor and some Council members inadvertently mobilized the 87-year-old Fire Department with comments at a recent Council meeting that were taken as anti-siren. "What we said was that we wouldn't have an objection to removing the fire sirens," the Mayor pointed out the other day.
Firefighters quickly doused the anti-siren talk. Last week, after hasty repairs, four of the six sirens were back in business, same as when the first siren was clamped on a downtown pole in 1923.
Why does a town with beepers need sirens?
"To signal school snow closings," said one firefighter.
"Floods," another explained.
"Civil defense," suggested a third.
Sirens, of course, are supposed to be loud and intrusive. In old industrial towns, sirens once had to compete with the factory whistles that shrieked out starting time, lunch time and quitting time. In more recent times, people raised in small towns recall their fathers sitting the family down at the table to review the fire-alarm codes: One siren blast is a brush fire. Two is more serious. Three is a big one. Short sustained toots at regular intervals? Why, that's nuclear war, kids. The Russians are coming!
In little towns on the commuter trade routes like Lincoln Park, 25 miles from New York City, cultural change accelerated in the 1980's.
"When I first came on the force in 1967," Police Chief Ken West recalled, "we would be sent out on calls not by street addresses but by people's names." Lincoln Park was then still a semi-rural town on seven square miles of flood plain beside the Pompton River. In the 80's, when the town's bucolic allure combined with its proximity to major highways to ignite a building boom, the population rose 25 percent, to nearly 11,000. Some of them became anti-siren people.
Mayor Baker, who likes to keep everybody as happy as economically possible, has staked out his ground on the issue.
"I'm in the dead middle now," he said. "In this job, I have enough people beating up on me as it is." The town's budget this year for the Fire Department is $75,000, of which the firefighters have set aside about $3,000 to keep the sirens working right. "It's their decision," said the Mayor.
Few departments now depend solely on sirens. Those that do retain sirens see them as a backup, and as a symbolic gesture to the firefighters themselves.
But symbolism goes only so far when money is tight, and towns that use sirens have had to make compromises. In Bergen County, Tenafly officials began hearing complaints about eight years ago from people who had moved into the big houses in East Hill, which was also the location of Tenafly's loudest siren. "They hollered, and the town had to move the siren to a secluded park," grumbled Harvey Eisner, chief of the Tenafly volunteer department. Tenafly now hits its sirens only between 7 A.M. and 7 P.M.
In Lincoln Park, one firefighter spoke the other day about how his young son's eyes widen when the siren goes off and Dad thunders out the door. Then he dug into his back pocket for his beeper, which he held in the palm of his hand as if it were a wet sponge. "This thing, you could leave it in the kitchen, you know?"
At the main firehouse, a small group of firefighters agreed that the sirens should always remain. "If your house goes up in flames, then that siren is music to your ears," one man said.
His colleagues nodded gravely. Then one of them recalled that a siren had gone off accidentally a few nights earlier. "I couldn't get back to sleep for an hour," he complained. His buddies glared him into silence.

HEADLINE: THE TRASHING OF PROFESSIONALISM

 BODY:
Much of Louis Menand's argument against term limits for political officeholders rests upon the notion of lack of transferability of skills from one profession to another ("The Trashing of Professionalism," March 5). Yet, the very idea of education is to transfer skills. Moreover, corporations frequently have programs to rotate workers from one position to another to cross-fertilize the organization with fresh ideas and to impart new skills to employees.
In an outstanding example of skills transferability, Adam Smith transformed himself from professor of moral philosophy to become the "father of economics"! Smith never seemed to believe in "disinterestedness" either; for he said, "it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the baker, or the candlestick maker that we get our daily bread, but rather from their greed." 
 Modern management theory recognizes the disadvantages as well as the advantages of division and specialization of labor. Today, even production workers frequently are found to be more efficient when they have responsibility for the finished product rather than one repetitive operation.
Making pins, with "18 distinctive tasks," is not the same as serving as a U.S. Senator.

AUTOS
It Ain't Broke, but Fix It
Chrysler's message to mini-van owners, apparently, is this: Your tailgate latches are not a safety hazard, but come in and we'll replace them -- free. Huh? Why not replace the perfectly good headlights while they're at it? You'd be excused for finding Chrysler's deal with regulators a bit convoluted, but it all comes down to that ugly word "recall." Even though 29 deaths have been linked to the latches' tendency to pop open in crashes, Chrysler didn't want this to be an official recall, and it got its way. A recall, you see, wouldn't look too great in some coming lawsuits. But how, asked one safety advocate, do you get van owners to come in if you're "telling them there is no hazard"? (Don't rush in, by the way -- it'll take months to build enough latches.)

BANKING
The Biggest Get Bigger
Nomination for understatement of the week: a merger with the Mitsubishi Bank would, in the words of the Bank of Tokyo's president, "make an interesting bank." Interesting, that is, as in huge. The merger of those Japanese banks will create, by far, the world's largest bank -- with $819 billion in assets, it will have more than three times the assets of the not exactly tiny Citicorp -- and 100 times the assets of Bill Gates. Will life change for the rest of the world? Not really. Japan's always had the bank giants, and those banks have been trimming overseas activities, and that's not expected to change. In California, though, Union Bank is 70 percent owned by Bank of Tokyo, and Bank of California is owned by Mitsubishi. No doubt either they'll be merged or one will be sold.

UPHEAVALS
Will the Flag's Colors Be Next?
Americans face a wrenching adjustment. No, it isn't the death of the New Deal, the fall of Communism. It's -- brace yourself -- the colors of M&M's, a constant for nearly half a century. M&M's were born in 1941, in six colors (brown, yellow, red, orange, green and violet). In 1949, tan replaced violet, and that mix outlasted Elvis, Liberace, even Nixon. But Mars Inc. concluded that people don't like tan and ran a poll to pick a new color. And last week it named the winner: blue (even with Communism dead, people weren't ready for pink; it got just a 10 percent vote). The new mix is due in September. In the meantime, save those tans; they'll be collectors' items (if they don't melt).

EXECUTIVE SUITE
Sex. $20 Million. Read On.
Odd as it may sound, this seems to have been W.R. Grace's message to J.P. Bolduc: You've been accused of sexual harassment, so you'd better resign as chief executive, and instead of a $15 million farewell handshake, let's make it $20 million. Yes, when Mr. Bolduc quit unexpectedly a month ago, the official version featured executive-suite boilerplate: "differences of style and philosophy." Plus that $5 million bonus. But last week it turned out that a former Federal judge advising the board had concluded that, though Mr. Bolduc was vehement in his denials, allegations of sexual harassment were on solid ground. Add to that the recent resignation of J. Peter Grace as chairman, and it's not exactly a smooth passing of the baton for a $5 billion company.

TELEPHONES
Whose Long-Distance Savings?
Americans must be as sick of hearing about long-distance deals as they are of that Los Angeles trial. But at least the O.J. lawyers, pro and con, don't call you or mass-mail you or ad-blitz you with the latest twist (well, not yet). The question now is whether AT&T, MCI et al. will now rush to tell you the latest news -- that the F.C.C. last week cut by $1 billion a year the access charges they must pay local phone companies, the biggest single cost cut since the Bell breakup. The access charge is a big part of a call's cost -- 4 cents a minute, on each end -- and long-distance companies have been lobbying hard to get them down. But watch carefully to see if those savings are passed along (or -- horrors! -- pay for even more aggressive marketing).

TRAVEL
Agents' Fees: Never Mind
It's the old story. Airlines get together and trumpet some historic change, but then, under market pressure, things slip right back where they were. A few years ago, American, with much huffing and puffing about simplified fares, swept away all the nonsense of having 97 different fares for the same route, and many other carriers piped up, "Me too." But there are no simple skies, and when that became clear, the notion collapsed. Then this February came a "revolution" in travel agents' fees: No more 10 percent commissions, the airlines said -- the top fee is $50 for a round-trip domestic ticket. But cracks are already appearing: Continental is offering agents a $50 "bonus payment" for some costly tickets, and Delta's offering incentives, too. Consumer tip: while this backtracking sorts itself out, don't let yourself get steered to a high-commission fare that's not the best deal.

INCOME TAXES
It's in the Form? So What?
Tax season wasn't already complicated enough, right? Tax forms, it seems, say the self-employed can deduct 25 percent of health-insurance costs. The trouble is, that deduction expired in 1993. But the I.R.S. put it in the form anyway, assuming it would be reinstated. Well, it hasn't -- yet. Why rush? April 17 is two weeks away. The House did vote it back in last week, but the Senate has still to act. If it affects you, better not file till the last minute. . . . Also, for $250-plus donations, you can now, if necessary, get the required receipt after filing.

MARKETS
Stocks Hit a Bad Bump
The stock market heard what it wanted to hear most of the week, and the Dow industrials bumped to a few more new highs. First the Fed met without raising interest rates. Then new-home sales fell 14 percent, to the lowest point in three years -- investors like things cooling off. But Friday morning the bubble burst, partly because of a report that fourth-quarter G.D.P. had grown at a 5.1 percent rate -- too hot for comfort. This was compounded by worries about the dollar -- it rose 2 percent on Thursday after Germany cut its interest rates, but traders wanted more. As a result, the Dow plunged 60 points in the opening minutes, though it later steadied to be off just 14 for the day.

INVESTING
Ready! Set! Lose Your Shirt!
Speaking of Barings -- O.K., nobody's spoken of Barings lately; that's why an update is in order. Nicholas Leeson, who has insisted that he was being a company man when his risky trading brought down Barings, is in a prison in Frankfurt -- that's where he was arrested, en route from Singapore -- as Singapore tries to extradite him on fraud charges. Back in London, though, a stiff upper lip has curled into a sly grin: The Independent is running a "Lose Your Bearings" contest. The goal: create an imaginary Asian stock portfolio, and see how much you can lose. Whoever loses the most by April 4 gets a vacation to Singapore -- with, yes, a stopover in Frankfurt (not, presumably, in handcuffs).

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS: FUNDS WATCH;
Litmus Test For Fund Managers

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
ADD one specific set of credentials to the long list of desirable qualities in a fund manager. That is C.F.A., or chartered financial analyst.
Stock fund managers with that designation have turned in superior performance, according to a study by Ravi Shukla and Sandeep Singh, assistant professors of finance at Syracuse University and the State University of New York at Brockport, respectively. 
 In an article in the Financial Analysts Journal, the academics said they examined the returns of 223 stock funds that kept the same managers from July 1988 through June 1993. After breaking the funds into two groups, they found that the funds run by chartered financial analysts had higher returns than the others. The difference was most pronounced among aggressive-growth funds.
To become a chartered financial analyst, money managers must pass three tests on securities, accounting and similar matters. Roughly half the people who take the tests pass the first two parts, and three-quarters pass the final one. There were 28,000 candidates this year, up from 7,100 in 1987. To find information about a manager's education and training, check the fund prospectus or call the fund company.
 
Getting Together
 The merger pace is picking up. The Twentieth Century group, whose speciality is stock funds, is acquiring Benham Management International, a group that specializes in bond funds and is based in Mountain View, Calif. The deal needs the approval of Benham's shareholders. The combined group would manage $37 billion in more than 50 funds, all sold without sales charges.
The Colonial Group, Boston, is merging with Liberty Financial Companies, also of Boston, which manages 22 funds, many under the Stein Roe name.
United Asset Management picked up tiny but powerful Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, which runs PBHG Growth and PBHG Emerging Growth.
 
Breather for Bonds?
 With the dollar dipping to new lows practically every day, should bond buyers worry? Though the dollar is not necessarily healthy for the long term, the worries about its condition are overblown, said William H. Gross, an expert on fixed-income investing with the Pimco family of funds. Because Americans don't save enough, he said, the country relies on the savings of strangers, meaning long-term problems. But the Federal Reserve will probably sit tight for some time rather than raise interest rates further. "It's the perfect circumstance for a money manager who believes that bonds won't go up much, won't go down much, but will earn an attractive coupon along the way," he said.
 
Change at Fidelity
 Jeffrey Ubben resigned as manager of the $4 billion Fidelity Value fund to join Richard C. Blum & Associates, an investment firm in San Francisco. His successor is Bettina Doulton, manager of Fidelity's Advisor Equity-Income and VIP Equity-Income funds.
 
Tax Help
 Just in time for tax season, Scudder Funds has published a new version of its booklet, "Tax Issues for Mutual Fund Investors." Call 800 225-2470, extension 8444, for a free copy. "Tax Do's and Don'ts for Mutual Fund Investors" is available without charge from the Investment Company Institute at 1401 H Street N.W., Suite 1200, Washington, D.C. 20005.
 
New Funds
 Warburg Pincus Japan OTC is a way to bet on small Japanese stocks and comes from the people who brought you the top-performing Warburg Pincus International fund.
Small stocks in the United States are the province of Stein Roe Special Venture.
Price Capital Opportunity aims for capital growth and has great flexibility to buy growth and value stocks and big and small stocks, but the portfolio will be concentrated in a small number of issues, meaning greater risk.
Matthews International Capital Management, San Francisco, has started Matthews Korea, the first mutual fund here to invest heavily in South Korea.
 
In Brief
 To attract new shareholders, Investment Advisers Inc. has reduced the initial purchase requirement for its IAI funds to $1,000 from the usual $5,000 through mid-April.
T. Rowe Price Adjustable-Rate U.S. Government, never a stellar performer, moved to another investment category on March 31, when it changed its name to Short-Term U.S. Government.

HEADLINE: Goldilocks Settles In, but Will Bears Be Back?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THIS bull market has left some investors ecstatic, and many unhappy. The bears scornfully call it the "Goldilocks market," their way of sneering at the conventional wisdom that the economy will grow just right -- not too fast, setting off inflation, and not too slow, damaging corporate profits. But the cash keeps pouring in, and prices keep rising.
This year's rise, after a lackluster 1994, is a continuation of the bull market that began in 1990, as that year's recession was ending, and can be dated as far back as 1975. It has been fueled by factors as immediate as rapidly rising profits and as long-term as the baby boom generation's growing concern with retirement. 
 The strong profit growth for many companies has depressed their need for new capital and thus served to depress the volume of new stock issues sold. Far more money is pouring into the stock market than can be absorbed by the new issues.
And long-term interest rates, after rising sharply for much of last year, have declined, making stocks more competitive with fixed-income investments. At the peak in early November, shortly before the last time the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, 30-year Treasury bonds yielded 8.16 percent. Now they yield 7.43 percent.
Now, for money managers and individual investors who missed the sudden spurt in the major market averages, the question is whether to leap in or wait for a drop. And for those who decide to buy, the big issue is whether to chase the winners -- most especially the semiconductor stocks that have zoomed and boomed, although they stumbled late last week -- or to search among the many laggards, hoping to find bargains.
Stocks of companies with large foreign businesses -- which may see reported profits rise because the dollar has fallen so much against the Japanese yen and most European currencies -- also have done well.
Stocks of economically sensitive industries like automobiles, steel and industrial equipment -- the cyclicals in Wall Street parlance -- have done the worst in this year's rally. Morgan Stanley's index of cyclical stocks has risen, but it remains 4 percent below its peak of early 1994, before the market began to be worried about a possible economic slowing brought on by higher interest rates.
Since Thanksgiving, when the market hit its recent low, 29 of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average have risen, and the average is up 13 percent. The only loser in the bunch is Bethlehem Steel, but other laggards include Alcoa and Caterpillar, as well as big oil companies.
"The big surprise" of the stock market in coming months "may be that these economically sensitive stocks come alive," said Byron Wien, the chief United States strategist at Morgan Stanley. Caterpillar had been down for 1995 until last week, when Morgan Stanley put out a strong buy recommendation.
In fact, it is possible that last week marked a turnaround within the stock market. For a couple of days at the end of the week, it was the time for the biblical injunction "the last shall be first" to come true. Both technology stocks and international companies weakened, while the cyclicals showed strength and interest rates rose. Then on Friday, a report of strong growth at the end of last year scared some investors and put the stock market on a roller coaster ride that left it a bit lower.
Even with that dip, the Standard & Poor's 500, the general standard of comparison for American institutional investors, rose 9 percent in the quarter, its best showing since the first quarter of 1991. But it appears that well over two-thirds of money managers fared worse than the S.& P. In part, that reflects holdings in small stocks and foreign stocks, both of which have lagged. For a money manager, it is embarrassing to lag the S.& P., so there is less joy on Wall Street than might be expected. "You have managers way behind," said David Shulman, Salomon Brothers chief strategist, who has been bearish.
That has not been a problem for those betting on technology. The success of those stocks -- particularly the companies that make semiconductors or computer software -- has set off an amazing boom in initial public offerings. When a company decides to go public, it gives a range of prices at which it wants to sell shares. These days, tech stocks almost always raise that price before they go public, but even so the demand sends the prices up sharply after trading began. Last week brought Datastream Systems, a software company that wanted to sell stock for $11 to $13 a share, got $15, and saw the shares immediately leap to $21 in public trading.
Perhaps the most amazing performance of a stock index came from the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's index of 16 semiconductor makers. From Oct. 4 through Tuesday, the index was up 55 percent, with most of that gain coming in the last two months. But it then fell 6 percent by week's end, in what bulls called a momentary pause.
The argument for such stocks has been that the computer boom, and the ever wider use of semiconductors in other products, has made their manufacturers the growth stocks of tomorrow. And that has been aided by the rise of what is politely called "momentum investing," which means buy what goes up and sell what goes down.
MUTUAL funds have climbed on board, to the extent that many diversified funds have a third of their assets in technology stocks. It is not uncommon to see Fidelity funds with 15 percent or more of a tech company's stock. If -- the bears would say when -- such institutions turn negative, the falls could be precipitous.
Most Wall Street wisdom holds that the end is not near. Intel, the premier company in semiconductors, "is still selling at nine times estimated earnings," argues Charles Clough, the chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch, adding that the expansion of capacity in semiconductors -- typically a warning sign -- has been restrained. "I think the semicondictors still have a long way to go," he said.
All that seems absurd to money managers like William Fleckenstein of Olympic Capital Management in Seattle, which has bet against technology stocks by selling them short, and has lost money. "People forget that the technology business is one of the worst businesses you can be in," he said. "Every day, you are trying to obsolete the competition and yourself. There are very few Microsofts and Hewlett-Packards."
A few years ago, that was the conventional wisdom and many such stocks were very cheap. But it has been more than three years since technology stocks began outperforming the market. Since the end of 1991 the Standard & Poors 500 is up about one-third. The semiconductor stocks in the index have more than tripled during the same period.
It is a reasonable bet that such stocks will continue to be more volatile than the market as a whole, but most of them are by no means cheap. So it may be safer to buy stocks that have lagged. Auto stocks and many transportation companies -- rails and trucks -- have done poorly in large part because of concerns that the economy is slowing. If those concerns turn into recession fears, the whole stock market could be risky. But if instead it begins to appear that growth will continue at an acceptable level for a couple of years, those stocks could benefit.
By many traditional standards, stocks are not cheap. The dividend yield on the Standard & Poor's 500 -- the amount you would earn if you bought all 500 stocks and held them for a year during which none of the companies raised or lowered its dividend -- is 2.7 percent. That does not, of course, include any capital gains (or losses). Historically, that is near the low end of the range, but the yield has been low for three years now, with no great disaster, and few now seem to be worried.
A MAJOR reason for the flow of money into stocks -- and one that does not seem likely to reverse -- has been the growing concern about retirement of the baby boom generation. The notion that stocks are the best long-term investment -- now being pushed in television ads by Nasdaq -- is widely accepted in a way that would have seemed impossible 20 years ago, when stocks were cheap by almost all measures. (The dividend yield then was 5.5 percent.)
That has brought a flood of money from Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) plans coursing into stock mutual funds. In 1994, a year when most stocks made no progress as interest rates leaped, investors still put $75.6 billion into funds that invested primarily in American stocks. As recently as 1983, the total assets of such funds were less than that amount. In the first two months of this year, the flow of money into stock funds increased from the 1994 pace.
Moreover, while many companies needed cash coming out of the 1990 recession, that is no longer the case. Corporate profits, Mr. Clough of Merrill Lynch says, are running strong enough to finance capital needs internally. He points to Federal Reserve Board figures showing that in 1994 companies sold $57.2 billion of stock to investors. But during the year corporate America bought -- via share repurchases and takeovers -- $159.2 billion of shares. That left fewer shares for all that mutual fund money to chase.
"That leads me to the most absurd prediction I have ever made," Mr. Clough said last week. "We are going to see a shortage of financial assets." And that means stock prices will keep being bid up.
As Mr. Clough knows, such an idea seems unreasonable to many old Wall Streeters, who believe that while a shortage of some industrial component or mineral may be possible, it is hard to believe that printing presses will not churn out enough share certificates. But it is still a widely held idea.
"Our investment bankers are scurrying around the country trying to get business," said Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley. "But companies don't need the money."
There is an old joke about bankers, to the effect that they will lend you all the money you can prove you don't need, but there is something of that in the current stock market. One group of stocks that seem to hold little attraction are those of companies trying to go public after leveraged buyouts. Such companies need the money to pay down debt, but even in this market there has been no rush to pay money for them.
Among the ex-buyout companies going public this year have been Fort Howard, the toilet paper giant; American Standard, the bathroom fixtures company, and Uniroyal Chemical. All had to sell shares at less than they originally sought.
PERHAPS the most interesting determinant of where the market will go from here is the dollar, which has fallen this year to new lows against the Japanese yen and the German mark, even while soaring against the Mexican peso. Indeed, a Japanese or German investor would wonder what bull market this article is talking about. In their currencies, American stocks cost a little less than they did at the end of 1994. (But their own markets have done even worse.)
A bearish argument on the dollar holds that Japanese investors, who have been burned by currency losses, will choose to get out of American assets. But for now, the scenario more widely believed on Wall Street is that a wave of foreign takeovers are likely because American stocks seem cheap to those with strong currencies.
In any case, it appears that Wall Street's stretch of historically very low volatility may be coming to an end. In 1992, 1993 and 1994 the range between the annual high and low of the S.& P. 500 was 11.9 percent, 9.8 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively. The average volatility for the index since 1945 is 25 percent in any given year, and only twice in the 12 years before 1992 was volatility less than 20 percent.
So far this year, the spread between high and low for the index has been 9.8 percent, exactly what it was for the last two full years, and there are still nine more months to go.
If volatility is back, it will mean that there are greater chances to get rich -- or poor -- by playing stocks. This is likely to be a year with plenty of excitement. And, at least for now, most of Wall Street thinks there will be more joy than sorrow to be had from that excitement.

Ending the Dollar's Disastrous Decade

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Growth is great for a company, but it helps to know what produced the growth. And now, at the end of a disastrous decade for the dollar, it is more important than ever for owners of some Wall Street darlings.
Take a couple of the great stocks of the last decade. Coca-Cola saw its earnings per share rise at a compounded annual rate of 17 percent a year. Johnson & Johnson had an increase of 16 percent. The gains brought ample rewards for shareholders. 
 Most of that growth has come in foreign markets. And while there is no way to quantify it exactly, it is clear that the declining dollar has been responsible for some of the good news. If your Japanese subsidiary earned 10 billion yen in 1985, you could tell your shareholders about a profit of almost $40 million. Ten years later, if yen profits have remained constant, you can brag about earning $115 million. That looks like a compound annual growth rate of 11 percent for your Japanese subsidiary. Things are even better if your subsidiary actually grew.
A decade ago the dollar was ridiculously expensive by almost any measure, a situation that was great for American tourists and horrible for American exporters. Now the situation is reversed.
To be sure, it appears that traders despise the dollar more than almost anything, save the Mexican peso, and think it will keep falling. The dollar lost more than 10 percent of its value against both the mark and the yen in the quarter just ended. Not since the last three months of 1987, when the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates after the stock market crash, has the greenback had a worse quarter.
But even if this is not the bottom -- and the bet here is that we are close to it -- it is safe to say that the dollar will do a lot better in the next 10 years than it did in the last decade.
What does that portend for American multinationals? It means reported growth is likely to slow, even if the business keeps doing just as well as before. Consider a hypothetical company that reported a 15 percent annual growth in profits. In fact, real growth was about 12 percent, with the other 3 percent coming from dollar weakness. But share buyers here have given it credit for the faster growth pace. If the dollar starts to rise, that 12 percent growth rate could look like 10 percent, even if nothing has changed. And that could bother investors.
Notice that none of this has anything to do with the real underlying fundamentals of the business. J.& J. and Coke, the two companies named above, are representative of a lot of American companies, with quality products and international success. They have also been very successful in the stock market. If you had bought Coke a decade ago and reinvested the dividends, your compound annual return would have been 28 percent; for J.& J. the figure is 22 percent. Both are comfortably ahead of the 14.4 percent posted for the stock market as a whole, not to mention well above the companies' profit gains. Investors are willing to pay up for growth.
The implications of that analysis are directly contrary to the conventional Wall Street wisdom. That holds that the weak dollar is good news for multinationals. It is, to the extent that their exports are more competitive. And profits for this year will look better because of the dollar's plunge.
But the longer-term verdict may be that multinational growth stocks will stop looking so attractive. And that could lead to a contraction of price-earnings multiples for such companies, just as the decline of the dollar led to the expansion of multiples for much of the last decade.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CHINATOWN;
1,500 Dine, and Back Restaurant in Battle With Union

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
In a dramatic and unprecedented display of community solidarity against the independent union that has been trying to organize restaurant workers in Chinatown, 1,500 people packed the largest restaurant in the neighborhood Thursday night.
The event at the Jing Fong restaurant marked a rare moment of unity in politically fractious Chinatown. The participants banded together to show their opposition to Local 318 Independent Restaurant Workers Union, which represents waiters in two Chinese restaurants in Chinatown and Flushing, Queens, and has tried unsuccessfully to organize employees at Jing Fong. 
Participants, including business people, workers and community leaders from anti-Communist as well as pro-mainland factions, said they hoped to send a message to the union's adviser, Wing Lam, executive director of the Chinese Staff Workers Association, that his tactics are damaging the Chinatown economy by discouraging patronage of targeted restaurants. The union has staged mock funerals, complete with coffins, drums and dancers performing mourning dances outside Jing Fong since February.
Union advisers refused Friday to comment on the event.
During the emotionally charged evening, diners gave a 10-minute standing ovation to 140 headwaiters, waiters and kitchen workers, who marched around the restaurant.
Unions are a sensitive topic among Chinatown workers, who fear that they would lose financially under union contracts. Waiters, for example, say they fear losing salary and tips because owners would hire second shifts to avoid paying overtime. People at the dinner acknowledged that restaurant workers are often underpaid and overworked. But they said it is up to the government, not unions, to enforce labor laws.
"If there are labor problems in the restaurant, then let the government handle it," said George Hui, president of the influential Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, an umbrella organization representing more than 70 family, business and area associations in Chinatown. "There is no need for Mr. Lam to haul out the coffin and hurt the Chinatown economy."
For their part, restaurant owners accept much of the blame for the problems within their workforce, but they say competition and low profit margins make it difficult to pay benefits and higher wages. They concede they do not make enough effort to understand Federal labor practices.
Thursday's turnout came as a surprise to Yai Chi Chan, president of the Chinese Restaurant Association, who said he had originally planned the event as a fundraising dinner for his 500 members. But people from the community also wanted to come. "Soon, the whole restaurant was all booked up -- we had to turn people away,"he said.
The union had planned its own demonstration outside Jing Fong Thursday night but no one showed up. JANE H. LII

Baffling Trusses, Flying Buses or Fishy Buttresses

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
In a sense, there are only two ways to look at the Port Authority Bus Terminal's Ninth Avenue bus ramps. The first is to see what is there: rusty steel overpasses that cut a dark, ungainly line across Ninth Avenue just south of 42d Street.
The second is to see what could be there. And there lies a window on the peculiar stuff urban visionaries' dreams are made of. 
Last fall, the terminal's manager, Ken Philmus, approached Community Board 4, asking for ideas from the community about what to do with the ramps, built in 1950 with strictly utilitarian intent. Since the overpasses were due for rehabilitation work, he thought, why not see if long-standing community complaints about them could be solved, economically and inventively, at the same time?
The board formed the Triple Bridge Task Force -- 10-strong -- and broadcast a call for designs. Now, countless (pro bono) man-hours later, the task force is delightedly wading through more than 40 submissions, from high-tech computer-aided designs to utterly impractical, delightful drawings.
"We were ecstatic when we saw what was coming in," said Jo Ann Macy, the task force's chairwoman.
The designs tend to fall into certain categories. Some try to hide the overpasses, covering them with, say, giant baffles and video screens; some try to make the most of them, painting the segments defined by the trusswork in a welter of contrasting colors. Some incorporate elements of nature, growing walls of grass or raising a subterranean creek to form a waterside concourse. Some cover them with decorations, like a road map of New Jersey. A few use the ramps as a starting point to redesign the entire neighborhood.
The task force members hope to present a report on the submissions to the Port Authority this summer -- in time to piggyback some sort of redesign to the rehabilitation work, due to start in 1996.
In the meantime, the designs will be on view soon in store windows near the overpasses and in the Port Authority bus terminal. And an open meeting to solicit neighborhood reaction will be held at 7 P.M. April 11 at the Duke Ellington Room at Manhattan Plaza, 400 West 43d Street, where the whole megillah will be on display. ANDREA KANNAPELL

GRAPHIC: Photo: A panel collected ideas to change this.
 
Diagrams: "THE HIGH STEPPING PLAN"
 Outside staircases lead to small-scale market spaces carved out of the terminal's inhuman bulk.
 
"SALUTING JERSEY"
 The terminal is about motion, specifically, motion to New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. So a map of the destinations could ba applied to the overpasses.
 
"THE GRAND SOLUTION"
 Meant as homage to Washington Square Park and the Manhattan Bridge, the Triumphal Arch would be made of honeycombed panels, keeping it light and inexpensive.
 
"FISH AGAINST VIOLENCE"
 The idea is that an aquarium would cool the city's hot temper. "But the fish would die and the maintenance is pretty high," says Leni Schwendinger, a panel member.
 
"OUT OF SIGHT..."
 Mirrors applied to the overpass exteriors would angle up, reflecting the sky. "It's humorful," says Laura Briggs, an architecture professor on the task force.

HEADLINE: A Week to Be Fashionable by Association

BYLINE: By DAN SHAW 

 BODY:
AT the Alternative Fashion Week ball at Webster Hall on Wednesday night, models in thousand-dollar ball gowns shared a runway with men in high heels and a dwarf in a G-string. Like many events tied to the week of New York fashion shows that officially begins today, the evening wasn't really about clothes. It was about generating publicity for Absolut Vodka, the show's sponsor, and raising money for Housing Works, an organization that provides housing and social services to people with AIDS and H.I.V.
 The next night at Barolo in SoHo, the model Beverly Peele celebrated her 20th birthday along with hundreds of her admirers. Like many fashionable birthday parties these days, the evening wasn't really about commemorating a birthday. It was about having Ms. Peele photographed by paparazzi and written about by gossip columnists. To lure them to the party, Ms. Peele's public relations firm billed the fete as a "kickoff to fashion week." 
 The hoopla surrounding New York's fashion week, which runs through Friday, is beginning to resemble the hype associated with the Super Bowl: the before and after parties -- along with the advertising and marketing opportunities -- are nearly as important as the main event.

RESTAURANTS, charities, perfume companies, record labels, authors, museums and retailers have all scheduled events to piggyback on the frenzy generated by Seventh on Sixth, the festival of 49 fashion shows under tents in Bryant Park and in the New York Public Library. (Seventh on Sixth itself has become a marketing tool for its 13 sponsors, including Clairol, Evian and The New York Times Magazine, which offer their products at booths in the tent lobbies and fly their names on banners along 42d Street.)
 With journalists and television crews from around the world descending on New York to cover the fall '95 collections, many fashion-related businesses are hoping for publicity by association.
 William Morrow, the publishing house, is counting on it. Its publication of "Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women" by Michael Gross was timed to coincide with fashion week.
 After the last round of shows in November, when the feud between Carre Otis and her estranged husband, Mickey Rourke, dominated the tabloids' coverage of the tent shows, Mr. Gross told his publisher that he thought fashion week would be the ideal time to promote the book. "Interest in models reaches a fever pitch during the shows," Mr. Gross said.
 He plans to offer his authorial expertise in sound bites to any reporter under the tents who will listen. "You have 800 press people in town all looking for great stories," Mr. Gross said. "It's an ideal opportunity to get the word out in a way that is economical and effective."
 For Stan Herman, the president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which established Seventh on Sixth, it's an opportunity to raise money and awareness for one of his favorite charities: the Hetrick-Martin Institute, a social service agency that provides counseling and education for lesbian, gay and bisexual youths. Mr. Herman is a chairman of a fund-raising auction and cocktail party tonight for Hetrick-Martin, which will be the first-ever benefit in the Bryant Park tents.
 "It was a calculated risk to try to squeeze this in during fashion week," Mr. Herman said. "But the fashion community has been very supportive of Hetrick-Martin, and if we are going to get publicity for the institute's work, it helps to do so while the out-of-town press is here."
 Allure magazine agreed to sponsor the benefit for the same reason. "It's very simple," said Paul Wilmot, director of public relations at Conde Nast, which publishes Allure. "You go duck hunting when the ducks are flying. It puts Allure in a very visible position."
 The opening of the Fashion Cafe in Rockefeller Center on Friday night will probably be visible around the world. CNN, MTV and the BBC are slated to have camera crews at the party at the 280-seat theme restaurant, whose owners include the models Naomi Campbell, Elle MacPherson and Claudia Schiffer. Tommaso Buti, the restaurant's chief executive, scheduled the opening to follow the last tent show (Donna Karan's 6 P.M. presentation) so that his party would become fashion week's de facto finale.
 Mr. Buti also regards the opening as a global photo opportunity, a chance to build name recognition around the world. "I think Fashion Cafe is an exportable concept," he said. "I want to expand to Europe and Asia."
 American Movie Classics, the cable station, is also using fashion week to drum up interest in a future project. Late last week, the company sent out fashion week "Survival Kits" -- fruit baskets with news releases -- promoting "The Hollywood Fashion Machine," a one-hour documentary that isn't scheduled to be televised until August.
 "It's about jumping on the bandwagon early," said James LaForce, the cable station's public relations consultant, who sent the fruit to 300 editors and television producers who will be attending the tent shows.
 Francois Nars, a makeup artist whose new line of cosmetics is due to hit stores in May, is giving a party for 500 at Laura Belle on Tuesday night. "It's not a product launch," said Jennie Lister, a vice president of Mr. Nars's company, Agora Cosmetics. "Barneys will do that in May. Francois is from France, and a lot of his foreign friends will be in town next week, and he wanted to have a party for them." Still, a half-dozen television crews have already promised to cover the event, lured by the fact that Mr. Nars's friends include many supermodels.
 Gee Street Records is giving a party to promote Malcolm McLaren's new album, "Paris," on Tuesday night because so many of Mr. McLaren's peripatetic friends will be in New York. "Malcolm is inextricably linked with fashion," said Michelle Feeney, the organizer of the party, whose hosts include Joan Juliet Buck, the editor of French Vogue, and James Truman, the editorial director of Conde Nast. "He worked with Vivienne Westwood. He knows a lot of fashion people, and the album was used at a lot of the Paris fashion shows, so we decided it was good to have a party when a lot of people who like his stuff could be there."

MTV's "House of Style," however, won't make it. "There's too much to cover," said Alisa Bellettini, the producer. "The only thing we're covering outside the tents is the opening of the Fashion Cafe." She won't be covering the party Wednesday night at Henri Bendel for Todd Oldham's new perfume, even though Mr. Oldham is a regular contributor to "House of Style." But Ms. Bellettini is taping a segment, on how to produce a fashion show, that will feature Mr. Oldham.
 Even the Metropolitan Museum of Art hopes to attract editors and buyers visiting New York for the collections. "Our spring show is planned to open the week of fashion week," said Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute, whose exhibition "Bloom: Fashion's Spring Gardens" opened yesterday. "It's a way of showing respect to the fashion community."
 With all the ancillary activities, fashion designers can't always hold their events when they want to. Wolfgang Joop, for instance, who will show in the tents on Friday, has invited editors and buyers to his apartment tonight for cocktails. "Clearly, it's not the time we'd prefer," said Judith Agisim, who is organizing the party. "We're not trying to draw people away from the Hetrick-Martin benefit, but it was the only time that didn't conflict."
 Lauren Ezersky, a columnist for Paper Magazine, has had trouble organizing a dinner to introduce her friends and colleagues to Roberto Cavalli, an Italian designer who is showing in the tents for the first time. "We had to reschedule it three times," said Ms. Ezersky, who decided to hold her dinner on Wednesday after Todd Oldham's perfume party. "We would have loved to have had it after Roberto's show on Friday night, but who's not going to go to the Fashion Cafe? If we had the dinner on Friday, I might have skipped my own party."

HEADLINE: Word for Word / Names for an Era;
No Time Like the Present To Leave Something for Posterity

BYLINE: By SARAH BOXER 

 BODY:
Two weeks ago the Week in Review invited readers to choose a name for the time we live in, in the spirit of James Atlas's article, "Pinpointing a Moment on the Map of History." The reaction was fast and floodlike.
 A few readers were outraged at the very idea of The New York Times soliciting opinions. Someone derisively named the current age "The Era of the Audience-Participation New York Times." But hundreds of readers -- professors, students, psychologists, bureaucrats and hackers -- replied seriously. Some got carried away, unintentionally casting their votes for the Age of Indecision by sending in long lists of suggestions. One reader sent 52. 
 The responses came overwhelmingly from men and they were overwhelmingly pessimistic. The word "global" appeared in more than 40 of the names; the prefixes "dis-," "re-," "post-," "fin de" and "cyber-" (including two cyberias and one cy-barbaric) popped up repeatedly.
 There were about 20 variations on Millennial Age or Messianic Age (including "Milleni-end" and "Millenopause" and one picture of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who died last year). The Age of Anxiety (in deference to W. H. Auden), the Age of Uncertainty, the Age of Fragmentation, the Age of (Great and Failed) Expectations, the Age of Disillusion (and Dissolution) were popular. The ages of tribalism, fundamentalism, capitalism, regionalism, technology, deconstruction, greed and the Internet all had their adherents. Two people said the Age of Aquarius was dawning.
 Here are some of the editors' favorites. History will name the winner. SARAH BOXER
 
THE AGE OF CHUCK. Prior to this time there had been a sweeping infestation of . . . political correctness (PC), which sanitized everyday speech and suppressed humor . . . A cynical public began calling it the time of Post-Charles, "Charles" being a name they associated with . . . Victorian times. Eventually Charles gave way to "Chuck," a name used in American society to represent "one of the guys."

KOKUSAIKA (Japanese for "Internationalization"). The major, overriding trend of the age is the internationalization of economics, politics, culture and society. It is only fitting that a non-English word be used for it, and Japan, as the first nation of the non-European world to reach developed status, should be the country it comes from.

THE GREAT OPENING. Gorbachev remains the dominant figure, the original catalyst for the changes we're continuing to endure, and so I derive my tag from his policy of glasnost. . . . There is the opening of the rain forest, and the spread of pathogens from that ecosystem . . . the vulnerability of our blood supply . . . There is the opening of cyberspace. . . . Looking forward . . . alas and thanks, to much greater knowledge, a blessing and a curse.
James Linville
New York
 
THE GRAY NINETIES. Along with the graying of America's postwar boomers comes the dismal reality that this era is characterized by a society unable or unwilling to address the real problems which we have created. . . . A stark contrast to the Gay Nineties of not so long ago.

The Selling Of a Used President Gets Easier

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR two years, Bill Clinton tried hard and looked as if he was trying hard. He began his Presidency with a flurry of proposals, some carefully thought out, others concocted on the fly, some enacted, some defeated, some abandoned.
 On balance, the American people did not much like what they saw. 
 But in the weeks following the Republican triumph last November, a kind of lassitude seemed to grip the White House. Mr. Clinton and his aides rejected suggestions that they draft a new program of their own as a counterpoise to the Republicans' Contract With America. Whether staging a strategic retreat or simply stunned into inaction, the President allowed Newt Gingrich & Co. to dominate the first two months of the year.
 And now the strategy (or the non-strategy) seems to be paying rewards. The Red Queen told Alice that you had to run as fast as you could to stay in the same place; in present-day Washington, does standing still get you places?
 That would clearly be an overstatement. But Robert Squier, a veteran Democratic campaign consultant, thinks it hints at the truth. He believes both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gingrich read too much into their victories, taking relatively narrow margins as broad mandates, trying to do too much too quickly, and thereby agitating an electorate that, however cynical and dissatisfied, wants evolution, not revolution.

 
 
Stress Fractures
 In a demonstration of legislative efficiency unparalleled in the three decades since the enactment of the Great Society legislation, the Republicans have managed to push the less controversial parts of their Contract through the House, and they appear to have the votes to pass far-reaching welfare reform in the Senate as well. The line-item veto seems likely to become law soon. But they have failed, at least to date, on the balanced budget amendment and (last week's defeat) term limits, two of the populist measures they most strongly emphasized last fall, and they appear to be at sixes and sevens on tax policy.
 If not yet split in two as they were in the great Taft-Eisenhower and Goldwater-Rockefeller battles, the Republicans have begun to show some stress fractures -- Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who declared his candidacy for President last week, vs. the Religious Right; the tax-cutters vs. the budget-balancers; Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois and his old-timers vs. the Beltway-loathing youngsters; the neo-Progressives who dislike Big Business vs. the traditionalists who are its champions. Like Mr. Clinton a year ago, Mr. Gingrich says the real problem is not substance but communication; to get his message out, he plans a nationwide broadcast this week. But like Mr. Clinton, he seems part of the problem himself.
 Though most people still tell poll-takers that they disapprove of Congress, most say they think the Republicans are doing a fairly good job. But the more people know about the Speaker, the less they like him. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, a Gingrich fan, says he regularly tells the Speaker, "Newt, cool your jets." In the latest New York Times / CBS News poll, 22 percent of respondents reacted favorably, 33 unfavorably to the abrasive gentleman from Georgia; meanwhile, Mr. Clinton's poll figures have begun to stabilize, with 43 percent giving him a favorable rating and 39 giving him an unfavorable rating. Not brilliant, by any means, but probably good enough to prevent a full-fledged challenge from another Democrat.
 The battles on Capitol Hill have given Mr. Clinton a chance to do what hard-pressed politicians long to do: change the subject. One of his strategists said last week: "We finally have people talking about tax breaks for the rich and cutting off school lunches for poor kids instead of Bill Clinton and his character problems and his capacity to govern. That can only help us."
 Though he is already looking beyond the first 100 days of Republican control, talking about a flat tax and Medicare reform and eliminating government departments, Mr. Gingrich told David Frost last week that he thought Mr. Clinton could be re-elected because "he's clever, he has energy, he's articulate, he's attractive."

 
 
Fate and Numbers
 But the President remains a long shot who does not entirely control his own destiny. To win, many leading Democrats are saying, he will need the intervention of fate, in the form of a third-party candidate, perhaps, or a crisis abroad -- or a series of errors by the Republicans. Espousal of economic policies that seem too unfeeling, brawling over social issues like abortion and gun control, the choice of a candidate who is unable to hold the center, an economy that lands softly -- those are elements of a possible second-term scenario.
 Against them, however, must be set other factors. The issues, by and large, are running against the Administration. Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore may talk about re-inventing government, but their party is seen by the public as the defender of the much-maligned status quo in Washington. The most damaging thing about the failure of health-care reform, from an electoral point of view, was its reinforcement of the public image of Mr. Clinton as the bureaucrat's friend.
 The Whitewater affair lurks just offstage. Not only a special prosecutor but several influential Republican lawmakers are sifting through evidence that could prove distracting, embarrassing, perhaps even damaging to the President in the midst of tough election fight.
 For Mr. Clinton, the numbers are also difficult. The 43 percent approval rating he scored in the latest Times / CBS poll is identical to his share of the vote in 1992; the belief is widespread in Washington that he will have trouble increasing it, which means he would need a third-party candidate in order to win.

 
 
The South, Gone
 Look at it another way, from the perspective of the electoral college: Almost all of the South, including two of the nation's four largest states, Florida and Texas, apparently lies beyond his grasp, despite his politicking there last week. The retirement of Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama and the defection of Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama are only the most evident symptoms of the collapse of the Democratic Party in Dixie. The big gains scored there at the ballot box last November by the Republicans may prove to have been the most lasting aspect of the upheaval of 1994, and they mean that Democratic Presidential nominees will have almost no margin of error for the foreseeable future. Win California and most of the states stretching from New York to Illinois, Democrats recognize, or stare defeat in the face.
 Just as Ronald Reagan did a decade ago, the young Republicans in the House are redrawing the partisan playing field. They have begun the process of shifting power back to the states. Most important of all, they have done most of what they said they would do.
 But it will be the election of 1996 that decides whether this is a political watershed or not. Presidential elections, not mid-term elections, mark the realignments that come along three or four times a century in this country. With a Republican President pounding on the bully pulpit starting in January 1997, Gingrich & Co. would have clear sailing. Failing that, the Democrats may be able to limit the "revolution" of 1994 to a modest swing of the partisan pendulum.

On the Road in Hillaryland

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: KATMANDU, Nepal

 BODY:
HERE in the shadows of Mount Everest this weekend, the burning questions are these: Will the world see America's No. 1 Democratic woman on that Republican icon, the elephant? And when Hillary Rodham Clinton sets out on a safari, who will win -- the First Lady or the tiger?
 Halfway through her 12-day official visit to South Asia, Mrs. Clinton has paused below the peak conquered by that other Hillary in search of a vanishing breed. So far, the view isn't bad. Mrs. Clinton's good will tour has been animated by an air of high moral purpose as she stresses the importance of educating women in a region that is home to some of the most oppressed, and most resourceful, women in the world. She has visited families, schools, a worker's union, government officials and even one of Mother Teresa's orphanages (yes, an orphanage). 
 The stream of photo-ops, shopping stops and short hops aboard the old Boeing 707 that serves as Air Force One and a Half has also produced its share of low comedy, as a planeload of White House aides and reporters joined Mrs. Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea, on the journey into what the First Lady herself calls "Hillaryland." What follows is a strictly selective collection of impressions from along the way.

 
 
Candlesticks Are Nice
 March 25. A refueling stop in Cairo turns into a surprise visit to the pyramids and the Sphinx at Giza, combining the serendipity of a trip to the Dairy Queen with the logistics of a Napoleonic campaign. The First Lady's entourage whizzes through downtown Cairo at midday with every intersection blocked off. Mrs. Clinton declines the offer of a camel ride, and a bit over two hours later is back in the air.
 March 26. A luncheon with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan in Islamabad begins a seemingly endless series of gift exchanges. Mrs. Clinton gives: a limited-edition crystal vase titled "Moon Over Arkansas" and a pair of silver candlesticks. Mrs. Clinton gets: two Victorian-style chairs with silver arms.
 March 27. The First Lady meets a group of 16-to-20-year olds at the Islamabad College for Girls, where one offers a clear-eyed view of marriage. "You're never going to find the proper person or the ideal man," the girl says. "You have to be a lot more realistic." A few minutes later, Mrs. Clinton offers her own sober summary: "It's not a partnership that's 50-50. It's a partnership that's 100 percent and 100 percent, because that's what you have to give to it."

 
 
That's Entertainment
 March 28. The traveling party is still agog from an official dinner the night before in the ruins of the red sandstone mogul fort at Lahore, Pakistan, where meandering paths were lit by thousands of tiny oil lamps and the entertainment included dancing camels. The glow fades just a bit when word spreads that the Secret Service had been worried about cobras in the garden.
 March 29. After a day crowded with a speech on women's rights, a lunch with the Indian Prime Minister and an evening reception at the American Embassy in New Delhi, Mrs. Clinton undertakes a midnight economic development mission: She buys several chain-stitched rugs at the National Cottage Emporium in the Sheraton Hotel. The Kashmiri proprietor, Manzoor Wangnoo (a salesman straight from Central Casting) coins a new title worthy of a major Memsahib: "Her Ladyship." Mrs. Clinton's Deputy Chief of Staff, Melanne Verveer, becomes "Her Deputy Ladyship."
 March 30. Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea visit the white marble meringue of a mausoleum that is the Taj Mahal. Inside, Chelsea says: "When I was little, this was sort of the embodiment of the fairy-tale palace for me. I would see pictures of it and would dream I was a princess or whatever. Now that I'm here it's spectacular."
 Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, Lisa Caputo, plays a tape of the comment for reporters who did not hear it. But after television correspondents asked if Chelsea, whose privacy is zealously guarded by the White House and respected by reporters, will repeat the remarks on camera, Ms. Caputo declares the words off the record altogether. After some pointed discussions about genies and bottles and a consultation with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Caputo relents.
 April 1. Bound in a few minutes for a safari in the Chitwan National Forest, aboard a fleet of lumbering elephants. No phone, no fax, some fuss. The quarry: the elusive and endangered royal Bengal tiger. The real trophy: a picture of Mrs. Clinton on an elephant. So far her office has resisted that mightily. But the forest has a thousand eyes.

HEADLINE: LEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN RECORD NUMBERS WANT CITIZENSHIP

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, April 1

 BODY:
The number of legal immigrants applying to become United States citizens has nearly doubled in the last year, an increase that one immigration official described as "an unprecedented surge" stemming partly from recent initiatives passed in California and in Congress that would deny many benefits to noncitizens.
From October 1994 through January of this year, the first four months of the Federal fiscal year, applications for citizenship rose to 232,850, about 80 percent above the same period a year before, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
 And there are some signs the trend is accelerating among the nation's approximately 10 million legal immigrants. In January, the most recent month for which statistics are available, there were 65,959 applications, the highest monthly total on record at the agency and more than double the 31,846 filed in January 1994.
The biggest reason for the increase, immigration officials contend, is the fear that many government programs that are now legally available to noncitizens will be cut off.
Rudolph Brewington, a spokesman for the immigration service in Washington who described the increase as unprecedented, said: "There is a fear of losing benefits. They talk about the G.O.P.'s Contract With America, they talk about welfare reform."
While many of the immigrants themselves cited the fear that benefits might be cut off, others said their decisions were based on an even broader concern. They said that all noncitizens, whether in this country legally or illegally, were stigmatized in the current political climate.
And with a more than doubling of applications here in Texas and in Southern California, some experts see yet another factor at work: the declining economic conditions in Mexico.
"In older days, many Mexicans who came here said it was better to stay a first-class Mexican than become a second-class American," said Leonel J. Castillo, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization in the Carter Administration who now runs a program in Houston offering citizenship classes.
"Now they don't talk that way, especially the younger ones," Mr. Castillo said. "It isn't just the economic crisis, or the political crisis. Their whole notions of Mexican patriotism have changed. They're feeling like becoming a U.S. citizen is not such an act of disloyalty."
Sirelio Flores, a 36-year-old appliance repairman in Houston who is a Mexican citizen with legal authorization to live in the United States, became eligible for American citizenship nearly 10 years ago but chose not to apply for what he said were "sentimental reasons." He said he had also thought of returning to his native Mexico to retire, as many Mexicans who spend their working lives in this country do.
Now, as he studies for the citizenship examination and plans to apply to become an American, he cites a number of reasons, one of which is the turmoil in his native country.
"The way things are going in Mexico, I think the U.S. is looking like a better choice all the time," he said.
And just as important, he said, he was deeply angered by what he had heard of moves in Congress to take away benefits now available to noncitizens who are here legally. "I'm afraid they are trying to take everything away from us," Mr. Flores said. "I pay my taxes all the time. I've been very straight with the Government here. So why are they coming after us?"
The recent welfare overhaul package passed in the House of Representatives as part of the Republicans' Contract With America, and now pending in the Senate, would strip legal immigrants of eligibility for dozens of major aid programs, including food stamps, Medicare, rental assistance and testing for lead poisoning in children. Such cuts are intended to save about $20 billion over five years and affect at least 2.2 million legal immigrants.
That vote and other moves that are widely perceived as anti-immigrant have been exhaustively covered in the Spanish-language press here and in other immigrant communities. So has California's Proposition 187, the referendum approved by voters last fall that would make illegal immigrants ineligible for nearly all Government programs except emergency medical aid. While the measure was not specifically directed at them, many legal immigrants view it as part of a backlash directed at all foreigners. The measure has been tied up in court challenges, and most of its provisions have not been enforced.
To be sure, there are plenty of other forces at work in the increase in legal immigrants' becoming citizens.
For one thing, under terms of the 1986 Immigration Act, there is a sizable pool of formerly illegal immigrants who were granted amnesty and in recent years have become eligible for citizenship.
For another, the immigration service is now requiring all people who prior to 1979 were issued a "green card," or authorization to live in this country, to apply for new, computer-compatible cards similar to bank cards. The new card costs $75 while an application for citizenship costs $95, and many people are simply deciding to use the moment to spend the extra $20 on a citizenship application, immigration officials and advocates say.
In general, immigrants who have been in this country for five years with proper authorization are eligible to apply for citizenship and, in the absence of any criminal history, are entitled to receive it. Immediate relatives of those who have become citizens are eligible to become citizens more quickly. Some demographers predict that the current boom in applications will only amplify as new citizens sponsor other members of their families.
Still, the rise in applications is less a function of increasing numbers of people coming to this country than of more people who are already here deciding to apply. In the past, many legal immigrants decided to delay or forgo applying for citizenship, either because they intended to return to their native countries or because they just did not see American citizenship as necessary.
One Federal immigration study a few years ago suggested that as many as two-thirds of those eligible to apply in any given year were not doing so; what may be happening now is a return to past generations, when roughly two-thirds of those eligible chose to become naturalized citizens. One major reason for the dip was the ever-increasing number of immigrants from Mexico, who typically had less difficulty returning to their native country than other noncitizens and may have felt less need to become United States citizens.
For many of the Mexicans now applying for citizenship, the decision seems tinged with both excited anticipation and more than a hint of bitterness.
"I want to vote, I'll tell you that," said Monica Guerra, a 21-year-old Mexican who is applying for citizenship now that her husband, Angel, a welder in Houston, has received his.
"I don't believe there's justice for immigrants now," she said recently at the home of a neighbor in Houston's Spring Branch area, clutching her 7-month-old daughter, Jennifer. "The Hispanics, the Mexicans, they have done all the hard work that nobody else wants to do. It's not fair to deny them."
Mrs. Guerra's application is part of a surge in Houston. From a total of 937 citizenship applications in February 1994, the number rose as high as 2,734 last September and was 1,674 this February, said Mariela Melero-Chami, a spokeswoman for the immigration service here.
Mrs. Guerra and others are taking English and citizenship classes and studying sample questions for the test, including, "What is the name of the ship that brought the Pilgrims to America?" "What are the colors of our flag?" and "Who is the President of the United States today?"

HEADLINE: U.S. Bailout of Mexico Verging On Success or Dramatic Failure

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER with ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
More than two months after the Clinton Administration committed $20 billion to save Mexico from bankruptcy, the effort to bail out America's troubled neighbor is teetering between modest success and potential failure. And as Mexico struggles to lure back investors, a movement to back out of the American aid commitment has erupted in Congress.
Already the cash-starved Mexican Government has used $13 billion of a total $50 billion aid package, including more than $5 billion from the United States Treasury, to pay off billions in debts it ran up in a risky financial strategy that collapsed in December. Most of those investors -- a mix of rich Mexicans, Americans and other foreigners -- have swept up their hefty profits and immediately transferred their money out of the country. 
 But for the first time since the peso crisis began on Dec. 20, anecdotal evidence suggests that a tiny trickle of private investment has begun to flow back into the country -- a trickle that both governments acknowledge must turn into a river if the American bailout package stands a chance of working.
In the last few days senior American and Mexican officials have seized on a modest upturn in the stock market and some signs that the peso is stabilizing to argue that their strategy for restoring confidence is succeeding. Many others say that the small recovery may only mark a brief reprieve before the country begins to pay the price for soaring unemployment, inflation and consumer interest rates that have topped 100 percent.
"In the past week we've developed a more positive feel," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the chief architect of the plan, said in an interview Friday. "There are no guarantees in life, but the evidence has become more encouraging."
No one has more at stake in making the bailout work than President Clinton. By circumventing Congress and using the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund to issue the loans -- a highly unusual use of money normally intended to stabilize the dollar -- Mr. Clinton alone will be blamed if the rescue effort falls apart. Already the Senate Majority Leader, Bob Dole, who is seeking the Republican nomination for President, has backpedaled from his early support for the bailout. And if Mexico's economic downturn results in a flood of goods or illegal immigrants into Texas and California, two key states in next year's election, Mr. Clinton will likely pay the price.
Moreover, Mr. Rubin and other members of the Administration are scrambling to cut off a surprise attack by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, who tied up the Senate for most of Thursday with an amendment that would have prevented the Administration from dispersing anything beyond the $5.2 billion that Washington has already sent. He has promised to take the matter up again on Monday, and perhaps force a vote this week.
"Mexico has collapsed already," Mr. D'Amato argued in a telephone interview on Friday. "The rescue plan has failed. And we are just perpetuating a myth if we think we are helping anyone except rich investors, who the United States has saved while everyone else in Mexico starves."
Many in Congress were relieved when President Clinton acted alone two months ago, alleviating them of an unhappy choice between voting for a deeply unpopular plan and letting Mexico descend into financial ruin. As a result, Mr. D'Amato concedes that he probably does not have the votes to kill the aid package, at least this time. But he has successfully revived the continuing argument over whether the Administration's plan can work, and whether the White House erred in designing a bailout package that clearly benefits rich investors, in the optimistic hope that they can be convinced to keep their much-needed capital in the country.
Moreover, Mr. D'Amato, who is also the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, knows he does not have to pass his bill to seriously wound the Administration's effort. Even a close vote will send a signal to the markets that Mr. Clinton will have to be extraordinarily cautious in committing more American funds to Mexico.
With considerable political theater, Mr. D'Amato has also been leading an investigation that has come to be called: "Who lost Mexico?" For weeks he has been arguing with the Administration over demands for thousands of pages of classified documents on everything from the drug connections of Mexican officials to the Treasury Department's warnings to Mexico last year that financial disaster was looming. An agreement has been reached, but it is a sensitive issue at the White House, because many of the warnings came in the weeks before President Clinton publicly hailed Mexico as a "model" for emerging markets around the world.
On Wednesday, a day before he began his effort to scuttle the aid package, Mr. D'Amato and other Republicans clashed at a closed hearing with Lawrence Summers, the Undersecretary of the Treasury, arguing that the Administration misled Congress and the public last year about the depth of Mexico's troubles and the risks of the bailout plan. For the first time, Mr. Summers provided a detailed account of his contacts with Mexico -- something he has declined to do in public -- and defended the Administration's failure to issue its warnings about Mexico in public. To do so, Mr. Summers has argued, would have touched off exactly the kind of market run on Mexico he was trying to prevent.
At the same classified briefing, the Central Intelligence Agency also told the committee that Mexico's oil exports, which it put up as the collateral for the $20 billion from Washington, will drop off significantly in the next five years, leaving little to secure the American loans. That runs contrary to assurances given by Mexican officials as recently as two weeks ago.
Treasury officials decline to discuss the details of the classified assessment, but one senior official said he was convinced that "there will be sufficient revenue stream" from Mexico's oil exports to insure that American taxpayers will be paid back if the country defaults.
Apart from the maneuvering for political advantage, two questions lie at the core of the argument under way in Congress: Is the rescue package achieving its primary goal, which is to bring foreign investment -- and thus stability -- back to the country? Is the austerity plan that the United States insisted on likely to trigger social or political turmoil?
For the Administration, the answer to the first question is disappointing. Even after the signing of the loan package Feb. 21, foreign investors seemed to be more nervous than before -- in part because of the soaring interest rates that were intended to attract them. Most foreign investors who hold maturing tesobonos -- high-yield, short-term Government bonds that Mexico issued in enormous numbers last year to cover its trade deficit -- simply cash them in and get out of town, taking their money with them.
But the Mexican Government has already paid off $13 billion of the $29 billion in outstanding tesobonos, and there are indications that some Mexican investors have started to use that money to buy other types of Government debt, including treasury certificates and bonds called "ajustabonos" that are adjusted to Mexico's soaring inflation rate.
"There's no new money going in," said one investment fund manager in New York who did not want to be identified. "The spigot that was turned off is still off."
But Luis R. Luis, the head of research for emerging market debt at Scudder, Stevens and Clark, an investment manager in Boston, notes that the Mexican stock market fell so low and interest rates on bonds rose so high that "some of the assets are now attractive." With the devalued peso making imports far more expensive than they were in December, Mexico has also begun to run up a trade surplus, largely at the expense of the United States. A massive surplus, which reduces the need to import foreign capital, is a key to the recovery plan.
The Mexican Government, trying to put the best light on a bad situation, insists that the program is beginning to work.
But the turnaround is a race against time, with the Government gambling that things will look better before it feels the consequences of homeowners who cannot pay their mortgages and workers who are laid off. "There is this enormous explosion that everyone is worried about," said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs & Company, where Mr. Rubin spent most of his career.
Unemployment in January was more than twice the level of Government estimates. Inflation is steadily rising and could soar this month, as huge increases in the cost of gasoline and electricity are passed on to consumers. For the year, inflation will likely run above 50 percent.
Today the Government also increased its national sales tax to 15 percent on a broad range of goods, an increase that hurts the poor more than anyone else.
Remarkably, there has been no explosion of social unrest, although people are in the street protesting the Government's economic policies. Labor unions have grumbled loudly that the devaluation of the peso has hurt workers, but most have agreed to the salary increases offered by the Government or individual employers -- knowing that the only alternative is layoffs. That is a particular hardship in Mexico where there is no unemployment insurance.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Cut Food Aid Going Abroad

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Responding to strong domestic pressure to reduce foreign aid, the Administration has cut nearly in half the nation's annual pledge of overseas food aid, which had remained unchanged for two decades.
Noting that the developing world's food demands are rising every year, the 15-nation European Union has criticized the American move, suggesting that the United States is breaking its commitments. 
 Administration officials confirmed Friday that the United States had outlined its plans on March 13 at a meeting of the Food Aid Convention, an organization of about two dozen nations that includes Japan and the European Union. The United States said it would cut its promise of yearly food aid to 2.5 million metric tons from 4.47 million.
Administration officials said the move, which was partly a response to Republican pressure to cut foreign aid, would save the Government more than $300 million a year.
Another reason for the cut, officials said, is that the Government's stocks of surplus grain are nearly exhausted as a result of reductions in farm subsidies.
Aid experts said the move would leave aid agencies far short of their goal of promising the developing world at least 10 million tons of food aid a year. Right now, American food aid is going to Rwanda, Burundi, countries of the former Yugoslavia and more than a dozen other nations in the form of wheat, corn and other grains.
The American announcement surprised and irritated other nations because American officials had indicated at the aid group's December meeting -- where final commitments were negotiated for a new, three-year treaty among donor nations -- that Washington would maintain its previous pledge of 4.47 million metric tons. A metric ton is about 2,200 pounds.
In a statement, the executive commission of the European Union said it "regrets that the U.S. decision has been taken at such a late stage."
"The size of the reduction is not appropriate at a time when food aid needs do not seem to be decreasing, and particularly in light of efforts to fight poverty," the Europeans added.
But Mary Chambliss, deputy administrator for export credits at the Department of Agriculture, defended the decision.
"The United States will continue to be the world's major donor of food aid," she said. "It is a role we have always played. Our friends in the 15-nation European Union, even collectively, are still making a pledge that is below our pledge."
The European Union has pledged 1.755 million tons. Ella Krucoff, speaking for the European Union, said Friday that the Europeans did not plan to reduce that pledge.
Ms. Chambliss also emphasized that the pledge of 2.5 million tons a year was a minimum, and said there was a good chance that Washington's annual contribution would exceed that level. Over the last seven years, American food aid has averaged more than 6 million tons a year, well above its pledge of 4.47 million.
She said the reduced pledge was in line with President Clinton's proposed budget cuts. The Administration is proposing that food aid fall to $990 million in fiscal year 1996, which begins Oct. 1 this year, down from $1.1 billion in fiscal 1995 and $1.4 billion in fiscal 1994.
"This shows that the U.S.'s role in world food aid is falling," said James Hill, a senior economist with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. "So you're getting other countries, like Japan and the European Union, looming larger in the aid picture."
At the meeting in December, members of the Food Aid convention pledged 7.32 million tons of aid to the developing world. But with the reduced American pledge, total commitments have fallen to 5.35 million tons, about half the target of 10 million tons.

HEADLINE: John White, Real Estate Agent Expert in Big Sales, Dies at 75

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
John R. White, a New York realtor who set a price record in 1980 when he negotiated the $400 million sale of the Pan Am Building to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, died on Wednesday at his home in Jupiter, Fla. He was 75.
The cause was complications of a heart attack he suffered late last year, his family said. 
 As the chairman of Landauer Associates, an international consulting company specializing the complex real estate transactions of large corporations, Mr. White had long been an expert in the Manhattan skyscraper market.
But nothing had quite prepared him for the complexities he encountered when Pan American World Airways, facing a financial squeeze that would lead to its bankruptcy a decade later, placed its flagship headquarters building on the market in 1980.
The 59-story landmark, on Park Avenue just north of Grand Central Terminal, had been the world's largest commercial office building when it opened in 1963 with 2.25 million square feet of rentable space, and assessing its value in the buoyant 1980 New York real estate market proved daunting.
To project the value of leases, and factor in other financial considerations, Mr. White's company had to design its own computer program, and the eventual private sale brochure filled 65 pages.
To guarantee confidentiality, Mr. White alone received and handled bids, which were hand-delivered to him by top executives of the bidding institutions. Nine of the bids exceeded $325 million, for a building that had cost just $115 million to construct 17 years earlier.
When the sale to Metropolitan Life was announced on July 28, 1980, Mr. White described the $400 million price as the largest ever paid for a single building -- a record, he modestly suggested, that resulted from the building's unusual size. Maybe so, but the price also worked out to a record $177 a square foot, or $41 a foot more than another Park Avenue landmark, the Seagram Building, had attracted the year before.
In addition to setting a sales record, the transaction also became a footnote to legal history. Because the transaction had been structured so that it was not the building, but the stock in its single-asset corporate parent that was sold, Pan Am escaped all but $125 of the $4 million New York City real estate transfer tax that would have been due.
In the resulting furor, the law was changed to close the loophole for future transactions.
The sale of the Pan Am Building may have been a special achievement, but Mr. White had long been a leading figure in real estate, one whose expertise extended from urban skyscrapers to suburban shopping malls and rural industrial sites.
He also played important roles in transactions involving the General Motors Building and Rockefeller Center in New York, L'Enfant Plaza in Washington and the Spring Hill, Tenn., site of the General Motors Saturn division.
He also wrote widely on the economics, financing and valuation of real estate, and taught at both New York and Columbia universities.
To achieve his business success, Mr. White, a native of New York, had to go beyond his Harvard education, which he did by attending night classes to obtain a master's degree in business administration from New York University.
"That degree was my salvation," he once said. "Up to then my education was mostly in things like English and history."
After serving in Coast Guard intelligence in World War II, Mr. White broke into New York real estate in 1946 as a broker with Byrne, Bowman & Forshay. He moved to Brown, Harris, Stevens residential real estate company in 1954 and joined Landauer in 1963. He headed the company from 1972 to 1985, when he became honorary chairman.
He is survived by his wife, Gloria Eunice Pedersen; three sons, Geoffrey, of Philadelphia; Stuart, of Cuenca, Ecuador, and Randall Bruce White of London, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Spring Ahead, Sleep Behind: It's Time

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
If all went well, a short-wave radio signal from Fort Collins, Colo., reached an antenna on the roof of Grand Central Terminal early this morning and sent all 80 clocks in the station spinning and whirring forward one hour.
If all went well, the guests at the Plaza Hotel found notes at their bedsides before turning in, reminding them that the twice-yearly time change was at hand and that wake-up service could be arranged by dialing zero. 
 And if all goes well, millions of people in the New York metropolitan area will stumble out of bed sometime this morning and survive the leap into daylight saving time with nothing more than a mild case of discombobulation.
"Sure, I'd like to have the hour back," said John-Michael Caprio, the choirmaster at St. Patrick's Cathedral, whose 9 A.M. Sunday rehearsal effectively jumped this weekend to 8 A.M. "But you take what you get."
What Mr. Caprio and most other Americans got today (except, of course, for those in Arizona, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa and parts of Indiana, who ignore the rest of the nation's switch) was the vaguely unpleasant jolt commonly known as springing forward.
Daylight saving time went into effect at 2 A.M. -- which is to say 2 A.M. was really 3 A.M. -- the prospect of which New Yorkers greeted late last week with the usual mix of wisecracks and resignation.
"I'm glad you reminded me," Nathan Lane, the actor, said. "Because I was going to give myself a Toni home perm this Sunday and, with that extra hour, I'd look like Buckwheat."
The burden is never shared equally. Airlines and clock stores tend to suffer. But after-work joggers and softball players and urban toddlers with cabin fever thrive on the addition of a usable daylight hour.
At Fairview Piano and Clock, in Fairview, N.J., Tom Castro will spend tomorrow morning resetting the clocks in his shop. "My wife was just telling me in the car this morning, 'Why don't they leave the darn time alone?' " he said.
Customer-service agents at the Time Warner New York City Cable Group, which operates the cable systems that serve most of New York City, will spend the next 10 days trying to explain to addled callers how to reset their VCR's.
And some of the gorillas, binturongs and langurs at the Bronx Zoo can be expected to take a full week to adjust to the change in the time when their attendants arrive to wake them up.
"You get this impression from them, 'Jeez, it's awfully early to be getting up,' " said Edward Spevak, assistant curator of mammals. Asked how he could tell, Mr. Spevak said, "It's this little, squinty-eyed look."
That squinty-eyed look may be a symptom of what psychologists call dysphoria, a kind of foggy malaise that some specialists say is the most common human consequence of adjusting to the change of time.
David F. Dinges, a specialist in sleep and biological rhythms at the University of Pennsylvania, said the switch to daylight time has the same mild effect on the body as jet lag from a one-hour time-zone change.
Meddling with time to extend the number of usable daylight hours may have all sorts of nifty social and economic impact, Professor Dinges said, but it also throws people in confict with their own biology.
"I'm never sure if I should be up or eating breakfast or sleeping," said Andrea Watman, a caterer at Zabar's in Manhattan. "I find that it's a very, very short day and that I'm normally confused."
Heath Lamberts, an actor playing the role of Cogsworth, a man becoming a clock, in the Broadway production of "Beauty and the Beast," complained: "If they didn't arbitrarily do this, we'd get along very well with Nature."
Daylight saving time is, after all, a relatively modern invention. It was tried first in this country during World War I to conserve energy. It was instituted throughout most of the country in 1967.
The purpose is to make better use of daylight hours, for business as well as recreation. But it has also been found to help reduce crime and traffic fatalities, the United States Department of Transportation says.
Even so, many people still find the whole thing confusing.
"You know how people always say, 'Fall back, spring forward'?" asked Jackie Green, a theatrical press agent in Manhattan. "I don't find that helpful because I fall forward."
Penn Jillette, the magician, traced his befuddlement to his Newfoundland roots: "When it's noon in New York, it's 1:30 P.M. in Newfoundland. When you start there, you'll never understand daylight saving time."
Businesses, however, have daylight saving time down to a system.
Dan Brucker, a spokesman for the Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company, said the railroad relies on reams of brightly colored "bulletin orders" posted in train yards and operations centers to remind its 600 conductors and 300 locomotive engineers to reset their clocks.
The Transit Authority, on the other hand, began changing the clocks in the subway system one by one last week, leaving straphangers momentarily wondering if they were an hour late to work.
As for the clocks at Grand Central Terminal, Metro-North depends on the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which broadcasts time signals from Fort Collins, Colo., to receivers throughout the country.
The railroad has become so comfortable with the time changes that it even arranges for its own schedule changes to coincide with the twice-yearly time changes. The railroad figures it is doing its riders a favor.
"How shall I put this?" Mr. Brucker said. "If people are going to have to rethink at what point they get up and catch the train, they might as well explore what new trains they might be catching." It is similar to the theory that people will change the batteries in their smoke alarms twice a year if the chore is pegged to the change in time.
In the end, many New Yorkers say they like daylight saving time once they get over the shock. They like the sunshine going home from work, the time at the park with their children, the extra business generated by more people on the street.
"I like it," said Zachary Berman, 32, a lawyer from Rego Park, Queens, who intends to change his work hours to take better advantage of the evening light. "If you're going to have summer," he said, "you might as well go all the way."

HEADLINE: U.N. Force Takes Up Duties in Haiti

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, April 1

 BODY:
The United Nations began its first full day of formal peacekeeping here today, with nearly 6,900 soldiers and police officers from more than 30 countries donning blue berets and moving in to replace the American-led military force that has been responsible for Haiti's security since last fall.
The mood in the capital was calm as the troops took up their mandate, which is to maintain order as this poor and volatile nation struggles to build a democracy and a functioning economy. 
 Though United Nations troops have been pouring into Haiti for more than a month, they took up their duties only after a formal transfer of authority on Friday attended by President Clinton, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
The peacekeepers are expected to remain in Haiti for the next 10 months, with their mission culminating in the inauguration of Mr. Aristide's successor in February 1996. Throughout this period, they will be exercising a broader set of responsibilities than the American force they replaced.
"What we will be doing is looking at what Haiti is doing to make all the various components, such as justice, police and elections, come together," said Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian Foreign Minister who directs the United Nations mission here.
"Also, we will also be taking a very active interest in the economy, although that is not strictly part of our mandate," he said. After years of corruption, mismanagement and tough international sanctions, Haiti's economy is in a shambles, and more than half the population is unemployed.
Before its departure, the United Nations mission here must also oversee two sets of campaigns and elections, parliamentary and presidential, that diplomats say have the potential to deteriorate into violence.
In contrast to the American-led force, the United Nations plans to deploy some of its units permanently in the Haitian countryside, home to 70 percent of the population and still the scene of considerable political tension. That promises to give the peacekeepers more mobility and flexibility than their predecessors and is intended to compensate for the smaller size of the United Nations contingent. At its peak, the American-led mission numbered some 20,000 troops.
In the meantime Haiti will be training a new, permanent police force to replace the disbanded armed forces, whose former leaders forced Mr. Aristide into exile for three years beginning in a coup in September 1991.
The United Nations mission's military component is led by Maj. Gen. Joseph W. Kinzer, who is keenly aware that, as he put it this week in an interview, he is "the first American general officer ever to command a United Nations force."
A former chief of Army operations at the Pentagon, General Kinzer, 55, has previously served abroad in the Dominican Republic, Vietnam and Panama, where he took part in the 1989 American invasion.
About 2,400 of the 6,000 soldiers under General Kinzer's command are from the United States, mostly from the 25th Infantry Division. Pakistan and Bangladesh provide the two next largest contingents, at about 850 troops each, followed by Canada, Nepal and a contingent representing a group of Caribbean nations.
United Nations officials said that nearly three-quarters of the new peacekeeping force consists of troops who took part in the initial, American-led phase of operations here. That American force was largely concentrated in Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitien, the country's two largest cities, with ongoing operations in rural and provincial areas largely entrusted to small Special Forces contingents.
Though the United Nations force is smaller, "I'm not going to be doing anything less than what the multinational force was doing," General Kinzer said. He added, "It's how I employ the force and mix and match the force that I think will maintain the same kind of presence."
General Kinzer said he would be operating with considerably less air support than the American force, which could be a significant factor once the rainy season begins next month and makes movement on Haiti's primitive and dilapidated road system even more difficult than usual.
He has been given three naval landing craft, and he said he planned to do "a great part of the logistics by sea," as Haitians have done for generations.
There is widespread concern among Haitians that remnants of the paramilitary groups that acted as enforcers for the old military dictatorship will be tempted to test the readiness and fighting ability of the new force.
General Kinzer declined to offer details of how his troops would respond to such a challenge, other than to say their training had prepared them to respond to any threat.
But he also acknowledged that his forces were operating under somewhat more restrictive rules of engagement than those followed by the American-led force that landed here in September. Those troops were empowered by the United Nations Security Council to take "all necessary means" to impose order in Haiti. The new rules of engagement do not offer the same latitude in maintaining a "safe and stable environment," as the United Nations describes its mission here.
"The only difference is that I am not authorized to take unilateral offensive action," General Kinzer said. "But I believe that I've got sufficient flexibility in the rules of engagement that if a situation arises, I've got a full range of options." He said that included the use of deadly force.
In an interview this week, President Aristide expressed some concern that the United Nations peacekeepers would be purely a "reaction" force "in case some people want to disturb the climate."
"I am not in a position to say I am worried, but clearly I will have to pay attention," the Haitian leader said.
Violent crime has surged over the last month. Dealing with that issue will be the responsibility of the United Nations civilian police, which is commanded by an officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Neil Pouliot, and replaces the international police monitors who have been here since last fall.
The mission's plan calls for the United Nations police to patrol the streets of Haitian cities and towns and to work with the new Haitian police as its trainees emerge from the police academy here. "In many respects, their job is going to be even tougher than that of the soldiers, because the biggest vacuum is in law enforcement, and Haitians are tired of crime," a diplomat here said.
Haitian Government officials and foreign diplomats also said they were particularly worried about security for the coming elections. In the past, Haitian elections have routinely been marred not only by ballot stuffing and other forms of fraud, but by violent attacks on candidates and voters.
With the first round of parliamentary elections scheduled for June 4, political tensions are already high, especially in the countryside. Some Haitian political leaders are calling for the United Nations force to guarantee the security of all candidates and voting booths, but United Nations officials say that is not a practical course.
"I don't have enough soldiers to do that," General Kinzer said. "There are potentially 9,000 polling places, and I have 6,000 soldiers."

HEADLINE: S.A.T. With Familiar Anxiety but New (Higher) Scoring

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
After three hours of suffering through the S.A.T. yesterday morning, Isaac Hurwitz and Geoffrey Fischer stood near the Tribeca Bridge whooping and exchanging high-fives. And for the first time since leaving the testing room at Stuyvesant High School in Battery Park City, their classmate Stephanie Xie allowed herself a smile.
" 'Stalwart' is to 'cause' as 'adherent' is to 'party,' " she rejoiced. "Yeah! I had that too!" 
 If they were re-enacting the relief celebrated by millions of high school students before them upon completion of the nation's most widely used college entrance exam, the three juniors from Hunter College High School, like other 230,000 students across the country who took the Scholastic Assessment Tests yesterday, were leaving a new academic playing field.
Forever, an asterisk will appear next to their scores: the average student got an extra 100 points just for showing up yesterday.
The College Board, the New York nonprofit company that oversees the test, has adjusted its scoring system for the first time since 1941, when the average score was 500 math and 500 verbal, the midpoint of the 200-to-800 grading scale. Since then, scores have steadily declined, to an average of 424 in the verbal portion of the test and 479 in the math portion.
College Board officials insist that what looks like old-fashioned grade inflation is merely a maneuver that will bring the average scores back to the center of the bell curve, the mid-point on a graph of all scores that indicates average performance.
But for many students the extra points seemed a setup to a cruel April Fools' Day trick. The test was as grueling as ever and the higher scores will not matter when it comes to college admissions.
"It just went on forever," said Olivia Ng, a junior at Hunter College High School in New York, who emerged from the test exhausted, massaging the left side of her head.
The change, which mostly affects the college class of 2000, has admission officers scrambling to figure out how to compare the old scores with the new ones. Already, the National Collegiate Athletic Association has announced it is raising the minimum requirement for sports eligibility to a combined score of 820, from 700.
The College Board has sent around a conversion slide rule, a sort of decoder ring that translates the new scores to the old. "Its almost as incomprehensible as adjusting from Fahrenheit to Celsius," said Delsie Z. Phillips, the director of admissions at Haverford College in Pennsylvania.
Only a few students at test centers around the country yesterday said they knew about the scoring change. "I read on the test that it was being recentered, but I didn't know what that meant," said Marlana Thompson, 17, of Athens, Ga., as she left Clarke Central High School.
Part of the confusion stems from the complexity of independently adjusting the statistical curves of the test's two parts. For the most part, the new system raises scores: a verbal score of 730 becomes a perfect 800, for example. But for a handful of math whizzes, scores will dip. A 670 math score on the new test equals of previous score of 680.
The last time the scores were recalibrated was in 1941, when only 10,000 students took the exam, most of them well-educated, affluent, college-bound white men from the Northeast. As more and more students took the test, the nation's most widely used college entrance exam, average scores went down. Last year, the test's format was changed slightly to reduce biases against women and minorities. This year, 1.8 million students from a range of backgrounds will take the test, which is regarded as a measure of abstract reasoning.
"There is a gross misalignment between the 1995 scale and the 1941 scale," said Bradley J. Quin, an associate director at the College Board. "Americans like to fix everything in numbers. We fix on a 520 and you are a 520 kid for the rest of life. But the mathematicians know full square that number is not set in concrete."
Dr. Neil J. Dorans, a psychometrician at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., who supervised the readjustment of scores, said recentering scores every year would make comparisons over time impossible.
"Basically you become dependent on the group of candidates who happen to take the test that year," he said. "You lose the ability to make comparisons from year to year."
Dr. Dorans said he first proposed readjusting the scores in 1983. "A lot of people wanted to stay with the old scale because it had a tradition of 50 years. It took a lot of persuading, a lot of research, to point out the positive benefits of changing."
The new scoring system is based on a study of more than a million S.A.T. results from 1990. "Now, students won't have to look at percentiles," Dr. Dorans said. "They can just compare the scores and get a good handle on their relative strengths and weaknesses. It's a chance to see themselves relative to their peers instead of a group from 1941."
For some admission counselors, the new scores will not make much difference. At Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, one of the most competitive schools in the country, the director of admissions, Michael C. Behnke, was unmoved. "We will certainly be less impressed by 800's than we were before," he said. "But frankly, we weren't ever impressed much by 800's because we got a lot of them."
Several admission officers said they were concerned that the recentering of scores would confuse college applicants. College guidebooks, often carried about like bibles by high school students pondering their futures, are now all out of date because they list old scores.
Geoffrey J. Harford, the director of admissions at Pennsylvania State University, said he was worried students would misinterpret their higher scores. "Just because the recentered score is higher on paper does not mean they have done better verbally or mathematically," he said. "I am not sure the test takers are aware of that."
Sarah Strauss, 16, a junior at Brookline High School just outside Boston, said she had been aware of the recentering of scores but did not expect them to affect her chances of getting into Skidmore, a liberal arts college in upstate New York.
"I worried about the S.A.T.'s because I feel pressure to do well," Miss Strauss said. "But this test just shows if you are good at filling in little ovals. Life isn't about that at all."
Elizabeth Hotetz, a junior at Maria Regina High School in Hartsdale, N.Y., did not know of the score change until her mother told her about it just before the test. "I don't think it's going to make much of a difference," she said clutching her pencils on the way into the exam. "The test is still as hard as ever."

Table: "SORTING IT OUT: The S.A.T. Decoder" gives a conversion chart showing what old scores would be under the new recentereing. The conversions are applicable for those who have taken the test in the last four or five years. While all verbal scores would rise, some math scores above 650 would decline slightly under recentering.

Figures for 1994 are based on individual students' scores that have been recentered; other are estimates obtained by applying an equation to the original scale. (Source: College Board)

HEADLINE: 4 Months After Robbery, Bike Shop Is Still Picking Up Pieces

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
In his mind, Gerald Browne still smells the acrid odor of gunpowder and hears his silent goodbyes to unseen loved ones. Roy Beatong jolts awake at night, shaken and sweating.
And Neil Ir, the owner of Frenchie's Cycle World in Canarsie, Brooklyn, still hears that chilling phone call of four months ago, when his store and his workers, Mr. Browne and Mr. Beatong, came under attack. Mr. Ir says he retains "an inability to fathom how someone is ready to eliminate you for a piece of metal" -- a bike. 
 Wall panels now cover the holes from the fusillade of bullets fired by one of four holdup men and a swarm of police officers who converged at the shop, tucked in a mini-mall off Flatlands Avenue at East 107th Street just before 4 P.M. on Dec. 2. The shattered plate-glass windows have been replaced, as have the steel rear gates that were torn away in those chaotic few minutes when police reinforcements frantically fought to get to the side of a fallen comrade.
But memories cannot be repaired.
In the days that followed the gunfight, news accounts conveyed deeply felt tributes to the slain officer and etched the details of his muffled-drum funeral. They diagnosed a social pathology in which an adult and three teen-agers would stop at nothing to furnish themselves with the proper equipment for what police officials say is a new criminal mode: holdup gangs on bicycles.
But Mr. Ir and his workers were simply left to clean up the mess, deal with the lingering trauma and ponder the vulnerability of small-business owners who struggle, as Mr. Ir said, "eight days a week, because that's umpteen hours a day," just to survive.
Mr. Ir -- who was summoned from his soon-to-open second store in Huntington, L.I. -- still shudders at the thought of that moment at dawn the following day, when, after a night in the parking lot, under the garish winking of so many spinning lights, he was at last allowed to enter his store. "I had to step over the blood of the police officer and clean it up, the blood of the robber and clean it up," Mr. Ir said.
Officer Raymond Cannon, 26, the first to arrive at the scene, was killed, shot twice in the head. His partner, Kevin Murphy, had returned fire, wounding one suspect and killing another, a 30-year-old man. The police say that the man had persuaded his two teen-age nephews and one of their friends to join him in a pre-Christmas quest to steal bicycles and clean out the store's cash register.
Frenchie's Cycle World -- where a child's first training-wheeled vehicle can be found a rack or two away from $3,000 full-suspension mountain bikes with titanium shock absorbers -- has been a Brooklyn institution for nearly 80 years, with prior incarnations on Clarkson Avenue and on Church Avenue. Mr. Ir, 41, a native of Israel, took over 20 years ago.
"When you're in retail, you're always exposed," he said. "Doesn't matter if it's a liquor store or a bike shop. Think about it. They are willing to kill you, ruin your family, for what they want right then. I don't care about education level or economic level, there's no excuse."
The phone call from a police operator that Friday afternoon was frightening for what the caller would not say. "I wasn't told whether there was a holdup or a hostage situation or anything," Mr. Ir said. He was just asked, "Is there access to the basement?" During the long ride from Long Island, Mr. Ir said, he was "shaking like a leaf."
The gunplay was over by the time he arrived. Still, Mr. Ir recalled: "There must have been 200 emergency vehicles, an armored personnel carrier, Swat teams on the roof with automatics. What I saw was a business, a livelihood, that seemed to be flittering through my fingers."
Mr. Browne and Mr. Beatong saw more.
In pairs, 10 minutes apart, the robbers had entered the store, then conferred, pretending to be interested in buying bikes. "They had their hats covering their eyebrows, wool hats," said Mr. Browne, the store manager. "You just had the feeling something wasn't right. That's when I told Roy I was going to buy a slice of pizza." In fact, he strode to Sabella's Pizzeria, four doors down, and told the owner to call 911.
Mr. Browne, 22, then returned to the bike shop, forsaking his safety, because he "knew Roy couldn't open the register." By then, Mr. Beatong, 60, a salesman, was face down in the rear clothing room, his arms and legs taped. The adult robber, gun in hand, pushed Mr. Browne into the room.
"Just as he got one turn of the tape, the door opened and the police identified themselves," Mr. Browne said. "I heard someone saying, 'It's all right, it's a mistake.' That's when the older guy ran out of the clothing room, put the gun toward the officer and fired, like three, four, five times."
Two of the teen-agers were in the clothing room. As a ruse, Mr. Browne told them they could escape through the basement. But there was no escape, and later they were found cowering under cardboard boxes.
By then, to the wail of so many sirens, the older robber, fatally wounded, "crawls into the room and collapses about a foot from my head," Mr. Browne recalled. "You could hear the cops yelling -- '1013, officer down' -- something like that."
Windows splintered and officers fired into the store, Mr. Browne said. "So much firing you could smell the gunpowder in the air. I was on the ground, put my hands over my head, just waiting. 'Hands up. Who's in there? Come out.' So many different officers yelling different things. I started shouting, 'I work here!' "
Mr. Beatong, a native of Jamaica, said: "Nothing in the world ever scared me so much. Where I was lying, not six inches from my head is where the majority of the bullets from the police hit, coming from outside. Seemed like they were coming by the hundreds."
Mr. Browne said: "You think about everyone that means something to you -- 'I didn't say goodbye to this one, I didn't say goodbye to that one.' " In particular, there was his daughter, Krystal, 2.
"You figure this is it," Mr. Browne said. "You're going through your head like crazy, racing -- a lot of unfinished stuff."
In late February, an advertisement ran in The Village Voice: "Grand Reopening of Our Brooklyn Store!" Frenchie's was finally back in business.
Mr. Ir said: "Two months. Christmas lost. Forty, 50 bikes ruined, discarded. Insurance doesn't cover situations like this. All out of my pocket, man!"
Other merchants in the mall also suffered. "Everybody stays away," said Carol, the owner of the pizza parlor, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used. "The walk-in business is not too good. It's still fresh."
Mr. Ir said it took two months to reopen because he decided to focus his attention on the new store in Huntington "and because the people there were still traumatized." And while business in Canarsie hasn't been bad since the reopening -- "I think there's curiosity," Mr. Ir said of patrons who come from all over the city -- the psychological costs have yet to be tabulated.
"Most nights, I wake up sweating and sitting by my bed," Mr. Beatong said. "I cannot get over it."
Mr. Browne added: "You're basically on edge. People come in, you look at them closely."
These days, Mr. Ir said: "My 6-year-old son always talks about the robbers and the guns and the killing. He saw it on television -- the 45-foot storefront, all lit up, on every news station."
And then there are the sometimes welcome, but constant, reminders. "We have 69th Precinct guys in here all the time," Mr. Ir said. "They come in, they look around. They ask, 'Where did he fall?' The more you see them, the more you like it, especially in the beginning. But it's a sad thing. You know why they're doing it."

HEADLINE: Bringing Slavery's Long Shadow to the Light

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
During most of his 59 years, Oswald Sykes, a former hospital administrator for New York State, rarely thought about his ancestors' odyssey through slavery. And when he did, all he felt was a fleeting rage.
But then he saw the remnants of a rotting English slave ship, the Henrietta Marie, discovered in the Florida Straits. As he examined the heavy iron shackles and ship's bell, he pondered how strong his ancestors must have been to survive the passage from the Gulf of Guinea. 
 "They had to be good," Mr. Sykes remembered thinking, "or we just wouldn't be here."
Within the last decade, Mr. Sykes's evolution of emotion has been experienced by a growing number of African-Americans, who have begun to re-examine slavery -- reflecting upon it in film and music, remembering it through ritual and ceremony, assessing its legacy from universities to neighborhood study groups.
Some scholars compare this widespread reflection to that of Jews who have vigilantly preserved memories of the Holocaust. Much in the same way, the scholars say, many blacks are now looking to slavery for inspiration as they struggle to withstand modern-day troubles.
"What's happening is an attempt to celebrate the spirit of ingenuity and survival in the face of suffering," said Michael Eric Dyson, professor of communication studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "We can say, 'If they could make it under slave conditions, then certainly we could make it under crack. If they made it under economic misery, we can make it under conditions of ethical collapse.' "
Looking back at slavery is not new. From emancipation celebrations at the turn of the century to Alex Haley's "Roots," the celebrated book and miniseries of the 1970's, black Americans have long grappled with that era and its legacy. But some scholars say the recent burst of introspection, greatly inspired by the Afrocentric movement, represents a transition from feelings of shame and denial about slavery to an embrace of that painful past. Some have begun to call slavery by another name, dubbing it the black Holocaust, or "maafa," a Swahili word meaning "unspeakable horror."
"I guess the generation here in the 90's is doing what it is called to do, and that is to remember," said Velma Maia Thomas, curator of a black Holocaust exhibit in Atlanta. "To finally open up the wounds, so when we go into this next millennium, some healing has taken place."
This unsealing of memory has taken many forms. Across America, black couples jump over a broom to seal the bond of matrimony, a ritual created by slaves, who were often forbidden to marry. Along the shore of Coney Island in Brooklyn, hundreds gather each June, to pray and cast flowers into the sea in honor of the millions who perished during the voyage from Africa known as the Middle Passage. Hundreds more gather in September at Mount Vernon, Va., where they sing and pour libations in memory of the slaves owned by George Washington.
Blacks in New York City rallied in the early 1990's to preserve the African Burial Ground (originally Negro Burial Ground) in lower Manhattan, where slaves and free blacks were buried through the 18th century. Wynton Marsalis used slavery as the theme for his concert piece "Blood on the Fields" last year. "Middle Passage," a novel by Charles Johnson about the slave trade, won a 1990 National Book Award. Over 100,000 people have seen "Sankofa," a film about a black woman who travels in time to the slavery era.
Such a renewed perspective on the past is vital if black Americans are to overcome the travails of the present, said Zala Chandler, a professor in the department of literature, languages and philosophy at Medgar Evers College.
"What our children are doing, being able to kill each other so easily, has to do with the fact they haven't been given that history," said Ms. Chandler, who makes a point of discussing slavery with all of her classes. "It would be less likely if they understood what our ancestors went through, those who died and were buried in the Atlantic Ocean, and those who survived."
Experts estimate 40 million to 100 million Africans were taken to the Americas during the era of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Millions did not survive the voyage and their bodies were thrown overboard.
So it is at the sea that Ms. Chandler and hundreds of others gather each June. They go to Coney Island to gaze into the Atlantic Ocean, and with dance and song, speeches and prayer, remember those who were buried in the waters.
Ms. Chandler and other faculty members have coordinated the tribute for six years, usually in summer. But the first service was held in a colder time, forcing Ms. Chandler and others to remember their ancestors' suffering in a visceral way.
"It must have been the coldest day in November," Dr. Chandler, 48, recalled. "But to me it was the most spiritual one, because it helped us to remember that when they brought slaves to this country, they didn't wait until summertime."
Rituals like those at Coney Island reflect a willingness to examine the past that has long been discouraged, both among blacks, for whom slavery has often evoked feelings of pain and shame, and in the larger society, where it is often dismissed as a bygone era with little resonance.
"Slavery is a collective wound constantly being torn at by people who deny its importance," Mr. Dyson said, "by people who acknowledge other people's pain, but ignore slavery as a source of pain for black people."
Black Americans young and old speak of the cursory references to slavery in their schoolbooks, in which blacks were often portrayed as passive victims who achieved nothing before being enslaved. Some remember the overwhelming silence that surrounded the subject in their homes and communities.
"For people of my generation," said Roger Wilkins, a writer and history professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., "slavery was pushed away."
Now in his 60's, Mr. Wilkins recalled a day when his mother told him stories of their ancestors that he had never heard. "I said, 'Why didn't you tell me that when I was growing up?' " he said. "She said 'Well, Roger, I guess it is like the old folks used to say: we didn't like to clank our chains.' Apparently, that was a common expression among black people. It meant that slavery was a shameful past. People didn't want to look back at it.
"Now most black people's attitudes toward slavery have come 180 degrees, and they look at slavery with pride," said Mr. Wilkins, who believes today's interest is part of a continuum that first bloomed during the 1960's. "They say, 'I must be descended from some extraordinary people to have weathered that hideous storm.' "
Oswald Sykes did not ponder slavery enough to feel ashamed. But when he watched a scene from "Roots," or read a passage about it in a book, "I'd say, 'I would've killed somebody if they did that to me,' and that's as far as I'd get with it because I got angry," he said. "The Henrietta Marie gets you past that."
The former chief of mental health treatment services for New York's state hospitals, Mr. Sykes said he first saw artifacts from the sunken slaver in 1992, at a conference of the National Association of Black Scuba Divers. The shipwreck had been discovered in the Florida Straits years before.
"They brought the bell, the shackles," said Mr. Sykes. "And we didn't know what was happening to us. People were crying in front of each other. It had some ability to do something about our feelings that other things had been unable to do. We knew it was a moving thing."
A year later, he and 11 other divers from the group sailed out to sea and had a plaque lowered at the shipwreck site. Mr. Sykes, who now gives talks about the Henrietta Marie, wrote the inscription. "Speak her name," it reads, "and gently touch the souls of our ancestors."
After the ceremony, Mr. Sykes dived into the sea. "I felt a sense of comfort I'd never had," he said. "It was like there were lots of people with unseen hands saying, 'Glad to see you.' "
Many blacks have been similarly moved by the film "Sankofa," the story of a black woman who wanders into a Ghanaian slave dungeon, and back in time, where she is enslaved. She remains defiant and dignified despite her cruel circumstances.
Haile Gerima, a Howard University film professor who wrote and directed the independent film, said that often after screenings, members of the audience hug him.
"When their chest shoves toward my chest, they're crying," he said. "But it's not a cry of hate, not a cry of anger. But a cry of ecstasy. A cry that says, 'What I feel inside me is legitimate. I have the right to grieve. There's nothing wrong with that.' "
But some still do not want to remember. Mr. Gerima, who said he had great difficulty raising money for his film among both whites and blacks, said many found the topic too troublesome to embrace. A re-enactment of a slave auction last October in Colonial Williamsburg sparked outrage among many blacks, who said the dramatization ripped open a painful wound. Some question why a couple, by jumping the broom, would invoke memories of slavery on their wedding day.
"I've had people ask me, 'Why would you want to do something that points out slavery?" said Harriette Cole, who wrote "Jumping the Broom" (Henry Holt & Company), a wedding planner that talks about the rite. "But I see the beauty in it."
The book, published in 1993, has sold 70,000 copies. Ms. Cole, an editor at Essence magazine, who jumped the broom at her own wedding two years ago, said the flourishing of the ritual shows that many blacks are realizing they do not have to reach back to Africa for in tradition: "We can go to our grandparents, our great grandparents. We have family we can trace back to slavery."
Still, some who encourage others to take a look at those years of bondage say they understand how painful such reflection can be. Ms. Thomas, who manages the Shrine of the Black Madonna bookstore in Atlanta and created its exhibit, "The Black Holocaust," has spent many days fingering slave bills of sale and touching the neck irons slaves wore.
"I read about a child who was given from one slave holder to another for $1 as a gift, and I just have to put it down," said Ms. Thomas, 39, whose exhibit has drawn more than 50,000 viewers in four years and traveled as far as Houston.
She said she had seen men unable to bring themselves to enter a box that simulates the amount of space Africans had on slave ships. She has had to answer the anxious questions of her own 5-year-old son after he gazed at an effigy of a hanging man with whip marks across his back.
Because of her research, Ms. Thomas said she had come to realize how unvented sorrow about the past can lead to self-hatred and hostility. "I had no idea how devastating slavery was to us as a people," she said. "So now I look at us and say we have to be patient with each other, and understand there is still a lot of hurt wrapped up in us."
But she said she was heartened to see so many trying to purge the pain by taking a long look back.
"Every group of people is allowed to remember the past and pay homage to those who have come before them," she said. "Why shouldn't we? It's that whole ritual of memory and honor. That's part of being human."

GRAPHIC: Photos: "Feeling the Spirit: Searching the World for the People of Africa," Chester Higgins Jr.; Bantam Books  1994; To many black Americans, images of slavery, like those of field hands picking cotton, above, are as painful as they are familiar. But many have begun exploring the subject more openly. Oswald Sykes, left (Jim Carras for The New York Times), a diver, helped to lay a plaque at the site of a sunken slave ship. Black New Yorkers fought to preserve the African Burial Ground in lower Manhattan. Slaves buried there, right, had their hands crossed in a gesture that was believed to insure their souls' return to Africa. (Culver Pictures) (pg. 43)

A Resurrection in the South Bronx

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
Eleven floors up a pitch-black stairwell, walking in pigeon dung and rotting plaster, is a long way to go for a view. But the roof of Morrisania Hospital -- 20 years abandoned, ravaged by scavengers -- is well worth the hike.
 West from the roof lies curvaceous Yankee Stadium, the elevated train line snaking along its flank. South looms the skyline of Manhattan and a view to swoon for. In the foreground, the Bronx itself rolls in low and strong, right up to Morrisania's doors. 
 The Bronx is rarely, if ever, described as "majestic." But Morrisania Hospital is certainly that, a signature structure of the 1920's municipal architect Charles Meyers, whose work in New York City includes several hospitals and Manhattan's House of Detention for Men, better known as the Tombs. Built of steel and concrete, sheathed in blond brick and trimmed in stone, Morrisania Hospital was meant not as a fleeting figment on the landscape, but as a monument that would endure. Endure is what it has done, while around it raged the most devastating urban calamity America has seen.
 In the 1950's came Robert Moses, hacking at the community with what Moses himself described as "a meat ax" while building the Cross-Bronx Expressway. Neighborhoods that had been stable for most of the century dissolved, as the middle class fled and the poorest of the poor moved in. In the 1960's, landlords, insurance companies and banks left, too. In the 70's, fires were clearly visible from Yankee Stadium, as property owners cashed in on insurance and scavengers torched buildings to get at the copper wiring and pipes.
 The Bronx became the backdrop of choice for politicians who wished to tut-tut urban decay for the cameras. The South Bronx in particular became a synonym for urban decline, and was storied in film and literature as a ghost town, peopled primarily by criminals. The gospel of laissez faire preaches that government should do nothing to reverse the decay. But public funds and not-for-profit groups have rebuilt the Bronx from nothing.
 Borough President Fernando Ferrer's planners describe Morrisania Hospital as the last significant abandoned structure in the Bronx, which makes its impending refurbishment a cause for celebration. A not-for-profit group called the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, made up of Bronx pioneers, plans to begin the renovation in late summer.
 The State of New York has committed nearly $11 million in low-interest loans to the project. The rest of the money, more than $13 million, comes as an equity investment raised through the Federal low-income housing tax credit program. The state money was committed by the Cuomo administration. The Pataki administration would be wise to honor that commitment. The private-public collaboration fits Mr. Pataki's philosophy. The project will contain businesses, apartments, a day-care center, a family health-care center and P.S. 235, an elementary school specializing in science. There is a hum of anticipation along 167th Street. No longer will parents passing the hospital say to their small children "I was born there" and point to a building that is darkened and dead. Majestic, strong against the new Bronx sky, Morrisania Hospital is poised to rise again. BRENT STAPLES

HEADLINE: Drowning in The Second Wave

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich is Secretary of Labor.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"We are feeling the impact of the third great wave of change in history, and we are, as a result, in the process of creating a new civilization," writes the Speaker of the House in his foreword to "Creating a New Civilization: The Politics of the Third Wave," by his favorite futurists, Heidi and Alvin Toffler (published by the Progress and Freedom Foundation, Newt Gingrich's think-tank).
 It is Mr. Gringrich's credo. On his second day as Speaker, he issued Toffler-inspired marching orders to the House Ways and Means Committee: "I would suggest to you and to your staff, and to the witnesses you bring in, that about every policy we should ask the question, 'Does it accelerate our transition into a third wave information age, or does it slow it down?" 
 Ironically, the Speaker's own agenda does not pass this test. According to the Tofflers, third wave societies are based not on manufacturing products, but on creating, manipulating and distributing information. "Third wave operations," they say, "require diverse and continually evolving skills." Yet the Contract with America says almost nothing about skills or the workforce. Nowhere is there any proposal to help Americans struggling to swim from the second wave to the third. (The first wave was the agricultural South; the second, the industrialized North.) Instead, House Republicans are busy cutting the lifelines and puncturing the lifeboats.
 As "third wave" technologies fragment the old mass-production system, millions who used to work in or around factories need help just staying afloat. More than 11 percent of working families with at least one full-time wage earner have fallen into poverty -- up from 7 percent in the 1970's. Nearly one out of five workers who lost a full-time job between 1991 and 1993 was still without work last year. And among those who have landed new jobs, almost half are earning less than before.
 This is why the Administration has pushed for and achieved legislation to create a network of youth apprenticeships, to expand college loans and deliver them more cheaply and to combine unemployment insurance with easy access to job training. But too many Americans are still treading water.
 The Tofflers describe in futuristic terms an economic transformation that has been palpable for almost two decades. The well-skilled and well-connected already are riding the third wave. But most Americans are caught in the turbulence as the second wave crests and breaks. And that is the problem. It is not that the future is slow in coming; it's that it is coming for only some of us.
 The new Republican solution is to cut Federal funding for education, job-training and welfare, and to shift responsibility to the states. Less money but fewer strings. On the surface, the notion is attractive. Who's a better judge of what the families of Tacoma need -- Washington State or Washington, D.C.? But block grants are not the revolution their proponents promise. Ronald Reagan tried it, with disappointing results. Substituting state bureaucracies for Federal, and giving them less money to spend, won't help the millions of Americans who risk drowning in the new economy.
 There is another alternative that is genuinely radical and, in a real sense, "third wave." The key is equipping people to get jobs and to earn their own prosperity. For Americans who are unemployed, or have low incomes, we're proposing "skill grants," which are essentially training vouchers, worth up to $2,620 a year for up to two years, which can be used at any accredited institution.
 This represents a radical shift from programs to purchasing power. Instead of feeding the budgets of bureaucracies, Federal or state, the idea is to channel resources directly into the pockets of ordinary Americans so they can get the skills they need -- at the time, in the place, in the way that makes sense for them. Armed with up-to-date data on what skills and jobs are in demand, people can navigate their own careers.
 To this we would add a third wave tax incentive: making the money families spend on college tuition and job training tax-deductible, up to $10,000 a year per family. Under current law, any spending by business that can conceivably be called an investment qualifies for favorable tax treatment, including business lunches. Yet the tax code does not give families a break for investments linked most directly to raising living standards -- investments in education and lifelong job training.
 By contrast, there's nothing third wave about the G.O.P.'s proposed tax incentives. Giving corporations far larger tax deductions for purchasing equipment, machinery and buildings may indeed increase investment somewhat. But apart from the fact that this would drain the Treasury of about $169 billion over 10 years, it is far from clear that new tax breaks for capital will help working Americans adapt to a transforming economy. Spending on new machines and buildings is necessary but no longer sufficient for third wave prosperity.

The Republican proposal to cut taxes on capital gains has similar difficulties. The problem is not simply that most of the immediate benefits would go to the well-off. Evidence linking this tax break to any significant and sustained investment increase is weak. And once again, it is a policy at odds with the Tofflerian notion that "the allocation of wealth" is far less important than the "allocation of knowledge." It's essentially focused on the buying and selling of objects and has little to do with insights.
 The Tofflers argue that political conflict in the United States is largely a battle between second save groups fighting over the scraps of a decaying system. Their criticisms are bipartisan: The "Democrats' reflexive reliance on bureaucratic and centralist solutions . . . draw straight from second wave theories of efficiency." We have tried to fix that.
 But the Contract only deepens the flaw that the Tofflers diagnose in the other party: "Republicans tend to play down the potentially immense social dislocations that are likely to flow from any changes as profound as the third wave . . . Free marketism and trickle-downism twisted into rigid theological dogma are an inadequate response."
 At the close of the 20th century, there is a danger that America's well-educated third wave is losing sight of its second save compatriots. Some societies, perhaps, can endure even when their members no longer have a common culture or common prospects. But America -- at least an America recognizable as itself -- cannot. As the Tofflers put it, "We need to feel our way, leaving no group behind, as we create the future in our midst." Precisely.

AIDS on the Air

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Less than a decade ago William F. Buckley was proposing that "everyone detected with AIDS" be tattooed on the buttocks. Time has certainly marched on. This week Mr. Buckley's National Review will publish a memoir called "Positively HIV" in which David Brudnoy, the conservative ratings champ of New England talk radio and a National Review contributor since 1968, graphically describes his own near-death experience with AIDS last fall and the subsequent outpouring of affection with which his audience greeted the revelation of both his illness and his homosexuality.
 Not that everyone has been supportive. Mr. Brudnoy writes that "most conservatives take a dim view of homosexual activity" and that "some conservatives" now feel "that the Brudnoy they thought was on their side must be a fraud because homosexuals can't be conservative." 
 Mr. Brudnoy is hardly a fraud. He speaks well of Phil Gramm and touts the economic credos of the John Birch Society. "The Bell Curve" has pride of place in the studio WBZ set up for him in his Back Bay apartment.
 Yet the same libertarian conservatism that leads Mr. Brudnoy to mock Bubba and oppose big government also drives him to support gays in the military, gay marriages and condom distribution in schools. Isn't this what many of his friends demonize as "the gay agenda"? Mr. Brudnoy replies: "My only gay agenda is to live."
 Though rail-thin and requiring a cane to negotiate Boston streets, Mr. Brudnoy is back doing his five-hour radio show five nights a week, with energy left over to teach at Boston University and review movies for a local newspaper chain. (He also reviewed "Angels in America" -- loved the drama, hated the "puerile" politics.) At 54, he talks of living at least three or four more years. He exults in the limelight -- eight minutes on "Oprah," three pages in People -- and pictures a former Yale classmate, Sam Waterston, playing him in a talked-about movie-of-the-week.
 What prompted me to visit Mr. Brudnoy, though, was the prospect of tweaking him. Isn't he sitting right on the divide between economic and religious conservatives that threatens to split the G.O.P.? How can he defend Newt Gingrich, who has accused "active homosexuals" of recruiting the young in counseling programs? Could he vote for a '96 ticket that subscribed to the gay-bashing rhetoric of the religious right?
 After a lot of pressing, Mr. Brudnoy answers the last of those questions: "I'm not sure I would." He also allows that he resigned as film critic for The American Spectator in the 1980's rather than countenance its "stupidly vicious" treatment of homosexuals. He describes the religious right's rhetoric about gay people as "grotesque" -- a word he also applies to hypocritical conservatives who tolerate their own gay friends "but say everyone else is a faggot."
 While Mr. Brudnoy is politically timid, he isn't a hypocrite. He can't be mistaken for Roy Cohn or Terry Dolan of the National Conservative Political Action Committee, closeted gay AIDS casualties of the 1980's who vilified homosexuals in their public lives. Though in the closet until last fall -- to the point of making clandestine visits to a Washington doctor who treats "a couple of other well-known conservative AIDS patients" -- Mr. Brudnoy has publicly argued for gay rights since 1970.
Even so, he disdains angry confrontational politics and "gay activists." He doesn't believe in raising his voice. But he sounds almost angry when he speaks of how Barry Goldwater has been "invited out" of the conservative movement for extending his libertarian principles to bedroom issues. And Mr. Brudnoy despairs that anyone will win over the "family values" demagogues in the G.O.P. in this millennium.
 His National Review piece notwithstanding, Mr. Brudnoy says, "I don't want to be a poster boy for AIDS." He'd rather enjoy what time he has left. But the fact remains that he's a hugely popular conservative talk-show star destined to fight AIDS before a million empathic listeners in 38 states, New Hampshire included, during a Presidential campaign. Republican candidates rushing to embrace the religious right and its anti-gay agenda should at the very least stay tuned.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Unsigned Free Agents Might Have a Place To Showcase Talents

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Players Association planned to run a spring camp this month in Homestead, Fla., for the players who were going to make their all-star tour starting next month, playing games for charity as a way of reminding fans who the real major leaguers were.
Now that the real major leaguers are on the verge of returning to work, the union plans to convert the Homestead site into a camp for free agents. Invited participants will be the slightly more than 100 players who voluntarily became free agents last fall and remain unsigned and perhaps another 100 or more who became free agents involuntarily, by being released or not being tendered contracts. 
 If the owners accept the players' offer to end their strike, the 1,069 players on major league rosters will have camps to go to for spring training. Even the more than 800 who are unsigned will be able to join their teams while their agents negotiate their contracts.
But the unsigned free agents will have nowhere to go to get themselves into shape so the union will invite them to Homestead. Details have not been worked out, but the union plans to commit formally tomorrow to a lease for this month.
The camp will be unique and could become the site where scouts from all or many of the clubs flock to scrutinize the available talent. The players haven't been seen playing since last August, and eight months is an unusually long time for players to spend off the field.
Lawyers for the owners, the players and the National Labor Relations Board fought over the voluntary free agents in court Friday, but it has been so long since the free agents became free agents that it's not certain anyone remembers who they are.
Teams looking for starting pitchers may want to send scouts to Homestead to watch Orel Hershiser, Kevin Brown, Danny Darwin, Bill Swift, Bob Tewksbury, Todd Stottlemyre, Bobby Witt, Jim Deshaies, Tim Belcher, Scott Sanderson, Fernando Valenzuela, Zane Smith, Dave Stewart, Frank Viola and Bob Welch.
They also could see Steve Ontiveros, whose 2.65 earned run average was the lowest among American League starters last season, and Terry Mulholland, whose 6.49 e.r.a. was one of the highest.
Anyone in the market for a relief pitcher could check out Dennis Eckersley, John Franco, Jeff Russell, Jay Howell and Doug Jones. Catchers they might see include Pat Borders, Benito Santiago, Brian Harper and Mike Macfarlane.
A nice collection of players for other positions may show up, too: Brett Butler, Mickey Tettleton, Larry Walker, Mark Grace, John Kruk, Mike Devereaux, B. J. Surhoff, Andy Van Slyke, Bo Jackson, Kevin McReynolds, Vince Coleman, Eric Davis, Mariano Duncan, Dave Magadan and Terry Pendleton.
Dave Winfield and Andre Dawson would add a touch of class to the camp.
Despite the eight-week ban on signings of players by individual clubs, some free agents may have deals that have been worked out but obviously not announced. One agent, Tony Attanasio, said clubs have contacted him about some of his clients and in one instance a manager called a client directly.
"I'm sure these guys have been told whatever you do don't do anything substantive," Attanasio said. "They're told you can talk, but don't sign anybody before we get though with this appeal thing."
The clubs are appealing a Federal judge's order that the Player Relations Committee cannot serve as the exclusive representative in contract negotiations. Meanwhile, the commissioner's office issued a list of talking points for club officials following the issuance of the injunction. One of the nine points regarded free agents.
"Without a collective bargaining agreement and crippled by strike-related losses, clubs will be unable to offer huge new contracts to free agent players," it said. "In some cases, they won't be able to sign free agents at all."
Hearing that point, one agent said, "It sounds a little bit like collusion to me."
 
More Recruits for New League
 In recent years, an increasing number of veteran or otherwise marginal players have failed to find jobs in the major leagues. That trend certainly will continue this year and, in fact, will probably approach epidemic proportions. Clubs will not want to expend their decreased funds or abbreviated spring training time on players they can't be certain will help them now.
Ordinarily, that would mean the end of careers for most of the unemployed. But there could be a United Baseball League in those players' futures.
Organizers of the budding league, which plans to begin play next year, couldn't have asked for a better scenario than the one that has unfolded and will continue to develop. Not only will they have a larger supply of potential recruits than they might have anticipated, but they also could benefit from the deep animosity the labor dispute has engendered.
The league had planned to wait until late summer or fall to begin signing players, but player agents have urged league officials to advance their timetable and begin signing players now, if only to future contracts.
Agents figure to be instrumental in the success or failure of the venture because they can steer players to the United League if they see it as a viable alternative to major league baseball. Already many agents like the idea that the new league promises to be player-friendly.
Base salaries won't be as high as players have become accustomed to, but players will have two unique incentives for going United. As a group, players will have an equity share in franchises, and as team members, they will receive a 35 percent share of that team's pretax profits.
League officials continue to study potential sites for teams in the New York and Los Angeles areas. Franchises already have been awarded to Washington, New Orleans, Vancouver and San Juan.
 
A Creative Spin From Bench
 When judges are called on to decide a baseball dispute, no matter who the litigious parties are, they can't resist speaking from the bench in baseballese. Judge Sonia Sotomayor, the Federal judge who put major league baseball back on track, was no different, but she at least was more creative than and not as trite as most of her predecessors.
In fact, she brought an imagery to the proceeding that probably had some of the spectators in the courtroom drooling for live, legitimate baseball.
The judge did not say "Batter up" or "Play ball," as too many jurists have. In reading her 47-minute ruling from the bench, she began this way:
"I can't help but to at least borrow some analogies from baseball as I start. The often leisurely game of baseball is filled with many small moments which catch a fan's breath. There is, for example, that wonderful second when you see an outfielder backpedaling and jumping up to the wall, and time stops for an instant as he jumps up and you finally figure out whether it is a home run, a double or a single off the wall, or an out."
"Unwillingly," she continued, "I have been drafted onto the deck of this field, with those of you watching out there waiting for one of those small moments to happen. I personally would have liked more time to practice my swing."
But when she took her swing, she whacked the owners like Dave Winfield used to hit line drives.
 
Sharing the Wealth
 The check's in the mail -- even for replacement players.
The union mailed checks from its strike fund Friday, sending money to players who had major league service time in the years the licensing money was retained. That means even players other than those on strike will receive checks, including players who took part in replacement exhibition games this spring.
Among those who did so but who nevertheless will get money from the union are Darren Reed, Hector Villanueva, Mike Schooler, Junior Ortiz, Eric Yelding, Mickey Weston, Juan Guerrero, Lonnie Maclin, Rob Mallicoat, Denis Boucher, Shawn Abner, Wayne Rosenthal, Doug Saunders and Bob Ayrault.

HEADLINE: Mexican Peso's Wake Makes Mideast Waves

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The Mexican monetary crisis appears to have foreign policy reverberations that have reached the Middle East. 
 In the wake of the sudden and precipitous devaluation of the Mexican peso last Dec. 20, and the flight of international capital as a result of that devaluation, Mexico has taken steps to stem the outflow. Austerity measures taken to stabilize the Mexican economy, coupled with an already weakened Mexican peso, have transformed Mexico's large deficit in trade before the fateful devaluation into a surplus in trade in the first quarter of 1995, which is projected to be substantial for the entire year.
 The implications of this reversal are of great consequence to the United States economy. The United States was ironically one of the major contributors to the Mexican trade deficit, most of which was accumulated as a result of American merchandise being sold to our prosperous neighbor.
 Now that Mexico is unwilling and unable to purchase our goods, compounding our own chronic trade deficit problem, the United States has to find another market.
Once again we appear to be turning to the Middle East. After a stop in Saudi Arabia, Defense Secretary William Perry visited other Persian Gulf states. He told the Saudis, Iraq's main rival, that the United States has solid evidence that Iraq has rebuilt its armed forces to a threatening level. The Saudis, with wealth derived from oil, are being urged to arm themselves to match Iraq's "buildup."
 A similar message is being delivered to Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and others in the Persian Gulf, with warnings that Iran, the gulf states' other neighboring nemesis, is deploying weapons of mass destruction in the Persian Gulf.
 There should be less menacing methods to address our trade deficit problem.

 In your March 25 front-page article on the House welfare bill, you quote the unsubstantiated ideas of Representative James M. Talent of Missouri. Mr. Talent states that the public assistance system, while "trying to give people material wealth and lift them out of poverty, is luring them into a kind of spiritual poverty by destroying their families and their incentives to work." 
 This poppycock, which the Republican majority repeats with the hope that if they say it enough, it will catch on as truth, has no support from any responsible research.
 In reality, people don't work because jobs don't exist. When they can't work, they turn to public assistance for food and rent money.
 According to the Current Population Survey of the United States Census, New York City lost 300,000 jobs in 1990 and 1991. Not surprisingly, the public assistance caseload increased from 369,765 cases in 1989 to 475,850 cases in 1992. When economic expansion creates additional jobs, assistance rolls will experience a similar decline.
 I suggest that Mr. Talent and his colleagues look to the cities of Calcutta, Rio, Manila and Mexico City for proof that eliminating social safety nets leads not to spiritual enrichment but to abject misery.

HEADLINE: You Might as Well Say 'Bon Appetit"

BYLINE: By RUTH REICHL 

 BODY:
As Congress began to debate the dismantling of the Federal school lunch program, many people looked back at their own school days and said, "Good riddance."
Childhood memories came flooding back -- of squishy spaghetti and gray hamburgers floating in an indefinable liquid. Some of us remembered the horrors of creamed chipped beef, others the ladies in hairnets who dished out the slop and the vile smell of the school lunchroom itself. 
 Personally, I can't forget the taste of the breaded veal patties that were served in my school every Thursday. I thought that if today's children hate their school lunches as much as my friends and I did, perhaps it was time to rethink the whole program.
And so, my mind firmly fixed on dreary food and the endless waste -- all that food we threw out! -- I set off to discover if school lunch was still as awful.
My first stop was Stuyvesant High School on Chambers Street in downtown Manhattan. It was a shock. I walked into the lunchroom and found myself facing a line of windows looking out over the Hudson River. The large, airy cafeteria is considerably more attractive than most corporate canteens I've seen and nothing like the lunchroom in any school I ever attended.
The sound was different, too; what I heard was the cheerful buzz of people deciding what to eat. As groups of teen-agers spread out, some lining up at the "trend bar" and others at the "deli counter," I found myself waiting in line at the "theme canteen." Here, the students and I chose between chicken chow mein with rice (it was delicious) or broccoli and pasta. Broccoli and pasta? I wondered if the people who made the food were insane: Surely teenagers don't actually eat broccoli.
Wrong. The students at Stuyvesant were happily heaping their plates with bright green vegetables and pasta. Even more surprising, the next line snaked toward a salad bar, where girls with gleaming hair pointed to a bowl of spinach with sliced mushrooms and croutons. Clearly, times have changed.
Stuyvesant's lunchroom sold hamburgers, too, but they didn't float. They came wrapped in foil, just like the ones at McDonald's and Burger King. And by the time I had drenched my low-fat patty with ketchup and sprinkled salt on the oven-baked fries, it was tasty enough to pass for a bad-for-you kind of burger. Actually, any student who feels the need for a fast-food fix is free to walk out the door. (My generation was captive to the system, but this one is not.) That the vast majority of students choose to eat at school is partly because of economics: the full price of lunch at Stuyvesant is $1, and many students receive free or reduced-price (40-cent) meals.
Credit for the lunchtime crowd also goes to Andreas Skouras, Stuyvesant's cook, who admits that he "improves" the recipes the district sends him by using lots of fresh garlic, herbs and spices. "They just love my soups," he said happily. No wonder; all the food I tasted was good.
And there is another factor: the nutritional savvy of the modern teen-ager.
"There's been a big change in the kids in the 12 years I've been in school food service," said Lynn Fiumi, school food service manager at Stuyvesant. Today's students, she said, "are very nutrition conscious." And she doesn't just mean the girls. Boys and girls alike, she notes, are anxious to fill their bodies with healthy ingredients.
"They want to know what's in everything," Ms. Fiumi said. "They love the spinach salad, they love carrots, they insist on skim milk. This is just not what I'm used to. They even want to look at the books and find out how much fat, salt and sugar there is in everything we serve. They are much more informed."
Stuyvesant, of course, is a state-of-the-art magnet high school for scientifically inclined college-bound students. I expected to find a very different situation at P.S. 137, which occupies a graffiti-scarred, rubble-strewn street in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge.
Walking into the lunchroom, I found the principal, Ron Salazar, standing by the kitchen door chewing on a chicken leg. Boys darted under his arms munching on apples and pieces of melon, while a little girl tried to sneak past him to filch a second carton of milk from the cooler. (Extra milk is easy to get -- pupils who don't want their milk put their unopened cartons in a special place --but she wanted an ice-cold one. )
"I eat lunch with the kids every day," Mr. Salazar said. "It's a great way to get to know them." He looked down at his plate and sighed.
I nodded sympathetically and said, "It must be really difficult having to eat here."
Mr. Salazar nodded. "Yes," he replied, "it is." Then he patted his substantial belly and explained, "I'd really like to lose a little weight, but the food here is just too good."
At P.S. 137 the dining room and the gym share a single space. While one group of children ran relay races, another lined up for lunch, marching into the kitchen to choose between freshly roasted chicken or cheese-stuffed pasta shells.
I was certain that the small children who attended the school would not be interested in nutrition. Wrong again. Just above the salad bar was a sign. It said: "To the kitchen staff: Thanks for all you have done for us." It was signed, in childish handwriting, "The nutrition committee."
The nutrition committee? In elementary school?
Barbara Gulotta, director of food technology for the New York City schools, said that every school in the city has one. "We want the children's feedback," she said. "It's no good making nutritious lunches if the children don't eat them. Taste is the most powerful tool that we have."
And the New York school system seems to be turning tastes around at a time when other locales across the country have abandoned school lunch to fast-food providers.
"I can tell you that there are some major problems with the national school lunch program," said John Gleason of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington., noting that Taco Bell has gone into nearly 3,000 schools nationwide and that Pizza Hut is in 3,500 of the schools that participate in the national school lunch program.
At P.S. 137, Mr. Salazar, an admitted junk-food eater, said he rarely ate the salads that are served every day, but his students were happily tucking into fat chunks of cucumbers and tomatoes.
I didn't blame them. The salads were fresh and fine and delicious. So was the chicken. And I couldn't blame the children who ignored the mixed vegetables that were doled out with the pasta and chicken; I didn't eat the dreary mixture of frozen winter vegetables, either.
Still, it was just about the only thing the children left on their plates.
"You going to eat that?" one little boy asked another, eyeing his barely tasted chicken.
His friend hunched protectively over his plate. "Yes," he replied, "I am."
The first little boy looked sad. Later, as they dashed joyously for the door and the freedom of the weekend, I heard him talking to his friend. "You know the only thing I'm going to miss about school?" he asked. Barely waiting for an answer, he shouted "Lunch!"

HEADLINE: Franchise Fervor in the Ivory Tower

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
They stood eye to eye and nose to nose for almost 40 minutes, exchanging heavy talk, soulful looks and angry glares outside Mrs. Fields Cookies at the food court entrance, he a brooding Ethan Hawke in leather jacket with white fur collar, she a waiflike Wynona Ryder in black.
It was the kind of minor mall world melodrama that plays out all the time whenever kids gather over their Whoppers, Pizza Hut personal pan pizzas and Freshens Premium Yogurt -- everywhere from Tysons Corner Center in suburban Washington to the Galleria in Dallas and Phipps Plaza in Atlanta. The only difference was that this was no shopping center, it was the student union at Boston University. 
 More and more, the Golden Arches are entering the Ivory Tower. And Metropolitan Boston, with its 250,000 students at 57 colleges and universities, reflects the trend.
At one extreme is Boston University with its glitzy new $5.7 million food court in the George Sherman Student Union and its plans to remodel the university bookstore into the first on-campus Barnes and Noble superstore.
At the other is Harvard, with its elegant 19th century dining halls where students -- or their parents -- still pay for the traditional 21-meals-a-week plan that finances the university's $22 million-a-year residential food service program. No one expects a Jack in the Box or a Taco Bell in Harvard Yard, though even Harvard will offer an upscale grazing emporium on campus this fall that includes a familiar name or two.
Across the country from Boston to California, the question is not whether to wed college and commercial culture, but how far to take the merger -- a merger that has raised revenues for many schools, along questions about the balance between economic realities and an atmosphere traditionally associated with higher learning.
Increasingly, the culture and values of the mall are coloring the culture and values of the university; even schools resisting the trend are taking note of it.
"We think the Harvard name is better than the Pizza Hut name, so we don't tend to mingle," says Michael P. Berry, director of dining services at Harvard, who also does service consulting for other universities. "But I think you'll see in general that especially in schools that have a vibrant student center or union, you'll see those student unions become increasingly malls with multiple stores. Let's face it, Main Street America doesn't exist anymore. Mall America exists. Why should collegiate life be the last bastion of something that doesn't exist anymore?"
Why indeed? Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., offers Pizza Hut and Taco Bell in its student center. And the University of South Carolina has had a 14-store shopping mall in its student center for the last 10 years. "We built a mall on campus because today's students are mall children," said Richard Wertz, the school's director of business and finance. "They grew up going to the shopping malls and looking for branded concepts. They all have VCR's and computers and everything else as opposed to 10 or 20 years ago. Colleges have to adapt to changing times." The mall has generated $1 million in scholarship money for the university.
While there has been some commercial presence on campuses for decades, with bank branches and the occasional fast food outlet in the student union, the pressures to increase the commerce have risen dramatically. Universities, under growing financial stress, are receptive to almost anything that promises to cut costs or increase revenue.
And students who have grown up eating at Taco Bell and breezing over to the Blockbuster Video have come to expect the brand name at, or near, their university. "I remember a place in Denver that used to advertise, 'No arches, no clown, just the best burgers in town,' " says David Suiter, now a reference librarian at Boston University. "You'd look at it and think, 'Naah, I don't think so.' There's something scary about a nonfranchise place."
In general, schools get a fee and a percentage of proceeds for allowing franchises on campus. The franchises also get them out of the labor-intensive and costly food service business.
Mr. Berry of Harvard said a recent study indicated that 92 percent of schools would consider bringing commercial brand names on campus, 54 percent do it and 62 percent say there is a lot of student pressure to do it.
For their part, corporations, who have already filled most of the prime commercial locations, are lusting after the roughly 12 million students on the campuses of about 3,500 colleges and universities. Denny Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's International Inc., based in Columbus, Ohio, said some fast-food companies may feign indifference to confuse the competition, but they are all eager to get a share of the campus business.
"People will lie about it, but this is a big deal, a very big deal," said Mr. Lynch, whose company operates on 13 campuses including the University of Michigan, the University of Texas, Ohio State, Rutgers and the University of Toledo. "Nontraditional sites, particularly college campuses, are very hot. There is a captive audience of your customers 18 to 24, actually 18 to 30, that is a very important customer base."
And so Barnes & Noble Bookstores Inc. (an offshoot of Barnes & Noble Inc.) now anonymously runs hundreds of campus bookstores, while youth-oriented businesses like Clinique Cosmetics, Mailboxes etc., Body Shop, Blockbuster Video and Perry Ellis clothes have cropped up at student unions.
Given President John Silber's oft-stated interest in bringing hard-nosed business practices to academia, it's not surprising that Boston University, with its sprawling 29,000-student campus on the south side of the Charles River, is in the forefront of the merging of campus and commerce.
Recent graduates say they find the new look a little disorienting when they return to visit.
"I walked in there and my jaw dropped to the floor, it was like the Prudential Center only nicer, with mahagony furnishings and TV's in every corner," said Rachelle Sanders, a 1990 B.U. graduate who is now assistant director of public relations at Trinity College in Connecticut. "I guess it's the new B.U., and I liked it, but I thought, 'This is a bit much."'
When university officials planned the student center renovation, they visited airport dining plazas and malls around the country, including the huge Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., to get ideas for the layout and design.
What they came up with is all neon, chrome, steel and bustle. There is a convenience store built to look like a 7-Eleven or Majik Market. The food area, operated by the Aramark Corporation, the giant Philadelphia food company that caters airline meals and runs mall food courts, has a snack area, with Mrs. Fields cookies, Avanti gourmet coffee and Freshens Premium Yogurt. The central section houses Burger King, D'Angelo's Deli, Pizza Hut and four nonfranchise options -- from a Mexican food operation to something called Changing Scenes, whose electric sign changes colors and whose menu includes Cajun catfish, shrimp jambalya and blackened swordfish.
"It's better than the school I came from -- all they had was a Roy Rogers and some sandwiches," said Annemarie Foley, who recently transferred from Nassau Community College to B.U. Smoking a cigarette and sitting by one of the 13 television sets as she ate a Burger King cheeseburger, she added: "And I can watch Sally Jesse Raphael, too."
Like many schools, B.U. offers a hybrid meal plan. Students can pick from six dining options, with some heavy on traditional dorm dining and others offering more fast-food meals a week.
A number of B.U. students, like those in the Warren Tower dormitory dining room, say they prefer the slower pace of the dining halls, where the premium is more on conversation than eating and running. "I come here with a couple of friends, and we can sit and talk," says Chris Laphrop, a freshman who says he avoids the Sherman Center. "I couldn't concentrate there. It's too loud."
But given the pace at B.U., where many students live off campus and cram as much study into as few years as possible, fast food makes sense for others.
"There is a lot more pressure to make sure you have experience to get jobs to pay off your loans," said Christina Glendon, who works part time at a campus dining hall, volunteers at a museum, runs a show on a local radio station and is a full-time student. She added: "Socializing is really speeding up -- you gotta eat quick. Nobody talks anymore."
Across the river at M.I.T., all the dorms once had dining halls -- sociable islands on a campus with legendary academic pressures. But because of increasing financial strains, three of the six halls have closed in recent years, and none serves lunch anymore. M.I.T. Students either use dorm kitchens, the microwaves in their rooms or they eat at the Harold E. Lobdell Memorial Dining Room's food court -- a slightly smaller version of the lineup fond at B.U. -- Pizza Hut, Burger King and D'Angelo's.
The traditional dining halls still have a distinct following among some students at M.I.T. At Baker Hall, instead of two- or four-person plastic mall tables, kids are sitting around big round tables, in groups of five or six and actually conversing. There's boisterous, animated talk about sports or physics labs or boring lectures.
Baker Hall, built 45 years ago, was designed by the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. It was designed not as a mall but as a dorm, with the idea that the dining hall, on the lower level of a skylight atrium, would be the principal architectural element.
"It's important for students to have a place to get together, so that a dorm is something other than a place to eat and sleep," said Adam London, a senior studying aerospace engineering who recently completed his term as dorm president. "There's so much pressure here to get good grades, to go to grad school, to go to med school, you need something like this to bring people together."
But the truth is that most students want both the mall and the dining area, and the more they gravitate toward the mall, the more dubious the survival of dorm dining halls. At Baker, students have organized a committee to try to cut costs to keep the dining hall open, and losses of $10,000 a month have been cut in half.
But, though it may be one of the nation's most prestigious universities, M.I.T. last year ran a $13 million operating deficit and hopes to trim $40 million in costs over the next three years. Some at M.I.T. fear there's a good chance the dorm dining halls will be among the things to go.
The fast-food franchises have helped both B.U. and M.I.T. financially. At B.U., food is a $28 million business, and food services have always been profitable, but the new food court led to a dramatic increase in revenues, says Craig Hill, assistant vice president of business affairs.
"It's much more profitable than it was before," said Mr. Hill, who declined to release specific figures. "It's just a more efficient operation. Labor costs as a percentage of sales are much lower, food costs are lower and sales are way up."
At M.I.T., the $10 million food operations have finally reached a break-even point for the university after years of running deficits.
Robert McBurney, Aramark's food service director at M.I.T., says every school is different in terms of what students and the university want. (Aramark serves more than 200 million meals a year at more than 350 colleges and universities) But he said outside contractors save universities money in numerous ways.
"There are reduced employee benefit costs, and employees are on our payroll and not the university's," he said. "Food purchasing power is much greater because we can do one-stop shopping with national suppliers. We have computerized food production systems and accounting systems. There's just a level of expertise that's beyond what a university can provide."
Bill Dillon, vice president for market development of Aramark's campus service division, says the company usually increases food-service revenues at universities by 10 to 15 percent.
It's a bit different up Massachusetts Avenue at Harvard University.
True, many students want some relief from the meal plan, and it seems likely that before long, such eating plans will probably include a few hundred dollars' worth of "points" that can be used outside the dorms at campus snack bars and pizza parlors.
And when the university completes its $26 million renovation of historic Memorial Hall next year, with its soaring cathedral design and $6 million of stained glass, its lower level Loker Commons will include Harvard's tony, largely non-branded, version of a food court.
There will be a sweet shop with Freshens yogurt; a Southwestern cuisine area called Cilantro, with marinated and charbroiled meats and up to six kinds of salsa; Cafe Zinc, with panini sandwiches of artichoke with provolone and roasted peppers; Harvard's in-house Greenhouse pizza in California concepts like Moo Shu Pizza and designer soups that combine zucchini with red peppers or grilled eggplant with polenta .
After all, even Harvard students sometimes want a smidgeon of mall culture. "Have you ever been to Dartmouth?" Liza Studen, a junior from Cleveland asked Jennifer Weh, a junior from Farmington Hills, Mich., over lunch at Eliot House one afternoon. "The food is so much better. It's like eating at Friday's."
But for the most part, Harvard undergraduates are not much interested in changing the venerable house system, and Mr. Berry is quick to extol its academic, intellectual and social virtues, with meals a time for conversation as much as food. Having studied at Oxford and the University of Chicago and having worked at the University of California at Irvine before he came to Harvard in 1991, he also knows that well-endowed Harvard is one of the few places where the venerable dining hall system can work.
"Our hourly wage is $15.90 an hour with benefits," he said. "The food service industry was meant to run on minimum wage." How, he asked, can most universities "run a food service on $15.90 an hour if, from a totally fiscal standpoint, the numbers don't pencil? So there are big arguments for privatizing."
As for arguments against it, Mr. Berry said, "the question is, do these outside entities understand the mission of the university or do they understand the mission of The Gap?"
So far, most of the franchise activity on campus has been in food service, but the next wave is clearly in consumer goods.
Even now, the six-story Boston University Bookstore Mall is a testament to the buying power and consumer needs of today's students. It carries MacIntosh and IBM computers, $800 Global Village One World Faxes, $33 Simpsons screensavers, $499 IBM Laserprinters, $169 Nikon Discmans, $285 Mount Blanc pens and $54.95 Braun Coffeemakers.
This summer the store, which does $20 million in business a year, excluding computers and other areas run independently, will be remodeled into a Barnes and Noble Superstore -- Barnes and Noble at Boston University, a lease-management arrangement in which the university will get a fee from Barnes and Noble, plus a share of revenues. Next door will be an outlet of The Gap, under a standard tenant arrangement: The store will pay a rental fee to operate on land owned by the university.
Already, marketing students at Stetson University in Florida operate a franchise of the Body Shop, which sells cosmetics. And last year, DePaul University opened the Chicago Music Mart, a 15-tenant mall, which includes retailers like Baldwin Piano and Organ, Carl Fischer Music, the Crow's Nest (which sells compact discs) and other shops.
So far, most schools are resisting this second wave of franchises. The University of Maryland is redoing its student union but has decided to limit its commercial service shops to stores allied to academic pursuits, like Mailboxes etc., which offers fax, copying and shipping.
And a number of older East Coast universities have held the line against franchises altogether. "I'm here to study," said Sharon Goldstein, a junior from Boston at Clark University, "not go shopping."
All this franchising presents universities with new ethical and business dilemmas.
"There are touchy questions about how far to take it," said Mr. Wertz of the University of South Carolina. "There's a fine line about how far is too far."
At Texas A&M University, a top administrator last November was convicted of soliciting benefits from Barnes and Noble Bookstores in connection with a $10 million contract awarded in 1990 to operate the university bookstore. Law enforcement officials are investigating possible impropieties in other A&M outside contracts as well.
And at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, it's not a question of misconduct, but of how much to mingle the two cultures. In January, the Georgia Tech Athletic Association and McDonald's announced a $5.5 million sponsorship program, designed to help fund a $25 million renovation that includes a $12 million upgrade of its main athletic arena, Alexander Memorial Coliseum.
But under the terms of the 25-year agreement, the coliseum can be renamed either McDonald's Center or Alexander Memorial Coliseum at McDonald's Center. McDonald's also gets the right to put its logo on the coliseum floor, the exterior of the building, the backs of players' chairs, the scoreboard and all tickets and promotional materials. And it can build a large freestanding monument as a sign and get free advertising space in all inside front covers of basketball and football programs for seven years.
In March, the Georgia Attorney General said the arrangement violated the State Constitution because it improperly mingles "the commercial name and reputation of McDonald's with the good will, property and higher education programs of the state."
University and corporate officials are trying to put together a deal that will meet with state approval. And school officials, while pointing out that the athletic association is independent of the university administration, say the issues raised are not easy ones.
"Everyone is asking the question of how far can an institution go before it becomes unseemly, tawdry, improper," said Jim Langley, vice president for external affairs at Georgia Tech. "We believe this is probably a recognition of modern realities, and we hope that it sends a signal of a university that is trying to respond to economic realities in an innovative way and doing so without taxpayer support."
Still, Georgia Tech has its limits. "In this deal we have negotiated with McDonald's, they cover the floor during commencements," Mr. Langley said. "We thought a commercial trademark at a commencement would be inappropriate."
At Harvard, meanwhile, the marketing dilemmas have more to do with what to put the university name on than with what names to bring on campus. The hot new product on campus is Crimson Gourmet Coffee, roasted exclusively for Harvard by Seattle's Best Coffee, sold in $49 gift boxes and advertised in the Harvard alumni magazine under the headline, "You went to The School. Now drink The Coffee."
"Here's something else," Mr. Berry said, handing a visitor a small box of Harvard Commemorative Chocolates. Inside were three pieces of dark sweet chocolate handcrafted by V.I.P. Sweets of Boston, each bearing the Harvard seal.
"That veritas shield," he said happily. "That's a logo as good as Coke."

HEADLINE: Embargoed Fuel Sent To Serbs via Albania

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: SHKODER, Albania, March 29

 BODY:
As the warring parties in Bosnia gear up for their expected spring offensive, vast quantities of high-grade fuel, which is used in tanks and fighter jets, are being openly smuggled across the lake here into Yugoslavia, in violation of a United Nations embargo.
The flow of jet fuel from this small country to Yugoslavia gushed a couple of months ago, and is believed to be destined for "the Serbian war machine," as one Western diplomat put it. In addition, millions of gallons of regular gasoline and diesel fuel have moved in recent months from Albania to its northern neighbor. 
 The United States has repeatedly expressed its concerns to the Albanian Government about the trade, which sanctions monitors in Europe say has reached nearly one million gallons a day at times.
The Clinton Administration is considering an official diplomatic note, as this country on the Adriatic has become the fuel highway to its pariah neighbor.
On a 20-mile stretch of bad road that runs along the lake, there are at least 20 gas stations, whose underground tanks can hold some 450,000 gallons, and more stations are being built.
This is in a dirt-poor region with little more than sheep and peasants, where yoked cattle pull wooden carts and the bicycle is a more common mode of transportation than the automobile.
While fuel is reaching Serbia by other routes, notably along the Danube, Albania is supplying more than all other countries combined, said Antonio Napolitano, the sanctions coordinator for the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose office is in Brussels. Mr. Napolitano, an Italian diplomat, advised the Albanian Government and foreign diplomats of this when he was here in February.
The Albanian Government denies that it is allowing sanctions violations. In an interview, President Sali Berisha said that statements by Ambassador Napolitano and the American Embassy about the high level of fuel passing through Albania to Yugoslavia were "absolutely not justified."
He said that while there was some smuggling, it did not amount to much. His Government is doing the best it can to control the smuggling, he said, given its lack of resources and police training.
United Nations sanctions prohibit the shipment of all but a few categories of goods, like medical supplies and food, to Serbia and Montenegro, the constituent states of the current Yugoslavia. Stopping imports of fuel is of particular concern because of its military uses, Mr. Napolitano said.
The sanctions were intended to punish the Serbs for "ethnic cleansing" and for Yugoslavia's refusal to recognize Croatia and Bosnia.
The fuel comes to Albania from Italian and Greek companies and enters Yugoslavia through Montenegro. The border between Albania and Montenegro runs through the lake.
It is not known exactly what happens to the fuel after that. But diplomats here say they believe that most of it does not remain in Montenegro, which they note has a border with Serbian-controlled areas of Bosnia, as well as with Serbia.
The international sanctions monitoring team in Albania, which includes Americans on loan from the customs agency as well as Italians, Belgians and Swiss, receives praise from American and European diplomats for its work. But it has no mandate to stop the trade, only to monitor and report on it.
And it is hampered in doing even that by a lack of cooperation from the Albanian authorities, a report by Mr. Napolitano's office says.
President Berisha cited steps that his Government had taken to curb the flow of fuel to Yugoslavia. These include requiring gas stations to be licensed and prohibiting trade in oil products within three miles of the lake.
Under another new law, Albanian officials must verify that a shipment is intended for a legitimate user, and then notify officials in the shipping country before the vessel is to be allowed to leave its home port.
These measures worked for a while to reduce the trade, but it has been increasing again, the sanctions monitors and diplomats here say.
A visit to this city makes it obvious that the measures are not being enforced. At least nine of the gas stations that should have been closed because of the three-mile limit are still pumping gas; most of the other stations lie not more than a few hundred yards outside the limit.
During the first two weeks in February, nearly 3.5 million gallons of fuel was imported into Albania, including 1.3 million gallons of Jet Fuel-1, Albanian customs documents indicate.
During the last 10 days in February, 100,000 gallons a day was taken into northern Albania by truck, the Albanian police have calculated. Western diplomats say the figure is a gross underestimate.
Northern Albania has only 1,583 registered motorized vehicles, according to Albania's Institute of Statistics.
This country, the size of Maryland, was kept undeveloped during four decades of harsh Communist rule by Enver Hoxha, and is the most economically backward in Europe, with two-thirds of the population of 3 million living off the land.
It has only 140,000 motor vehicles, including tractors and sidecar motorcycles as well as passenger cars and trucks, according to the statistics bureau. There is no four-lane highway in the entire country, and the only access road to the single-runway international airport goes over a one-lane bridge.
The oil trade is a major source of legal revenue for the country, which is struggling to modernize. National authorities collect customs duties on the fuel products, ranging from 70 percent to 100 percent of their declared value.
Here in this impoverished region, the local government collected $22 million in taxes in 1994, virtually all of it as result of the fuel trade, an Albanian newspaper, Zeri i Popullit, reported in February. This was up from $8 million in 1993, the paper said.
At first the oil trade with Yugoslavia was a mom-and-pop operation, but it has now been taken over by more organized criminal organizations, foreign diplomats here said.
The oil companies ship the fuel to the Albanian ports of Durres and Vlora on the Adriatic Sea, where Albanian-registered companies take control of it. Tanker trucks then make a long and arduous journey north, creeping along at maybe 20 miles an hour over a bad road. Once at Shkoder, the gas is pumped into the tanks of one of the gas stations, most of which are little more than a couple of pumps and a shack where a man sits.
It is quickly pumped out into other trucks -- the stations operate around the clock, but are busiest at night, residents say -- and taken the short distance to the shores of Lake Shkoder.
The smugglers are so confident that they will not be bothered that they often operate in broad daylight.
About noon today, a truck turned off the hard-surfaced road and headed west over a dirt road a couple of miles to the lake. It passed a border post, where Albanian soldiers carrying automatic rifles were on duty in their drab, heavy uniforms. The truck was followed by a Ford and a Mercedes, each with four men, an unusual sight in this barren land.
At the lake, less than a half mile from the border post, the fuel was transferred into 50-gallon drums in two long, heavy metal boats.
A mile or so up the shore, the system is more efficient. By means of a long black plastic tube, the fuel is transferred directly from trucks to small barges.
Today, after one truck's cargo was drained into a flat-topped barge that the operator said had a capacity of 6,500 gallons, and the truck pulled away, another truck moved into place and the process continued. Then the barge, with a 25-horsepower outboard motor, pulled away into the lake, heading for Yugoslavia.

'If You're Breathing' You Can Get a Home Mortgage

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
GETTING a home mortgage these days can be as bewildering as negotiating a path through Alice's Wonderland. In Connecticut, as elsewhere, the array of mortgage instruments, brokers, banks, and a smorgasbord of mortgage-lending entities seems endless.
Because of the prolonged sluggish housing market competition among lenders is intense. They are reaching out by tailoring mortgage loans to meet the requirements of borrowers whose credit-worthiness may not be up to the standards of the secondary market to which loans are commonly sold. The beneficiaries may be self-employed people with erratic or unverifiable income. 
 According to David Olson, president of Olson Research Company in Columbia, Md., trackers of the mortgage industry, "self-employed people may be a lot of risk, but with all the layoffs I don't know what good a salary is anymore."
"If you are breathing you can get a loan," he said.
Beside the nationally advertised companies that promise "when your bank says no" or "just dial 1-800-loanyes" there are some home-grown varieties. Fairbank Mortgage Company, a 30-year-old Waterbury firm, does not resell its loans and therefore is able to negotiate with buyers on a more liberal basis. It caters mostly to affluent customers who will pay up to half a percentage point more in interest and make down payments of 20 percent and higher.
In the last five years Fairbank expanded into Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Long Island. "A large part of our business is the self-employed," said Craig Cooper, executive vice president of the company. "It's an extremely fast-growing segment, generated by economic conditions."
The recession and resulting layoffs of high-level employees created a pool of home-equity-loan applicants as well as first mortgage borrowers. "People have gone out and established businesses on their own," said Mr. Cooper. "They may have good credit but their adjusted gross income doesn't qualify them for a standard bank loan."
Perhaps not, but banks are also wading into the nontraditional mortgage market. "A lot of people went back to work for their old companies as freelance consultants," said Thomas W. Deutsch, loan officer with Chemical Bank in West Hartford and Stamford. "We will accommodate customers at 5.5 percent, below the treasury rate of 6.38 percent, on a 1-year adjustable loan with no points, no fees, no appraisals."
But a year from now, he added, the 30-year fixed rate will be 9.375 percent and there will be a $250 charge to borrowers who want to convert from an adjustable-rate loan.
A rating from A to D, indicating the lender's estimate of the borrower's credit worthiness and differing from lender to lender, establishes the tailoring of the loan.
"An A-rated borrower," said Mr. Cooper, "would be someone who had made a mortgage payment 30 days late only once, had a minor credit card delinquency and whose monthly mortgage, taxes, insurance and credit-card bills made up no more than 50 percent of his income. In the traditional market it would be 33 to 36 percent of income."
A C-rated borrower, Mr. Cooper said, would have been late with mortgage payments four or five times, have serious credit-card delinquencies and monthly obligations beyond the 50 percent of income. "As credit becomes weaker, the interest rate goes higher," he said.
GARY DEANE, mortgage banker for Raveis Mortgage Company, a division of William Raveis Real Estate, noted that "with 30 percent down and a decent credit file nobody cares about the customer's employment history or if he even has a job."
"The lower rated B, C, and D customers were an underserviced market," said Kathryn Freda, first vice president of the Connecticut Mortgage Bankers Association in West Hartford. "Just because someone's credit was ruined in a divorce or illness, or he lost a job, doesn't mean he shouldn't have a house to live in."
Roger Stolpen, for instance, fell into the D category. Today he runs a medical transportation and wheelchair-repair service out of his home in Stamford, but last year he was financially strapped after a divorce, and his credit had been ruined by a foreclosure on his former house two years ago.
Needing a house for himself and his business, he negotiated a 13 percent first mortgage with Fairbank last December, with 20 percent down. The current A-loan rate is just under 9 percent. He also paid 4 points, or 4 percent of the mortgage, divided between the mortgage broker and Fairbank.
"For someone with an unmarred credit rating it was high, but for my situation it's fair," he said. After one year he can try to negotiate a better rate.
About 60 percent of people who need financing use a mortgage broker, said L. Edward Viscovi, president of Fidelity Mortgage Services in Branford. "Self-employed people have the most to gain by having a broker put a package together and present it to a likely lender." Mortgage companies seek out business through the brokers, and brokers deal only with such companies, not with banks.
Carl Freyer used neither a broker nor a bank. A self-employed investment banker who owns two condominiums in St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands, but lives for half the year and conducts his business from his home in Greenwich, he needed a home-equity loan to consolidate debts.
"My income is undefinable -- from a variety of sources," he said. "I knew I wouldn't qualify at a bank." His self-employed wife, Marina, owns the house but her income as a consultant for food magazines would not qualify either.
"He owns substantial property and has good credit," said Mr. Cooper, "so we made him a large loan." The high rate, said Mr. Freyer, "wasn't important compared to consolidating loans on which I was paying very high rates."
COMPETITION among lenders has generated a rash of acquisitions, and as volume is increased through takeovers lenders can afford lower rates. Of those operating in Connecticut, Chemical Bank took over Margaretten & Company last year, and Chase Manhattan acquired American Residential Mortgage of New Jersey and Troy Nichols of Louisiana in 1993 and 1994.
"Twenty-five percent of our loans are to self-employed accountants, lawyers, doctors, small manufacturers -- the high end of the scale," said Deborah O'Brien, vice president of Chase Manhattan's Home Mortgage Corporation in Norwalk.
Intent on maximizing its options, Chase refined its operations last year by forming Chase Alternative Funding specifically for B to D quality borrowers. It has offices in Norwalk, Branford and Rocky Hill.
"We were missing a lot of good business because it didn't meet A-loan requirements," said Jay Connor, a vice president of the division. Interest on a no-points, A-rated loan under $203,150 is 8.875 percent, 11.75 for a B loan, and 14 percent for a D loan. Loans over $203,150 command a slightly higher interest rate.
Some borrowers, according to Margaret Osborn, customer service manager of McCue Mortgage Company in New Britain, split their 20 percent down payment into 5 percent cash and 15 percent that buys an annuity that funds the rest of down payment. The annuity protects the buyer from possible losses if it becomes necessary to sell the house in an unfavorable market.
Mr. Olson, the researcher, thinks that mortgage interest will drop as treasury rates back down to their 1993 levels of 5.3 percent in 1996.
"If anybody wants to wait," he adds.

HEADLINE: A Play's Invisible Character

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

 BODY:
WHEN "Having Our Say" opens at the Booth Theater on Thursday, one of the play's main characters will be off stage. She is Amy Hill Hearth of Ossining, a former contributor to The New York Times who was the co-author of the best-selling book on which the play is based.
The other authors, possibly the oldest first-time authors in history, are Dr. A. Elizabeth Delany, known as Bessie, and her sister Sarah Delany, known as Sadie, the now world famous centenarians of Mount Vernon. 
 The play is set in the house that the sisters, 103 and 105 years old, have shared for 37 years, and the actresses who portray them are Gloria Foster and Mary Alice. "They welcome the audience in, just as they welcomed me in, and they tell their story," said Ms. Hearth, who shaped 18 months of interviews into an oral history involving slavery, two world wars and the evolution of the black middle class in America.
"In the play, I am invisible; I am the audience," Ms. Hearth said. "It's very peculiar for me to watch the play, because it mimics the experience I had with the sisters in their kitchen."
Now that "Having Our Say," which broke box office records during its pre-Broadway run at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, is in its final week of previews, Ms. Hearth said she is too excited to sleep or eat. Since the book was published to rave reviews by Kodansha International in 1991, "every day is like Christmas," she said. There have been countless television, radio and newspaper interviews, book awards in adult and young adult categories and sales that so far have exceeded 350,000 copies in hard cover and 500,000 copies in paperback. The hard cover edition spent 28 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller List, and the paperback is now in its 25th week on the list.
The book has been translated into Japanese, Spanish, German and Italian, and last November Kodansha published a sequel, "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom," also written with Ms. Hearth. Camille O. Cosby is a producer of the play, along with Judith Rutherford James, and Emily Mann is the playwright and director. Ms. Hearth, who said she chose not to adapt the book herself, is an artistic consultant.
The most recent honor to befall the Delanys -- the daughters of a former slave whose 10 children all went to college -- was the March 23 visit to their house by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
"I think I've finally convinced them that they are famous," said Ms. Hearth, who played the role of hostess during the First Lady's visit. The writer, who has developed a close personal relationship with the women, also persuaded the Secret Service not to upset their domestic routine too much. "You have to train people -- people don't realize what it's like to be over 100 years old," she said.
Ms. Hearth, who will turn 37 on April 10, said success has spoiled neither her nor the Delanys, whom she occasionally refers to as "the girls." The sisters live without a telephone and watch black and white television. Ms. Hearth says she herself drives the same car and lives in the same three-bedroom house on its one-third acre with her husband, Blair Hearth, a Methodist minister who is the director of gift planning for the Monmouth Health Care Foundation in Long Branch, N.J.
Her straight hairdo, secured with a plain headband, is reminiscent of Mrs. Clinton in earlier days, and she wears mid-length skirts with sensible boots. But she was interviewed behind shaded glass as a driver ferried her to the theater, and she exuded a kind of amazed delight at everything that has happened since the book, her first, was published.
Ms. Hearth met the sisters when, as a freelance writer, she was assigned to do a story about them for the Westchester Weekly. Because they had no phone, she arranged to be introduced to them by a neighbor. Then she had to persuade them to be interviewed.
"They didn't think they were important enough," she said. "I had to convince them and give this little impromptu speech -- that I thought it was very important that people from their generation be represented, especially black women who hadn't had much opportunity. I guess my enthusiasm rubbed off."
When it was published in The Times on Sept. 22, 1991, the story of Bessie Delany, one of the first black women to become a dentist in New York City, and Sadie Delany, a teacher, drew responses from blacks and whites alike. "There was this sense of joy among black Americans that these two women were being paid attention to," Ms. Hearth said. "White Americans were very interested, too. They didn't know about things from this perspective."
A White Plains teacher called to say she had changed her lesson plan for the day in order to discuss the story. Minato Asakawa of Hartsdale also called. As the publisher of the Manhattan-based Kodansha America, a Japanese-owned company, he said he was attracted to the characters in the article: the highly educated sisters, so "unusual for black women at that time," he said recently, and their father, an Episcopal bishop who "seemed to be a decent, hard-working, disciplined person -- that's not easy to find and not just in the United States."
The three women signed a book contract with Kodansha four months later, after Ms. Hearth convinced the Delanys to do a full oral history. "I wanted the sisters to speak for themselves," she said. "I was intent on capturing their personalities, which were very different." They talked twice a week in the Delanys' kitchen and in their garden. Ms. Hearth said that after a few months she turned off the tape recorder and got "rich material" simply by working alongside the women.
They talked about the humiliation of Jim Crow laws in Raleigh, N.C., where the sisters grew up; about Harlem, where the two lived together -- neither ever married -- in the 1920's and 30's, and about Sarah Delany's triumph in becoming the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school.
Ms. Hearth brought her own memories to the conversations; she had attended a segregated elementary school in Columbia, S.C., where she said, "The white teacher would not let me write about Harriet Tubman," who was one of her heroes. "They wanted me to write about Betsy Ross or Dolley Madison," she said. "It's not just black people who have been deprived of their history. White people have too." Now, she added, "Having Our Say" is being used in the North Carolina school curriculum and has been nominated for the South Carolina Young Adult Book Award by the South Carolina Association of School Librarians.
The women had frank talks about race, which Ms. Hearth said affected her profoundly. "What we did was very daring," she said. "We agreed not to worry about each other. White people are terrified to talk about race with a black person because they are afraid of saying the wrong thing. I began to feel things on a level that was more than sympathy. Bessie said I was about as close to understanding as a white person could be."
Sometimes the conversations were very painful, and she said she "felt almost ashamed to be white."
"But they would say, 'Don't worry, child, it's not your fault,' " Ms. Hearth said. "I encouraged them to be candid, because that was the point."
The book succeeded because of the intimacy that developed among them, Ms. Hearth said. "The relationship is why the book is good," she said. "There were a lot of opportunities to test trust. They got to see they could count on me, as I could count on them."
Ms. Hearth is fiercely protective of the sisters' health and feelings and screens requests to interview them. She is especially alert, she said, to people who may ask crude questions about race or marriage, or who may not speak to them respectfully.
"One of the things of which I'm most proud is that they have been treated well," she said. "It's a fine line -- these are very independent people, and they make their own decisions."
The sisters declined to be interviewed for this article, because, Ms. Hearth said, "They said: 'Well if it's a story about you, we shouldn't be in it. It's always about us.' " Her voice bubbles with fun and admiration when she talks about them. She calls them funny, brilliant, "the smartest people I have ever met." The way she told it, it is a love story, and the listener can believe that money, a taboo subject with her , is not the most important way she has profited from this experience.
"My main goal has been to make it as fun as possible for the sisters, to make sure they get what they want," she said. "They are the boss, and when people are very old, most other people don't let that happen."

A White Plains teacher called to say she had changed her lesson plan for the day in order to discuss the story. Minato Asakawa of Hartsdale also called. As the publisher of the Manhattan-based Kodansha America, a Japanese-owned company, he said he was attracted to the characters in the article: the highly educated sisters, so "unusual for black women at that time," he said recently, and their father, an Episcopal bishop who "seemed to be a decent, hard-working, disciplined person -- that's not easy to find and not just in the United States."
The three women signed a book contract with Kodansha four months later, after Ms. Hearth convinced the Delanys to do a full oral history. "I wanted the sisters to speak for themselves," she said. "I was intent on capturing their personalities, which were very different." They talked twice a week in the Delanys' kitchen and in their garden. Ms. Hearth said that after a few months she turned off the tape recorder and got "rich material" simply by working alongside the women.
They talked about the humiliation of Jim Crow laws in Raleigh, N.C., where the sisters grew up; about Harlem, where the two lived together -- neither ever married -- in the 1920's and 30's, and about Sarah Delany's triumph in becoming the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school.
Ms. Hearth brought her own memories to the conversations; she had attended a segregated elementary school in Columbia, S.C., where she said, "The white teacher would not let me write about Harriet Tubman," who was one of her heroes. "They wanted me to write about Betsy Ross or Dolley Madison," she said. "It's not just black people who have been deprived of their history. White people have too." Now, she added, "Having Our Say" is being used in the North Carolina school curriculum and has been nominated for the South Carolina Young Adult Book Award by the South Carolina Association of School Librarians.
The women had frank talks about race, which Ms. Hearth said affected her profoundly. "What we did was very daring," she said. "We agreed not to worry about each other. White people are terrified to talk about race with a black person because they are afraid of saying the wrong thing. I began to feel things on a level that was more than sympathy. Bessie said I was about as close to understanding as a white person could be."
Sometimes the conversations were very painful, and she said she "felt almost ashamed to be white."
"But they would say, 'Don't worry, child, it's not your fault,' " Ms. Hearth said. "I encouraged them to be candid, because that was the point."
The book succeeded because of the intimacy that developed among them, Ms. Hearth said. "The relationship is why the book is good," she said. "There were a lot of opportunities to test trust. They got to see they could count on me, as I could count on them."
Ms. Hearth is fiercely protective of the sisters' health and feelings and screens requests to interview them. She is especially alert, she said, to people who may ask crude questions about race or marriage, or who may not speak to them respectfully.
"One of the things of which I'm most proud is that they have been treated well," she said. "It's a fine line -- these are very independent people, and they make their own decisions."
The sisters declined to be interviewed for this article, because, Ms. Hearth said, "They said: 'Well if it's a story about you, we shouldn't be in it. It's always about us.' " Her voice bubbles with fun and admiration when she talks about them. She calls them funny, brilliant, "the smartest people I have ever met." The way she told it, it is a love story, and the listener can believe that money, a taboo subject with her , is not the most important way she has profited from this experience.
"My main goal has been to make it as fun as possible for the sisters, to make sure they get what they want," she said. "They are the boss, and when people are very old, most other people don't let that happen."

HEADLINE: PROFILE;
A Pair of Presidents Keep It All in the Family

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN

 BODY:
As Fraternal Twins, the Shapiro brothers grew up sharing the same room and the same schoolteachers, but not the same interest. Harold was the athlete, two championships, played basketball, loved soccer. Quieter, more studious Bernard got better grades and showed a marked lack of interest in sports.
 "My parents were very careful not to treat us as if we were the same person just because we were the same age," Bernard Shapiro recalled, sipping tea in his wood-paneled office at McGill University in Montreal. 
 Yet the brothers, now 59 years old, have virtually the same job: Each leads a prestigious university. Bernard J. Shapiro was installed as McGill's president in November. Harold T. Shapiro is president of Princeton University.
 Of course, these academic twin peaks are not identical posts. McGill is a large public university with nearly 15,000 undergraduates, compared with 4,500 at Princeton. McGill has 11 schools and 3 affiliated theological colleges. Princeton, which has no law or medical school, has long focused its attention on undergraduate study.
 And the brothers persist in their separate interests. At Princeton, where he has been president since 1988, Harold Shapiro closely follows his teams' fortunes in the Ivy League. At McGill, Bernard Shapiro still shuns sports. So intense is his dislike that when the school's football coach asked him to perform the ceremonial kickoff for the first game in the fall, he declined. "I believe my actual response was, 'In a pig's eye,"' he recalled. "I said, 'I've never had any interest in athletics. I don't want to pretend I have. I don't want to pretend to be other than what I am. What you see is what you get."' (In the ned, his wife, Phyllis, a professor of education, donned a red McGill sweatshirt and kicked off the game.)
 But in their different ways, the presidents Shapiro face many of the same challenges: Both are concerned with soaring costs and rising tuitions, as well as increased public scrutiny. Both worry about quality, accountability and access. And both want to re-examine the role played by higher education in the community.
 The two say they talk frequently to each other about the joys and trials of heading a university. "You can call up on a basis that you can't call anyone else up, and talk about issues that you have in common or sometimes on which you just want advice," Bernard Shapiro said. "It's so congenial and so easy, and there's never any hidden agendas."
 The brothers were born in Montreal in 1935. Their father, Max, had grown up in a small village near Warsaw, but left early, seeking work. He stopped first in Odessa, eventually made his way to Toledo, Ohio where he worked in an automobile factory, and finally moved to Montreal, where he met Mary, his second wife. The twins are the couple's only children.
 Although Mary and Max stressed education, neither imagined that their sons would dedicate their lives to higher learning.
 "Did I think they were geniuses when they were young?" asked the boys' mother, Mary Shapiro Kantor. "No." Still the two were good students, she said. "Bernard was the born scholar; it wouldn't make any difference what kind of mother or father he had, he would have been that. Harold developed over time." Over time, both boys pursued academic paths -- but not before taking an unusual detour. Shortly after they graduated with honors from McGill, their father died. So the two took over his stake in Ruby Foo's, a Chinese restaurant that is legendary in Montreal. "Even my children, who have never put their feet in there because it was gone long before they grew up, have heard of it," said Gretta Chambers, chancellor of McGill.
 But neither considered making the business a career. "I loved it," said Bernard Shapiro. "I learned an incredible amount, primarily about other people and how to relate to them. It was fascinating. But I knew I didn't want to spend a lifetime doing it."
 For Harold Shapiro, the five-year ownership of Ruby Foo's was a time to nurture the idea of pursuing a scholarly life. Encouraged by his then-girlfriend, Vivian (now his wife, and mother of the couple's four daughters), he began part-time graduate study at McGill in economics and Russian history.
 "Vivian really showed me what the rewards of a thoughtful and scholarly approach to a topic were," he said, "and what one could contribute to the world with scholarship and ideas to make this a better place for us all. She was very influential in that sense."
 After the brothers and their partners sold the restaurant, Harold enrolled at Princeton to pursue his doctoral degree in economics.
 Bernard went to Harvard to earn a master's degree in education and perhaps become a high school teacher or a librarian. Once there, however, he decided, with the encouragement of his professors, to pursue a doctoral degree.
 "I knew I loved to read and I knew I loved to think about what it was I was reading." he said. "And it seemed to me an academic career would make the most of that love, because it would be central to what it meant to be decent in that area."
 Max Shapiro would have been both pleased and perplexed by his sons' decision to become academics., Harold Shapiro said -- pleased that they were doing what they wanted, but perplexed by their desire to teach long hours, at the pleasure of some department head or faceless president, for a relatively modest salary.
 "He very much wanted me to be a businessman," Harold Shapiro said. "I remember he and my mother took us to Europe once, in the days when you still went by boat. I remember standing on the rail of this boat, looking out at the sea, and my father saying to me, 'There's one thing that's wonderful about being in business. Here I am sitting on this boat and I'm still making money."'
 After receiving his Ph.D from Princeton, Harold Shapiro joined the faculty at the University of Michigan (Vivian Shapiro became an associate professor at the School of Social Work). In his 24 years at Michigan, he served as chairman of the economics department, vice president for academic affairs and, finally, university president from 1980 to 1988.
 Bernard Shapiro began climbing the academic ranks in the schools of education at Boston University and the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. He also spent years in public life in the Ontario government, serving as the Deputy Minister of Education. It was, he says, an interesting exhilarating change from academia.
 "In academic life you think of your influence or the consequence of your actions in terms of generations," he said. "Whereas in public life, although the things you do may have enormous generational effect, the particularly jolting part is they can have an effect tomorrow.
 You do something and there it is!"
 Bernard Shapiro's call from McGill came last year, when he was all set to retire from the University of Toronto, where he was teaching education and public policy. He and his wife have a daughter and a son.
 As university presidents, the Shapiro brothers are both described as quietly decisive in meeting their goals. Both speak (in literally identical voices) of shepherding their universities through a time when higher education is changing from a small, elite social system to a larger and more accessible one.
 At Princeton, Harold Shapiro has pushed faculty and students to grapple with questions of diversity and race relations. In speech after speech, he urges the university to take "voyages of discovery in a pluralistic society."
 His promotion of racial and ethnic diversity at Princeton, he said, stems in part from his belief that even private universities are civic institutions that should serve society.
 "If all we did at Princeton was train a terrifically well-qualified and very smart group of white males, we would be failures," he said. "It's as simples as that. At one time that was an acceptable way to meet civic responsibility. But at this time and this place, we have the responsibility to do better than that."
 Ruth Simmons, Princeton's deputy provost, says she considers Harold Shapiro a courageous leader who does what he believes is right even when that action is unpopular or unheralded. "A lot of people will do it when they're going to get a lot of play," she said. "But the reason I respect it so much is he's doing things which are courageous when no one else knows."
 For example, she says, when hiring recommendations are made, he often asks whether women were included in the pool of candidates. "In one case, I heard him really questioning the presenters quite severely about some of the assumptions they were making, because he is acutely aware that women get judged differently in this environment," she said.
 Dr. Simmons said she also considers Harold Shapiro a mentor who has helped prepare her for the challenges she will face as the newly appointed president of Smith College.
 "I would trust his judgment on moral issues more than just about anybody else," she said. "He's a wise man, but in a quiet way."
 At McGill, Bernard Shapiro faces essentially the same battles. One of the challenges is to manage an Anglophone institution in a Francophone province.
"McGill generally behaves as if it could as easily be in Paris, London, New York, San Francisco or Beijing," Dr. Shapiro said. "That's wrong. It ought to behave as if it is here in Montreal."
That means, he says, that McGill ought to attract a significant number of French-speaking Quebec students who want to study in English.
His objective is to raise that student population from the current 19 percent to about 25 percent. He also wants McGill to establish links with Francophone universities in Montreal to share resources and programs.
"If you become an integral part of a community, everybody has a stake in your future," he said.
With that in mind, he has instituted a library policy for East Asian studies with the University of Montreal. "It's quite simple," he said. "Any book they buy, we don't buy. Any book we buy, they don't. We share. And there are a whole series of things like that -- each one small and inconsequential in its own right, but it turns out to add up over time."
Dr. Chambers, who is both chancellor and chairwoman of the search committee that hired Bernard Shapiro, says he approaches tough decisions with an open mind.
"That's very unusual among academics," she said. "Usually they come with a theory. He asks, 'What would be the sensible thing to do here?' "
And although Dr. Shapiro is somewhat shy, she says, he is still accessible.
Dr. Chambers recalled that he once spent an entire evening talking with the student council about what it could and could not expect from the university.
"He got there around 6 P.M. and stayed until about 9 P.M., but he could have been there until midnight," she said. "It was almost as if they were dying of thirst -- they wanted more. It was because he was really giving them the goods. He was not condescending. He treats them exactly as if they were grown up and fully responsible."

HEADLINE: Who Is Major Enough For the Major Leagues?

BYLINE: By TY AHMAD-TAYLOR

 BODY:
What makes a city ready for the Major Leagues? Phoenix and Tampa must have it. Three weeks ago they were picked as homes to the newest teams in Major League Baseball. Do other cities have it, too? And what exactly is it, anyhow?
 The question isn't idle, its economic. And the way Major League Baseball has answered it over the past 80 years has a great deal to do with the impasse that resulted in the 232-day strike the players ended Friday when a Federal judge ordered the owners to restore salary arbitration and other parts of the old contract. Without a lockout, the season could open later this month with the regular team rosters. 
 Money and fans are just two factors in deciding where teams play. Some cities that have threatened legal action against baseball's anti-trust rules have been awarded franchises. While political and emotional forces always play a role, formulas allow an objective look at a city's ability to be in the big leagues.
 Economists say a team can make it in a metropolitan area with: a population over one million; a high percentage of men between 18 and 54, baseball's core audience; per capita income above the national average; high population growth; and a high proportion of businesses with more than 500 employees - businesses most likely to buy stadium luxury suites. These criteria are not absolute predictors of success. Good marketing, business acumen and fan loyalty also help.
 Some cities with teams miss these benchmarks. And of the four cities recently awarded Major League franchises, only Phoenix and Denver measured up. TY AHMAD-TAYLOR

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CONEY ISLAND;
Boardwalking: Carnies in Gear For Next Ride

BYLINE: By JOHN DeSANTIS 

 BODY:
By night, the streets that jut from Coney Island's wide wooden boardwalk are as empty and barren as the newly groomed sand on the beachfront. Shuttered metal gates hide the entrances to clam joints and ice cream stands, and the mechanical rides are still, naked skeletons stripped of their canvas wraps.
But during these spring days, the gentle pounding of the surf is drowned out by the hammering and chatter of workers. Coney Island's carnival subculture is rustling up, preparing for the season that will start in two weeks, on Easter Sunday. Young workers, mostly men but a handful of women, daub gallons of paint and whitewash, screw in hundreds of colored light bulbs and walk all 3,000 feet of Cyclone track, checking the roller coaster for safety. 
 Many of these workers will operate and repair the rides once the season begins and the boardwalk teems with families, tourists, hawkers and sunbathers. Most say they are happy being silent partners in the one-day vacations of millions. No one says what he earns.
"I operate, fix, anything that's here," says Angel Colon, 23, as he stands near the Polar Express ride. "I got taught by somebody else. Before that I was working jobs like Toys 'R' Us, Nathan's."
Mr. Colon's friend, Tirell Johnson, 19, says his speech, which comes in loud bursts, helped get him a job hawking games of chance to passersby in 1990. "I started out in Astroland, the game where the hands go up and down and I was talking on the mike. So one day I came over here and talked to the boss and asked if there was an opening, and he said 'Yeah, come by.' "
He also runs the Polar Express, sometimes playing the ride's rock and rap music so loudly that residents of nearby high-rise buildings complain to the local precinct commander. The work, Mr. Johnson says, is hard, but there are rewards.
"The thing that I like best is 'showboatin,' " he says. "That's when the ride is moving and the people have to sit down on the ride, we stand up. Just to bug out, to keep the crowd excited. But if the ride is going a certain speed, then you know you can't do it."
Despite his almost boyish excitement with such escapades, Mr. Johnson seems to have an eye tilted toward the future.
"This ain't gonna be my whole life," he insists. "Atlantic City, I thought about it. I was out there last week," he said. He filled out applications. No one has called back.
Although the police say that gangs like the X-Men, Dog-Pound and the more organized Latin Kings are active on Coney Island's streets, most who work the boardwalk play down the gangs' hold on the area. Many young men in the neighborhood, they say, are gang wannabe's.
Kenny Vazquez, 27, is a ride operator during the season and does whatever is needed to get the rides at Astroland running. He's grateful for work in a local economy pretty much bare of opportunity.
"I wouldn't trade it for anything or anybody," he says. "It's very hard to find any type of jobs here, and this is the last resort." Occasionally, he says, he does wish the future would hold something just a little different. Maybe a job at Six Flags-Great Adventure, the New Jersey amusement park. "It's the same job we do here but bigger," he says. "They've got a lot of the same rides we've got. Just let me know when they get the biggest ride there is. I'll be there." JOHN DeSANTIS

HEADLINE: Manhattan Business Districts Lift Quality of Life at Small Cost

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your report on Manhattan business improvement districts (news article, March 27). As I advised you before that: 
 (1) The "management report" delivered March 17 was a preliminary, confidential draft for comment by management. It has been revised.
(2) As to outside employment of district managers, there is a specific protocol approved in 1993 by the Grand Central and 34th Street Partnership boards allowing them to spend up to 15 percent of their working time on ouside activities. Similar protocols exist at leading universities permitting professors to devote up to 20 percent of their time to outside activities. Such activities can help the public and enhance the professor's experience. Universities do not require reimbursement for the time, as do the partnerships.
(3) With regard to Jersey City, any program will be submitted to each business improvement district board for review and cannot proceed without approval.
(4) The Jersey City business improvement district has paid for all disbursements on its behalf.
(5) There have never been special arrangements to meet the requirements of a particular building owner. All programs offered by the partnerships are offered generally -- to encourage owners to improve public spaces around their buildings.
(6) The floodlighting of Grand Central Terminal and the sidewalks surrounding it has greatly enhanced security, as well as the beauty of Grand Central Terminal. Four buildings have permitted installation of massive floodlights without charge.
The number of lights and the size of the support structure installed on the Lincoln Building are substantially greater than those of the other three buildings. The location on the Lincoln Building selected by the independent lighting consultant was a narrow setback, which required additional safety precautions.
There was no direct benefit to any building.
The Grand Central and 34th Street Partnerships -- which recently expanded beyond the boundaries on your map -- have significantly enhanced the quality of life for those who work, live in or visit the districts, with great cost-effectiveness.
They have demonstrated that the public areas of Manhattan can be safe, clean, well lighted and intelligently directed. The cost is only a few cents per square foot per year, a very small fraction of the real estate tax and an amount most owners and tenants are more than willing to contribute.

HEADLINE: Many Haitians Fearful Despite U.N. Presence

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, April 2

 BODY:
Despite the new United Nations mission of establishing a "safe and stable environment" in Haiti, there is growing nervousness among its people about the future. The unease stems from an increase in crime and the lack of any immediate and widespread economic relief nearly six months after Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored as President.
"On balance, the American presence here has been positive," said Necker Dessables, executive director of the Justice and Peace Commission, the human rights arm of the Roman Catholic Church in Haiti. 
 But he said the American-led force, which transferred authority to the United Nations on Friday, had been "late in reaching a will to disarm" the paramilitary groups created by the military dictatorship. This delay, he said, "gave them time to hide their weapons and go underground and organize."
Now it is up to the 6,000 soldiers and 900 police officers who make up the United Nations operation in Haiti to blunt the threat posed by the remnants of that repressive apparatus. Yet they must do so with fewer troops and equipment, with virtually no Haitian law enforcement or security force to assist them and in the face of skepticism about their ability and willingness to act.
In a report issued on the eve of President Clinton's visit on Friday, two human rights groups, Human Rights Watch/Americas and the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees, warned of the problems that might lie ahead.
"Political tensions are increasing," the report said, "and far from having brought stability, the U.S.-led force can point only to a fragile security that impending parliamentary and presidential elections may rupture."
The threat to stability has been underscored by a recent surge in street crime, which Haitian Government officials attribute in part to former soldiers and police officers, and that has created some disaffection with the foreign presence.
"If they're not going to protect us, then why are they here at all?" asked Claudette Armand, a shop clerk here.
Such sentiments may be even more pronounced in the countryside, where there has been a steady barrage of complaints about "collaboration" between American troops and sympathizers of the dictatorship.
A national conference of peasant groups loyal to President Aristide, for instance, adopted a resolution last month calling the foreign military deployments a "useless presence" and "a waste of money" because they had failed to root out paramilitary gunmen.
Mr. Aristide himself remains enormously popular, and moves freely among the people without apparent concern for his own safety. But his Government, led by Prime Minister Smarck Michel, has been slow to address economic problems and meet growing demands for improved living conditions. People blame the current Government for many of the country's ills, even though the army maintained effective control of Haiti in the three years after the overthrow of President Aristide in September 1991.
Despite Mr. Aristide's return, food prices are still rising sharply with no sign of leveling off, jobs continue to be scarce with the unemployment rate approaching 75 percent, foreign investment has been slow in returning and 1.2 million people are still being fed by international relief agencies.
At the same time, basic services like electricity, water, transportation and health remain tenuous at best.
"Aristide has done nothing to improve our lives since he returned," said Ronald Charles, 23, who is unemployed and lives in a squatter settlement near the port here. "Yes, we no longer have to worry that the army will kill us or beat us or steal from us. But it was the Americans who made that possible, not Aristide."
Discontent with the slow pace of economic development has led to frequent street demonstrations in recent weeks against the high cost of living and mounting criticism of the way Mr. Michel and his economic team are dealing with the problem.
"If this Government has a strategy, the people are not aware of it," said Chavannes Jean-Baptiste, a peasant leader and longtime political ally of and adviser to Mr. Aristide.
In a country as poor and scarred as Haiti, most of the capital required to rebuild the economy and infrastructure will also have to come from foreign sources.
More than $1.2 billion in such assistance has already been pledged, but the Haitian bureaucracy, which diplomats and foreign economists describe as laden with talent at the very top but barely competent at other levels, has found it difficult to decide how to apply the bonanza that is in the pipline.
"They simply expect us to give them money with no questions asked," one foreign aid official said. "You can ask them all you want what they plan to do with it, but it is hard to get much beyond vague answers."
But some basic preliminary steps have already been taken. More than 1.2 million people have been immunized against diseases, $83 million in foreign debt arrears have been paid off and some 30,000 temporary jobs have been created.
But on the left, some of Mr. Aristide's supporters are complaining of what they describe as his loss of ideological zeal and excessive deference to his foreign patrons. As Mr. Jean-Baptiste put it, referring to President Aristide by his nickname, "When the peasants compare the Titid of before with the Titid who returned with the multinational force, they see a big difference."
Nonetheless, American officials and Mr. Aristide have frequently disagreed on many basic issues, especially those relating to security. From the start, they have argued over the size and composition of the police force that is to replace the Haitian armed forces, which Mr. Aristide has dismantled despite American pressures to retain some sort of military entity.
The potential for further discord can only grow, Haitian and foreign analysts predict, with the entry of the United Nations into the picture.
"This has been an all-American show up to now," a Latin American diplomat said. "But all of us are going to be forced to make adjustments in this next phase, and it is not going to be easy."

HEADLINE: Trying to Cut Welfare the Ohio Way

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, March 27

 BODY:
When Gov. George V. Voinovich of Ohio proposed deep cuts in welfare benefits for able-bodied adults four years ago, he predicted that many recipients would finally get off the dole and find a job. Welfare advocates, meanwhile, spun doomsday scenarios about large increases in homelessness, crime and even death on the streets.
Neither prediction came true, according to welfare officials and researchers here. But in New York, where Gov. George E. Pataki is pushing for similar cuts, the same arguments are now framing the debate. 
 "If you create incentives, and in fact demand work, I think you'll see people move into the work force," Mr. Pataki said in a recent interview. "I mean, how many low-income, low-skilled jobs go to immigrants, or go begging?"
On the other side of the debate is Shelly Nortz, director of state policy for the New York State Coalition for the Homeless, who notes that there are 584,000 unemployed New Yorkers, and welfare is often the only thing that keeps them off the streets.
"We think that about a third of the people who lose their benefits are going to end up requiring some kind of government-supported emergency shelter because they become homeless and have no alternatives," Ms. Nortz said.
The cuts made in Ohio and proposed in New York would affect state-financed programs that primarily serve single adults. Most needy mothers qualify for the Federal Government's Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, which the Republicans in Congress are seeking to trim back.
The cuts proposed in New York by Mr. Pataki are part of a broader plan to trim the rapid growth in the state's welfare cost. Mr. Pataki would also like to reduce benefits for welfare mothers and the elderly, as well as making reductions in Medicaid benefits.
The experience of Ohio, and of other states that have made similar cuts, has been far less clear-cut. A Case Western Reserve University study of the impact of Mr. Voinovich's cuts in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, found that virtually the same percentage of able-bodied welfare recipients were employed before and after they were forced off the rolls, indicating that welfare recipients either were unsuccessful in looking for jobs or did not seek them. The study also found only a slight increase in the percentage of people who did not have permanent housing, from 23 percent to 27 percent.
But researchers in Ohio and elsewhere have concluded that most former recipients simply totter on the edge of subsistence. With few job skills, and often with disabilities and addictions, they somehow just manage to get by, frequently with the help of the underground economy, family members and friends.
"They find ways to cope, but there may be impacts on the families that help," said Linda Crowell, one of the Case Western Reserve researchers. "A wife may be abused right now because someone was back in the home that shouldn't have been."
It also remains to be seen whether state governments that restrict welfare benefits create expensive new burdens that devour any savings. "If you're a governor doing cost-benefit analysis, my question would be how many former welfare recipients are showing up in mental institutions and prisons and homeless shelters," said Joe R. Garcia, director of the Cuyahoga County Department of Entitlement Services. "That's real money."
The cuts enacted by Mr. Voinovich and proposed by Mr. Pataki involve a program known around the country as general assistance. Financed solely by state and local governments, the programs exist in some form in 31 states, with 22 states requiring it statewide.
General assistance provides welfare benefits to needy people who do not qualify for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Besides single adults, the recipients include childless married couples and disabled people.
A heavy share of general assistance recipients -- in New York, about half -- are considered employable. During the last four years, that has made the programs a popular target for Republican governors seeking to trim welfare budgets. Michigan and Illinois have eliminated their programs altogether. A number of other states have cut benefits and restricted eligibility.
In Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, as a freshman Republican Governor in 1991, pushed through legislation that limited general assistance benefits to six months in any 12-month period. He also cut the monthly grant from $148 to $100 and created a new welfare program, called Disability Assistance, that paid $115 a month to those considered unemployable.
The time limits in Ohio succeeded in reducing the number of people on general assistance from about 142,000 in 1992 to 68,000 in 1994. Another 52,000 are on Disability Assistance. The cost for the programs declined from $421 million in 1992 to $198 million in 1994, including medical expenses.
This year, Mr. Voinovich has proposed eliminating general assistance and restricting eligibility for Disability Assistance to save an additional $100 million a year. A new state health-care plan would provide medical insurance for most of the poor.
New York, which calls its program Home Relief, is now one of only three states, along with Alaska and New Jersey, that provide ongoing assistance to able-bodied adults without children. With 387,000 recipients in an average month and a cost to the state of almost $1.2 billion a year, including Medicaid spending, it is by far the largest and most expensive program of its kind in the country.
Because the cost of Home Relief has doubled in the last 10 years and now eats up nearly 4 percent of the state's general fund budget, it quickly grabbed the attention of Mr. Pataki's budget director, Patricia A. Woodworth, who helped her previous boss, Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan, eliminate that state's program. And because New York splits its Home Relief costs with local governments, the cuts are also supported by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City, which is home to 77 percent of the state's recipients.
Mr. Pataki's proposal would save $204 million for the state and a similar amount for local governments. After first proposing to limit Home Relief benefits for able-bodied recipients to 90 days in any 12-month period, he has now agreed with the Republican-controlled Senate on a 60-day limit. While on Home Relief, recipients would be required to work in public service jobs, like cleaning parks and government buildings.
Recipients would lose their Medicaid health care coverage when they leave the rolls, relegating many to seek treatment in the emergency rooms of public hospitals. And the basic monthly grant of $137.10 would be cut by 25 percent, to $102.82. Recipients also receive a shelter allowance -- $215 in New York City, meaning that the total grant there would decrease from $352 to $318.
In the ongoing negotiations over the state budget, the Democratic-controlled Assembly has been silent about Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts. Traditionally viewed as the protectors of the poor, Albany's Democrats have responded to the rightward swing of last November's election by positioning themselves as defenders of the middle class. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, declined repeated requests last week to explain his position on Mr. Pataki's welfare proposals.
Mr. Pataki said he does not expect homelessness to increase because of the cuts. But in his budget, he added $26 million in new spending for the homeless just in case.
In other states, Mr. Pataki said, "the vast majority of the Home Relief population was able to make successful alternate arrangements to continue to live. They weren't on the streets. They weren't in the shelters. Those stories of dread just didn't happen."
In some cases, that is true. In others, it is not.
For instance, Maurice B. Tiff, a 47-year-old portrait artist from Cleveland, has lived with his elderly parents while receiving general assistance benefits intermittently since 1991. He acknowledges that he can survive without the monthly $100 check, and that he has continued to reapply successfully for benefits because no one has stopped him from doing so.
In essence, Mr. Tiff said, he works when he feels like it, while taking care of his parents. "It's not that I'm not capable or willing," he said. "I'm probably one person who shouldn't have been on assistance to begin with."
But it is different for Darnell Alexander, an unemployed 40-year-old alcoholic and drug addict who has been on general assistance for seven years. Until Mr. Voinovich imposed time limits, Mr. Alexander always managed to scrape up the $120 he needed to pay rent for a room in a boarding house, usually by supplementing his welfare check with income from occasional dishwashing jobs.
Since the cuts, he has been constantly on the move -- staying with friends, doing time in jail, even sleeping on benches in downtown Cleveland. "It's been a struggle," he said.
Mr. Voinovich said that proposing the cuts "was one of the most wrenching experiences I have had."
"We had large demonstrations outside the Statehouse," he said. "I was accused of being insensitive, un-Christian and so forth."
But he said the results of the last three years have convinced him that he was right. "People really didn't understand that what I was doing was because of tough love," he said.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: BASEBALL OWNERS QUIT FIGHT; OPENING DAY IS SET FOR APRIL 26;
Replacements Ambling Back To Anonymity

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: DENVER, April 2

 BODY:
They ambled across the marble floors of the hotel lobby in their suits and ties this morning, still acting like members of the New York Yankees yet still wondering where their charter plane was headed. The Yankees had not officially told their replacement players where they were flying.
Some carried briefcases that held their minor league contracts, some made telephone calls to their wives describing their anxiety and some sipped coffee, boasted about the experience and called it the most exhilarating six weeks of their once-dormant careers. The 36 replacement players figured that their status as Yankees would disappear by the time they arrived in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., tonight. 
 "It kind of stinks it came down to the last day," said pitcher Doug Cinnella. "The owners got the living starch beaten out of them, so they're taking their frustration out on us."
But Kent Wallace, another pitcher who is headed to the minor leagues, said: "I got to do things I've never done before. I'd do it again."
Once the owners decided Saturday to release replacement players from their contracts, scenes like this were acted out throughout major league baseball as the real players inched closer to returning to work, while those who substituted for them inched closer to oblivion.
Half of the Yankees will return to being minor leaguers, another handful will probably be offered minor league contracts and the others will return to being salesmen, coaches, teachers or unemployed. None will be given the chance to play for the real Yankees anytime soon. The players won't receive the handsome salaries they had desired, settling instead for the $5,000 bonus they received for signing.
The concept of replacement players became a hot-button issue in the longest strike in sports history, meshing modern labor realities with the fanciful aspirations of would-be baseball players. But around the country today, the replacements themselves were looking more and more replaceable.
In the hotel lobby here, 270-pound Matt Stark took pictures of his soon-to-be former Yankee teammates. In Clearwater, Fla., Joe Cipolloni played an April Fool's joke on his Phillie replacement teammates by telling them the team would leave for its game in St. Louis today. And in a Port St. Lucie, Fla., hotel, replacements complained about waiting three hours to meet with General Manager Joe McIlvaine to find out their fate.
"I can't believe I did this and this happened," said one player, requesting anonymity. "I really goofed up."
Wallace, however, will savor his designation as the planned opening day starter for the Yankees. "That's a compliment," he said. "That's something I'll never forget."
Everywhere, players lamented about how agonizingly close they had come to making $25,000 in bonuses. Players who signed replacement contracts were owed $5,000 signing bonuses. But by releasing the replacements from their contracts, the clubs saved about $800,000 each because players were supposed to receive another $5,000 for making the opening day roster today and $20,000 in severance pay when the major leaguers returned.
One club, the Florida Marlins, created some good will with the replacements by paying them the $25,000, anyway. And at least five clubs told the players they will pay the $5,000 as a good-will gesture. One of them was the Mets, who though they kept the replacements waiting tonight at least sent them on their way happy.
But the Yankees, who had not decided whether they will pay bonuses, were worried enough about potential hostility from players that they removed alcoholic beverages from their flight.
Since their trip to Arlington, Tex., for the season opener had been canceled, the replacement Yankees, who were registered in the hotel here under aliases to protect them from potential harassment, lingered in the lobby searching for answers. Even though the assistant general manager, Tim McCleary, said the players would remain in Florida under minor league contracts to presumably be available should something go wrong, Showalter said, "I think they are basically being dispersed once we get there."
Requesting that the replacement players remain as a safety measure might be a ticklish issue since one claimed he felt "like a piece of meat hanging on a hook," and five had already returned home instead of going to Florida. Bill Lindsey, a catcher, added, "They better come up with some more money if they want us to do that."
Several replacement Mets, who admitted to nursing hangovers today, wanted to collect their $5,000 signing bonuses and leave. Jeff Edwards, a car salesman who quit his job in Nashville, did not feel the money was enough after enduring Manager Dallas Green's rigorous spring training. "I could have made $8,000 selling cars," he said.
Frank Eufemia did not want to leave. The 35-year-old pitcher thirsts for a Class AAA job with the Yankees and feels he pitched well enough with an 0-1 record and 3.95 earned run average to secure that chance. Eufemia, who has purposely been silent this spring because he wanted to be viewed as a professional and who even turned down the chance to be photographed for The Sporting News, said being a replacement player was not always pleasant.
"It was difficult, at times, to get psyched up to pitch," Eufemia said. "When I don't have butterflies, I know something is wrong. There were a lot of mixed emotions when you went out there. You didn't always know who you were pitching for."
In recent days, the replacement Yankees gathered around the television whenever labor news was being announced and badgered reporters for information about their future. Some of the Yankees had pictures taken of themselves at Coors Field, one lasting reminder of their brief flings in pinstripes. Pitchers Eufemia, Daryl Smith, Guillermo (Willie) Hernandez and Dave Pavlas and Stark, a designated hitter, could be offered Class AAA contracts.
"How many people can say they spent a whole spring with the Yankees?" asked catcher John Kroeger. "How many people can say they played at Coors Field? We had a good time playing baseball, we got $80 a day meal money and we stayed in nice hotels. You can't beat all that. I don't think the players have anything to complain about."
But some Yankees were upset because they became replacement players to make money and, at this point, were only assured of their signing bonus and whatever meal money they saved. Cinnella was one of them. He showed reporters the contract he signed on Jan. 18 and said he would ask for the $25,000 based on the reasoning that, on the day he signed it, opening day was scheduled to be April 2.
"We are not committed on that condition," said McCleary, the assistant general manager.
Told that his argument might not hold up, Cinnella shrugged, put the contract in his briefcase and seemingly figured it was another part of a frustrating day. The team bus was leaving for the airport and the replacement Yankees were descending the escalator and about to be sent into history. Even Cinnella sensed it as he pondered his other job.
"I'll give you guys a call," he told reporters. "I might have a press release you can print about my baseball school."

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Tax Cut Edges Out Deficit As G.O.P.'s Guiding Tenet

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
There is considerable evidence in public opinion polls that Americans put a greater priority on balancing the budget than cutting taxes. At the same time, there is considerable anxiety among Republican lawmakers that their promise to produce a balanced budget by the year 2002 will be substantially complicated by their pledge to also provide nearly $200 billion in tax cuts over the next five years.
But this week, the Republican majority in the House is expected to set aside those concerns and approve a huge tax cut proposal as the final act of this Congress's first 100 days. Yes, there are last-minute jitters in the House, and an out-and-out wariness toward the idea in the Senate. But behind the drive for a tax cut are some powerful political forces in the Republican Party, born of years of conservative theology, internal struggles for the soul of the party and searing experiences on the campaign trail. 
 The theology is simple enough: "It's a fundamental divide between what Republicans and Democrats believe," Representative Robert S. Walker, Republican of Pennsylvania, contended in an interview last week. "Democrats, through their policies and their language, believe all wealth generated in this country is ultimately the Government's to distribute. Republicans believe it belongs to the people and they should be allowed to keep as much of it as possible."
This article of faith was regularly invoked during the tax cuts of the Reagan years, and was at the heart of George Bush's legendary sound bite of the 1988 campaign: "Read my lips: no new taxes." To many conservatives, when President Bush broke that pledge in his 1990 budget agreement with the Democrats, he set an inevitable course for his party's defeat in 1992. The Republican Party, according to this school of thought, lost its identification as the party of lower taxes, succumbed to the thinking of the old party establishment and paid an immense price for it.
"Bush ran on a Reaganesque platform in 1988, reverted to pre-Reagan Republicanism in '90, and got clobbered in '92 by a Democrat promising a tax cut," said a conservative strategist, William Kristol. "Call me simple-minded, but I think it's better to cut taxes."
For many conservatives, the House vote this week will represent an important moment in the rightward redefinition of their party and the restoration of its Reaganesque glory. "We've been burdened since 1990 as being the party that promised not to raise taxes, and did it," said Representative Walker. "As of next week, we'll be the party that promised to cut taxes, and did it."
There are, as Mr. Kristol and Mr. Walker suggest, serious campaign implications to this vote and this issue. Republicans hope to position themselves as the party that delivered the middle-class tax cut that Mr. Clinton promised during the 1992 campaign and then abandoned after taking office because of the magnitude of the deficit.
In a memorandum circulated last week, Mr. Kristol wrote, "It all comes down to this: In mid-1996, campaigning for larger House and Senate majorities and for the White House, Republicans must be able to tell voters that 'a Democratic Congress and President raised your taxes in 1993; a Republican Congress cut your taxes in 1995.' "
The Republican strategist added: "Reducing the deficit more than Clinton won't be an effective Republican platform. It will always be an uncertain claim, in any event, given the macroeconomic exigencies of interest rates. And let's face it -- deficit reduction has a patchy record as a political bragging point. Ask our current President, who's just devoted the first half of his Administration to that goal, with notably disastrous results."
There is another important political judgment at work: At a time of vast cynicism about politicians -- specifically, about their ability to keep promises -- Republican strategists are adamant about abiding by one of the best-known pledges in their Contract With America.
"The American people have been lied to in two successive Presidential elections," said Grover Norquist, an adviser to Speaker Newt Gingrich and president of the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform. "And the Republican Party stood up in '94 and said: 'This is a contract. We know you've been lied to before, and that's why we're putting this in writing. And if we don't do what we said, fire us.' "
Representative Sam Brownback, a freshman Republican from Kansas, said he recalled one voter after another who simply did not believe that Mr. Brownback would do what he had promised to do. "There's no faith that anything said during a campaign will be delivered," Mr. Brownback said this week. "It's a question of trust, faith, and that's an enormously important quality in a representative democracy."
For Mr. Brownback, that means he will live up to his promise and vote for tax cuts, although he worries about the deficit.
Many conservatives also maintain that only Democrats and nervous opinion leaders see balanced budgets and tax cuts as mutually exclusive; the solution is simply to cut spending, they say. This, they argue, was the mistake of the Reagan years; not in cutting taxes, but in not cutting spending enough.
Still, even in a House Republican Conference where conservatives rule by a wide margin, there are qualms. Martha Phillips, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group devoted to eliminating the deficit, asserted, "Member after member has told Concord Coalition members that they personally don't approve of a tax cut at this point but have to go along, and they're sure the Senate will save them." She added, "This is absolutely the wrong time to be doing tax cuts."
But Ed Gillespie, press secretary for the House majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, asserted that such arguments were an old "siren song" in Washington -- the plea to set aside the promises of a campaign and "do the responsible thing." Mr. Norquist talked about the susceptibility of the "weak-kneed -- the ones who wake up in the morning and think, 'Oh my goodness, what will The Washington Post and The New York Times think of me today?' "
He added, "The good news for the Republican Party is there aren't too many of them anymore."
Indeed, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who has voiced considerable skepticism about tax cuts in the past, said on the CNN program "Evans and Novak" on Saturday that if the budget could be balanced without touching Social Security or harming the economy "then there is room for a tax cut."
Conservatives, in short, are rallying their troops for the last push in the contract -- one that resonates with 15 years of political history.

HEADLINE: Mubarak's Challenge

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 31

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak's visit to Washington in the coming week will take place as he is being confronted at home with rising discontent and mounting accusations of human rights abuses, governmental corruption and mismanagement that are driving away foreign investors.
Despite a recent crackdown that has curtailed violence by Islamic militants in Cairo, critics who include Western diplomats describe this country of 56 million as on the brink of crisis. They point to dismal economic growth and a refusal by Mr. Mubarak to share power as among the main elements for creating further social upheaval. Many Western diplomats now contend that the Government is too weak to sustain the shock of serious reform. 
 "The Egyptians tell us that if they hold free elections the Islamic militants will win," a senior European diplomat said. "They tell us that if they sell off the state industries and throw people out of work there will be riots. And they tell us that if they divide the currency their economy will collapse. All this is true."
Mr. Mubarak's Government, which is among America's closest allies in the Middle East, presentsitself as a modern, Western-style democracy; in fact, it more closely resembles the military dictatorships throughout the Arab world. For the past 50 years, power has remained firmly in the grip of the governing National Democratic Party, although under various names.
Mr. Mubarak was re-elected for a third six-year term in a 1993 referendum that did not permit any opposition. Many Cabinet ministers have remained in office for more than a decade. Nepotism and patronage determine advancement. And the President's pronouncements and image are given more and more prominence in the state-run media, reinforcing what critics say is a growing personality cult.
The largest opposition party, the Muslim Brotherhood, is outlawed and 34 of its leaders have been imprisoned without charges over the last few weeks, including 5 on Thursday. The Government, concerned over victories by Islamic militants in a spate of elections at university and professional unions, has moved to wipe the names of suspected militant sympathizers off the lists and annul the votes.
In February, in one of several efforts to curb the influence of the Islamic movement, a government court dissolved the leadership of the 220,000-member Engineer's Union and sequestered its assets; hundreds of engineers staged a sit-in in their headquarters.
"There is still a measure of freedom here, although it is growing smaller," said Magdi Hussein, the editor in chief of the opposition newspaper Al Shaab.
"But no Egyptian is allowed to criticize, or even question, the President or any member of his family. We are sliding closer and closer to an absolute dictatorship, and as we are, we are sliding closer and closer to an explosion."
The refusal to give the average Egyptian a stake in the Government has been matched by increasing repression. Human rights groups like the Washington-based Human Rights Watch say the Egyptian security forces torture suspects, abduct relatives of suspected militants until they surrender and carry out extra-judicial executions. In the last three years Egypt's military courts have sentenced 62 people to death, hanging dozens of them.
The tough measures by the police, while crippling the militant movement in Cairo, have failed to quell rebellion in southern Egypt. The violence there erupts in almost daily gun battles with Islamic militants, including one on Thursday in which five suspected militants were killed. The mud-walled towns and villages in southern Egypt look like armed camps, with troops lumbering down dirt roads in American-supplied armored personnel carriers, and public buildings surrounded by soldiers who crouch behind sand bags and are armed with heavy machine-guns.
"The tactic now is to kill as many of the local police and security officials as possible," said a militant leader. "We are no longer going after the top officials. We are under-cutting the Government's base. None of these people, who are poorly paid, have any incentive to fight. The morale of the security forces, especially in southern Egypt, is bad. And we are talking to a lot of these young recruits, trying to get them to join us."
But the most potent source of strength for the militant movement is governmental corruption, which many businessmen and Western diplomats say has spiraled out of control. It is driving away foreign investors and has helped stall economic reforms that were aimed at creating a vibrant private sector.
"We are forced to pay thousands, or tens of thousands of dollars," a Lebanese businessman said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.. "The corruption has wiped out many smaller businesses." Bloated and inefficient state-owned corporations dominate 80 percent of the economy, although many are losing money. The bureaucracy is so torpid that it can take weeks to get permission to make simple customs transactions or receive import licenses.
The United States Embassy said in a report this month that there would be no acceleration of economic growth unless the Government began carrying out promised structural reform.
"The desultory nature of the economic reform program in 1994 has led some observers to argue that the program has stalled," the report said.
The failure to devalue the currency, Western economists contend, means that Egypt will probably experience a crash, which could double prices overnight. The currency is overvalued, the economists say, by about 40 percent.
Only 15 percent of hard currency earnings in Egypt now come from goods and services. Suez Canal receipts, oil exports and tourism bring in about $6 billion a year. Remittances bring in $5 billion a year. But the growth of the population is now rapidly outstripping that of the economy, which has experienced less than 2 percent growth in the last three years.
"Egypt's economy was based on barter trade," one Western diplomat said. "It produced shoddy goods and dumped them on the Communist bloc in exchange for oil and other commodities. The Communist bloc doesn't exist, but the state factories keep turning out junk no one wants."

HEADLINE: Worries About Military Readiness Grow

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
The Pentagon is spending less on new weapons and equipment than at any time in nearly 50 years, prompting many lawmakers and senior officers to warn that the Clinton Administration may soon jeopardize combat readiness.
The debate over military preparedness poses a vexing problem for the White House. Last year, the issue focused on Republican accusations that the Administration was cutting the Pentagon budget too far, too fast. Subsequent Congressional hearings suggested that such concerns were exaggerated, but to avoid appearing weak on military matters, the White House added more than $10 billion for training, spare parts and salaries. 
 In fixing one problem, however, the Administration may have created another: Administration officials had to dip into money earmarked for replacing aging equipment and weapons.
"The Administration continues to make decisions that worsen the long-term prospect for cost-effective modernization," said Representative Floyd D. Spence, a South Carolina Republican who is chairman of the House National Security Committee.
Senior officers, concerned with potential problems in the future, have clashed with their civilian Pentagon superiors over these shifts and turned to Republicans and conservative Democrats for help. For Republicans, who have advocated deep spending cuts in areas from welfare to foreign aid, the Pentagon remains largely a sacred cow.
The issue of readiness is a complex one that spans training, spare parts, planning for new weapons and more, and it involves not only being ready today, but also being prepared for the combat of the future. And just in the last few days the issue's political dimension was underscored when President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, had a sharp exchange of letters over the failure of Congress to approve an emergency spending bill to cover unexpected operations in Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia.
Defense Secretary William J. Perry has proposed spending $39.4 billion in the 1996 fiscal year, or 16 percent of the total $246 billion military budget, on new equipment and weapons. It would be the lowest purchasing level, adjusted for inflation, since 1950.
In 1985, for instance, at the height of the Reagan-era buildup, spending on new equipment accounted for 34 percent of the $402 billion budget.
Under next year's budget, the Army would buy no new tanks, the Air Force no new fighter jets and the Navy just three new combat ships. But that is largely by design. After the collapse of the Soviet threat, the Clinton Administration decided the shrinking military could safely afford to live off cold-war stocks for a while. The question is, how long can the Pentagon wait before buying new generations of weapons to keep a smaller military technologically superior?
Ideally, the Pentagon seeks a balance between fielding well-trained, well-equipped troops and preparing for future weapons and equipment. But to help pay for short-term problems, the Pentagon's budget for new weapons in the 1996 fiscal year has $9 billion less than what the Administration said a year ago it would allocate for that purpose.
Some Democrats say senior officers are overstating the readiness risks to keep their budgets high. "We should avoid buying new systems that maintain the United States and the world on a treadmill of weapons development," said Representative Ronald V. Dellums, a California Democrat on the House National Security Committee.
But postponement of these long-term investments has sounded alarms at the highest levels of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "The dangers are very, very real and very great," Gen. John Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee recently. "The last year we can afford that is this year."
Ships, tanks, planes and trucks bought during the military buildup under President Ronald Reagan are showing signs of wear, their life spans compressed by unexpectedly high use in the Persian Gulf, Haiti, Bosnia and Somalia. Shrinking budgets have required the Defense Department to delay buying new weapons, like helicopters and amphibious troop-carrying tanks, and forced commanders to patch up aging equipment that costs more to maintain.
The Marine Corps, for example, is still using 50-year-old canvas tents, old leather combat boots and bulky, Korean War-era sleeping bags. The Marine Commandant, Gen. Carl E. Mundy Jr., told Congress last month that he did not have enough money to buy new gear.
To be sure, the American armed forces are still the most formidable in the world and are in no danger of being surpassed anytime soon. Since the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the military has greatly improved its laser-guided bombs, communication systems and intelligence networks.
The military is shopping smarter, largely by modifying existing equipment to extend its usefulness. But even the best equipment eventually needs to be replaced, usually after 15 or 20 years. Because it takes more than a decade to develop and build a new fighter jet or warship, the military has to plan far ahead. Technology developed in the 1970's and 1980's like radar-evading planes and night-vision goggles was not fielded until the 1990's.
Mr. Perry has an ambitious plan to modernize the force, increasing spending for new equipment and weapons by 47 percent, to $58 billion a year, from 1996 to 2001. But many senior officers, in unusual bursts of candor, warn that these increases will not be enough.
"At some point in the near future, the current funding strategy will ultimately undermine the Corps' ability to meet war-fighting and peacetime presence requirements," said the Marine Corps inspector general, Maj. Gen. Richard L. Phillips.
The Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, echoing views of the other Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the situation was not a crisis now, but "I am concerned for the long term." Many senior officers say serious problems may crop up as early as 1997 or 1998.
Even senior civilian Pentagon officials acknowledge that their approach has flaws. "We are not doing an adequate job for modernization, pure and simple," John Hamre, the Defense Department comptroller, said at a meeting of military contractors and Pentagon officials last month.
The Defense Department's modernization plan through 2001 includes about $77 billion for each service's big-ticket priorities: the Air Force's F-22 fighter and C-17 cargo plane; the Navy's new attack submarine and destroyer and remodeled FA-18 attack plane; the Army's M1 tank upgrade, and the Marines' V-22 transport aircraft.
Each service makes tradeoffs in setting such priorities. While General Mundy says he will not have enough money next year to pay for 129,440 new sleeping bags at $118 apiece (a total of $15.3 million), the Marines are spending $762.5 million on the V-22.
The larger problem of allocating money to the services falls to Mr. Perry and John M. Deutch, the Deputy Defense Secretary. The Pentagon is relying heavily on savings from base closings, a streamlined weapons-purchasing system and bigger budgets to pay for the weapons of the future. "This is the biggest management challenge of the department," Mr. Deutch said in an interview.
Many military analysts express doubt that the Pentagon can achieve its projected savings. Moreover, analysts say it will be difficult for the Defense Department to afford a 1.4-million-member military, sustain today's high readiness levels and spend billions of dollars on new weapons.
"We can't afford to have force structure at today's high readiness level and have all the modernization programs they have on the books," said Steven Kosiak, an analyst at the Defense Budget Project, an independent research organization.
To slash costs, the military is trying to buy more off-the-shelf commercial products, build planes and missiles that more than one branch of the military can use, increase training on simulators and rely more on modifying existing weapons. Air Force B-52's built in 1961, for example, are still flying, thanks to improved electronics and other modifications.
Tighter budgets have inspired clever money-saving innovations. At Camp Lejeune, N.C., for example, Marines expect to save $385,000 a year by retreading truck tires instead of buying new ones. Commanders are planning to spend $490,000 to replace lithium truck batteries with rechargeable lead batteries, an investment that will save $364,000 a year.
Maj. Gen. James L. Jones, the Second Marine Division commander, is urging troops to wear flak jackets on exercises only when needed, saving wear on the protective vests, which cost $396 each.
Other marines, like Capt. Catherine Cabrera, the head of an electronic maintenance company, make do with older equipment, like a 12-year-old copy machine. "We'll hold on to it until it breathes its last breath," she said.
Lieut. Col. Mike Applegate's battalion of 208 amphibious assault vehicles may not have that option much longer. The 22-year-old troop-carrying amphibious tanks are breaking down more and more.
"If we don't fix this in three or four years," Colonel Applegate said, "this fleet will be on its knees."

HEADLINE: In Frail State, Knudsen Taps A Rescue Pro

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
The Morrison Knudsen Corporation, struggling with the worst crisis in its 83-year history, yesterday named Robert S. Miller Jr. as its new chairman.
Mr. Miller, 53, a former vice chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, helped negotiate the auto maker's financial rescue in 1980. He also advised Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the Reichmann family's real estate empire, during its protracted debt negotiations in 1992. 
 Mr. Miller fills the position vacated two weeks ago by William P. Clark, who had been Morrison Knudsen's acting chairman.
"Morrison Knudsen is one of America's great national treasures," Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview yesterday from his home in Sun River, Ore. "It would be a great tragedy for us all if it were to disintegrate. If I can help avoid that disaster, I can't resist the challenge."
Mr. Miller will head a leadership team that includes Robert Tinstman, Morrison Knudsen's president and chief executive and a 20-year veteran of the company, and Denis Slavich, the chief financial officer, who has experience at the Bechtel Group and at Fluor Daniel.
His appointment comes as Morrison Knudsen, which helped build national landmarks like the Hoover Dam and the San Francisco Bay Bridge, is engaged in critical negotiations with 28 banks, led by the Bank of America, a unit of BankAmerica Corporation, and the Mellon Bank, a unit of Mellon Bank Corporation.
The Boise, Idaho, company already owes the banks $235 million and is negotiating for at least $50 million in fresh credit at a time bankers' confidence in the company and its leadership has been severely shaken.
Last summer, in the sixth year of William J. Agee's controversial term as chairman and chief executive, the public picture of Morrison Knudsen's finances began to deteriorate sharply. Mr. Agee had pushed the company into highly visible but ultimately unprofitable mass-transit equipment projects; aggressive asset sales screened the worsening problems until July, when the value of important transit-car contracts was abruptly and sharply reduced.
By October, despite Mr. Agee's predictions of a turnaround, the company no longer complied with the terms of its loan agreements. On Feb. 10, Mr. Agee was forced to resign, and soon after, the company predicted that its 1994 loss would be $175 million.
That was just the beginning. On March 20, the company warned Wall Street analysts that its 1994 loss would be closer to $310 million, and on the same day, announced the resignation of Mr. Clark, a board member who stepped in as acting chairman the night Mr. Agee resigned.
Yesterday, Mr. Miller said: "I have talked with a number of the bankers to get a sense of their attitudes. They are a bit stunned by the suddenness in the downturn in the fortunes of the company" and by "the leadership vacuum" created by Mr. Clark's abrupt resignation.
Wall Street, too, has been shaken. The company's stock, which traded at nearly $30 a year ago, has fallen about 80 percent since then, closing Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at $6. That decline has hurt the company's institutional investors, which own 56 percent of its shares, and has frightened the thousands of current and retired employees who own shares through executive retirement programs and employee stock plans.
Tobias M. Levkovich, an analyst at Smith Barney, said Mr. Miller's appointment would probably be greeted with cheers in the market today. "It will be seen as a very positive development that they have attracted somebody of Mr. Miller's caliber," he said. "But we still think they're going to have a very difficult time keeping this thing together. Mr. Miller has got to make people believe he can keep this company from going under -- it all comes down to confidence and credibility."
The company has not yet released its final audit for 1994 and is trying to raise cash through the sale of its 65 percent stake in MK Rail, its 46.5 percent share of MK Gold, and its Australian construction subsidiary, McConnell Dowell. And it must arrange a viable exit from the troubled MK Transit subsidiary.
In outlining his view of the choices facing Morrison Knudsen's bankers, Mr. Miller was just as blunt as he had been in his celebrated confrontations with the 400 or so domestic and foreign banks that were involved in the Chrysler talks.
"The overpowering thing is that it makes so much more sense to keep the company going than to stop the music," he said. "Since the value of the franchise and the prospects for the banks' ultimate satisfaction both depend on continuing the enterprise, I'm reasonably confident that a way will be found to find the new funding" the company needs.
Mr. Miller, known as Steve, was a rising star at the Ford Motor Company in 1979 when he was asked to become Chrysler's chief financial officer at the onset of Chrysler's brush with bankruptcy. Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman then, recalled in his memoirs that Mr. Miller's role was "absolutely critical."
His task was to get hundreds of lenders to agree to take less than they were owed. Unless they agreed, Chrysler could not tap the Federal loan guarantees that underwrote the rescue plan. He succeeded, Mr. Iacocca recalled, by using both tough bargaining and lively humor -- at one point, holding a toy gun to his head and threatening to fire if a key concession was not accepted.
His most effective prank, however, was at a critical meeting with bankers on April 1, 1980 -- 15 years before his acceptance of the Morrison Knudsen job. Mr. Miller opened that Chrysler meeting by announcing that the economy was so troubled and the company had gotten so little support from its lenders that it had decided to file for bankruptcy anyway. He quickly reminded his audience that it was April Fool's Day.
"It got everybody in the room to focus on the larger picture and to consider the consequences of no agreement," Mr. Iacocca noted.
After leaving Chrysler in 1992, Mr. Miller briefly joined the investment banking firm of James D. Wolfensohn Inc., where he worked on the Olympia & York negotiations. Since 1993, he has helped run his family's lumber business in Bandon, Ore., declining several job opportunities because they seemed "too ordinary," he said.
But he remained friends with two Morrison Knudsen directors -- Gerard D. Roche, chairman of the executive-recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles, and Peter S. Lynch, the retired mutual fund manager whose Fidelity Magellan Fund had been a major investor in Chrysler stock. They were instrumental in bringing his name to the board's attention, he said.
A few of Morrison Knudsen's banks worked with Mr. Miller in the Chrysler negotiations in 1980. "That was an experience that all the bankers seemed to take great pride in, like going through a war," he said, noting that he would be attending a party at the Sky Club in New York in June to mark the 15th anniversary of the bank agreement.
"One or two of the bankers in the Morrison Knudsen case are in that group," he added. "That might help."

HEADLINE: Symbols of Policy Ills, Public High Rises Fall

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 2

 BODY:
They once represented the promise of urban renewal. But today, two buildings in the Christopher Columbus Homes here were turned to dust, a symbol of well-intentioned housing policies turned bad.
The Newark Housing Authority dynamited the two long-vacant high rises today to make way for new homes at the site. The 13-story buildings, each with 200 apartments, collapsed upon themselves, just as the demolition experts, Controlled Demolition Inc., of Phoenix, Md., had planned. 
 "High-rise public housing was not a good idea for urban America," said Harold Lucas, executive director of the housing authority. "These buildings haven't worked anywhere. They generated high crime and had a negative image."
Under a 1989 court agreement, the housing authority is building homes to replace each public housing unit it tears down. Four Columbus towers were demolished in March 1994, and Mr. Lucas said he hoped that the remaining two would be torn down by the end of the summer. About 300 town houses are to be built on the Columbus site, he said.
The housing authority's goal is to build 1,777 town houses throughout Newark to replace the 1,600 apartments that existed at Columbus.
Mayor Sharpe James said the public housing high rises were "a blight on the community."
"They were reservations for the poor," he said. "Now we are building safe, affordable housing where people can live in dignity."

HEADLINE: Losing Hope of Regaining Senate, Democrats Focus on House

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Many leading Democrats have all but given up hope of regaining control of the Senate in 1996 and are concentrating on persuading wavering House members to run again in the hope of recapturing that chamber.
The Democrats' worries, which have been building since last November, intensified when 73-year-old Howell Heflin of Alabama announced last week that he would retire from the Senate after three terms. He will be the fourth Democratic Senator to retire next year, and others may well follow. 
 Seeking to prevent the same thing from happening in the House, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, and Representative Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, have begun holding one-on-one strategy sessions to persuade wavering House Democrats to run at least one more term. Although the campaign committee is still paying off a $2.5 million debt, Mr. Frost said he was promising to give these members, who, by some estimates, number close to two dozen, whatever financial assistance possible to help them.
"We're talking individually with any member who is even considering retirement," Mr. Frost said, "and at least urging that member to run one more time."
Mr. Gephardt has also assembled a group of former House members to try to persuade their old colleagues not to give up, and to help recruit new candidates. Former Representative Dennis E. Eckart of Ohio, who retired from Congress in 1992, said he had had several such "confessional talks" with incumbent lawmakers.
"A lot of members call me and say, 'Gosh, how do you like it? Is there really life out of Congress?' " he said.
Yet Mr. Eckart said his hunch was that most Democrats were ready to fight to win back the House. "Both sides are really ginning up for 1996 to become almost a holy political war," he said. "Republicans see this as a year in which they can lock in majority status. The Democrats know that because they have the largest minority in 40 years, this is their chance because otherwise they could get locked into minority status."
But Mr. Eckart and many other analysts concede that the Republicans have the edge, particularly in keeping the Senate.
"I've long suspected that there was going to be a mad rush for the door," said Charles Cook, who tracks Congressional campaigns for his nonpartisan political newsletter. "The chances are greater of Republicans getting 60 seats than Democrats recapturing control of the Senate. In the House, they're on pins and needles. My suspicion is that you'll see an exodus there as well."
Democrats are particularly concerned about retirements because open seats are much more difficult to hold than a seat with an incumbent seeking re-election. Before the 1994 election, six Democrats decided not to seek re-election to the Senate and the party lost all those seats.
Even as Democrats are still adjusting to being the minority, many readily acknowledge that winning back the Senate anytime soon may well be out of the party's grasp.
"Candidly, I think we're in a better position to regain the House," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "That's just a question of numbers and of retirements. But obviously, a large amount of this depends on how we do at the top of the ticket and in gubernatorial races. Who would have anticipated at this time two years ago that the House Republicans would win 55 seats?"
Despite the party's assurances of help, a continued parade of retirements would not be surprising given that many Democrats do not relish being in the minority, or the other hardships of political office these days, like the interminable fund raising. In fact, fund raising is almost certain to be more difficult for Democrats because the Republicans in power are demanding support, and allegiance, from political action committees.
Now that two Democratic Senators have switched to the Republicans -- Richard C. Shelby of Alabama and Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado -- the current Senate lineup is 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats. Three other Democrats besides Mr. Heflin have announced their retirements: Senators Jim Exon of Nebraska, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and Paul Simon of Illinois. Alabama, Louisiana and Nebraska are increasingly considered Republican-leaning states.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, has identified three more Democrats who face re-election in 1996 and might retire: Senators David Pryor of Arkansas, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island. There are 15 Democratic and 18 Republican seats up next year. Only one Republican Senator, Hank Brown of Colorado, has announced that he will retire next year.
Tom King, a Democratic consultant, echoed many of his colleagues in saying he was more hopeful about the House than the Senate.
"It's a tough road in the Senate, but in the House, we have a shot at it," he said. "But I think there's a fighting mood and people are more optimistic than they were two months ago. Newt Gingrich will be a great foil to run against."
So far, no House Democrats have announced their retirements. Generally, senators give more notice because of the fund-raising and organizational requirements for those in their party who might seek the seats.
The Republicans have only a 26-seat edge in the House, and 12 Democrats and Republicans were elected to that chamber last year with less than 50 percent of the vote. Still, Republicans have set their sights on picking up even more seats, especially in the South. Mr. Cook has already identified 22 possible Democratic retirements next year, as opposed to 10 among Republicans.
Mr. Frost said he was hopeful about winning back the House, but he did not see 1996 as a race for dominance over several terms. "It's possible for us to take the House back in '96 and for them to potentially take it back in '98," he said. "It is my sense that the House is going to be up for grabs every two years for the rest of the decade."
While Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton are playing hosts to fund-raising events next month for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, several Democrats said White House officials were too preoccupied with the President's re-election effort to do much now to regain the House and Senate. But more than anything else, the popularity of Mr. Clinton in 1996 could have a lot to do with which party ends up controlling Congress.
But Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster, suggested that it might be in the long-term interest of Democrats to lose the White House next year.
"The Senate's gone for them -- you look at those seats," he said. "The best thing the Democrats can hope for is for the Republicans to win the White House in '96 and hope for an economic downturn. Then they can storm back and take the Senate in 98."
But in Alabama, the state Democratic chairman, William B. Blount, refuses to give up after Mr. Heflin's retirement.
"I don't think Howell Heflin could have been beat," he said. "Now, it's a flip of the coin. But we've got several good candidates looking at it -- including me."

HEADLINE: Throngs of Boat People to Be Sent Home to Vietnam Soon

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 30

 BODY:
Governments throughout Southeast Asia are to begin sending Vietnamese boat people home within weeks, with the United Nations breaking tradition to help in the effort to push tens of thousands of the migrants back to Vietnam by the end of the year, diplomats and United Nations officials say.
Alarmed by violence this month among Vietnamese detained in Hong Kong and the Philippines, governments across the region are beefing up the police presence in the detention camps, where most of the 46,000 boat people are expected to face eviction by the end of the year. 
 In protest this week, a group of boat people set fires in a Hong Kong camp and a group of asylum-seekers in the Philippines threatened suicide again. Several slashed themselves with knives this month when they were forced to move from one camp in the Philippines to another.
The first large wave is expected to take place in April or May, with the program reaching its full monthly quota of 3,600 by midsummer, said Werner Blatter, director of the Asia division for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
"We will soon see some important movements of people," Mr. Blatter said in an interview. "We feel sure that it is now time for these people to go home. It's time to wrap this up."
He said the goal was to empty virtually all of the detention camps in Asia, except those in Hong Kong, by the end of the year. In Hong Kong, where about 25,000 boat people are detained, officials said they might not complete the repatriations until the middle of next year.
Although United Nations employees will be not be personally involved in forcing the Vietnamese onto airplanes or boats, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has agreed to cooperate with the repatriation program. The move is a sharp break for the United Nations, which in the past has refused to involve itself in programs to force refugees or economic migrants to move against their will.
"From a public relations standpoint, there's some queasiness within the United Nations about taking part in something like this," said a Western diplomat involved in the program. "But I think the U.N. people are comforted to know that the international community is behind them."
The United States, which long opposed sending the Vietnamese home and has provided hundreds of millions of dollars since the end of the Vietnam War for the upkeep of the camps, is now eager to see the last of the boat people return to Vietnam -- voluntarily or not.
In a statement intended to dash any lingering hope among the boat people that they might find a home in the United States, the State Department said on March 17 that the Vietnamese "whose claims to asylum have not been upheld have no option but to return to their country of origin."
Vietnam is also eager to see the migrants back home, if only to put an end to its image as a country so poor and so repressive that people would rather take to rickety boats on the high seas than remain in their homeland. The return of the last boat people will signal the end of a 20-year exodus that led more than a million Vietnamese to a new life abroad, most in the United States.
Virtually all of the Vietnamese left in detention camps in Southeast Asia -- the largest camps are in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand -- have been labeled economic migrants, not political refugees.
Ruth Marshall, a spokeswoman in Geneva for the High Commissioner for Refugees, described the situation of the Vietnamese left in the camps as "a nonrefugee problem."
"There is no moral or legal principle that requires the international community to continue to assist a large population of illegal immigrants," she added.
She said the High Commissioner's Office was eager to close the Asian camps because of far more pressing needs elsewhere, particularly in parts of Africa where civil war and ethnic strife have displaced millions of people in just the last year.
"There are real refugees out there crying out for a lot more help than we can given them right now," she said. "We have to draw a line."

HEADLINE: For Stocks, Winners Outnumbered the Losers by 2 to 1 in This Year's First Quarter

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
After a dismal 1994, investors may have needed a reason to party. So far this year, they certainly have, celebrating the least bit of good news by sending the stock market to new highs and individual issues soaring in the first quarter. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 companies, which serves as a general proxy for the market, rose 9 percent in the first three months of 1995, compared with a loss of 1.3 percent last year.
The general euphoria seems to have extended to most of the stocks trading at more than $5 a share on the three major markets: the New York and American stock exchanges and the Nasdaq market, according to data compiled by Media General Financial Services. The number of winning stocks outnumbered the losers by the rate of almost two to one. Among the 6,014 issues tracked by Media General, 3,853 closed up in price, compared with just 1,959 losing stocks. 
 Not even last week's jitters over the falling dollar managed to significantly dampen the enthusiasm, led by the strong performance of large multinational consumer companies and technology firms.
While investors may be in for more volatility than they have been used to during the last few years, few market optimists were predicting a real about-face from this year's highs.
"I think a lot of it is noise," said Alfred Kugel, the senior investment strategist for Stein Roe & Farnham, a Chicago money management firm. "The bottom line is, not much has changed." The economy's growth seems to have slowed without halting, and the companies based in the United States that sell goods and services abroad are benefiting from the cheaper dollar.
While some highfliers felt the pull of gravity in the last few days, investors who were in from the start were still looking at some sizable gains. The shares of semiconductor maker Micron Technology, for example, werestill one of the quarter's hottest performers, up 72.5 percent -- even after falling $9 in the last three days of the quarter. Among other technology stocks leading the way were two semiconductor companies: Alpha Industries, which trades on the American Stock Exchange, up 80 percent, and Orbit Semiconductor, which trades on Nasdaq, up 110 percent.
Many of the biggest gainers this quarter fueled investors' enthusiasm by reporting strong profit comparisons for the quarter or by announcing an exciting new product or contract. The Corrections Corporation of America, for example, a Nashville company that manages prisons, was the top-performing stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
Crime certainly paid: the stock nearly doubled, from $16.13 to $30.63, in the quarter as investors reacted positively to a 71 percent increase in the company's quarterly earnings, followed by news of a $23 million contract to manage a 2,000-bed jail in Texas.
Hudson Technologies, which recovers and reclaims the refrigerants that environmental regulators are worried about in air-conditioners and refrigerators, saw its stock more than triple, closing the quarter at $17.25, up from $5.50. Shares of the company, based in Hillburn, N.Y., took off after it said that it had a contract with the Carrier Corporation, a leading maker of air- conditioning systems that is a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation. Hudson's earnings are also up.
Among the quarter's other top performers were several medical technology companies, like the Sofamor/Danek Group, the Memphis producer of spinal implant devices, and Thermo Cardiosystems, the Woburn, Mass., maker of heart implant devices.
With Wall Street favoring the stocks of large pharmaceutical companies again, investors received any news of a settled lawsuit or favorable action by the Food and Drug Administration by bidding up the prices of medical technology stocks.
The surge in takeover activity also resulted in big gains for some issues. The stock of Chicago and North Western, the railroad company, saw its shares jump 78 percent after the Union Pacific Corporation's rail division bid $35 a share in cash in mid-March. Other stocks swept up in merger bliss included Shawmut National, the Hartford bank holding company that announced in February its intention to combine with Fleet Financial Group of Boston.
Wellcome, the British drug maker, saw its shares rise by more than half after it was pursued by Glaxo Holdings, Britain's largest pharmaceutical company. And the shares of American Maize-Products rose 60 percent once Eridania Beghin-Say, a subsidiary of chemical giant Montedison, decided it wanted to take over the Stamford, Conn., company.
All the biggest losers on the New York Stock Exchange were Mexican companies hurt by the plummeting peso. Investors decided to take their losses and go home. As a result, Grupo Elektra, which sells low-priced appliances and furniture, saw its shares drop from $14.13 to $4, despite the company's 68 percent rise in earnings in the quarter. If it was in pesos, it just didn't count.

New York City Tourism

 BODY:
By all indications, 1994 was a banner year for tourism in New York City. The weak dollar, an improving economy and big events like soccer World Cup and the Gay Games healped attract almost 25 million visitors to the city. Travel experts also credit the continuing decline in crime and the reduction in the tax for hotel rooms for the surge in tourism. The combined city and state tax fell to 13.25 percent plus $2 a room from 19.25 percent plus $2 on Dec. 1. But hotels and travel agents began to see an increase in bookings months earlier, when the cuts were announced.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Is Moving To Protect Homosexuals

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, March 30

 BODY:
While anti-discrimination laws are being challenged elsewhere, Rhode Island is bucking the national trend by advancing a bill that would grant protection to homosexuals in employment, housing, public accommodations and credit.
"Rhode Island has always been contrary," said State Senator William P. Fitzpatrick, a Democrat from Cranston who is gay and will shepherd the bill through the Senate, where it is given a good chance of passage. The measure was approved 57 to 41 on Wednesday by the House of Representatives, and Gov. Lincoln C. Almond, a Republican, has said he will sign it. 
 The Governor's communications director, Jim Taricani, said Mr. Almond "has a longstanding belief that no one should be discriminated against, and he thinks this law is unfortunately necessary."
Mr. Fitzpatrick said Rhode Island "will be viewed as progressive in what is appearing to become a regressive country." But he added that he did not underestimate the opposition, since such legislation has failed four times in the state since 1990.
Challenges to existing or prospective local anti-discrimination laws have been mounted in Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Maine, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon and Washington, among others. Some have been successful, some not and some are pending.
Opponents like State Representative Charles T. Knowles, Democrat of Narragansett, who voted against the Rhode Island bill, say anti-bias laws designating homosexuals as a protected minority effectively create "special rights for well-educated, economically advantaged people."
State Senator Michael J. Flynn, a Smithfield Republican who serves as minority leader and also opposes the bill, said the gay people he knew "live in some of the best locations and certainly have mortgages and jobs."
"I see no need for these special rights," Mr. Flynn said. "I think if we pass this legislation, we're validating a life style."
Advocates respond that homosexuality is not a life style but an innate characteristic and that homosexuals constantly suffer discrimination that is almost impossible to measure. A woman dismissed from her job because she is a lesbian, for example, would probably not make a public issue of it, for fear of jeopardizing future employment prospects.
"We in the gay and lesbian community of Rhode Island hear many, many stories of discrimination, especially in employment and housing," said a teacher, Ralph M. Perry. "But most people won't come forward for fear of receiving publicity and being identified."
When Mr. Perry came forward earlier this month to testify for the bill and publicly disclose his homosexuality, it was front-page news in Rhode Island. That is because he is the state's Teacher of the Year.
"My success and reputation in my field are not enough," Mr. Perry told the House committee on special legislation. "Despite my recognition as a good teacher, I can legally be fired tomorrow for testifying here tonight. This is not right."
State Representative Francis A. Gaschen, Democrat of Cumberland, a co-sponsor of the bill, said Mr. Perry's testimony "answered the question, 'What do we need this for?' "
Mr. Perry, 42, teaches reading, writing and mathematics to first and second graders at the Aquidneck Elementary School in Middletown. Known familiarly as Marty, Mr. Perry has worked in the Middletown public schools for 17 years and was that system's Teacher of the Year in 1994, before winning the statewide designation last December.
Although he studied for the Roman Catholic priesthood, Mr. Perry said his volunteer work with the deaf and mentally retarded convinced him that "teaching was my true calling."
After years of keeping his homosexuality a secret from friends and family, Mr. Perry met Bob Fulghum in 1982. "We decided in 1983 to spend the rest of our lives together and wanted to share that with family and friends," Mr. Perry said. However, he refrained from talking about his personal life at school, he said, "for fear of repercussions from parents."
Last year, when the bill was before the Legislature, Mr. Perry planned to testify. But he said a lawyer for the National Education Association, the teachers union, "couldn't warn me in strong enough terms" not to do so, out of concern for his job.
"I really felt by not testifying that I let down the gay and lesbian community," Mr. Perry said, and resolved to come forward this year. Since his appearance two weeks ago, he said, he has received "nothing but support."
Sharon Osborne, the special assistant to Rhode Island's commissioner of education, who oversees the Teacher of the Year designation, said there had been "no backlash at all" from Mr. Perry's testimony.
If the State Senate passes the anti-discrimination bill, Rhode Island would become the ninth state to adopt such a statewide law. Wisconsin was the first, in 1982, said Robin Kane, of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Massachusetts followed in 1989; Connecticut and Hawaii in 1991; California, New Jersey and Vermont in 1992, and Minnesota in 1993.
New York does not have such a law, as Republican leaders in the State Senate have blocked the bill from reaching the floor for a vote. Gov. George E. Pataki has said he believes the measure should be considered by the full Senate but would veto the bill if it passed.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Owners End a Battle, But the War Isn't Over

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
As Bud Selig tried to walk away at last from the most ignominious chapter in the history of sports labor relations, a lone voice called out to baseball's harried interim commissioner with some unsolicited advice yesterday.
"Lock 'em out, Bud." 
 Selig, the man who banked on rewriting the rules when it comes to player salaries only to have to concede the war to a victorious players union, didn't even break stride.
There was no use stopping. There was no fight left. Not in the owners, at least. The damage that had come from a nearly eight-month-old fight with striking players had been assessed. And the assessment wasn't good.
Yes, the owners had learned how to match the players' resolve. "I think we've both proven how strong we are," Jerry McMorris, the owner of the Colorado Rockies, said. But, an obviously world-weary McMorris said, "I think we've severely damaged our game."
And because enough owners obviously agreed, the battle was over, for now.
The war had started in 1974 when the first players were granted free agency and their employers, eager to buy success, stopped caring about controlling costs or their fellow owners' economic concerns.
The war, which has run hot and cold ever since, resumed with open hostilities last Aug. 12, when the players struck. History will show that on April 2, 1995, 234 days later, the longest work stoppage ended not with a bang but a whimper, not with lasting peace but with uncertainty.
There still is no Basic Agreement, no accord with the workers. And, to the chagrin of small-market clubs, there is no increased revenue sharing because big-market clubs still link revenue sharing -- which could distribute $58 million -- to major concessions by the players.
Still, enough owners, big market and small, are now obviously convinced that for now there can be no gain on any front, even if the players were locked out. So they accepted the players' offer to return, and didn't even have to vote on it.
"The clubs sat patiently and listened to all the information and in the end came off without very little debate, really almost no debate, on what were the best ways for us to restore order but continue to keep moving toward a solution to our problems," Selig said. "And the course of action we took today is what we believe to be the most viable solution to all that."
And, Selig added, any talk of who won and who lost was childish. Yet there are winners, although very few among the ranks of the owners. Conversely, the varying degrees of loss were obvious.
Small-market owners, hard-line executives, like Jackie Autry of the Angels, walked by with tight lips and precious few comments.
"I'm not sure comfortable is the word," Bill Bartholomey of the Atlanta Braves -- a hard-line club -- said when asked to describe the tenor of the afternoon. "But under the circumstances, it was a good meeting."
But for big-market executives, the relief showed in their walk and in their talk. "There is ongoing concern," said McMorris, who voiced opposition to a lockout throughout the weekend. "We still have to have the right economic improvements in the industry. I think everybody knows that. But we need to get the '95 season going."
Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles, once the lone holdout against total war, went in today knowing that McMorris and Fred Wilpon of the Mets, George Steinbrenner of the Yankees, the Blue Jays and more didn't want an escalation in hostilities. They just wanted to play ball, and with their regular players, not replacements.
So there was no lockout vote that many had predicted would be close. Instead, the owners said yes -- with delight, Selig said more than once -- to the players' offer to come back if the rules of the expired Basic Agreement are adhered to. Then, Selig said with much hope, an agreement that gives the owners what they want in terms of financial security will come, anyway, without another work stoppage and labor carnage.
As for Round 8, did what the owners do yesterday constitute total surrender?
As it turned out, that was the one question that didn't delight Selig. And it certainly didn't cause him to turn a deaf ear.
"I don't regard it as a surrender," Selig said, voice and dander rising. "The players were on strike. They made an unconditional offer to come back. We accepted that offer. We also said there are also many other things working.
"The fact is, we believe that we have to come to some fulfillment in our long-term economic problems. There are many ways to do that. But we believe that right now it's important to get the focus of the game back on the field for all parties. Period. It's in our best interest for us to do that."
In thinking of their own best interests, the owners have stumbled on what was right for the game, too. The best interests of baseball, a dust-covered concept, had made a return.
The best interests came back, hand in hand with some sanity and rational thought. And as it did, it passed replacement players, salary cap imbroglios and total war with the union, on their way out the door at last.

HEADLINE: The Baseball Truce

 BODY:
Just when it seemed the highlight of the summer sports season might be videotape of Michael Jordan's return to basketball, Major League Baseball has been forced to snap out of its stupefying labor dispute. The resumption of baseball, even for an abbreviated season that may make 15-game winners the paradigm of pitching excellence, is cheering news for baseball fans, many of whom feared a summertime choice between lawn mowing and watching hapless replacement players.
But the resumption of Major League Baseball does not signal an end of the economic and labor issues that have divided the players and owners and badly wounded America's most ingenious sport. This is a reprieve, not a resolution. If a new labor agreement is not reached in the weeks ahead, there is a good chance play will be suspended again in coming years. 
 It may be hard to summon great sympathy for either side in a dispute over how to divide the kind of riches most Americans can only read about, but the players are justified in fighting for the freedom to sell their skills in an open market. The salary inflation that imperils teams in smaller cities that offer less lucrative television contracts was propelled by the owners themselves as they signed .250 hitters to multimillion-dollar deals. If some redistribution of wealth is required to keep the poorer franchises competitive and in business, the owners should finance it. It offends principle to ask the players to prop up weak franchises by restricting their right to bargain for higher salaries.
Even the temporary peace produced over the weekend represents a failure of collective bargaining. The two sides decided to play ball not because they had narrowed differences but because Federal Judge Sonia Sotomayor left little choice. She found the owners had unfairly established new work rules during the baseball negotiations by suspending salary arbitration, free-agent bidding and anti-collusion provisions in the old agreement. After she ordered the provisions reinstated, the players ended their strike. A lockout by the owners was untenable because it could cost them $5 million a day in back pay and damages if the National Labor Relations Board ultimately were to rule that they engaged in unfair labor practices.
Baseball has been in an uncontrollable skid since 1992, when a group of owners, led by Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers, decided they had had enough of a competitive marketplace and player rights. They fired Commissioner Fay Vincent, who was trying to work out a new labor agreement, and under the protection of baseball's antitrust exemption started dictating to the players instead of bargaining with them.
The only way to resolve the crisis in baseball is with a new collective bargaining agreement, and with elimination of the antitrust exemption. But for now, let the April optimism of fans from Boston to San Francisco flower anew.

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Meets Man Who Gave Her 2 L's

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: DHAKA, Bangladesh, April 2

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton has practiced law, raised a daughter and tried to change one-seventh of the American economy by reshaping health care. But in the last 24 hours she has ridden a bull elephant with Secret Service radio escort, and met the man responsible for making her a Hillary with two l's.
At an airstrip in Katmandu, Nepal -- just after an overnight tiger safari and just before her departure for this poverty-ridden pocket of South Asia -- Mrs. Clinton shook hands with Sir Edmund Hillary, the New Zealander who conquered Mount Everest with Tenzing Norgay in 1953. He was passing through town on his way to visit schools and a hospital in the Himalayan highlands financed by a foundation he heads. 
 "To be honest with you, in America, before if anybody recognized the name Hillary, it's always been me," Sir Edmund, 75, told reporters just before greeting Mrs. Clinton. "And now they say, 'Oh, you must be a lady!' "
For her part, Mrs. Clinton confessed that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, had read an article about the intrepid Edmund Hillary, a one-time beekeeper who had taken to mountain climbing, when she was pregnant with her daughter in 1947 and liked the name.
"It had two l's, which is how she thought she was supposed to spell Hillary," Mrs. Clinton told reporters after the brief meeting on the tarmac, minutes before her Air Force jet flew past the peak of Everest itself. "So when I was born, she called me Hillary, and she always told me it's because of Sir Edmund Hillary."
Sir Edmund was to have joined Mrs. Clinton overnight at the Tiger Tops Jungle Lodge, a rustic hotel in the Royal Chitwan National Park that has played host to guests from Queen Elizabeth II to Goldie Hawn. But mechanical problems delayed his plane from New Zealand and he barely made it in time for the airport handshake today.
So he missed the sight of Mrs. Clinton and her 15-year-old daughter, Chelsea, ensconced in a padded howdah atop Shamsher Bahadur, a 9-foot, 8 1/2-inch elephant whose name means Brave Tiger, in a sunset search for a tiger in the grass on Saturday. They were trailed by three Secret Service agents -- with sunglasses, wrist walkie-talkies, earphones and all.
"Fancy meeting you all here," Mrs. Clinton called out to reporters from under a wide-brimmed straw hat as her elephant approached a river bank for a picture-taking session that had been negotiated with her reluctant staff in the plaintive entreaties and blunt demurrers generally reserved for nuclear disarmament talks.
Informed that the reporters, aboard their own fleet of rolling trunks and giant toenails, had seen three mother-daughter pairs of armor-plated Asian rhinos, Mrs. Clinton quickly brought the topic around to the business of her trip: encouraging the education of girls and women.
"Mothers and daughters?" she exclaimed. "Are they sending their girls to school?"
In fact, it must be reported, Mrs. Clinton's day off -- sandwiched between 12 overloaded days of visits to schools, clinics and the leaders of five nations -- induced in the captive press corps accompanying her a degree of sympathy rare for traveling journalists.
So it was all the more puzzling that her aides had ever resisted letting her be photographed in such a quintessential subcontinental setting. Some suggested they were reluctant to invite comparisons with Jacqueline Kennedy, the last American First Lady to make a solo trip to this region. She rode an elephant in Jaipur, India, 33 years ago last month.
One ride of an hour and a half was enough for Mrs. Clinton, though Chelsea went out again this morning. Neither spied the big quarry, the endangered royal Bengal tiger, but they did see rhinos, spotted deer and a peacock perched in a tree.
The forest was also thick with wild hogs, whose cousin, the Arkansas Razorbacks, impelled Mrs. Clinton's attempt at contact with the outside world from the remote lodge: she brought a short-wave radio, hoping to catch word of the game between the University of Arkansas and North Carolina, but couldn't find any broadcasts in English. In the end, the White House communications staff traveling with the First Lady reached the President's entourage in Little Rock and learned that Arkansas had won.

HEADLINE: Poor Town Finds an Angel in a White Coat

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: BAYOU LA BATRE, Ala., April 1

 BODY:
The old man swore he saw angels.
It was a year or so back, the day 79-year-old Emile Lyons suffered an abdominal aneurysm. "The day my insides busted," he said. The bony commercial fisherman had lived through hurricanes, heart bypasses and his 50th wedding anniversary. But that day, he really believed the Lord had called him home. 
 As two paramedics loaded him into the ambulance, "I saw angels and lights and everything," he said. Through the haze of pain he found a familiar face, his doctor, Regina Benjamin. She had jumped in the ambulance with him, and treated him on the tortuous 30-minute drive to the nearest emergency room, in Mobile.
"She saved my life," Mr. Lyons said. "Could be she's an angel, too."
It seems like everyone in this impoverished fishing village on Alabama's Gulf Coast has a story to tell about this woman who stitches their shark bites, watches over the babies and comes running when accidents at the docks or shipyards injure husbands and sons. She makes house calls in a Ford pickup and checks in on shut-ins by telephone.
When they cannot pay -- which is often -- she tells them to pay when they can, what little they can. With envelopes containing single $5 bills, they come by her office: whites, blacks, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Laotians, people who would be turned away by doctors who put proof of insurance ahead of healing.
At a time when the nation's health care industry is becoming dominated by huge insurance companies, for-profit hospital corporations and massive health maintenance organizations, Dr. Benjamin, 38, is a throwback long thought to be extinct: a country doctor with a heart. She serves an isolated pocket of Alabama that is desperate for doctors, where only people who drag a living from the Gulf -- and a few lost travelers -- ever go.
"We didn't have anyone before her," said Bill Menton, a retired state senator who can afford to travel to see any doctor but prefers Dr. Benjamin. "We were just a bunch of shrimp pickers that no one cared about."
She is the only doctor here, and about 80 percent of her patients live below the poverty line. What little they can pay would never cover the costs of her staff of two nurses and an office manager or the overhead of the bare-bones clinic that shares the sidewalk with a pool hall.
But she found a way to make the clinic go, and for that, said medical experts and patients, the people of Bayou La Batre can thank Dr. Benjamin's business savvy more than her healing hands.
She opened her own practice in 1990, paying the way with late-night shifts as a traveling doctor in emergency rooms. But she soon realized that she needed to know as much about business and government red tape as she did about anatomy, so she made the 250-mile round-trip commute to New Orleans twice a week to earn her M.B.A. While in school, Dr. Benjamin discovered a little-known provision in a 1977 health clinic law that made Federal money available to help pay for the operation of a clinic or office in places like Bayou La Batre (pronounced lah BAT-tree), where medical help was badly needed.
Now, after serving on several state and national medical association panels, she gets calls, letters and visits from others who want to know how to do the same thing in towns and backwoods places around the country. She speaks at seminars. But mostly, she treats the sick of a tiny town. She has had offers to join big-city practices and hospitals but has declined.
Dr. Benjamin said she chooses to work in Bayou La Batre because there is a need, and because it is a place where one doctor's presence can make a difference.
"She wants to help people more than she wants to make a bunch of money," said Dale Hammac, 27, cradling his 10-month-old baby who had cried herself to sleep with an ear infection.
Like others in this town of 2,500, Mr. Hammac will fight you if you speak badly of his doctor.
Dr. Benjamin is a soft-spoken woman, quick to smile, slow to brag, too good to be true it seems. Instead of talking about successes, she talks about failures.
"What I hate," she said, "is writing a prescription for someone who can't get it filled because they don't have any money. People can't buy medicine, they can't buy anything."
Some say the town's economic plight is a result of the Federal Government's closing the local oyster beds after bacteria showed up in tests. Others blame yet another layoff at the shipyards. The Vietnamese say their nets are empty because the gods are angry.
In one way or another, everyone here is tied to the water. At quitting time at the packing and canning plants, the streets are filled with people in white uniforms and white rubber boots that people here call Bayou La Batre Reeboks. But the work is seasonal.
"Older people choose between buying medicine or eating," Dr. Benjamin said. "They like to be sick more in the summer than in the winter, because they live on food from their gardens in the summer."
Dr. Benjamin grew up not far from here in the little town of Daphne. Her family owned land that was gradually sold off. She was raised on food from the nets, like fried mullet and shrimp, and never even knew she was poor.
She did not grow up wanting to be a doctor. In high school, she heard the term "international lawyer," and thought it sounded good, so she wrote to Yale Law School. "They said it might be a good idea if I went to college first," she recalled.
She wound up in a premed program at Xavier University in New Orleans, then medical school at the Alabama School of Medicine in Birmingham. To help pay for her schooling she signed on with the National Health Service Corps, which pays tuition in return for a commitment to work three years in places in dire need of doctors. They sent her to Bayou La Batre.
She stayed.
Dr. Benjamin has treated a man on a commercial fishing boat who had slashed his hand open and stuck the wound together with Super Glue. She said it seemed to be healing nicely so she left it alone. She regularly treats cases of frostbite among the workers in seafood plants, who get it from walking in and out of giant freezers.
She treats patients with liver failure and cancer, and people who contracted their sickness in the bottom of a bottle.
"She cries when they die," said one of Dr. Benjamin's nurses, Nell Bosarge, 65, who retired last week.
Because the hospital is so far away, emergency cases walk in the door regularly "and drop," said Dr. Benjamin's other nurse, 20-year-old Lynn Gainey. The staff stabilizes them and sends them to Mobile.
Dr. Benjamin treats ornery Emile Lyons whether he thinks he needs it or not. When she told him his blood pressure was high, he brushed it off like a sand flea.
"I'm just worried, is all," said Mr. Lyons, whose wife, Gladys, had been treated recently with chemotherapy for lung cancer and seemed to be responding to it.
Dr. Benjamin just nodded her head. She asked Ms. Gainey to check it again, but Mr. Lyons had started talking about Republicans, a subject that always makes his blood pressure jump even more.
"Nothing wrong with my blood pressure!" he said defiantly. But as soon as Dr. Benjamin was safely out of hearing, he leaned forward and said, almost in a whisper, "I love that woman."

HEADLINE: Gingrich Is Seeking To Restore Gay Ban In Military Services

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, said today that Congress would reopen the issue of homosexuals in the military and would seek to undo President Clinton's two-year-old policy, known as "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue."
The old policy, which flatly prohibited homosexuals from serving in the armed forces, has been ruled unconstitutional several times in the last three years. And last week, a Federal judge in New York struck down Mr. Clinton's new policy, enacted in 1993, saying it was discriminatory and played to the fears of heterosexual troops. 
 The latest ruling notwithstanding, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have said that they are happy with the current policy and that in practice it proved to be not much different from the former policy. Homosexuals are discharged from the military about as often now as they were before the change.
Mr. Gingrich's remark, which he made on the ABC News program "This Week," came as something of a surprise because there has been virtually no clamoring for reinstatement of the old policy, except from Representative Robert K. Dornan, a conservative Republican from California.
"The fact is that we're going to probably go back to the rules that existed prior to President Clinton changing them," Mr. Gingrich said. "Now, he may well veto that. I mean, this may get to be an argument.
"But I'd be very surprised if you don't see a Republican Congress saying that serving in the military has a unique set of requirements, and if the military feels that in fact it's inappropriate, we're willing to abide by the military judgment."
The Clinton policy allows homosexuals to serve in the military and bars commanders from pursuing investigations of homosexual activity unless they have compelling evidence that such activity has occurred. But it continues the military's longtime ban on homosexual acts and requires gay service members to keep their sexual orientations private. Declaring homosexuality in a public forum is considered evidence of an intent to commit homosexual acts and is therefore grounds for discharge.
Last Thursday Judge Eugene H. Nickerson of Federal District Court in Brooklyn dismissed the Government's argument that morale and discipline would suffer if openly homosexual men and women were allowed to serve. He said the Clinton policy violated the First Amendment rights of homosexuals and was discriminatory because it did not prohibit heterosexuals from declaring their sexual orientation.
On the television program, Mr. Gingrich also rebuked fellow Republicans who had criticized Mr. Clinton's $52 billion bailout plan for Mexico.
"I don't think this is a game," Mr. Gingrich said, in apparent reference to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, chairman of the banking committee, who last week tried to reduce the amount of the United States contribution to the Mexico bailout.
Mr. Gingrich reaffirmed his support for the President's agreement with Mexico and said: "I think having Mexico collapse and having 5 to 15 million Mexicans decide to walk north would be catastrophic. And I think the people who think it's an easy vote ought to ask themselves what their reaction is going to be if this Government in Mexico collapses and if the Mexican economy collapses."
He added that undermining the deal with Mexico could produce "a secondary effect in all of the soft-currency markets around the world."
"And if you suddenly start having a similar impact in Argentina and Brazil and India and Eastern Europe," Mr. Gingrich said, "I think this is a very dangerous, very serious situation."
While Congressional leaders have supported President Clinton's plan, promising $20 billion from the taxpayer-financed Exchange Stabilization Fund and more than $30 billion through the International Monetary Fund, the bailout has been stalled by members of Congress who say the plan is unwise. The issue may be resolved this week.
Mr. Gingrich, who has appeared on a flurry of television programs recently as Congress completes its first 100 days under the new Republican majority, also suggested that the Republican effort to cut taxes would pass the House this week largely intact.
Many Republicans are unhappy over the details, especially the leadership's insistence that a $500-per-child tax credit be extended to everyone with taxable incomes of less than $200,000 a year. Many moderate Republicans want the credit limited to families with incomes of less than $95,000.
"We don't have a compromise yet," Mr. Gingrich said of the dispute. "We're still arguing. I'm not sure we'll get to a compromise. I mean, we may just bring the bill up and see what happens. And my guess is the House will vote for it."
He also said he expected Congress to take up some sort of "religious freedom" bill this year that would include school prayer.
On an ethics issue, he declared that members of Congress would keep the frequent-flier miles they earn on public business for their personal use, a practice that has been criticized. "We feel that if a younger member who has a couple kids, and they don't have very much money, and they have to maintain, you know, two households, if they have one minor benefit that allows their family to come to Washington, we think it's a good thing," Mr. Gingrich said.
He noted that Capital Cities/ABC, the company that owns ABC News, allowed its employees to keep their miles. Reminded that the bonus miles for members of Congress are paid for by taxpayers, Mr. Gingrich responded: "No. In our case, this is a pro-family benefit. I suspect, given the amount of work we're doing right now, the average taxpayer has far less passion than you do on this issue."
Mr. Gingrich said his fellow House Republicans had pleaded with him not to stage a second "100 Days" with a new batch of legislative initiatives, saying everyone was exhausted. The first 100 days technically ends in the second week of April, but because he wanted the House to be "family friendly," Mr. Gingrich set the first 100 days to conclude on April 7, which is the 93d day, when a three-week recess begins.

HEADLINE: Mischief on Mexico

 BODY:
Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York is recklessly threatening to block the Administration from providing Mexico loans and loan guarantees. The threat by the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee could be enough to scare off skittish foreign investors, driving the peso lower and worsening Mexico's recession. If Mr. D'Amato got his way, and Congress cut off the loans, the Mexican economy could collapse.
The Clinton Administration, fearing imminent bankruptcy and Congressional inaction, decided in February to use $20 billion in a Treasury fund under its control to aid Mexico. Mr. Clinton received support from Speaker Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, Senate majority leader, and Democratic leaders. The maneuver was justified because financial collapse in Mexico would hurt the United States. Tens of thousands of workers here would lose jobs in export industries, and citizens, whose pensions and savings are in mutual funds, would see their wealth drop. Mr. D'Amato's charge that the bailout serves only currency speculators is wide of the mark. 
 Mr. D'Amato also charges that the bailout is a failure. That is, for now, also untrue. Mexico, with help from Washington, launched tough reforms that have in two months wiped out its huge trade deficit, brought its federal accounts into surplus and clamped down on the money supply to keep inflation under control. Investors have noticed: stock markets are up and the fluctuations of the peso have dampened.
Loans by the United States and the International Monetary Fund to Mexico are key to investor confidence. The cash reassures foreigners that Mexico will have reserves when they choose to cash in their investments. In this fragile environment, Mr. D'Amato's remarks are incendiary.
President Clinton might be confronted with the sickening choice of reneging on his promise to Mexico or vetoing a crucial piece of legislation, such as a budget bill, to which Mr. D'Amato plans to attach his pernicious amendment. The better course would be for Mr. D'Amato to withdraw the threat.

HEADLINE: Underwriting on Wall Street Remained Sluggish in Quarter

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Beset by layoffs and losses, Wall Street has been hoping that its bread-and-butter business -- the underwriting of stocks and bonds -- may finally have hit bottom.
There is, therefore, a glimmer of hope for the securities industry from its sales of stocks and bonds for the first quarter of 1995. The industry's underwritings of such securities rose 17 percent to $138.7 billion, compared with $118.9 billion in the last quarter of 1994, according to statistics compiled by the Securities Data Corporation. 
 That is about all the relief the numbers provide, though. Compared with the first quarter of 1994, when the securities business was still buoyant, underwriting remains very much in the doldrums. First-quarter volume this year was down by slightly more than 50 percent, compared with the first quarter of 1994 when the industry sold $282.5 billion of new securities.
"It was a relatively slow quarter," said Grant Kvalheim, who heads Merrill Lynch & Company's debt capital markets business. He described the recent declines in long-term interest rates as "manna from heaven" for the markets, but said they had not had as much effect as brokerage firms had hoped. Declines in long-term interest rates tend to encourage borrowers to tap the bond markets, giving a lift to the debt-underwriting business.
There were also only a few big securities offerings that helped to bolster the weak market, including a $2 billion debt offering for the American Home Products Corporation and the AT&T Corporation's $1.8 billion issue of stock.
And underwriting fees were down substantially, too. The industry's disclosed fees, measured by gross spreads, totaled $904.2 million, compared with $2.122 billion in the first quarter of 1994, according to Securities Data. Though Merrill Lynch was the lead underwriter for the first quarter in terms of volume of securities underwritten, Goldman, Sachs & Company generated bigger underwriting fees, $175.6 million, compared with $138.0 million at Merrill Lynch and $83.5 million at Morgan Stanley & Company. Goldman managed to keep roughly level with its $173.6 million fees for the first quarter of 1994, but Merrill Lynch slipped substantially from $421.3 million for the year-earlier quarter, while Morgan Stanley's fell by more than half from $192.9 million in the 1994 quarter.
The fall in industry fees is partly attributable to the growing proportion of underwriting business that Wall Street did for Government-sponsored agencies like the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae. Such business earns only meager fees. Bond underwriting for such Government-sponsored agencies accounted for $44.9 billion, or 77 percent, of bond sales for the quarter, compared with 49 percent for the year-earlier quarter.
In contrast, initial public offerings for companies generate much fatter revenues. But these choicer morsels were much harder to come by: the securities industry underwrote $3.77 billion of initial public offerings in the first quarter of this year, compared with $8.13 billion in the quarter a year ago.
Wall Street's last big unincorporated partnership, Goldman, Sachs, however, romped to the top of the initial public offering league, underwriting $1.33 billion of such offerings. That was more than the next six ranked competitors put together -- Morgan Stanley; Smith Barney, a unit of the Travelers Corporation; CS First Boston; Merrill Lynch; Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a unit of the Equitable Companies, and Alex. Brown & Sons. These firms together accounted for $1.31 billion of the quarter's underwriting of initial public offerings.
The big Wall Street firms that dominate the securities business have suffered particularly from the downturn in the underwriting business. The top 10 underwriters of United States corporate securities, for example, sold $115.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $200.4 billion for the year-earlier period. As a whole, the securities industry's managing underwriters slumped to $138.7 billion for the first quarter this year, compared with $282.5 billion for the first quarter of 1994.
Recent lower interest rates are one promising sign for the industry. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond has declined to about 7.4 percent from about 8.15 percent late last year, helping to lift the bond markets. This, though, has not yet had that much effect on business volumes, said Mr. Kvalheim of Merrill. He says that should change, and he expects business volume to be "a bit better" in the second quarter.
The first-quarter underwriting numbers also provided further evidence of how a few commercial banks are succeeding in building successful securities businesses. J. P. Morgan & Company ranked seventh among the nation's leading underwriters, up from 11th in the first quarter of 1994. And First Tennessee Bank, a unit of the First Tennessee Corporation, jumped to No. 10, from 16th in the first quarter of 1994.
But Corporate America has been quite profitable recently, meaning that there is not that much appetite to issue stock to raise money.
Analysts also do not see much hope in the marginally higher business volumes for the first quarter. Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, late last week changed his recommendation on the shares of several large securities houses to "sell" from "hold."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
BASEBALL OWNERS QUIT FIGHT; OPENING DAY IS SET FOR APRIL 26

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 2

 BODY:
Major league baseball owners, faced with no viable alternative, today accepted the players' offer to return to work, ending the longest work stoppage in professional sports history on the day the 1995 season was supposed to open.
The owners' decision, announced after a four-and-a-half-hour meeting, ended the players' strike after 234 days, or 9 days short of eight months. The longest previous work stoppage was the 50-day baseball strike in 1981. The National Hockey League locked out its players for 103 days at the start of this season. 
 Players can begin reporting to spring training on Wednesday on a voluntary basis, with the mandatory date for reporting to camps in Florida or Arizona coming Friday. The season, which had been scheduled to begin tonight with a game between the Mets and the Marlins in Florida, will start April 26.
Each team will have a 144-game schedule, reduced from the regular 162 games. After April 26, some teams will have games canceled or added, mostly added, to enable them to conform to the 144 total.
Katy Feeney, the National League's schedule maker, said opening day games have not been determined, but added that it will feature a "close-to-full" schedule. Officials hoped to complete the schedule by the end of the week.
The players, whose strike last Aug. 12 wiped out the last 52 days of the season and the World Series for the first time in 90 years, will go back to work without a new collective bargaining agreement but with the protection of an injunction forcing the owners to reinstate elements of the expired agreement.
It was the owners' unilateral decision to eliminate those elements -- salary arbitration, individual bargaining between clubs and players and the anti-collusion provision of the free-agency rules -- that prompted the National Labor Relations Board to find that the owners had not bargained in good faith, issue a complaint and seek an injunction.
"The players are back, the game is back and we are very happy about that," Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said in announcing the owners' acceptance of the players' offer to end their strike. He added, "We hope to resolve our dispute so that we and our fans never have to go through the heartache we've endured for the past eight months."
From his comments, it was clear that Selig had decided to treat the development in an upbeat manner. Missing were the agonized and sometimes acrimonious comments about the union and its negotiating style. He tried to deflect questions about the continuing dispute over the owners' efforts to change the game's economic system.
Donald Fehr, the union leader, was not at home, but Gene Orza, the associate general counsel, said, "I'm obviously gratified that those were their decisions, both with respect to the lockout, but more important with respect to the replacement players, which would have been a telling blow to the future relationship of the parties."
He added: "None of that detracts from the continuing priority of getting a collective bargaining agreement. The players are committed to that objective and this development doesn't diminish that objective."
The owners' lawyers will go before a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on Tuesday to seek a stay of the injunction while they appeal it, but even management people gave the stay effort little chance of success.
Some owners had portrayed the meeting at the O'Hare Hilton today as a session at which they would vote on a lockout or, failing that, the use of replacement players in regular-season games until the regular players were ready to play. But, as developments showed, their characterization turned out to be erroneous. No votes were even taken.
"No vote was necessary," said Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles, who was the only owner who had refused to field a replacement team and had faced sanctions from the American League for his stance. "The matter was discussed and it was unanimously decided there would be no lockout and there would be no replacement players playing between now and April 26."
Angelos said the owners discussed "the pros and the cons and the in-betweens," and he said he believed everyone in the end was united.
"There were no real decisions to be made," a management official said. "There was no appetite for a lockout. People realized for a number of reasons they didn't want to do it. It just wasn't the thing to do."
Some owners had talked about securing a no-strike pledge from the players before allowing them to return, but management lawyers never asked the union to provide that pledge.
At a meeting on Saturday with lawyers for the players, the owners' lawyers asked about the idea of a no-strike, no-lockout agreement but did not request a pledge. They didn't want to condition the players' return on such a pledge, labor lawyers explained, because it could be illegal for the owners to place such a condition on an acceptance of an unconditional offer to return to work.
Basically, a person familiar with the meeting said, the owners' lawyers asked what the union's intentions were in regard to a strike and the union people replied that the players would comply with their obligations under the law.
Addressing the no-strike issue, Angelos said: "I think there's a commitment, but an unwritten one, on the side of the players, as well as the owners, that we will not have this kind of work stoppage in the future. And we'll finish the '95 season and the World Series."
When Selig was asked about such a pledge he said: "It's important we have a season without interruption. Those are things we'll have to work out."
In reality, the owners' course had been set in a conference call last Friday after Judge Sonia Sotomayor issued the injunction in Federal District Court. On the call were members of the executive council, the eight-owner body that rules the major leagues in the absence of a commissioner; the Player Relations Committee, the owners' labor arm, and the negotiating committee.
Hanging up from that call, the owners knew they would not lock out the players and they knew they would not begin the season with replacement players. The labor committee issued a directive to clubs Saturday telling them to release their replacement players from major league rosters, but to assign them to minor league teams.
The labor strategists wanted to keep the replacements as a precautionary measure in the event the players would walk out again, after a negative result on the injunction appeal, for example.
Asked about the possible future use of replacements, Selig said: "Replacement baseball, as of this time, is gone. If you're asking ever, I can't give you that."
Selig also thanked the replacement players, "who interrupted their lives to help us out."
The P.R.C. directive went out while the lawyers were discussing back-to-work issues. After two sessions, management lawyers prepared a document outlining such matters as spring training dates and length and the start of the season and the schedule, and delivered it to the union late Saturday night.
Union officials reviewed the document and offered their reaction to it yesterday in a series of telephone conversations.
The return to work brings with it a unique circumstance in baseball history. More than 800 players of the 1,069 on major league rosters are unsigned, and another 200 or so are free agents without jobs. Clubs and players most likely will begin negotiating contracts immediately, and the two sides will have to work out a procedure for salary arbitration for eligible players.
The union plans to establish a training camp for free agents in Homestead, Fla., so that they can work out while their agents seek jobs for them.

HEADLINE: Professors Battling Television Technology

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Questions about the extent to which technology will displace college professors have led to the resignation of the chancellor of the University of Maine in what some see as a forerunner to conflicts at other colleges.
Under a plan by Chancellor J. Michael Orenduff, the University of Maine would have created an eighth campus, this one with no buildings or professors, only two-way televised classes. Rather than adding a class in, say, economics at one campus, a class from another campus would simply be broadcast to students. Ultimately, some students would get their degrees from the video campus. 
 The plan had been approved by the university's 16-member board of trustees in January, but faculty members on all seven campuses objected vigorously and, in the last three weeks, passed votes of no confidence with the chancellor. They maintained that he had failed to engage them in the planning of what is often called distance learning.
The chancellor's resignation was accepted by the board at a hastily convened meeting on Sunday, and was effective immediately.
Mr. Orenduff did not return telephone calls yesterday.
"The question of how technology can substitute for the human element in education is a huge issue, and one over which major battles are going to be fought," said Patrick M. Callan, executive director of the California Higher Education Policy Center. "What happened in Maine may frighten off other presidents from becoming involved in this. It's one more issue where, if presidents attempt to exert leadership, they may come into conflict with faculties and wind up looking for a job."
Throughout the country, colleges and universities are experimenting with video-conferencing -- the use of two-way television and two-way audio to replicate the classroom while permitting students to remain at home or at remote places. The University of Maine system became one of higher education's early leaders in distance learning when it began the Education Network of Maine in 1989.
But, as the use of this and other technology has grown, so too have the concerns about staff, quality control and class size (whether one professor could end up teaching a class of thousands, or whole departments could be eliminated on one campus because subjects could be taught by video from another).
With shrinking budgets and increasing enrollments, many faculty members worry that universities will see distance learning and other technology as a way to lower the cost of education.
The California State University system has created a commission to explore the increased use of technology on its 20 campuses, and has already begun a two-year experiment using two-way broadcasts with voice-activated cameras to share business administration classes among four campuses. The State University of New York has also begun using videotaped courses at some of its 64 campuses.
At both systems, faculty representatives have expressed concerns.
"We're in favor of distance learning provided we have equal control," Bill Scheuerman, president of United University Professions, the SUNY faculty union said in an interview a few months ago. "We'll support it if it provides quality of education and doesn't put our positions in jeopardy."
In a nearly unanimous resolution at the University of Maine, the 736 faculty members at the flagship campus in Orono declared that Chancellor Orenduff had "jeopardized the academic integrity of all the institutions" in the university system "by proposing academic accreditation of the Education Network of Maine and by calling for a centralization of control over academic programs."
James Gilbert, a professor of wildlife ecology and president of the faculty senate, said in an interview yesterday that the faculty was not unalterably opposed to distance learning.
"We developed a 24-page paper in March that supported the concept," he said. "But we didn't want accreditation and we didn't accept the particular technology that was being pushed on us. It wasn't interactive two-way television, but one-way television and two-way voice."
John Diamond, a spokesman for the university, said that while there are a limited number of two-way video and two-way audio devices in the system, Mr. Orenduff's expectation was that more would be added in the future. Now, most network professors can hear but not see their students.
About 3,000 of the 25,000 students in the seven-campus system are involved in the video learning program.
Mr. Diamond also said the faculties were angry with Chancellor Orenduff's proposals to the State Legislature to consolidate the system by such means as having one dean serve two academic schools, publishing a common catalogue for all seven campuses and conducting "exit examinations" to determine how much students had learned.
"These things were proposed with a lack of involving the faculties in the process," Professor Gilbert said.
The chancellor's proposals to expand the Education Network of Maine were approved by the trustees at a meeting on Jan. 23, resulting in a vote of no confidence in the trustees by the faculty committees at the Fort Kent and Farmington campuses.
Because the proposals were so controversial, no steps were taken to put them into effect immediately, university officials said. Currently, the network offers such courses as the principles of economics, United States history, elementary French, abnormal psychiatry and advanced soil mechanics, and beams them by satellite to be distributed to campuses around the state.
The system also receives as well as sends. This means the entire curriculum for a master's degree in library science is provided by satellite from the University of South Carolina.
Mr. Diamond said the trustees would meet in Bangor tomorrow to discuss the appointment of an interim chancellor, and would visit the Orono campus on Thursday to hear the opinions of students and faculty members.

HEADLINE: Senate Extends Deduction for Self-Employed

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
The Senate agreed today to extend a tax deduction for self-employed workers, clearing one of the political hurdles that had unexpectedly stalled debate on $15 billion in midyear budget cuts and a vote on an emergency $3.2 billion appropriation to the military.
Anxious to bring the budget cuts to a vote before the start of next week's spring recess, Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said the Senate would vote on Tuesday on another contentious issue -- a Republican amendment to the budget-cut bill that would scuttle the Clinton Administration's $20-billion bailout of the Mexican peso. 
 But Mr. Dole did not say when or whether he would allow debate on a controversial amendment proposed by Senator Jim Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, to limit the use of Federal money to pay for abortions in cases of incest and rape.
Mr. Dole warned today that there were about 100 pending amendments to the midyear budget cuts -- 70 from Democrats -- and that unless some were withdrawn, it would take this week and next before the Senate could vote on the cuts, or rescissions.
"I have something else planned for next week," said Mr. Dole, who is scheduled to formally announce his candidacy for President on April 10.
The tax legislation, contained in a House-Senate conference report, cleared the Senate by a unanimous voice vote. It now goes to President Clinton, who is expected to sign the bill. The legislation would allow an estimated 3.2 million self-employed people to deduct 25 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums for tax purposes.
The conference committee of the House and Senate had agreed on the legislation on March 28 and two days later, the full House adopted the conference report by voice vote. But the report ran into unexpected trouble in the Senate last week when Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, tried to restore a provision that would have taxed wealthy Americans who renounce their citizenship to avoid taxes. At the request of House Republicans, the provision had been dropped. Democrats said that closing the loophole, which affects about two dozen taxpayers, would raise $3.6 billion over 10 years.
Saying that he supported closing the loophole, Mr. Dole promised today that he would allow Mr. Kennedy's legislation to be voted on this week as a separate amendment. But Mr. Kennedy and his fellow Democrats continued to run up political points over the issue, saying that the Republicans had sided with "Benedict Arnold billionaires."
The tax legislation would also repeal a tax exemption offered through the Federal Communications Commission to companies that sell broadcast outlets to minority investors.
The partisan flap over the Mexican loan package arose unexpectedly last Thursday when Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, introduced an amendment effectively preventing President Clinton from providing further loans to Mexico without Congressional approval. Critics said such a move would wreck the Mexican economy and cause upheavals in world markets. Democrats asserted that the amendment was intended to embarrass Mr. Clinton. It seemed today that the Democrats, who control only 46 Senate seats, had found enough support among Republicans to block the measure.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Weak in March, In Spite of Rebate Programs

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 3

 BODY:
Despite widespread rebates, many auto makers reported today that car and truck sales in March failed to pull out of their winter doldrums.
Led by a big drop in car sales at the General Motors Corporation and lower truck sales at the Chrysler Corporation, the industry sales that were reported today were down 9.8 percent from the strong levels of March 1994, to 907,652 units. 
 Sales of Japanese cars built in the United States gained strength in March, but the strong Japanese yen hurt sales of imported models.
When the Ford Motor Company and other auto makers report sales for March later this week, some analysts said, the annual selling rate for the month could fall to lower than 15 million units for the third consecutive month.
The strongest sales month last year was March, with a selling rate of nearly 15.8 million units.
Auto makers have offered rebates in the last month, including discounts of $1,000 or more on several vehicles. But consumers remain wary, because of higher interest rates and nervousness about the health of the economy, analysts said.
"I don't think these rebates have had enough time to do the trick," Kurt Brown, an analyst at DRI/McGraw-Hill, said.
Today Ford doubled the rebates on its best-selling Taurus and Sable sedans, to $1,000, matching the $1,000 rebate on the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision sedans made by Chrysler.
The overall sales at G.M., excluding Saab, fell 9.2 percent, to 440,285 units, with total car sales off 12.8 percent and total truck sales down 3.5 percent. Analysts attributed the drop in car sales partly to the continued reductions in fleet sales.
Sales at Chrysler fell 9.1 percent, to 209,370 cars and trucks. The domestic car sales of the company fell 5.1 percent, while its domestic truck sales, hurt by the model change to its new 1996 mini-vans, fell 10.4 percent.
Reflecting on the first-quarter sales, the chairman of Chrysler, Robert J. Eaton, said, "There's no doubt the market has gotten tougher."
"We're seeing a leaner mix and providing more incentives to bring customers into our showrooms," Mr. Eaton added. "These higher incentives will likely continue throughout this model year and, while helping us to maintain a strong market share, these added costs will adversely affect our first-quarter and first-half earnings."
Japanese auto makers reported gains in sales of the models built in the United States, but declines in sales of imports.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S. Intervenes To Back Dollar, But Move Fails

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration ended more than a month of currency inaction and sought to defend the battered dollar today by pouring some $1 billion into markets in Asia and the United States. But it failed to stem an assault on the currency by speculators around the globe.
The support for the dollar was matched by public statements that seemed intended to dispel perceptions that Washington had no intention of taking drastic action to rein in the large trade and budget deficits that contribute to the dollar's weakness. 
 "This Administration believes a strong dollar is in America's interest," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said, "and we remain committed to strengthening the fundamentals that are ultimately important to maintaining a strong and stable currency."
But in private, Administration officials conceded that there was little they could do beyond trying to talk the dollar back up. Faced with a gaping budget deficit and a $150 billion gulf with other nations in goods and services, the White House remains reluctant to endorse the painful measures needed to help mop up some of the surplus dollars flowing overseas.
"The issue is whether we view a strong dollar as truly central to our role as a world superpower," one senior Administration official said today, "and I don't think anyone in the White House is really able to answer that question."
So far, despite a 13 percent fall in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen and the German mark since the beginning of the year, the Administration has not treated the decline as either a political or an economic crisis. But many private analysts and some Administration officials say that could change if the full impact of the stunning drop in the dollar becomes evident later in the year. That could take the form of inflated prices for imports, a cheapening of American assets in the eyes of foreigners, and a slippage in the levers of global power available to Washington apart from its military might.
Mr. Rubin, who once directed currency trading at Goldman, Sachs & Company, is widely regarded as one of the most knowledgable strategists on exchange rate policy ever to sit in the Treasury Secretary's office. When he was trading on Goldman's account, he developed a keen sense of the psychology of the markets by trying to outguess his predecessors at the Treasury.
Since taking office, Mr. Rubin has shown extraordinary restraint in using the Government's funds to prop up the currency by buying dollars in the open market. With world exchange markets swapping a trillion dollars in currencies almost every day, government interventions of $1 billion or so are a weapon of limited range and little power unless they are used at just the right moment. At those times, when the driving force behind a currency movement has run its course, Mr. Rubin has indicated, even a comparatively small commitment is capable of propelling the volatile exchange markets in a desired direction.
The dollar had stabilized in recent days, and presumably Mr. Rubin -- talking frequently over the phone with Lawrence H. Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs -- decided his moment had arrived. But by midday, that appeared to be a miscalculation.
As word spread among traders of the buying spree by the Federal Reserve, which almost always acts at the request of the Treasury Department, the dollar rallied briefly. But traders immediately turned around and sold, locking in a quick profit. By the end of the day, the dollar closed in New York at 86.07 yen, down from a close of 86.55 on Friday. The dollar gained slightly against the German mark, closing at 1.3723 marks, up marginally from Friday's close of 1.3715. The dollar lost ground against the British pound.
"This shows that jawboning will get nowhere," said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist at Lehman Brothers. "The hope was the U.S. could come in and form the bottom. But the overall movement in our currency is downward, and nothing that has happened yet will change the markets' view of the direction we are taking." Mr. Sinai said he would "not be shocked" to see the dollar at 80 yen in the near future.
The causes of the dollar's dive against its rivals for global influence are hotly debated among analysts of a market where perception is often more important than reality.
But the most talked-about reasons are stark in their simplicity: Investors, after flirting in debt-laden emerging markets like Mexico and Spain, are fleeing to countries that save enough to run sizable trade surpluses, that follow strict monetary policies and appear to have put the worst of their problems behind them. There are precious few. Germany is seen as moving beyond the shock of reunification now that the Berlin wall has been down for more than five years. It stands poised to dominate trade with Eastern Europe. And Japan, despite economic recession, political paralysis and religious cults, is still seen as a nation of 120 million prepared to sacrifice for the common good.
By those standards, the United States falls short. The defeat of the balanced budget amendment last month, along with the talk of tax cuts, punctured the belief that the new wave of Republicans in Washington would wash away the nation's chronic budget deficits. And even though United States industry is enjoying a record export boom, Mexico's economic collapse and China's growing trade influence are likely to undermine any gains elsewhere.
Meanwhile, there is little to tempt foreign investors to return to United States capital markets. American interest rates seem frozen or headed down, and the Japanese Government has passed up opportunities to lower rates there. Without such actions, Tokyo remains a tempting place for Asian investors to park funds while the United States is less appealing.
That leaves Mr. Rubin, as the man chiefly responsible for defending the dollar, with few cards to play.
The Japanese, in seeming defiance of the logic of textbook economics, appear to be selling their American holdings after years of recycling big surpluses back into investments in everything from Treasury bonds to Rockefeller Center and MCA, the owner of Universal Pictures. But now, with many Japanese banks teetering on the edge of failing to meet new requirements for the cash they must keep on hand, there is little lending under way for purchases here. What money Japan is sending abroad is going elsewhere in Asia.
"This is not a dollar crisis made in America," Richard Koo, the chief economist of the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, said at an economic conference here last week. "It is a yen crisis, and it is made in Japan."
In fact, the strong yen hurts Japanese producers worst of all, making their products more expensive in world markets. But that pain is often overstated in the West. There is virtually no political pressure on the Japanese Government to solve the trade problems -- and the United State is viewed as holding diminishing leverage. Last week Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, made a compelling case that the long-term solution to both the dollar's woes and America's trade deficit is a breakthrough opening of the Japanese market.
But Japanese thinking on these issues often runs in opposite directions: To many Japanese manufacturers, the weak dollar primarily means that they will make less profit selling in the United States, where there is great pressure to cut prices if companies want to retain market share. Thus, it becomes more important than ever for them to keep walls up around Japan's domestic market, where their profit margins have always been higher.

Tokyo Markets Firmer
 TOKYO, Tuesday, April 4 (Reuters) -- The dollar regained some stability against the Japanese yen in Asia today after falling sharply to new lows in early trading. And Japanese stocks rebounded moderately from their plunge on Monday.
At midday, the dollar was quoted at 86.18 yen, after trading at a record low of 85.68 yen. The dollar closed in New York at 86.07 yen on Monday.
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei index of 225 issues finished the morning trading session ahead 107.19 points, or 0.70 percent, at 15,488.48. On Monday, the Nikkei plunged 758.66 points, or 4.7 percent, on continuing concerns about the weakness of the dollar and its implications for the Japanese economy.

HEADLINE: More Dire Warnings About Social Security

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that the Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly would run out of money in 2002, and two independent trustees said the Medicare program faced a financial crisis in the near future.
By contrast, the trustees said the Social Security trust funds, which pay retirement and disability benefits, would run out of cash in 2030. 
 The annual report to Congress was slightly less pessimistic than last year's, which predicted that Medicare's hospital trust fund would be exhausted in 2001, while the Social Security trust funds would be depleted in 2029. The new report says the condition of the Medicare trust fund "remains extremely unfavorable."
The report says nothing about the political changes of the last year. In April 1994, President Clinton was trying to reshape the entire health care system to control costs and guarantee health insurance for all. Since Congress rejected his plan, Mr. Clinton has proposed no new initiatives, and Administration officials have shunned discussion of possible changes in Medicare.
The Administration said that Medicare's hospital insurance program was "severely out of financial balance" and that there was an urgent need for Congress to address the problem. But it recommended no specific measures.
Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said: "This report should sound alarm bells across Washington and throughout the nation."
Medicare pays hospital bills for 37 million people at a cost expected to reach $176 billion this year. The trustees said Medicare's hospital trust fund would experience "increasing annual deficits," beginning in 1996.
The report was prepared by actuaries and submitted to Congress by the six trustees of the two trust funds. Four trustees are Administration officials; two represent the public.
The public trustees, Stanford G. Ross and David M. Walker, expressed grave concern about Medicare's finances. They said the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays hospital bills, and Medicare's Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, which pays doctors, showed "alarming financial results."
In a joint statement, they said: "The Medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its present form. We had hoped for several years that comprehensive health care reform would include meaningful Medicare reforms."
Mr. Ross, a tax lawyer, was Social Security Commissioner in 1978 and 1979. Mr. Walker is an expert on employee benefits at Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting firm.
Some measure of the problem can be gleaned from statistics in the report. For example, it said, to keep Medicare's hospital trust fund in sound condition over the next 25 years, outlays would have to be reduced by 30 percent or payroll taxes increased by 44 percent. The current tax is 1.45 percent of earnings for the employer and employee each.
The report says the Social Security trust funds, which pay retirement and disability benefits to 43 million people, are in better condition than Medicare. The balance in the Social Security trust funds will increase for 25 years, but will then begin to decline, and the trust funds will be depleted in the year 2030, it says.
Social Security outlays now exceed Medicare outlays. But health costs are rising much more rapidly than retirement benefits.
The report shows that the balance in Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, $133 billion at the end of last year, will rise to $136 billion this year, but will then decline as the fund runs larger and larger deficits. The Government has no authority to pay hospital bills for Medicare beneficiaries after depletion of the fund, expected in 2002.
The surplus in the Social Security trust funds for retirement and disability benefits will grow in the next decade, the trustees said. The assets of the two trust funds, now $436 billion, will rise to $1.3 trillion in 2004.
Trust fund assets are generally invested in special Government securities, and thus lent to the Treasury to be used to finance general Government operations, reducing the amount that must be borrowed in credit markets.
The Medicare trust fund that pays doctors' bills is sound, in part because it has access to general revenues, the report said. But the trustees said premiums paid by beneficiaries would account for a declining share of total income for this part of the program: 17 percent in 2004, compared with 31 percent last year.
The Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund took in $56 billion last year and paid out $60 billion. The trustees expressed great concern about the cost of this part of the program, which increased more than 50 percent in the last five years and is expected to rise by more than 70 percent in the next five years.

HEADLINE: With a Passion for Tax Cuts, and in Power

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, April 3 -- Dan Rostenkowski's first instinct when it came to tax legislation was that the rich should pay more and the poor less.
Because Congressional committees adopt the coloration of their chairmen, that was the main view of the House Ways and Means Committee, the most powerful committee in the House, during the dozen years Mr. Rostenkowski dominated it. 
 The current chairman, Representative Bill Archer, could hardly be more different in background, temperament and ideology.
"The engine that pulls the train must continue to be fueled," Mr. Archer said at a committee meeting last week. What he meant, he explained in an interview later, was that affluent taxpayers must receive tax breaks because they are mainly the ones who invest money and create jobs for others.
Since the Ways and Means Committee controls tax legislation, Mr. Archer's views will be on full display this week when he manages the House debate on the Republicans' tax bill. The measure would give families with annual incomes above about $20,000, and below $200,000, a $500 tax cut for each child. The legislation would also lower the capital gains tax, abolish the minimum tax on corporations and offer other tax breaks to individuals and businesses.
If Mr. Rostenkowski was the archetypal big-city liberal, with deep roots in his Polish neighborhood in Chicago and in the city's Democratic machine, Mr. Archer is the archetypal conservative Texas Republican.
As trim and natty as Mr. Rostenkowski was beefy and rumpled, as gentle and affable as Mr. Rostenkowski was gruff and intimidating, Mr. Archer has roots in the wealthy River Oaks section of Houston.
If Mr. Rostenkowski's typical constituents were butchers and bartenders, Mr. Archer's are bankers and oil company executives. His district, once represented by George Bush, is one of the half-dozen most affluent in Congress.
Mr. Rostenkowski was the master of the art of deal-making. He used his skill to get the tax and budget legislation of Presidents of both parties through Congress. He lost his chairmanship last year after he was indicted on corruption charges, and he was then defeated in his race for re-election.
In contrast, Mr. Archer has often placed conservative principle over political compromise. He voted against President Ronald Reagan's Social Security bill in 1983 and his Tax Reform Act in 1986. He surprised his friends by supporting the Bush budget in 1990, which lowered the Federal deficit by raising taxes and cutting spending. But he fought against the Clinton budget in 1993, which did the same thing.
Questions have never been raised about his probity. He refuses campaign contributions from political action committees or donors outside Texas, a stand made easier by the fact that he has never had formidable opposition since he was first elected to the House in 1970.
He also fills out his own income tax returns each year, exhibiting a patience that for Mr. Rostenkowski would have been unimaginable.
His core philosophy, Mr. Archer said as he leaned forward in the chairman's chair in the Ways and Means conference room across the hall from the House chamber, is "the less taxes the better; the smaller Government the better."
That is in accord with the dominant Republican view espoused by Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and the band of young conservatives who were elected to the House in November. But Mr. Archer, who is 67, has acquired none of the populism and revolutionary zeal that also characterizes the new majority.
Last week, for example, he voted against a constitutional amendment that would have limited the number of terms members of Congress could serve.
The parts of the tax bill before the House this week that he is most enthusiastic about are those that would sharply reduce capital gains taxes, which are the taxes on profits from investments, and abolish the alternative minimum tax that corporations must pay if they have so many write-offs that they would otherwise owe little, if any, taxes.
He is somewhat ambivalent about the $500-per-child tax credit, saying, "I think you can make good arguments on both sides."
But he said he would defend every penny of it. "My responsibility as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee," he said, "is to see that we keep the promises of the contract as they relate to tax provisions."
He was referring to the Contract With America, the campaign platform of Republican candidates for the House last fall. Some Republicans want to lower the maximum income at which families would be entitled to a tax cut for their children, but not Mr. Archer. "If you lowered the $200,000," he said, "it would be reneging on a specific commitment in the contract."
His ultimate goal as chairman, he said, is to "tear out the income tax by its roots and discard it and replace it with a new form of taxation."
What he prefers, he said, is essentially a sales tax in one form or another that would tax people 15 to 20 percent on almost everything they buy. Americans would then be taxed on what they spend rather than on what they earn. That, he said, would encourage saving and investment and improve America's competitive position in the world economy.
He said that he was working to develop such a plan, but that he did not think it could be enacted "until we have a new President."
Mr. Archer said he was not concerned that his tax plan might benefit rich people, who can afford to spend a smaller percentage of their income than others on the essentials of life.
"I wish you wouldn't say 'rich,' " he told an interviewer without a smile. "I wish you'd start saying people who are higher income rather than lower income."
Asked if he thought of himself as rich, Mr. Archer, who is worth more than $2 million according to his most recent financial disclosure statement, replied: "No, not really, I don't. I think of myself as someone who has been frugal and saved and tried to provide for his own security and someone who bore the responsibility of putting five kids through college."
He then related the story he often tells of his father, who lost his job during the Great Depression and was virtually penniless but was able to borrow some money and start what became, because of his father's hard work, a prosperous livestock feed business.
"My economic and tax philosophy," he said, "reflect what has become a proven fact in the world -- that the capitalistic system, which includes the opportunity to move up and to achieve to where everybody does not have the same amount of money, produces in the end the most good for the most people. Our country should be looked at as one of equal opportunity to achieve, not necessarily equal results."
Politicians who fret because some Americans are much better off than others are practicing "the politics of envy," Mr. Archer said.
If Mr. Rostenkowski were still in Congress, he would be calling Mr. Archer's philosophy an example of "the politics of greed."

HEADLINE: Bengali Women Are Candid With Hillary Clinton

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: DHAKA, Bangladesh, April 3

 BODY:
A group of women of the untouchable class reached across a gulf of language and culture today to pepper Hillary Rodham Clinton with questions about her status and self-reliance as a woman.
"Do you have cattle in your house?" asked one woman in Moishahati, a dusty hamlet in southwest Bangladesh that has been transformed by the Grameen Bank, which makes small loans to poor people without collateral in exchange for promises of productive work and monitoring by other borrowers. 
 "No," Mrs. Clinton smiled in acknowledgment of a world in which the difference between one cow and a few cows in a household is the difference between night and day. But the next question was trickier, touching on many of the compromises Mrs. Clinton, a lawyer and the first First Lady to have a professional career before entering the White House, has had to make.
"We earn our income and that's how we make our families," another villager said at a meeting under a bamboo and tin-roofed hut built for Mrs. Clinton's visit. "Whose income do you live on?"
Mrs. Clinton answered evenly: "I started to work when I was 13 years old, and I always earned my own income. And there were some years when I earned more income than my husband. Now that my husband is the President, I am not earning my own income. But I will later, again, earn my own income."
Mrs. Clinton seemed to relish the moment as she answered questions with her 15-year-old daughter, Chelsea, at her side.
"Do you intend to have any more children?" another woman asked, reflecting a pressing concern in a country where 120 million people are crammed into an area about the size of Wisconsin.
"I would have loved to have had one or two more children," Mrs. Clinton replied, putting her arm around Chelsea.
In a 12-day tour encompassing tightly scripted photo opportunities, visits to schools and clinics and ceremonial handshakes with heads of state, today's encounter, while still elaborately choreographed, stood out for its authenticity.
With the bank's 54-year-old founder and guiding light, Muhammad Yunus, an economist trained at Vanderbilt University, interpreting at her side, Mrs. Clinton heard a Bengali version of "It's a Wonderful Life," with Dr. Yunus in the role of Jimmy Stewart.
The idea for Grameen (the Bengali word for rural) was born in the mid-1970's, when Dr. Yunus was teaching at Chittagong University in southern Bangladesh and found himself implored for money by beggar women. He decided the answer was access to enough capital to win a toehold on life, and in 1976 he made his first loans ($30 divided among 42 people) from his personal money, eventually setting up an independent bank.
Now Grameen has more than 1,000 branches in 34,000 villages. Last year it made $369 million in loans, the vast majority to women, with the largest loans being typically about $600 for a home. Repayment rates are higher than those of commercial banks here and the idea has been copied in a handful of places across the United States, including Arkansas, where Bill Clinton helped start the Arkansas Development Bank when he was Governor.
"The woman who has completed the loan is completely different," Dr. Yunus said. "The whole world was telling her, 'You are no good, you are a woman.' Now comes the First Lady of the world to talk about it. It is a validation of what they are doing."

HEADLINE: Do Transit Rail Cars Need U.S. Label?

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

 BODY:
The mounting problems at the Morrison Knudsen Corporation have raised an important if little noticed question about America's industrial future: Does this country need a passenger rail car manufacturer?
Morrison Knudsen is the country's last producer of rail cars, the last of an industry that once included the Pullman Company, St. Louis Car and the Budd Company. American companies were leaders in the industry as recently as the 1970's, but most have now been sold or shut down and the leaders come from Canada, Japan and Germany. 
 Morrison Knudsen, the big construction company in Boise, Idaho, entered the rail car manufacturing business only six years ago. It was encouraged by transit authorities around the country that sought a domestic manufacturer that would put a plant in their home districts, thus generating jobs.
But its strategy of heavily underbidding on many big contracts, from New York City to Chicago and San Francisco, in an effort to win a sizable share of the market, turned into a disaster. Of the $310 million Morrison Knudsen lost last year, more than $200 million came from MK Transit, as the unit is known.
Though Morrison Knudsen had earlier said that it was firmly committed to the rail car manufacturing business, with the arrival of a new chairman, Robert S. Miller Jr., who was named to the position on Sunday, it is now an open question whether the unit will be kept open or even sold. For now, the company will say only that it is undecided. Mr. Miller replaces William P. Clark, who had been acting chairman since William J. Agee was ousted by the board in February after the company announced big losses for 1994.
"MK has received indications of interest for a number of its noncore businesses and is considering alternatives," said Mark Armstrong, a company spokesman.
The idea that the United States may leave this industry, even as the Clinton Administration pushes the proposal that the country must build its international competitiveness, has left experts in industrial policy and the transit industry divided.
Not only will American companies fail to benefit from the huge sums being spent on rail cars -- as much as $18 billion in the United States during the next decade, according to the American Public Transit Association. But also, experts say, it will be increasingly difficult for American companies to enter the market, leaving critical technologies outside the grasp of American concerns.
It takes huge investments in research and technology to become competitive. Faced with the need to invest billions of dollars over many years, few companies would be willing to enter the fray.
"The problem with R& D is very important," said Kenneth Mead, director of transportation issues for the General Accounting Office. "This is not a stable technology. It's changing very fast. You don't just walk into this business and say, 'Hey, I'm going to make trains.' "
Lawrence Gilson, a former senior executive of Amtrak and now head of Venture Associates, a consulting firm, added, "The truth is it's almost impossible for a company to get started because of the R& D costs."
That has created several problems. Mortimer L. Downey, Deputy Secretary of Transportation who is a former top executive of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said that American companies were losing out on some big overseas orders because of their inability to provide rail cars as well as other parts of big transit projects.
He cited a recent example in Guangzhou, in southern China, where he said some American companies offering electrical equipment lost contracts because they could not combine their products in a package that included the cars.
"This is of concern to us in large part because we think rail car building is something Americans ought to be able to do well," Mr. Downey said. "And that's not just for our own needs, but for export. There is a very big market there."
Proponents of free-market economics scoff at such arguments. If the business is really profitable, they say, clever companies will find a way to participate.
"There is no possible conceivable reason why the U.S. needs a rail car business," said William Lewis, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company and an expert on competition policy. "The global system is so big, so robust, so open that anything one person denied us we could get somewhere else."
Some have argued that the United States will lose jobs if the industry fails, but Mr. Lewis dismissed that view, too. "We don't need those jobs," Mr. Lewis said. "We're paying too much to keep them."
Most talk of industrial policy focuses on businesses like electronics, but the question of whether America needs to make its own rail cars has been a hot-button issue for years. Three years ago Los Angeles canceled a $121.8 million contract with the Sumitomo Corporation of Japan after facing complaints for giving the work to a foreign concern.
But MK Transit's deep problems demonstrate the complexity of the problem. If the company actually charges what it costs to build its rail cars, it may never win another contract. If it underbids to keep the orders flowing, its losses will mount.
Larry E. Salci, president of the unit, which is based in an old Pullman factory in Chicago, has thus argued for some form of government support, though he insisted that handouts would not be necessary. He maintained that foreign companies received substantial support from their governments. It comes, he said, through export subsidies and a steady flow of orders from big, nationally owned transit systems. Mr. Salci said the Government should create what he called a level playing field by fighting to eliminate benefits that foreign companies received in their home markets.
MK Transit has received help only in the form of up-front payments from transit districts that in effect provide working capital, he said.
Clearly, MK Transit brought many of the problems on itself. At its peak, it had more than 60 percent of the market for certain rail cars. It hoped follow-up business and government encouragement would turn the business profitable and give the United States a toehold in this important global industry.
MK Transit has built cars that some transit authorities like; it has, for instance, received plaudits for the M-6 cars it is manufacturing for Metro North's New Haven Line. But it is behind on nearly all of its contracts -- 18 months on the M-6 cars. And several transit authorities have refused to exercise options to purchase more cars from MK Transit, a harsh blow to its plans.
"We have stumbled badly, frankly," Mr. Salci said. "We went too far too fast. We're going to have to spend the next couple of years digging out from this hole."

HEADLINE: RUSSIA SAYS SALE OF ATOM REACTORS TO IRAN IS STILL ON

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 3

 BODY:
The Russian Government made clear today that it would go ahead with the sale of light-water nuclear reactors to Iran over fierce American protests, repeated here by the visiting Defense Secretary, William J. Perry.
Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin shares American concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, Mr. Perry said in a news conference this evening, and agreed to arrange meetings of Russian and American experts concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons and the transfer of nuclear technology to Iran. 
 But the Russians "did not agree to change their position to proceed with that sale," Mr. Perry said. "They did state that they will take actions to reduce the proliferation risk."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Perry had said he did not want to discuss ways to make the sale less dangerous. "Our first objective is to stop the sale," he said. "I consider constraints a very poor second choice."
While the Russian position appeared firm, senior American officials said tonight that they did not consider the issue closed. They said Washington would continue to bring up its objections at lower-level meetings and at the summit meeting between Presidents Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin scheduled for next month.
The United States has been pushing Moscow for weeks to cancel its agreement to sell at least two and possibly four light-water nuclear reactors to Iran, a deal worth $800 million to $1 billion.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has warned Russia that it will "rue the day" it provides nuclear technology to its neighbor, Iran.
But it is unclear what penalty Russia will suffer if it does not cancel the deal. On Sunday, Mr. Perry said he favored continuing aid to Russia even if he got nowhere on the nuclear question.
Washington has provided Moscow a written intelligence report on Teheran's alleged ambitions to build a nuclear bomb, and has promised the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry tens of millions of dollars in projects to compensate Russia for abandoning the Iran contract.
But the Russian Atomic Energy Minister, Viktor N. Mikhailov, said today after meeting with Mr. Chernomyrdin and Mr. Perry that the reactor sales would go ahead "in full measure."
Mr. Mikhailov, who is skeptical of American intentions toward Russia, said the Iran deal met the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The Clinton Administration objects to the Iranian project even though American officials say the type of plutonium produced by the light-water reactors that the Russians plan to build is far harder to use in nuclear weapons than the plutonium produced by older varieties of reactors, like the gas-graphite reactors used by North Korea. The United States is leading an international consortium to build light-water reactors in North Korea, asserting that those reactors will be a welcome substitute for the North's existing reactors and its program to develop atomic bombs.
The Administration insists that the biggest problem from the reactors planned for Iran will be the nuclear expertise the Iranians gain from the project, rather than the plutonium produced by the reactors. American officials say they fear that once Iran has the new reactors it will become much easier for Teheran to import so-called "dual use" nuclear equipment that can be used to develop nuclear weapons.
Even though the plutonium produced by light-water reactor is hard to use in bombs, Administration officials said they feared that Iran would not turn the spent plutonium over to the Russians, as promised, and would eventually become sophisticated enough to turn it into weapons-grade material.
Mr. Perry said the International Atomic Energy Agency's regulations were not sufficient to prevent this. "The problem lies in having some assurance that Iran would stick to the agreement to release the plutonium when the time came," he said.
The Americans have forced Conoco to give up a legal $1 billion agreement to pump more oil from Iran and have called for harsher sanctions against the country.
The American pressure is "absolutely unacceptable," Mr. Mikhailov told the Interfax news agency. "A disruption of the contract may result in a number of Arab states' refusal to extend the nonproliferation treaty."
Perhaps more important to Moscow is the hard-currency profit and the chance to keep its nuclear industry at work.
The contract is for nearly $100 million more than the total request for aid to Russia that President Clinton is putting to a skeptical Congress for the next fiscal year. It is double the amount of money for the programs that aid the conversion of Russian military industries to civilian production and help pay for the dismantling of Moscow's nuclear arsenal as called for under arms control treaties.
Sunday night, Mr. Mikhailov told Russian television that the United States now controlled half the world market in nuclear technologies.
"They're not going to let us earn even a little bit of money," he said, echoing a similar argument made by Russian arms manufacturers, who complain that America controls half the world's arms sales and objects to every sale that Moscow tries to make.
Mr. Perry acknowledged Moscow's quandary, saying: "This sale is a big economic factor for them. It is a very hard decision for them to make."
Last year, Washington complained of Moscow's sale of quiet diesel, Kilo-class submarines to Iran. Mr. Perry said that that sale, with two subs delivered and another to come, would continue, but that Moscow had reaffirmed a promise to sell no more subs to Teheran.
On the breakaway region of Chechnya, Mr. Perry said Moscow had spurned American and European demands for a cease-fire and talks with the rebels. But he said Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev supported demands for a permanent human rights mission in Chechnya of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
General Grachev also supports Russia's membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, Mr. Perry said.

HEADLINE: House Backs Board for Capital

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
The House approved a bill today to create an oversight board to help the District of Columbia out of its financial crisis.
The bill, passed by voice vote, would give the board veto power over District spending, limiting the home-rule authority that Washington has had since 1973. The board would have five members, Presidential appointees who would not be paid, and would be abolished after the city paid all its debts. 
 Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d, the Virginia Republican who heads the Government Reform and Oversight Committee's panel on the District, said: "There are no viable alternatives. We are, in effect, pulling the District's credit card with the U.S. Treasury and setting conditions for borrowing that can lead to economic recovery."
The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would give the board authority to reject District spending and borrowing plans and withhold money if budget goals were not met.
The bill requires that the District make substantial progress toward a balanced budget over the next three years and begin achieving a balanced budget in the fiscal year 1999.
The District's 600,000 residents would still elect a mayor and City Council, but the mayor would be required to submit budgets to the board for approval.
The District's nonvoting delegate to the House, Eleanor Holmes Norton, proposed the concept of financial review after Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. revealed that the city was $722 million in the red, putting it in its worst budget crisis in history. Ms. Norton, a Democrat, said the bill retained the integrity of self rule.
Congress demanded last fall that the District cut its $3.25 billion budget by $140 million and 2,000 positions.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 10.72 as U.S. Vainly Tries to Prop Up the Dollar

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration tried unsuccesfully to keep the dollar from falling to another record low against the yen, the stock and bond markets seemed to respond, if only slightly.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.72 points, to 4,168.41, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.14 points, to 501.85. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 0.84 point, to 818.05. 
 Bond prices rose, too, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.38 percent from 7.43 percent.
But the broader stock market did not rally much. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by only 1,129 to 1,080. The Russell 2,000, which tracks the performance of the nation's 2,000 largest stocks, finished at 260.81, up 0.04 point, or a change of only 0.02 percent.
And the kinds of stock that gained yesterday seemed to indicate that traders were betting on continued weakness in the dollar.
For example, traders bid up the Dow component stocks of Walt Disney, Coca-Cola, Philip Morris, and I.B.M., all of which have large foreign operations. And drug, soft drink, and computer microchip companies led the S.& P. 500. When these multinational companies receive revenues in strong currencies like the mark and yen, they get more dollars as the value of the dollar weakens.
Trading volume, at 296.4 million shares, was relatively modest yesterday, indicating that some traders may be on the sidelines, especially after a hectic Friday, when stock prices swung widely.
With the exception of Friday's employment data, there are few market-moving economic reports this week.
"The market is poised to go wherever the news goes," said Bill Allyn, director of listed equity trading at Jefferies & Company. He nonetheless expects the market to go up, if haltingly, because he says portfolio managers are withdrawing capital from the troubled markets in Mexico and Latin America.
"Ever since the emerging markets became submerging markets, these guys have to throw money at U.S. stocks," Mr. Allyn said.
After falling to historic lows against the German mark and Japanese yen on Friday, the dollar got a jolt from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve early yesterday as the Fed bought dollars in Asia and Europe.
Traders estimated the money spent by the Fed was between $1 billion and $2 billion in a market whose daily average is often about $1.5 trillion. The Fed's intervention was worth about one-tenth of a penny for every dollar traded. The American currency lifted substantially for less than 30 minutes in the morning in Tokyo.
Still, the market intervention by the Fed is respected by currency traders as an important policy signal, despite the relatively small sum of money deployed.
The intervention "prevented a free fall" in the dollar, said Robert A. White, senior vice president, foreign exchange, at Standard Chartered Bank. Moreover, he said, "since 1985 each major round of intervention has resulted in the direction desired by the central banks, whether down or up.
"But it's important to add this caveat -- there was some fundamental economic, fiscal, or monetary change, like interest rates, to help the central banks get what they wanted."
And, Mr. White added, the larger the currency markets get, aided by high-speed and high-performance computers, the more difficult it is for the Fed, or any central bank, to influence the markets.
The dollar, after trading near Friday's lows against the Japanese yen and German mark, ended mixed against major currencies. In New York, six hours behind Frankfurt and 13 hours behind Tokyo, the dollar settled at a record low of 86.07 yen , down from 86.55 yen on Friday, and 1.3723 marks, up slightly from 1.3715 marks.
Among the biggest gainers yesterday was E-Systems Inc. which rose 18 5/8, to 64, after Raytheon, the military contractor, agreed to acquire E-Systems, a military electronics company, for $2.3 billion. Also rising was Continental Medical Systems Inc., a hospital management company, which rose 3 3/4, to 11 3/8, after Horizon Healthcare agreed to buy Continental for $502 million in stock.
Among the biggest decliners were the American depository receipts of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the huge Japanese electronics company. Matsushita A.D.R.'s fell 4 1/2, to 153 1/2. Each A.D.R. represents 10 shares. Matsushita is reported to be considering selling all or part of its MCA film studio business.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Cover-Up Chronology

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The evidence is now in -- not all of it yet, but enough to prove that the U.S. Government knew a year in advance that Mexico was headed for financial disaster. The chronology shows that the Administration used the year to keep the information secret and feed the American public a false, knowingly deceptive line about the strengths of the Mexican economy. 
 The cover-up went on until Mexico was only a day or two from bankruptcy. Then, announcing that an emergency existed, the President ordered a $20 billion American loan, plus another $20 billion or so of "international" money, much of which will also be paid by U.S. taxpayers.
Even after the bailout, the Administration is still withholding full documentation, and real candor. But why should it worry? After President Clinton ordered the loan out of special funds, without debate or vote in Congress, the Republican and Democratic leadership in Congress, grateful at avoiding responsibility, told him how fine, how brave he was for going over their heads.
However, nine senators, led by Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, have had the gall to hold hearings in the Banking Committee. They are trying to get through the still-heavy Administration smokescreen of secrecy and evasion.
Mr. D'Amato has introduced a bill putting a $5 billion cap on the loan. That would still be 5 times larger and for 10 times longer than any faintly similar past loan.
But the $5 billion cap is not the real issue. If the senators want more, they can amend the D'Amato bill. Mr. D'Amato is trying to get them to face what they ran from last year: a vote on the bailout, and if yes, for how much.
My working-class soul rebels at the thought that without a by-your-leave the Government is entitled to spend even $20 billion of my money to meet a crisis it had concealed. So here is part of the still-emerging chronology of deception coming out of the hearings and other sources:
Summer and fall 1993: U.S. pushes through the North American Free Trade Agreement by proclaiming Mexican economic stability.
February 1994: The International Monetary Fund privately warns that Mexico is living like a credit-card addict.
March 23: U.S. lends Mexico $6 billion for quick-fix peso bolstering.
Spring: C.I.A. privately warns Treasury of dangers of Mexican collapse.
July, August: Treasury privately warns Mexico.
September: Lloyd Bentsen, then Secretary of Treasury, privately warns Mexico himself. Publicly he expresses support for Mexico.
Dec. 9: Mr. Clinton praises Mexico, publicly, as fine example of economic development.
Dec. 20: Mexico devalues peso; U.S. taxpayers learn of crisis.
Jan. 12, 1995: President suggests Congress enact $40 billion loan; finds Congress vastly reluctant.
Jan. 31: President and Congress acknowledge emergency, President allocates $20 billion. Congress surrenders right to vote or debate.
By now Mexico has already spent $5 billion of American money making good on its high-interest bonds and is readying another $5 billion. The money has whipped from Washington to Mexico to Mexican and foreign investors and currency speculators, and from them out of the country. As unconsulted lenders, Americans at least should know who they are, and how close to the Mexican or U.S. Government.
As for Mexican workers, they know they will also have to pay -- in taxes, lost collateral, lost jobs. At least they have the good sense to be surly about the whole mess.
Real concern for Mexico would have meant public warnings from Washington as soon as trouble was discovered. Legitimate confidentiality does not include deceiving the world. But that would have brought embarrassing revelations at the very time Mexico and the U.S. were both preparing for elections.
Washington insists it did nothing wrong. This deprives Americans even of the small satisfaction of knowing that the responsible officials and their political masters have learned anything at all from the great U.S.-Mexico combination plate, catch-up with botch-up.
April 3: Senator D'Amato supplies me with his New Yorker's sum-up of American and Mexican behavior: "The king has no suit."

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts for Political Gain

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich says the House will pass a big tax cut this week because "every person in the U.S. is overtaxed." Other Republican leaders offer the same justification, but they ignore an inconvenient fact. The United States ranks next-to-last among the 24 leading industrialized countries in rate of taxation on income.
The Republican tax-cut bill is not about alleviating onerous tax burdens, sparking investment or any other lofty purpose. It is a political maneuver. The Republicans want to promise tax cuts no matter how damaging the long-term consequences, then watch President Clinton squirm as he either signs the bill or tells voters he took away their tax cut for the sake of long-run prosperity. 
 The House Republicans would cut taxes $500 a child for most families. They would also cut rates on capital gains income, corporate investment and retirement savings. These measures would harm the economy. The child credit would encourage consumption over saving, the opposite of what the economy needs. The tax cuts explode in future years, making the deficit balloon despite G.O.P. promises to balance the budget. The specific investment and savings subsidies are poorly designed and would do more to enrich wealthy families than to stimulate productive investment.
Liberal Democrats are not the only politicians to wince at the tax package. Some conservative and moderate Republicans have acknowledged that the bill betrays the party's pledge to balance the budget by 2002. To meet the target, Congress would have to cut more than $300 billion a year -- 30 percent of cuttable programs. To raise the hurdle an extra $40 billion to $60 billion a year by cutting taxes puts the target out of reach. That matters little to the tax-cutters to whom it is an article of faith that President Bush lost office because he reneged on a campaign promise to keep taxes down.
The announcement yesterday that the two Republican camps had reached agreement does little to reconcile their differences. Under the agreement, tax cuts will not kick in unless Congress passes a budget bill later this year that would send the deficit to zero over seven years. But the agreement builds in no enforcement mechanism and amounts to little more than pious disinformation.
There is still a chance that common sense will block Mr. Gingrich's tax cut. But if the House approves and the Senate goes along, the G.O.P. will march into the 1996 elections as the party that cut taxes. Mr. Clinton will be tarred as the leader who raised them. Sadly, that may be all the typical American knows about the debate, since polls indicate many Americans support the Contract With America without knowing what it contains. Cynical tax cuts may work as campaign strategy. But they will prove destructive in the long run.

Doubts About Dollar Limit A Rally in U.S. Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rallied yesterday on data suggesting that the economy's growth is slowing and that inflation remains subdued, but a weaker dollar limited the day's gains.
A higher-than-expected index report for March by the National Association of Purchasing Managers showed the monthly production component fell to 51.4 from 54.5 in February -- the lowest level since September 1993. Economists had expected the index to drop to 52.9. Other parts of the report showed inflation and employment were down. 
 The 30-year bond rose 19/32 , to a price of 10230/32 for a yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, of 7.38 percent, down from 7.43 percent on Friday; shorter-maturity bills also improved in price.
"A moderating economy, coupled with diminishing inflation pressures, was a big positive for the fixed-income market," said Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at the CS First Boston Corporation.
"It was an impressive piece of data, with the production index the lowest in 18 months," he said. "This showed a very dramatic slowing compared to where we were in November, the peak of the cycle."
But the dollar's slide and volatility trouble market participants, Mr. Alexy said, adding that "we don't know yet where the bottom is for the dollar."
Indeed, some traders said that the Federal Reserve's purchase of dollars yesterday in international currency markets did not seem to make much difference.
The Commerce Department also reported yesterday that consumer spending increased one-tenth of 1 percent in February and that personal income posted the smallest gain in three months in February, five-tenths of 1 percent. Both reports provided more evidence that the economy's growth is slowing, but they had only a moderate impact on the market, Mr. Alexy said.
In addition to yesterday's producer data, which took the market to the day's highs, Mr. Alexy said the most important economic reports this week would be automobile sales and employment figures.
"Slower economic growth could lower the yield of a 30-year bond to 7.15 percent in the next six weeks," Mr. Alexy said. But without more conclusive evidence, traders said, there is a likelihood that the yield on the long bond will float around 7.40 percent.
The Treasury sold $24 billion of new three- and six-month bills yesterday, with the average rates higher than those of last week. At auction, the rate for a three-month issue rose 12 basis points, to 5.76 percent, the highest since early last month, while a six-month bill increased 10 basis points, to 5.90 percent, the highest in two weeks. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In the municipal bond market, yields dropped a bit, even amid speculation that investors would not aggressively pursue some of this week's supply of housing revenue bonds.
Of the $935 million of securities expected to be sold this week, the State of Washington is the largest. Washington is scheduled to sell $371 million of general obilation bonds through a negotiated offering through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers.
The Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues showed the average yield to maturity was down a basis point, to 6.36 percent, from 6.37 percent last week.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.544	97.017	Discounted Rate	5.76%	5.90%	Coupon Yield	5.94%	6.18%	High Price	98.552	97.032	Discounted Rate	5.73%	5.87%	Coupon Yield	5.91%	6.15%	Low Price	98.544	97.017	Discounted Rate	5.76%	5.90%	Coupon Yield	5.94%	6.18%	Accepted at low price	25%	27%	Total applied for	$49,050,938	$50,636,688	Accepted	$12,005,190	$12,166,037	Noncompetitive	$1,335,031	$1,314,138	
Both issues are dated April 6, 1995. The three-month bills mature on July 6, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on Oct. 5, 1995.

HEADLINE: Data Indicate Higher Rates Are Slowing the Economy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
Consumer spending in February grew at the slowest rate since last April, while factory activity last month slowed to the weakest performance in a year and a half -- signs higher interest rates are putting a damper on the economy.
"We're facing a string of consistently weaker economic data," said William Feezer, co-head of trading at Sanwa Securities (USA) in New York. 
 Consumer spending increased one-tenth of 1 percent in February, down from a seven-tenths of 1 percent gain in January, Commerce Department figures released today show. After adjustment for inflation, February's increase in spending translates into a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent.
At the same time, Americans' incomes posted the smallest gain in three months in February. And the five-tenths of 1 percent increase would have been less than half as large without bonus payments made to auto workers and larger Government subsidies to farmers.
Another sign of slowing came in factory output for March. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its manufacturing index -- which tracks factory orders, production, hiring, inventories and prices -- declined to 51.4 last month, the lowest level since September 1993. In February, the index stood at 54.5 percent.
A purchasing managers' index of 50 or more indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding. A reading below 50 signals manufacturing is contracting.
The purchasing managers' report also suggested inflation remained under control since the number of manufacturers reporting price increases slowed markedly in March from February.
Taken together, today's reports provide a clear picture of an economy that is decelerating. As a result, the Federal Reserve "doesn't have to worry about tightening right now," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York.
Today's Commerce Department report is an important gauge of the American economy's strength. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of United States business activity, helped power the economy to its strongest performance in a decade in 1994.
For all of 1995, many economists are projecting a growth rate equal to half of last year's pace. "February reflects a pretty strong pullback by consumers," said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Nationsbank in New York.
In its report, the Commerce Department also said disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased five-tenths of 1 percent in February -- compared with analysts' expectations of one-tenth to two-tenths of 1 percent -- while the savings rate rose to 4.9 percent during the month.
Meanwhile, another Commerce Department report showed factory profits strengthened in the fourth quarter.
Manufacturers' after-tax profits increased to 6.1 cents for each dollar in sales in the fourth quarter from 5.5 cents in the third quarter. The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations. During the fourth quarter of 1993, manufacturers' profits ran at 3.6 cents for each dollar in sales.
Meanwhile, retailers' profits after taxes rose to 2.9 cents for each dollar in sales in the fourth quarter from 1.8 cents during the third quarter.
Today's Commerce Department report also showed that consumers' interest payments to businesses -- counted separately from consumer spending -- increased by 1.7 percent during February.
January's reported seven-tenths of 1 percent rise in consumer spending represents an upward revision from the four-tenths of 1 percent gain initially announced a month ago.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Plan to Cut $189 Billion in Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The Republican tax bill the House of Representatives plans to take up on Wednesday would reduce the Federal income taxes of people and companies by $189 billion over the next five years and, according to Treasury Department estimates, $630 billion over the next decade.
The bill would give most families with children a $500 tax cut for each child. It would also lower the capital gains tax and provide a variety of other tax breaks for individuals and businesses. 
 The Republican sponsors of the legislation maintain that the bill would reduce spending by more than enough to offset the revenue loss in the first five years. They have also promised that none of the tax measures will go into effect until Congress has approved a budget plan setting forth a "clear path" to a balanced budget by the year 2002.
But the tax reductions are described with great specificity while the spending cuts are little more than promises.
The biggest single saving, for example, would be $100 billion over five years from lowering the overall annual ceilings on discretionary spending. This is all Government spending -- for everything from pencils to submarines -- except the spending for programs like Social Security and Medicare for which money is paid to everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. The bill does not specify which programs will be cut.
In addition, the Republicans are assuming a $65 billion saving over five years from cuts approved by the House last month in welfare and other programs for the poor.
Republicans and Democrats offer different statistics -- accurate but from different perspectives -- to illustrate who the main beneficiaries of the tax reductions would be.
For example, Republicans have produced a study showing that taxpayers with annual incomes between $30,000 and $75,000 would receive a tax cut of 4.3 or 4.4 percent, while the taxes of those with incomes above $200,000 would be reduced by only 2.9 percent.
Democrats have figures showing that under the Republican bill, the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers would get 20 percent of the tax reduction and that the wealthiest 10 percent would get 47 percent.
What follows are the main items in the bill, most of which would take effect next year:
 
Individuals
 FAMILY TAX CREDIT Most families with annual incomes below $200,000 would get a $500 tax credit, or tax reduction, for each child under 18. Families with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000 would get a gradually reduced credit. The credit would be available only to the extent that families owe income taxes. That means families with incomes below about $25,000 would get at most a partial credit. Cost: $105 billion.
MARRIAGE PENALTY Married workers would be entitled to a credit of up to $145 on their joint tax return to help offset the additional taxes that are often owed when single workers marry. Cost: $8 billion.
RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS A new form of individual retirement account would allow workers, regardless of income, to deposit up to $2,000 after taxes that could be withdrawn at retirement without additional taxes on the accrued interest and dividends. In addition to penalty-free withdrawals when the taxpayer reaches 59, money could also be taken out without penalty after five years to pay for college tuition, first-time home purchases, medical bills and long-term care insurance. The Treasury would get $2 billion more in the first five years as taxpayers converted their existing I.R.A.'s to the new kind and paid taxes on the money, but revenue losses in later years would be substantial.
SPOUSAL I.R.A.'s Nonworking spouses could contribute up to $2,000 to the existing form of retirement account in which taxes are not owed on the contribution but must be paid on money that is withdrawn. Cost: $500 million.
CAPITAL GAINS Taxes would be assessed on only 50 percent of all capital gains, which are the profits from investments. The result would be to lower the maximum rate to 19.8 percent from 28 percent. The value of assets would be adjusted annually for inflation so that no tax would be owed on the amount of profits that resulted solely from inflation. Taxpayers who sell their homes at a loss could deduct the loss. Cost: $32 billion, including the corporate capital gains rate cut described below.
SOCIAL SECURITY Increased income taxes enacted in 1993 on the Social Security benefits of many middle- and upper-income retirees would be repealed. The amount retirees age 65 through 69 could earn without having their benefits reduced would be raised gradually over five years to $30,000 from the current $11,280. Cost: $23 billion.
ADOPTION Families with incomes below $60,000 who adopt a child would be entitled to a $5,000 tax credit that year, and families with incomes up to $100,000 could get a partial credit. Cost: $1 billion.
ELDERLY CARE Families who take care of a disabled elderly relative in their homes could get a $500 tax credit each year. In addition, tax breaks would be provided for the purchase of long-term care insurance, and terminally ill taxpayers could claim their life insurance without owing taxes. Cost: $8 billion.
ESTATE AND GIFT TAXES The amount that could be excluded from estate and gift taxes would be increased to $750,000 from $600,000. Cost: $6.8 billion.
 
Businesses
 MINIMUM TAX The alternative minimum tax for corporations would be repealed over five years. (Its purpose is to make sure that companies with large write-offs still owe some taxes.) Cost: $17 billion.
CAPITAL GAINS The top corporate capital gains rate would be reduced to 25 percent from 35 percent. The value of corporate assets would be adjusted for inflation.
DEPRECIATION The bill would allow companies that buy machinery and equipment to take smaller deductions in the first few years after the purchase but to claim much larger deductions in later years. This would increase revenue by $17 billion in the first five years but cost much more afterward.
SMALL BUSINESSES Businesses could write off the entire cost of machinery and equipment costing $35,000 or less in the year of purchase. That is double the current limit of $17,500. Cost: $8 billion.
HOME OFFICES A deduction for the cost of offices at home would be allowed if the taxpayer used the office for administrative work and had no other fixed place of business. Cost: $1 billion.
 
Spending Cuts
 DISCRETIONARY SPENDING This is now frozen at slightly less than $550 billion a year. The bill would lower that by an average of $20 billion a year, but it does not indicate which programs should have less money. Saving: $100 billion.
MEDICARE Several cost-saving measures enacted in 1993 on a temporary basis would be made permanent. Saving: $11 billion.
ENRICHED URANIUM The bill would allow the Clinton Administration to sell the United States Enrichment Corporation. The corporation produces enriched uranium for nuclear power plants. Revenue gain: $2 billion.
BROADCAST LICENSES The Federal Communications Commission would be authorized to continue for two more years, 1999 and 2000, its practice of auctioning the rights to portions of the radio spectrum. Revenue gain: $2 billion.
GOVERNMENT WORKERS Federal employees would have to make larger contributions to their retirement plans. Revenue gain: $11 billion.

HEADLINE: U.S. PRESSES DRIVE ON IRAN AND IRAQ

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration moved against two of its Middle Eastern adversaries today, as President Clinton charged that Iraq could be regaining the ability to develop weapons of mass destruction and his national security advisers met to consider whether to impose a near-total trade ban against Iran.
The stepped-up campaign against the two countries has a dual purpose: to keep together the anti-Iraq coalition at the United Nations and to throttle Iran's economy as it tries to rebuild its military capability. 
 But it also highlights the fact that 16 years after Iran's revolution and more than four years after Iraq's humiliating defeat in the Persian Gulf war, the United States appears to be incapable of controlling or moderating what it considers the unacceptable behavior of both governments.
In pursuing its strategy, this Administration has cast the two countries as regional threats of equal importance.
The Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, is a secular, totalitarian Arab leader who came to power by force, spent tens of billions of dollars on his military machine and continues to rule by terror, while the Iranian President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, is an Islamic Persian clergyman who was popularly elected and who has invested much less money in his weapons program.
But in the eyes of the Administration, they are simply "those two rogue states," as Secretary of State Warren Christopher called them in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League today.
"There's absolutely no room for complacency about Iran's efforts," Mr. Christopher said, referring to Teheran's weapons programs. "Just remember Iraq. Five years ago, too many were willing to give Saddam Hussein the benefit of the doubt. We must not make the same mistake with Iran."
In a joint news conference with the British Prime Minister, John Major, after a meeting at the White House, Mr. Clinton expressed his determination to maintain strict global economic sanctions against Iraq until its Government is in complete compliance with United Nations resolutions that require it to abandon offensive weapons programs and allow permanent intrusive inspections of military installations.
But Mr. Clinton also took pains not to overstate his case, saying he did not have evidence that Iraq had the ability to rebuild its nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic missile programs. "I didn't say they had the apparent ability," he told reporters in reference to their rebuilding those programs. "I said they could be regaining it."
Adding to the confusion, Mr. Christopher deviated during his speech from his prepared remarks to assert that Iraq is now trying to develop offensive biological weapons.
"We now have strong evidence that Iraq is conducting a large program to develop biological weapons for offensive purposes, and yet today, confronted with that evidence, the Iraqi officials just continue to dissemble and to lie," Mr. Christopher said.
In remarks prepared for delivery, Mr. Christopher said Iraq "was conducting" such a program, implying that it is no longer doing so. A senior State Department official explained that Mr. Christopher had made an inadvertent mistake because he was reading from a teleprompter, and that the "evidence" Mr. Christopher was referring to was a United Nations analysis in late February that Iraq has concealed evidence of a biological weapons program.
Iraq has never accounted for 17 tons of biological cultures that could be used for developing tuberculosis, cholera and the plague.
As for Iran, the Administration remains split over whether to ban most trade, senior officials said today. The issue has taken on new urgency because of Republican-sponsored legislation and a campaign led by the country's most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group.
Cabinet officials met at the White House today to discuss a variety of options, including banning American oil companies and their subsidiaries from buying Iranian oil on the open market and from investing in projects in Iran.
But they failed to come up with a recommendation for Mr. Clinton, a senior Administration official said.
"The bottom line was that no decisions were made," the official said. "I don't want to suggest consensus on any part of this. Options are still being shaped for the President."
The official added that the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, who headed today's meeting, has not decided whether to convene another Cabinet-level meeting on the issue.
Perhaps because of the strongly held views of different agencies, Mr. Lake intends to give Mr. Clinton a series of options. A senior Administration official said it might be weeks before the options went to Mr. Clinton's desk.
Mr. Christopher and Madeleine K. Albright, the American representative at the United Nations, who are pushing the near-total trade ban, argued today that it is the best way to make the current American strategy to isolate Iran work better.
Both officials favor a sweeping executive order that would send a strong signal to the Congress and Iran's trading partners that the United States is determined to thwart Iran's ability to purchase weapons and related equipment.
But other agencies, including the Energy and Commerce Departments have resisted taking any action that will not directly punish Iran. Both agencies believe that Iran will find other customers for its oil.
The Pentagon has argued that further isolating Iran may further radicalize the country. It is unclear what position the Deputy Defense Secretary, John Deutsch, took in today's meeting.
Mr. Clinton never has made a secret of his conviction that economic sanctions rarely have an impact unless they are globally imposed, and his views on this issue are not known. But the Iran policy debate has come to have more to do with politics and symbols than with any belief that new American economic sanctions will change the behavior of either Iran or America's allies.
The issue is complicated by two bills introduced by Senator Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican, to prohibit American companies or their subsidiaries from doing business with Iran and to impose sanctions on foreign companies that do business with Iran.
That legislation is supported by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which has distributed a 74-page argument for sanctions that seeks to seize on a wave of anti-Iran sentiment sweeping Congress.

HEADLINE: Kool-Aid, Not Soda: Living on Food Stamps

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SHELBYVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
The children love Doritos, but at $2.89 a bag at the Save-a-Lot discount store, where Linda Snider buys most of her groceries, they are too expensive. Instead, she buys two bags of generic potato chips for 89 cents, Kool-Aid instead of soda, pork chops instead of steak. Once a month she splurges on a half-gallon of ice cream.
"I buy a lot of macaroni and cheese for 19 cents a box," said Mrs. Snider, a 36-year-old emergency room aide who lives in a small garden apartment with her two daughters and a grandson on income of $222.89 a week and $160 a month in food stamps. "A 10-pack of hamburger meat, I can get six or seven meals out of. A pack of chicken gives me four. That's the only way I can shop." 
 Here in the rolling hills of Shelby County in central Kentucky, Mrs. Snider is among nearly 1,700 people, about 6 percent of the county's population, receiving assistance under the Federal food stamp program, which, after years of rapid growth, is in for some significant tightening if the House of Representatives has its way.
The welfare overhaul bill passed by the House in March would limit cost-of-living increases in food stamp benefits to 2 percent a year. Most legal immigrants would be declared ineligible, a provision that would remove 1.1 million people from the program's rolls. And all able-bodied adults who have no dependents would be required, after 90 days of assistance, to work at least 20 hours a week, not merely be enrolled in job training or be seeking a job as at present. That change would make an additional 800,000 recipients ineligible.
All this is aimed at saving $20 billion from the $150 billion that the program would otherwise cost over the next five years. A total of 27.5 million Americans, about one in 10, now receive food stamps, an increase of 36.8 percent since 1990 alone despite an improving economy and a lower unemployment rate.
Like about a fifth of the recipients nationwide, Mrs. Snider has a job and a family. She also has a dream that her children will "rise above my raising," and feels ashamed to have needed public assistance so long -- her parents were on welfare -- but angry at any perception that all food stamp recipients abuse the welfare system.
Despite Shelby County's modest living costs and job growth that has held unemployment at 4 percent or less for more than a year, Mrs. Snider and other recipients say they have no choice but to take food stamps: their jobs simply do not pay enough to make ends meet.
Many earn little above the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour and say their food stamp allotment is essential to keeping their homes and families intact. Many also say they are frightened by the possibility that their stamp allowance will not keep up with the rise in food prices.
Jerry Buehner, manager of the Kountry Pic-Pac Market, one of three supermarkets in Shelbyville, said that as much as 30 percent of the store's revenue was now in food stamps, about double the proportion of a decade ago.
For 20 years Janie Harrod, a case worker at the Shelbyville office of the state welfare agency, the Kentucky Department for Social Insurance, has been counseling food stamp recipients as well as those receiving cash assistance through the Government's primary welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
"Sure, we have our abusers," she said of food stamp recipients who refuse to work, who have babies to increase their benefits or who hide income or trade their stamps for drugs and alcohol. "You're always going to have a small group of people who abuse the system or wait for someone else to take care of them. And I get fed up with all the abusers. But they're not the majority. The majority of people really need the help."
Mrs. Harrod says stamp recipients -- whose benefits vary according to complex calculations of family income (up to $1,604 a month permitted for a family of four) and assets like a savings account, a car or a house -- fall into no particular category. There are single mothers getting no child support, recently separated or divorced people, retired people supporting grandchildren or children who cannot find work, and disabled people.
Most have a high school education, she said, but an increasing number of applicants have college degrees.
"You see everything," Mrs. Harrod said, pulling out folders that recorded a wide range of circumstances, from an 86-year-old man living alone who gets only $10 a month in food stamps because he has savings of $2,500, to a young working couple with six children who get $379.
Then, as she opened another file, her face tightened. "Here's a couple who just reapplied," she said. "He's 30, unemployed. She's 25 and works at a local day care center. When they brought in their checking account, it showed $36 a month for each of them to belong to a fitness center.
"Some people just don't know how to budget," she continued. "They're not making ends meet, and they want to keep their HBO and call-waiting."
Mrs. Snider, who separated from her third husband 10 years ago, knows few such luxuries. The biggest treat she gives the family is a rare evening at McDonald's, where a double cheeseburger, small fries and a Coke cost about $2. She pays in cash, since restaurant meals -- like alcohol, tobacco, vitamins and pet food -- cannot be bought with food stamps.
Her apartment is neatly decorated -- "Wal-Mart and yard sales," she said -- but cramped. She sleeps on the living room couch so Elvina, 18, who quit school after ninth grade, and Elvina's 3-year-old son, Brandon, can have the larger bedroom. Felicia, 10, sleeps in the other. Brandon's father, who is not married to Elvina, is 18 and lives with his grandmother.
For years, Mrs. Snider's life was a patchwork of rearing children, working menial jobs, drinking too much, moving into and out of her mother's apartment and, as her parents had, depending on food stamps and cash welfare to help pay bills.
Then, in 1989, she found work as a housekeeper at the Jewish Hospital in Shelbyville. Within two years she was promoted twice, enabling her to stop receiving cash welfare payments. She now earns $6.19 an hour and has her sights set on getting off the food stamp program.
"I'm embarrassed by this for the children," she said of her need for food stamps. "When I didn't have the right clothes in school, they'd call me Rag Doll. I realized I wasn't doing better than my parents. I've sat Elvina down and told her, 'Don't throw your life away; don't do what I did, bring a baby into this world and give it a whole lot of nothing.' "
While some recipients, like Mrs. Snider, have received food stamps for decades, many others say they expect to use them only briefly, until unforeseen or unavoidable setbacks begin to ease.
Toni Brown, a 24-year-old single mother receiving $169 in food stamps each month, is living in a subsidized two-bedroom apartment in Shelbyville with her 4-year-old son, Brandon, while she works at Wal-Mart and attends the University of Louisville, 38 miles away. A sophomore majoring in chemistry and Spanish, she has made the dean's list.
Like Mrs. Snider, Ms. Brown shops carefully, skipping name-brand cereals, which cost more than $4 a box, in favor of $3 store brands. But unlike Mrs. Snider, she knows that her earning capacity as a chemical researcher will get her off welfare quickly after graduation. And nothing angers her more, she said, than people who milk the system with no intention of quitting. Some, she said, are her neighbors.
"It makes me really hot," she said the other day before picking up Brandon at the Childtown Day Care Center. "I see them just sit around, watching soapies all day. I see the drug dealers. One girl in my community, a teen-ager, I heard her say, 'When I have my next baby, they'd better give me a three-bedroom apartment.' These people have no ambition."
Yet she also criticizes lawmakers who would reduce benefits. "It scares me," she said. "Not for me, because I'll be out soon, but for others. If the Government takes anything away, it just hurts the kids."
Patricia Kearney and Ruth Mahoney agree. Losing even a small fraction of their food stamp allowance would hurt their dependents, they said.
Ms. Kearney, a 30-year-old unemployed and unwed former assembly-line worker who attended a business college for two years, has five children, all under 8 years of age. Because of her need to care for them, she said, she has little expectation of taking a job soon. A food stamp recipient for seven years, she now gets $370 a month.
She said she felt "kind of bad" over the need to take public assistance, which includes $791 a month in other welfare benefits.
"Would I do anything different?" she said. "I wouldn't jump and have these kids. I love them, but I wouldn't have had them. I'd have given myself a chance."
Mrs. Mahoney, 56, has been rearing two grandchildren since 1983, when her 24-year-old daughter died of cancer.
The same year, Mrs. Mahoney was divorced from her husband, leaving her as the sole supporter of the children. She gets $66 a month in food stamps.
"I can't work," she said. "I've had three heart attacks, the last one in 1989, and I didn't think I was going to make it. I've got a bad back, and I had a tumor removed from my left arm. I've got cataracts and glaucoma. If they change the benefits, it's really going to be hard on me."
Pam Compton, 36, never imagined she would have to work, let alone need public assistance. She was married for 14 years to a trucker who earned as much as $50,000 a year. They lived in a middle-class neighborhood, in a three-bedroom house with their two children.
But their marriage broke up last May, and Mrs. Compton said she and the children, now 13 and 12, had moved 14 times to elude her husband, who wants custody. Two months ago, with nowhere else to go, they moved into a shelter. Now, she said, she receives $285 a month in food stamps and $156 a month in cash welfare.
She left her first two jobs -- at Pizza Hut ($2.30 an hour plus tips) and a local factory ($4.25 an hour) -- because the pay was so low. She said she expected to find a higher-paying factory job.
"I do feel a little shame about this," Mrs. Compton said, holding back tears. "I'm not taking care of them. The state is.
"It's been wonderful here," she said of the shelter, "but I want a normal life."

Chart: "REWRITING WELFARE LAW: Food Stamps"
 
THE GOAL -- House Republicans want to slow the growth of the Federal food stamp program, which has served as an income supplement for poor people, including those without children who would not qualify for other welfare programs.
 
THE PROPOSAL -- The bill passed by the House and set to be considered by the Senate this spring would tighten eligibility and, after 90 days' assistance, deny food stamps to able-bodied adults who have no dependents unless they work at least 20 hours a week; it would also cut most legal aliens from the rolls and limit cost-of-living increases to 2 percent a year.
 
CURRENT LAW -- Food stamps are indexed to inflation, most legal aliens are eligible for benefits, and able-bodied adults with no dependents are required only to be looking for a job or enrolled in job training.
 
SAVINGS -- The House bill would save almost $20 billion over five yoears, from a projected budget of $150 billion. Originally the program was to be scrapped altogether, with the states given block grants to spend on welfare as they saw fit. But farm-state Republicans stopped that effort. (pg. A16)

Dow Rolls Past 4,200 As Bull Market Continues
 An ebullient stock market hit record levels, with the Dow rising 33.20 points to close above 4,200 for the first time, at 4,201.61. Bonds and the dollar also rose, with traders anticipating stable interest rates, low inflation and higher corporate earnings. 
 But the stock market's bullishness did not extend to technology issues, which took a beating as many traders became fearful that prices were climbing too high too fast. D10.

HEADLINE: Court Allows Plan to Merge Housing Force

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Two days after consolidating the transit police into the Police Department, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday overcame the final hurdle to merging the housing police as well.
In a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled that the Mayor had the power to move ahead with the merger, a ruling that cleared the way for a single superforce of more than 38,000 officers within a month. 
 The court rejected an argument by the union for the housing police that Civil Service laws prohibited the transfer of its 2,500 officers and civilians from the quasi-independent Housing Authority to the city payroll.
With the decision in hand, Mr. Giuliani said that on May 7, the city would consolidate the housing force, which was created in 1952 with 47 officers to patrol projects. The Mayor has already received the necessary approval from the Housing Authority and the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which pays $70 million, or 40 percent, of the costs of the force.
The merger of the smaller transit and housing forces into the Police Department will complete one of Mr. Giuliani's core campaign pledges -- one that has been debated for decades but that eluded two predecessors, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins.
The merger will most likely leave Mr. Giuliani's signature on policing for years. "The merger assures all New Yorkers a coordinated and unified police protection whether they live in a housing development, whether they ride the subway, whether they are using the streets or public spaces of the city," the Mayor said at City Hall. "Crime and criminals don't recognize the boundaries between housing developments, the transit system or the streets."
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, who will command more than 38,000 officers and 6,000 civilians, said the merger would allow the city to eliminate duplicate functions, freeing 200 officers for patrols in the 337 housing projects. The merger of the transit police, he said, would free 300 to 500 officers.
A primary fear of opponents, who include some elected officials and tenants' groups, has been that policing would drop in housing projects as the larger Police Department focused its attention elsewhere. Some tenants' leaders have threatened to conduct a rent strike if the merger proceeds, contending that city officers do not want to patrol their projects.
The Mayor's aides have stressed that the merger would allow increased patrols in the projects, where crime has remained steady or risen in some categories in recent years, even as it has dropped significantly citywide.
"This gives us an opportunity to stem that kind of crime behavior," said the Mayor's counsel, Dennison Young Jr., who has spearheaded the merger plan.
In the agreement with the Housing Authority, which was reached last September, the Mayor's office pledged to maintain at least the current level of policing. The accord, however, did not set a specific target, as did the agreement reached last week with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that controlled the transit police until 12:01 A.M. Sunday, when the transit police merged into the larger force.
For that reason, some opponents remained wary. Councilman Anthony D. Weiner, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, "The stakes are higher" for the 560,000 residents in the projects.
They are "more likely to fall victim to violent crime and less likely to see a police officer," he added.
"I hope that the merger is not seen as an end but a means to greater attention to the economically and politically vulnerable residents," Mr. Weiner said.
The Council, which has sought to delay the merger but does not have the power to stop it, has scheduled a hearing on policing in the projects for tomorrow evening at the Beach 41st Street Houses in Far Rockaway, Queens.
After the court decision, the president of the Housing Police Benevolent Association, Timothy L. Nickles, conceded defeat in the fight, which delayed the merger from its originally planned schedule of October 1994. Mr. Nickles said he feared that despite Mr. Giuliani's promises, future mayors would not be bound to maintain policing for some of the poorest residents in projects with some of the most intractable problems.
"We have a lot of faith in Bill Bratton," Mr. Nickles said, noting that the Commissioner headed the transit police from 1990 to 1992. "It's not tomorrow or next year we're worried about. But what's going to happen two or three years from now?"
On May 7, the housing police will officially become a bureau in the Police Department, like merger of the transit police. The bureau will be led by the current head of the housing police, Chief Joseph R. Leake, who will become one of seven three-star chiefs under Mr. Bratton.
The officers in the housing bureau will continue to operate from the nine precincts in housing projects. As with the transit officers, officials predicted a smooth transition that would go unnoticed by most New Yorkers.
Mr. Giuliani said one of the first priorities of the combined force would be to combat drugs and crime in the projects.
The chairman of the Housing Authority, Ruben Franco, a mayoral appointee, said the merger would enhance safety by bringing in the full force and resources of the Police Department. "We've had a good police force," Mr. Franco said. "But it simply isn't big enough."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Major Patch Up Quarrel on Northern Ireland

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
With British-American relations at their lowest point in years, President Clinton and Prime Minister John Major emerged from nearly three hours of meetings today and declared that the two countries had largely patched up their differences.
Seeking to put the best face on their recent quarrel over Northern Ireland, the two acknowledged that some disputes were inevitable. 
 "It's honest and open and it endures occasional disagreements," Mr. Clinton said of America's relations with Britain at a news conference. "But the agreements are far more numerous, and over the long run should be the shaping factors of our relationship."
Although the two leaders tried to give the impression that they had buried their differences, they could not help but squirm when a reporter asked about the health of their personal relationship.
"I think we have a good personal relationship," President Clinton said. Mr. Major was less bullish, saying, "We know one another well enough, and the relationship is good enough, to have those disagreements, and it doesn't affect the broad swath of agreement that exists between the two countries."
Relations took a serious turn for the worst last month when President Clinton, rejecting Mr. Major's recommendations, invited Gerry Adams, the head of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, to the White House and allowed him to raise funds in the United States.
Mr. Clinton's aides said those moves would nudge the Northern Ireland peace process forward, but many Britons expressed outrage that Mr. Clinton was embracing someone they viewed as a supporter of terrorism.
Despite the good will that both men displayed publicly, officials said that in one or two private meetings Mr. Major made it clear that he still resented the President's invitation to Mr. Adams. He said he would not allow the rift over the Northern Ireland issue to spoil London-Washington relations, but the officials quoted him as pointedly saying at one stage, "I do not use the phrase, 'special relationship.' "
As evidence that the British-American relationship is strong, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Major pointed today to several areas in which they agree. They said economic sanctions should be extended against Iraq, that Russia should not build nuclear reactors in Iran and NATO should be expanded gradually and openly.
The two leaders also said the war in Bosnia was being prolonged by the Bosnian Serbs' intransigence and warned that the recent surge in fighting would only cause more bloodshed and a continued stalemate. They urged Bosnia's Serbs to accept a peace plan proposed by the so-called contact group on the Balkans, which consists of the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia.
In London, those five nations agreed today to pressure Bosnia's Muslim-led Government to agree to extend a rapidly fraying four-month cease-fire that is scheduled to expire on April 30.
"Throughout this century, the United States and the United Kingdom have stood together on the great issues that have confronted our people," Mr. Clinton said.
Seeking to put their differences on Northern Ireland behind them, Mr. Clinton echoed the British leader's call for the I.R.A. to move quickly to start surrendering its weapons. He also said that the conflict over Ulster was closer to reaching a just and lasting settlement than at any time since it began nearly 26 years ago, "thanks in large measure to the vision and courage of John Major."
Tensions between the two allies over Northern Ireland grew so serious last month that Mr. Major took five days to return a telephone call in which Mr. Clinton tried to mend fences. The two leaders had previously disagreed over Bosnia, with the British leader rejecting American calls for air strikes against Bosnia's Serbs.
Aggravating matters further, the British were annoyed when Mr. Clinton decided to go to Moscow instead of London in May to mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.
Officials familiar with the talks today said that Mr. Major also asked President Clinton to back Britain's efforts to have a former British Foreign Minister, Lord Owen, named Secretary General of NATO.
NATO's current head, Willy Claes, a former Belgian Economics Minister, is under pressure to resign because of a bribery scandal involving arms manufacturers and Belgian Government officials. Mr. Claes denies any involvement in the affair.
One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Major also informally proposed establishing a free trade agreement between the United States and the 15-nation European Union, though the Prime Minister has not discussed the idea with other European leaders.
During his two-day visit, Mr. Major went twice to Capitol Hill to meet with leaders of the new Republican-led Congress. He met with Bob Dole, the Senate Majority leader, to urge him to abandon his drive to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslim-led Government, but Mr. Dole said he was not persuaded.
"The British position on that is well understood," Mr. Major said at the Pentagon on Monday. "We think lifting the embargo would be a mistake."
Britain and France, both of whom have troops in the United Nations force in the Balkans, say that lifting the arms embargo on the Bosnian Government would only fuel the fighting in Bosnia, soon to enter its fourth year, and put the United Nations soldiers there in greater risk.
Even as Mr. Major and Mr. Clinton sought to repair the special British-American relationship that flourished under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, the new Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, sought to claim that he was now the one with the special relationship with Britain's Conservative leader.
"We do feel a special kinship," Mr. Gingrich said of Mr. Major.

HEADLINE: G.M. Agrees To Sell Car Rental Unit

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its National Car Rental System operation to an investor group led by William E. Lobeck, the former president of the Chrysler Corporation's group of car rental companies and a former owner of Thrifty Car Rental.
Industry analysts estimated the sale price of National, the fifth-largest car rental company in the United States, at about $1 billion. G.M. did not disclose the terms of the deal. 
 G.M. said the sale of National reflected its strategy to focus more resources on its core automotive business, and automotive industry analysts said they applauded G.M.'s decision.
"Investors want to see G.M. become more focused, more efficient and more liquid from a balance sheet perspective," said Thomas M. Galvin, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence. "Completing the sale of National is confirmation that management is sticking to its game plan."
G.M. emphasized yesterday that its agreement with Mr. Lobeck's investor group, the NCR Acquisition Corporation, was definitive. In January, G.M. said that its plans to sell National to a group led by Vestar Equity Partners had collapsed. That deal was first announced in September.
NCR won out over Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc., which had been considered the odds-on favorite. An acquisition of National would have given Alamo more of the airport locations it had been seeking to serve business travelers. Alamo primarily focuses on leisure travelers with rental offices that are away from many airports.
Besides Mr. Lobeck, the NCR investor group includes Alvin Swanner of New Orleans and Archer McWhorter of Houston. Certain National licensees may also join the investor group, G.M. said.
Mr. Lobeck, along with four other investors who included Mr. Swanner and Mr. McWhorter, purchased Thrifty Car Rental in 1981. Thrifty was acquired by Chrysler in 1989.
According to the terms of the sale to NCR, the new owners will continue to employ National's 6,400 workers, and will continue to buy cars from G.M.
Although G.M. said that National turned a profit in 1994, the auto maker's decision to sell the subsidiary marks its final move to sever a close tie to the car rental industry. That long-term relationship has been both good and bad for G.M. and other car companies.
Auto manufacturers have long looked at car rental companies as a showcase where potential customers can test-drive new cars and as a convenient market to absorb cars when the auto makers built far more than individual customers demanded.
But as the car rental companies started selling a growing number of their own late-model cars to individual buyers in the late 1980's -- creating overflowing used car lots that competed with established car dealers -- those dealers started complaining.
So the car rental companies largely stopped the practice of selling their own cars and returned them to the manufacturers, who would then sell them at auction. Fewer cars were sold to the car rental companies. Sales of these so-called program cars reached their peak in the 1991 model year, when 1.5 million such cars were sold; for the 1995 model year, just over a million such cars are expected to be sold, according to Auto Rental News, a trade publication based in Redondo Beach, Calif.
"It got out of control in the beginning of this decade with the program cars," said Jon LeSage, executive editor of Auto Rental News. "They seemed to have come back to some kind of balance point."
But before that balance point was reached, the industry economics grew so poor that G.M. considered liquidating the subsidiary a few years ago.
In late 1992, the car company reported a $744 million charge related to losses and the write-off of good will at National. G.M. then hired a turnaround specialist, and the unit returned to the black in 1993.
Other big car companies may also be looking to get out of the business. Chrysler is expected to announce shortly its plans to sell Dollar Systems Inc. and Thrifty Car Rental, according to a person familiar with the company's plans. A Chrysler spokesman said, however, that no active discussions were under way to sell the subsidiaries.
Of the Big Three car companies, the Ford Motor Company appears the most committed to the business. Last year, Ford announced its plan to buy the remaining 46 percent of the Hertz Corporation that it did not own to gain full ownership.
The G.M. deal was announced about two hours after the stock market closed. Earlier, G.M.'s shares ended trading down $1.125, at $43.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: A Legal High-Wire Artist Takes On Silicon Valley Giants

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
It is probably safe to say that Jim Manzi and Bill Gates, who seem to have little to agree on as the chief executives of Lotus Development and Microsoft, both wish they had never heard of Gary Reback.
A lawyer with the Silicon Valley firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, Mr. Reback wrote a brief that was influential in the decision by Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin in February to reject the Justice Department's settlement of its antitrust case against Microsoft. Last month, Mr. Reback helped Borland International Inc. win a ruling in a copyright infringement case brought by Lotus, when a Federal appeals court panel overturned a lower court's ruling that could have required Borland to pay crippling damages. 
 Both Microsoft and the Justice Department have appealed the decision by Judge Sporkin, and Lotus has said it will appeal the Borland case to the Supreme Court. However temporary his victories might be, Mr. Reback has drawn the kind of attention not commonly focused on specialists in such arcane areas as antitrust and intellectual property law.
This is hardly a case of David versus Goliath, however. The client list of Wilson Sonsini is a virtual Rolodex of the big players in Silicon Valley, and Mr. Reback has enjoyed his share of high-profile cases. Lawyers at competing firms say Mr. Reback's high-wire act in taking on Microsoft and the Justice Department is only possible because Wilson, Sonsini has so many clients that have a vested interest in seeing the software giant taken down a peg or two.
"Mr. Reback and his law firm are to law firms in this area what Microsoft is to software," said a lawyer at another Silicon Valley firm, who requested anonymity, "and the great irony is that their own monopolistic practices go unchallenged. They completely dominate the market in Silicon Valley."
In the appeal in the Microsoft case last month, the Justice Department argued that Judge Sporkin had greatly overstepped his authority and that his decision was "an invitation to anarchy." Lawyers for Microsoft requested that the judge be disqualified from the case, contending he had relied on a popular book about the company -- "Hard Drive," by James Wallace and Jim Erickson -- for much of his information.
In a brief filed last Friday in response, Mr. Reback argued that neither Microsoft nor the Justice Department had provided Judge Sporkin with adequate information to determine if the proposed settlement was adequate. A Federal appeals court panel in Washington has scheduled oral arguments for the case at the end of the month, but a decision could take several months.
On another front, Mr. Reback has filed documents stating that the planned $1.5 billion acquisition of Intuit Inc. by Microsoft would allow the giant software company to use its dominance in desktop computing to create a monopoly in electronic banking and commerce. A Justice Department ruling is expected later this month, and should the acquisition be blocked that would be another coup for Mr. Reback.
Brian Kahin, a law professor at Harvard University, said the briefs filed by Mr. Reback in the Microsoft cases raised "some very important issues that we don't really have a policy framework to address."
Standards -- hardware or software specifications that are either widely used or officially sanctioned -- present a challenge to regulators, Mr. Kahin said, and the briefs "illustrate the power that standards have when they reach a certain critical mass."
In the meantime, Mr. Reback is unfazed by a Microsoft publicity campaign to refute his claims. "Microsoft engaged in illegal acts for six years," he said, referring to what he and others maintain were predatory practices that gave the company a virtual monopoly in operating systems for desktop computers. "As a result," he said, "they prevented competitors from acquiring an installed base of their own."
The entire installed base of Microsoft "is tainted," he said.
"Using that tainted installed base they leverage it into new markets," he added.
Microsoft, Mr. Reback said, created pricing systems that coerced computer manufacturers to pay for licenses on each machine they sold, whether or not the company's operating systems were loaded. He also said the company engaged in the practice of promoting "vaporware" by announcing nonexistent products for the purpose of stalling sales of a competitor. And, he added, Microsoft uses undocumented features in its operating systems that give the company's other software products an edge over those of its competitors.
Mr. Reback's arguments in both Microsoft cases are similar, relying on a combination of conventional antitrust analysis and a relatively obscure economic theory called "increasing returns" or "network economics." According to this theory, a monopolistic company is freed from the diminishing returns suffered by most products over time in a free market because its customers are locked in and will buy new goods and services even in the presence of superior alternatives.
Having achieved its monopoly in operating system software, Mr. Reback contends, Microsoft can now use that dominance to achieve similar positions in new markets, like corporate computer systems and the on-line industry, through its planned Microsoft Network on-line service. Mr. Reback said the consent decree against Microsoft forbade per-unit license fees for its MS-DOS and Windows operating systems, but excludes Windows NT, a more advanced system.
Mr. Reback, who is 45, suggested that Microsoft could combine the dominance of Windows, its desktop operating system software, with the market leadership of Intuit in personal finance software to achieve instant dominance in the emerging market for electronic on-line commerce. "I took one look at Intuit and said this is pure network economics," he said. "In conventional economics, someone can have a third of a market and be a player; in increasing returns it turns out to be all or nothing."
Perhaps more controversial than his use of advanced economic theories is Mr. Reback's lack of a named client in either filing against Microsoft and his reliance on accounts in the news media of the company's tactics. He maintains the document in the Intuit case was a white paper, or an explanatory document, submitted at the request of the Justice Department; the briefs in the Microsoft case were filed on behalf of three rival software companies, which chose to remain anonymous because they feared retaliation.
Some lawyers at competing firms have said the filing was as much a promotional effort for Wilson Sonsini and Mr. Reback as it was an act on behalf of clients.
"The allegation that this is a publicity stunt is particularly offensive to me, " Mr. Reback said. "What motivates me here is something very serious. All the multibillion-dollar clients I have came into existence during my legal career -- the last 20 years -- because in Silicon Valley we have an environment in which that can happen. If you let one company endanger that, we're all going to be enormous losers."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
German Economists Fear a Slowdown From Strong Mark

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 4

 BODY:
Economists around Germany this week have issued the darkest warnings to date that the excessively strong mark is setting the German economy on a path toward radically lower growth, with exports dropping and employment stagnating this year and next.
With the dire predictions, growth projections have been reduced by one-third, in the aftermath of last week's unsuccessful attempt by the nation's central bank to bolster the dollar by cutting German interest rates. 
 This week, the mark continued to set new highs against the dollar. And the promises of politicians that German economic growth would not be affected could hardly be heard amid the warnings by some of the country's most prominent economists and business leaders.
On Monday, for example, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in Hanover that the economy would grow 3 percent this year, Hans-Olaf Henkel, head of the country's most influential business trade group, the Federation of German Industry, said he had scaled back his group's forecast to 2 percent growth because of the expected effects of the strong mark.
And today, as Economics Minister Gunter Rexrodt reiterated the 3 percent forecast, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank said his giant bank's internal estimates called for a persistently high mark through the end of the year, with even lower projected growth.
"Instead of the 3 percent, we may only achieve growth of 1.8 percent," the economist, Norbert Walter, said in an interview with the daily Berliner Zeitung that was released a day before publication.
He said the drop in exports, a result of the strong mark making Germany's exports too expensive for many buyers, would be felt as soon as the second half of this year. Mr. Walter also said that the dollar would probably remain around 1.37 marks through the end of 1995. [Late in New York trading Tuesday, the dollar settled at 1.3762 marks.]
These predictions come as Germany is just a year into recovery from its worst postwar recession, and struggling with persistently high unemployment.
Mr. Walter said the German currency's strength would make it nearly impossible for unemployment in the country's western region -- now officially 8.2 percent, but unofficially closer to 10 percent -- to fall.
The mark's high valuation and the poor prospects for the dollar have preoccupied German policy makers, as they realize that there is little they can do to change market sentiment against the dollar, barring a reduction in the American budget deficit or the resolution of the Mexican financial crisis.
Though most of the focus here has been on the dollar's weakness, officials at the central bank, the Bundesbank, say their paramount concern about German competitiveness relates to the value of European currencies like the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, the French franc and the British pound, because more than 70 percent of exports go to European countries while less than 10 percent go to the United States.
Officials are particularly worried about the lira, which has fallen almost 20 percent against the mark this year. "Italy is a very competitive supplier of machinery and other items that Germany also produces," a central bank official said. "At current levels, German exports to Italy just aren't competitive."
Some business executives here say it is almost impossible these days to sell German-made products in Italy because they are so expensive in lire. "You now have to produce in Italy to be able to sell there," a banker said recently.
The pound and the peseta have again taken big dips, making German exports to those countries less competitive, as well.
The Bundesbank's chief economist, Otmas Issing, today called the mark's value exaggerated, yet warned, "No one knows how long we will have to live with the current exchange rates."
Reflecting the dark mood among German officials, Mr. Rexrodt, the Economics Minister, took the unusual step of calling for American policy makers to do something to bring up the dollar's value.
The rise in the exchange rate of the mark "goes far beyond what is justified by fundamental factors," he said in a statement. "It is therefore all the more important that stabilizing signals be given by United States economic and fiscal policy, which make this clear and calms the market."
This was interpreted as a call to the Federal Reserve to again raise American interest rates.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Increase as Fed Buys Some Treasury Issues

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
ond prices were bolstered and interest rates slid to levels of a week ago yesterday as a result of the dollar's stronger performance in currency markets and an announcement by the Federal Reserve that it was buying various Treasury securities in the open market.
A few times a year, the central bank comes to market and buys certain maturities to add cash to the banking system. It is a way to address seasonal shortages of reserves that if left unattended may cause short-term rates to move higher than the current Fed policy warrants. 
 The process, called a coupon pass, also presents dealers with an opportunity to sell Treasury securities that have been piling up in inventory. It is not a signal of any change in monetary policy.
In the last coupon pass on Nov. 29, the Fed bought $4.2 billion of notes and bonds. The Fed will disclose the size of yesterday's pass at its weekly news conference on April 13. Yesterday, the central bank was buying securities with maturities of April 1996 or later.
The 30-year bond rose 2/32 , to a price of 103 for a yield of 7.37 percent, down from 7.38 percent on Monday, with shorter-maturity bill rates down an average of about two basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In currency markets, the dollar recovered some ground against most leading currencies after tumbling on Monday despite interventions by central banks.
Also yesterday, a construction spending report by the Commerce Department showed a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in February, slightly more than the four-tenths of 1 percent decline economists had expected. Analysts said it was yet another report from the market's perspective that the economy was slowing.
Spending in January was also revised to reflect a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent from the previously reported decline of two-tenths of 1 percent.
This Friday's payrolls report is expected to give the market a better idea where the economy is headed. Some economists believe employment conditions are probably the best indicator of the current pace of economic growth.
Traders said the expectation that the Federal Reserve would begin to buy securities in the open market yesterday was an early positive for the market, especially for shorter maturities.
So-called short-covering early in the session also helped bond prices edge higher ahead of the construction spending report. Traders who sell short borrow securities and then sell them, hoping to replace them later with securities bought at lower prices and make a profit on the difference. Yesterday, some of these players were forced to buy back these securities, or short-cover, to limit losses, as prices rose instead of fell.
Alan Kral, portfolio manager at Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen Inc., a New York investment management firm, sees the market trying to digest the events of the last few trading sessions, including the weakness in the dollar, the rise in gold prices, higher commodity prices and data that suggest the economy is slowing.
"I don't think the Fed will act to raise interest rates based solely on what is happening in the currency market, but I expect it to remain a concern of the market that they will," Mr. Kral said. That concern, he thinks, can only stop through the passage of time.
The coming economic numbers, Mr. Kral believes, will disclose a slowdown from the fourth quarter, though not necessarily enough to slow down inflation more than the pace of 2.5 percent the Fed would like. "However, we think that the trend of news announcements going forward will be positive enough to satisfy the targets and strategies of the bond vigilantes who are quick to lynch the Fed," Mr. Kral said.
Noting that recent data, including the construction spending report, continued to reflect a slowing economy, Jack McIntyre, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said: "The credit market's true test will come Friday when the employment situation for the month of March will be released. The bond market will need to see weakness in the labor sector of the economy if the 1995 rally is to continue."

HEADLINE: New Construction Spending Falls 0.5% for 2d Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
Spending on new construction projects declined in February for the second consecutive month, the Government reported today, as higher interest rates and winter weather slowed the pace of home building to its lowest level in more than a year.
Construction spending fell five-tenths of 1 percent, to $523.3 billion, at an annual rate in February, the Commerce Department said. In January, construction spending declined a revised five-tenths of 1 percent, initially reported as a two-tenths of 1 percent decrease. 
 The first back-to-back decline in a year reflected "an erosion of residential activity" pegged to the rise in long-term interest rates, said Raymond Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage rates are about two full percentage points higher today than when they bottomed out below 7 percent in the fall of 1993.
In addition, the weather turned colder in February after an unusually mild December and January in many parts of the country, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
Before today's Government report, many analysts had been expecting little or no change in construction spending for February.
Many economists saw little reason for concern in the construction figures. The outlook for commercial real estate remains healthy, said Gene Sherman at the New York investment firm of M. A. Schapiro & Company. "Corporate profits remain strong, and as long as they remain strong, capital spending will continue to grow," he said.
Additionally, Mr. Sherman said housing could stage a modest recovery in the spring because mortgage rates have fallen below 9 percent, prices are steady year over year and jobs remain plentiful.
By category, spending on residential buildings and home improvements fell five-tenths of 1 percent in February as single-family home construction declined to the lowest level since January 1994.
But spending on commercial projects, such as factories, rose 3.3 percent in February. Businesses continue to spend heavily on improving plant and equipment because it is "less interest-rate sensitive than housing," Mr. Stone said. "Housing tends to be the most interest-rate sensitive sector," he added.
Spending on public projects, such as municipal water works and public housing projects, fell 1.1 percent in February, the Commerce Department said.
The slowdown in construction spending follows declines in several other areas, such as new home sales and factory output, as the economy absorbs the effects of the seven interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve since February 1994.
The increases have made it more expensive to borrow for everyone from builders to home buyers. For example, sales of new single-family homes fell 14 percent in February to the lowest level in almost three years.
Additionally, starts of new housing construction declined in February to the lowest level in almost a year. Permits for new housing construction also dropped during the month.

HEADLINE: Way Ahead in the Space Race;
Europe's Arianespace Builds on Decade-Old Lead

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
It seemed a secure American domain: launching satellites to feed a growing world hunger for space-age telecommunications. But the Challenger disaster in 1986 effectively shut down the American space program for more than a year, leaving customers little choice but to look elsewhere.
Where many of them looked was to Arianespace, the European consortium that had set up shop in the early 70's and was starting to expand rapidly by 1986. After the Challenger, its business surged, aided by sharp business tactics and generous government financing, and it now dominates the worldwide business of launching commercial satellites. 
 And Arianespace may soon get an even tighter lock on the business and doom the two main American rocket makers, the Lockheed Martin Corporation and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, to permanent also-ran status in this strategically and symbolically important corner of the aerospace industry.
Late this year the French-led group will launch its first Ariane 5 rockets, the fifth generation in a series developed by European governments and companies specifically to break the long American stranglehold on lofting commercial satellites into orbit.
Developed for about $7 billion, the Ariane 5 is more powerful than the current Ariane 4 and designed to allow more efficiency in preparation and launching. Already, Arianespace and the European Space Agency are planning a $1-billion-plus upgrading to the new rocket that could by the turn of the century leave it with an ever greater advantage.
Arianespace's ascendancy owes something to that accident of timing after the Challenger. But it is also a case history in how Western European governments have proved willing to make consistent, long-term commitments to subsidizing and nurturing what they consider key technologies and industries.
Despite budget pressures like those that have led to cuts in the American space program, the major Western European governments, which pay for developing and testing the rockets before turning the technology over to Arianespace, have stuck doggedly to their plans and met all their financial promises.
As a result, Arianespace ranks alongside Airbus, the French-led commercial aircraft consortium, as the greatest success of European industrial policy. "Technologically, Ariane 5 is doing nothing that the United States is not capable of doing," said Barry Zilin, president of Practical Innovations, an aerospace consulting firm in Woodbridge, Va., that recently did a study of American and European space efforts.
"The difference is one of Arianespace taking advantage of many lessons they've learned from observing the U.S. space program and streamlining operating procedures," he said. "They've developed five new launch vehicles and three new launch pads, each time learning from the one before. We in the U.S. haven't been able to match those investments."
Arianespace, a partnership of 40 European aerospace companies, led by Aerospatiale of France and the French space agency, has had its problems, including two launching failures last year and delays this year.
But Arianespace, which sent up its first rocket in 1979 and did not begin commercial launchings in earnest until 1984, accounted for nearly half of all commercial launchings between 1989 and 1994, and holds 55 percent of the launching orders for coming years.
Lockheed Martin, which makes the Atlas rocket, the main American commercial launcher, and McDonnell Douglas, which makes the medium-sized Delta, together have less than 30 percent of advance bookings. The Russian Proton and the Chinese Long March rockets have the rest.
Aerospace executives in the United States trace Arianespace's success in part to an ability to price launchings aggressively.
While prices are a closely held industry secret, analysts say an Ariane 4 launching could range from $80 million to $120 million, depending on the number of satellites carried, the customers and the value of the dollar relative to the French franc. An Atlas launching might cost just $65 million, but where Atlas normally carries only one satellite, the Ariane 4 usually carries two, with the cost split between them.
The Atlas and Delta were originally designed to deliver nuclear warheads, and American aerospace companies still look a lot like military contractors, with all the associated costs and inefficiencies. Arianespace, by contrast, has always been purely commercial.
The differences show up in large ways and small. Arianespace has French chefs at the launching site in Kourou, French Guiana, to keep customers well fed while awaiting launchings. It offers them up-to-date facilities for preparing their satellites. And it runs a lean operation.
The Atlas program, for example, requires most preparatory work to be done on the launching pad, where working conditions are far from ideal and solving problems can be difficult. Most preparatory work on Arianes occurs in huge hangars, with the rocket and its payload rolled out to the pad only after nearly everything is checked out.
James Wynn, a George Washington University graduate student who is in Paris this year studying Arianespace, said the consortium used about 200 people to prepare and launch a rocket. American launchings, by contrast, require 500 people or more, he said, although their efficiency has been improving as the military adopts more commercial practices to save money.
"The U.S. system requires a lot of redundant oversight and checks," holdovers from the military days, Mr. Wynn said. "The French have found they need to do that for the first test series, but not once everything is up and running."
Just as it has tailored operations to commercial uses, Mr. Wynn said, Arianespace has also adapted technology to its customers' needs.
"Everyone assumes Ariane is wonderful new technology," Mr. Wynn said. "It's an old technology tailored to the commercial market. They've sized the tanks and the engines to the needs of commercial customers. They've simplified pumps and valves to make things more reliable. It's the same old stuff we're using, but put together in a way that's just right for launching commercial satellites."
Arianespace is extending that approach. The Ariane 5, which is expected to be launched for the first time in November or December and to begin commercial launchings late next year, is more powerful than the Ariane 4, but simpler in many ways. It has one main engine instead of the four on the Ariane 4. It will be able to carry nearly seven tons of payload into the type of orbit needed by telecommunications satellites, up from four and a half tons.
The Ariane 5 will thus be able to carry two spacecraft of nearly three tons, the average for a telecommunications satellite, plus their associated equipment. But satellites are growing larger, and are expected to be three and a half tons in the next decade. As a result, Arianespace plans to upgrade Ariane 5 to carry eight tons or so -- a capacity no other launcher will be able to match.
"If Ariane 5 proves reliable and matures quickly, which I expect it will, then the overall economic equation will be visibly improved for users who contract with Arianespace," said Ralph Jaeger, the consortium's senior vice president for marketing and international affairs.
Moreover, Mr. Jaeger said, the plans to squeeze costs are aimed not just at competing against other launchers, but at helping Arianespace's customers compete against alternative technologies like ground-based fiber optic cable. Those customers are almost exclusively companies that need satellites to relay television and telephone signals, both rapidly growing markets.
To be sure, the United States retains powerful advantages. Washington will for the foreseeable future use American rockets for its military and scientific satellites that do not ride the shuttle into space, providing a base of orders that should keep production lines and launching teams intact no matter what happens in the commercial business.
But Washington has proved unwilling to provide the American industry with the kind of direct support Arianespace receives. As a result, Arianespace executives and analysts said, the stiffest competition in future years might come not from the United States but from Russia, which is eagerly taking advantage of its low cost base.
A failure by the United States to support its launching industry "could portend a lesser ability for us to compete effectively against a clearly aggressive French commercial market competitor," said Brian D. Dailey, a vice president in Lockheed Martin's Washington office.
The Clinton Administration is now studying whether different rocket programs could be combined and slimmed down into a single family capable of both Government and commercial launchings.
But for Lockheed Martin, the key to competing may be held not by Washington but by the Russians. Lockheed has a joint venture to market the Russian Proton launcher to satellite users, and so far has been modestly successful at it. The Proton could become an even more potent competitor, analysts said, if Lockheed can develop a launcher with Russian costs and American levels of customer service.

Court Backs Injunction And Pushes for Talks

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The President, the Secretary of State and the mediator appointed by the President have tried to get the baseball owners and the players to bargain successfully. Yesterday, the chief judge of a Federal appellate court tried his hand.
Judge Jon Newman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was not trying to broker an agreement, but in making his judicial point, he elicited answers from lawyers that added weight to the contention of union officials that they are eager to resume negotiations and the owners are not. 
 At the conclusion of a 66-minute hearing in Manhattan, Newman and the other two members of the panel, Judges Ralph Winter and J. Daniel Mahoney, denied the owners' request for a stay of the injunction that prompted players to end their strike over the weekend and return to work without a new collective bargaining agreement.
All three judges were so severe in their questions and comments to Frank Casey, the owners' lawyer, that the appeal of the injunction the owners will present to a three-judge panel next month would seem to have virtually no chance of success.
The denial of the stay and the likely denial of the appeal would enable the shortened 144-game season to proceed with no possible interruptions or problems in the near future.
Typical of the comments from the bench was one made by Winter in response to an argument Casey was trying to make about mandatory subjects for bargaining. "Mr. Casey," Winter said, alluding to the court's previous decisions, "I think you're in the wrong circuit."
Later, when George Cohen, representing the union, rose to address the court after Ellen Farrell had argued against the stay for the National Labor Relations Board, Winter said, smiling, "What's the matter, counsel, you don't like the way the argument has gone so far?"
The judges especially were critical of the owners' view, as presented through their legal team, that the injunction issued last Friday by Judge Sonia Sotomayor of United States District Court somehow inhibited or prevented the two sides from negotiating.
In an affidavit submitted for the case, Casey said the injunction, if not stayed, would "end collective bargaining for the foreseeable future." The union, he said, would have "no incentive to negotiate until the late summer or early fall, when it again will be advantageous for the players to strike."
But Newman referred to a letter Donald Fehr, the union leader, sent to Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, last Friday, two hours after Sotomayor granted the injunction. In the letter, Fehr told Selig that the players were prepared to continue bargaining and asked him to "give me a call so we can arrange to return to the bargaining table."
"The last thing we have here," Newman said to Casey, "is Mr. Fehr's letter saying they want to resume collective bargaining. When can you do that?"
Casey: "As soon as we can do it."
Newman: "Starting today?"
Casey: "As soon as we schedule it."
The judge later raised the subject with Cohen. "Are the players ready to resume collective bargaining?" he said.
"Absolutely, your honor," the lawyer replied emphatically.
But the resumption of talks has not been scheduled. Selig has not called Fehr to arrange a return to the table, not after last Friday's letter and not after a subsequent letter from Fehr.
The judges unanimously criticized the owners' position on bargaining and the injunction as stated by Casey. At one point, Newman asked the lawyer what it would take for his side to understand otherwise.
"Do you want to hear it from Judge Sotomayor?" the judge said.
"Do you want to hear it from us?" Newman added later, "When you're telling us that the injunction is stopping you from negotiating a collective bargaining agreement, you're telling us something that isn't so."
The other two judges suggested to Casey that the owners and their lawyers squandered an opportunity to act when they might have succeeded.
Winter mentioned the owners' decision of Feb. 3, in a deal with the labor board to avoid a complaint being issued against them, to withdraw their implemented salary cap and to restore the previous work rules.
"You're the one who entered the agreement to restore the status quo," Winter said. "You could've fought that in court and you would've had a heck of a case. You didn't."
At another point, when Casey argued that the owners were prevented from negotiating the economics for 1995 and now couldn't do anything until 1996, Mahoney said, "You had the possibility of pursuing that with the N.L.R.B. and you threw in the towel."
In another problem labor area, a four-hour meeting in Philadelphia on the leagues' lockout of the umpires went nowhere.
Richie Phillips, the umpires' lawyer, said he told Robert Kheel, the leagues' negotiator, that the owners are "like bullies who can't win a fight so they want to pick on the smallest kid on the block" and beat him up.
"I said the umpires will not allow themselves to be bullied at the bargaining table," Phillips said.
 
Networks Vying for Games
 ABC, NBC and Major League Baseball -- the partners in The Baseball Network -- will meet next week to determine which network will broadcast the All-Star Game, the World Series and the playoffs this year. Although NBC is scheduled to televise the 1995 World Series, ABC would like it, having missed last year's. The partners must also determine whether to extend TBN's contract beyond 1995.

HEADLINE: Ford and Nissan Report March Sales Rise

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 4

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Corporation reported healthy March sales increases today in contrast to earlier reports of declines from most other major auto makers.
Despite the signs of strength, stocks for the Big Three weakened on Wall Street as investors reacted to the earlier reports. The Chrysler Corporation closed down $2.125 at $40. General Motors Corporation shares were off $1.125 at $43.50 and Ford was down 62.55 cents at $26.50. 
 Investors are getting mixed signals -- the growth in consumer spending and lower income -- Government data show. But there is evidence that consumers are increasingly confident and more Americans plan to buy cars.
"One thing is for sure: A year ago the industry was inflated at what everybody said were unsustainable levels," Joel Pitcoff, an analyst for Ford, said.
The industry's United States sales of cars and light trucks in March were down 5.3 percent from a year ago. Most analysts still expect the auto makers to equal or exceed last year's deliveries of 15 million light vehicles.
Ford's sales were 3.3 percent higher in March, with record truck sales, up 16.5 percent, offsetting a 9 percent decline in passenger car deliveries.
Nissan sales, including those of its luxury Infiniti division, were 9.2 percent higher. The Altima, one of Nissan's three high-volume sedans, was up 77 percent.
On Monday, Chrysler reported March sales off 9.1 percent, and its chairman, Robert J. Eaton, said the company's profit in the year's first half would be reduced because of increased spending on rebates and other buyer incentives.
G.M. said its sales were down 9.4 percent and Toyota's slid 13.2 percent. Of the top five Asian auto makers, only Honda reported an increase -- its sales were up one-tenth of 1 percent.
Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said consumers had been reacting to increases in variable-rate credit card and mortgage interest, and remembering periods when interest rates made monthly payments more expensive.
The Federal Reserve has repeatedly increased interest rates in the last year in an effort to head off inflation. If rates stabilize or decline later this year, "people who held off buying a car in February and March will come back into the market," Mr. Glantz said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Up Some Ground With No Signs of Intervention

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar recovered some ground yesterday after Monday's tumble, ending higher against most leading currencies as dealers watched for signs of further intervention by central banks.
While there were no signs that the Federal Reserve entered foreign exchange markets yesterday to buy dollars, the expectations of such interventions bolstered the dollar, dealers said. On Monday, the Federal Reserve spent about $1 billion to prop up the value of the dollar. 
 "The dollar has benefited from the threat of continued intervention," said John McCarthy, manager of foreign exchange for ING Capital Markets in New York. Indeed, the threat of intervention helps the dollar more than the actual purchases, he said. "The ironic thing is that when intervention comes, people are less concerned, because the deed is done."
After slipping to a postwar low of 85.68 yen in intraday trading in Tokyo, the dollar recovered to 86.20 yen in New York trading late yesterday, up from 86.07 yen on Monday. The dollar edged up to 1.3762 German marks from 1.3723 marks. The British pound slipped to $1.6067 from $1.6189.
The Bank of Japan, which bought dollars alongside the Fed in Asian trading yesterday, bought again yesterday, traders said. Japan's central bank has bought dollars repeatedly in recent weeks to try to keep the yen from strengthening. The strong yen hobbles Japan's economy by making its exports more expensive.
Speculation that the dollar may have fallen too far, too fast also helped the currency rebound today, dealers said.
The dollar's decline "has been overdone for a long time," said Richard Vullo, currency sales manager at the Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank in New York.
With American stock and bond markets advancing, the economy growing, and "the only inflation fears coming from the dollar itself, the U.S. should be an attractive place to invest, and the dollar should be doing O.K.," Mr. Vullo said.
Though stronger today, many traders said the dollar's swoon would not end until the United States took more drastic steps to slow its decline, like raising interest rates. Higher interest rates often help a currency by making bank deposits denominated in the currency more attractive.
"There is plenty of room for the dollar to fall" before the Fed holds its next meeting on monetary policy on May 23, said Betsy Reetz, manager of currency sales to fund managers at the National Westminster Bank in New York. The dollar could fall as low as 1.30 marks by then, she said.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Wrong Target

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
One of the many important issues to emerge battered and distorted from the insidious cavern of political demagoguery is affirmative action. If you listen to the latest crop of compulsively deceitful politicians, or tune into the howling degradation of talk radio, you might become convinced that the biggest problem of discrimination in the United States today is bias against white men.
The complaint is that legions of African-Americans, women and assorted others are taking jobs, promotions, classroom slots, theater tickets and the best seats on the bus from the folks who really deserve them -- white guys. 
 The arguments against affirmative action are almost always crafted in racial terms because the demagogues know that race is the way to get the emotional flames roaring. In fact, the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action are women. If all parties would lower their voices and try to communicate in good faith, it could be pointed out that while there are problems with affirmative action -- including some serious problems of fairness -- the negative impact on white men has not been great, and the problems are correctable.
What you do not want to do, in a country where there are still prodigious amounts of race and sex discrimination, is abandon a long and honorable fight for justice in the face of political hysteria.
The Federal Glass Ceiling Commission recently reported that 95 percent of top corporate management positions in the United States are held by white men. Throughout corporate America, women, blacks and Latinos are paid less than white men for doing the same work. And if you believe there is a bias against white males in hiring, just pair up a white guy with a black guy and send them off in search of the same job.
Racism against blacks and sexism against women abound. And yet the outrage we hear today is about discrimination against white men.
A report on discrimination in employment commissioned by the Labor Department found very little evidence of employment discrimination against white men. The report was prepared by Alfred W. Blumrosen, a law professor at Rutgers University. It found that a "high proportion" of the so-called "reverse discrimination" claims brought by white men were without merit.
The politicians will tell you that the attack on affirmative action is a cry for racial justice. That is not so. It is an expression of the anger and frustration felt by large numbers of overwrought and underemployed white men. Their anxiety is understandable, but affirmative action is not their enemy. Downsized to the point of despair, their wages stagnant or falling, their prospects dim, these men are caught up in the treacherous world of technological innovation, economic globalization and unrestrained corporate greed. Buffeted by forces that seem beyond their control (forces that are affecting everybody, not just white men), they listen to the demagogues. It's the blacks doing it to you. It's the women. They're getting your piece of the pie. Otherwise you'd be O.K.
The Clinton Administration, under pressure, is reviewing Federal affirmative action programs. Fine. Let whatever abuses exist come to light. Scrap whatever programs are unnecessary or unfair. Where affirmative action is being used to help the disadvantaged, remove the racial or ethnic requirements. There are white kids all over the country who are economically and educationally deprived. Give them a hand.
But neither Bill Clinton nor anybody else should back off from the commitment to fight what is still an enormous and debilitating problem -- discrimination against blacks, other ethnic minorities and women. Where affirmative action is needed to counter the effects of discrimination, let it be.
The United States is going through a period in which the politics of meanness is in the ascent. In many circles, it is unfashionable to be compassionate. Putting down others is the dominant mode of political expression, preferably with a vicious remark accompanied by cruel laughter.
All of this will pass. Eventually we'll find our higher selves and chase the dogs of bigotry and fear and ignorance from the yard. I am convinced this will happen. We are Americans, after all. We are better than we have been behaving lately.

HEADLINE: Cuba Blockade Supporters Cling to the Past

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senator Connie Mack insists (letter, March 24) on considering the United States policy of blockade against Cuba as the most effective means to achieve his aspiration, and that of an ultra-right-wing sector of Cuban migrants in Florida: to change the Cuban political system in line with his interests. 
 The failure of such a policy for more than 36 years and its rejection in the United Nations by 101 countries, as well as by increasingly wide sectors of United States society, are not sufficient arguments for the Senator from Florida, who presupposes that he is right simply because 20 other senators support the increase in pressures against Cuba.
According to a recent Gallup Poll among "common citizens" of Cuba, for those whose well-being supposedly concerns Senator Mack, 58 percent believe that the revolution has had more successes than failures, and 43 percent expressed being very satisfied with their personal life.
Those same "common citizens" enjoy social security, health and education standards well above those existing in Florida, the state that elected Senator Mack.
Cuba is immersed in a wide-ranging and irreversible process of change, but it is not the United States Congress that will decide the future of Cubans.
Senator Mack and those who support him are making this process more difficult by insisting on anachronistic ideas of times long gone and are underestimating the intelligence of your readers by affirming that Cuba constitutes a threat to the United States.

HEADLINE: On the San Andreas Fault, an Ideal Spot for Vines

BYLINE: By BILL STAGGS 

 BODY:
AS Pat DeRose guided visitors around the winery at his family-owned Cienega Valley Vineyards, he pointed out the tanks, barrels and other equipment of a typical wine-making operation. But his guests were drawn to the cracked floors and warped walls, and to a small box in the corner. Inside were seismic monitors from the United States Geological Survey, instruments whose needles wavered frequently because the powerful San Andreas fault runs smack under the winery, slowly splitting it in half.
The vineyard is set in a quiet valley dotted with walnut groves and other wineries, 10 miles south of the town of Hollister and 100 miles south of San Francisco. "The west side of the building has moved 24 inches in about 30 years," Mr. DeRose said, pointing out a gap between two walls that once were one. The west side is moving north and the east side is inching south. 
 Mr. DeRose is just one of many food and wine producers who do business along a 120-mile stretch of the San Andreas fault -- from the dry slopes of the Gavilan Mountain Range south of Hollister to the shores of Tomales Bay, north of San Francisco. Nowhere else along the fault do the temperature, soil and climate come together so agreeably for agricultural pursuits.
These farmers conduct their businesses with varying degrees of concern about their tectonic neighbor -- from reverence to indifference -- and reap the rewards of nature fully aware of the risks in setting up shop next to such a force.
Not many of them are old enough to recall the San Francisco quake of 1906, but most can remember the Loma Prieta quake of 1989. And still they stay.
Allan Lindh, a seismologist with the geological survey in Menlo Park, south of San Francisco, views the San Andreas fault not as the region's ultimate bogyman but as "perhaps the best thing that ever happened to the state." He doesn't consider it strange that people still want to establish businesses in such a risky zone.
"The San Andreas created California about 100 million years," Mr. Lindh said. "It has been assembled out of a million little pieces, creating an enormous range of economic and esthetic benefits, an endless variety of little valleys in which you can find almost any set of conditions you might be looking for, especially for agriculture."
He pointed out, for example, the limestone soil, so perfect for vineyards, that "rafted in" from areas hundreds of miles to the south as plates shifted, and the steep slopes of new mountains that created streams to fill valleys with rich, alluvial soil.
"Without the Coast Ranges and the Sierras that were thrust up by tectonic movement, all that rain from the Pacific would be falling somewhere over the Midwest," he said.
Mr. Lindh attributes his theory to Perry Byerly, a geology professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who suggested in the 1930's that earthquakes might do good as well as harm. Mr. Lindh acknowledges the injuries and destruction that occur with major quakes, but his scientific perspective helps him weigh the damage against the economic benefits.
"Losses of $15 billion or $20 billion are nothing compared with the benefits we have realized from the power of the San Andreas over time," he said.
In the picturesque Cienega Valley, Mr. DeRose, for example, is unfazed by the slow splitting under his building. He has adapted to the shifting earth by bracing interior walls, essentially turning the halves of the winery into separate structures that can move independently.
Just two miles south of Mr. DeRose's place is the Calera Wine Company, owned by Josh Jensen.
Mr. Jensen, who said his 20-year-old enterprise was "a Frisbee toss away from the fault," bought the land after a two-year stay in France working for the Burgundy producers Romanee-Conti and Dujac. He returned to California to scout limestone plots similar to those that yielded the best grapes in France. Today, he makes five pinot noirs that frequently win prestigious tastings.
Mr. Jensen knew about the potential hazards of being so near the fault when he carved his winery from an abandoned rock-crushing plant. His only precautions were steel and concrete reinforcements. So far, his improvements have held through quakes large and small.
"There's not a lot you can do, really," he said. "We all accept a certain level of risk simply by living in California."
Eighty miles north, in the Santa Cruz mountains, lies Ridge Vineyards. Paul Draper, a wine maker and the company's chief executive, has lived and worked alongside the fault for 25 years.
He said the Loma Prieta quake jolted everything -- people, barrels, tanks -- straight up and straight down. Yet, despite the winery's proximity to the quake's epicenter, only three bottles of 1987 Ridge Geyserville Zinfandel, from Sonoma County, were broken.
Mr. Draper has a keen awareness of the geologic forces underfoot.
"At least once a week I bike down into the canyon along the fault," he said. "There's an old split-rail fence, and the line of the fence is offset by 12 feet. That fence gives you a very real sense of how things move.
"Working on the fault makes you realize that there is this force that is greater than you. You deal with it with respect, doing everything you can. We make efforts -- from building special tanks to securing barrels -- but we realize it's a force that can't be predicted."
On a clear day, a visitor on a Ridge hilltop can look to the northwest and follow the San Andreas -- across the San Francisco peninsula and the choppy Pacific off the Golden Gate -- to see all the way to the Point Reyes peninsula on the coast of Marin County. Warren Weber grows organic produce on Star Route Farms, where the fault strikes land at Bolinas lagoon.
Douglas Gallagher, who manages the 100-acre farm, was in his house changing his son's diaper when Loma Prieta vibrated northward along the fault.
"The field crew saw waves start out in the lagoon," he said, "then continue across the marsh and ripple right under the farm like somebody was shaking out a carpet."
"It sounds strange, but I kind of enjoyed it," he said. "It's a phenomenon that makes you feel kind of small, that gives you a new perspective."
The farm suffered no damage, but Mr. Gallagher said he was stuck with two days' worth of produce because many restaurants in San Francisco were closed.
Twenty miles farther north, past the town of Olema -- the epicenter of the San Francisco quake of 1906 -- the village of Marshall hugs the eastern edge of Tomales Bay.
The town is home to the Straus Family Creamery, with its barns and pastures on the shore and its bottling plant four miles inland. Albert Straus and his family have run this organic dairy since February 1994.
Ellen Straus, Albert's mother, extols the virtues of the region. "The dairies always liked to blend our milk with interior valley milk because ours tasted better," she said. "It has to do with the cool, foggy climate," she added. "Our cows are not stressed by high temperatures like they are inland."
The Hog Island Oyster Company, a newcomer to this fault-created bay, sits near the land where the Straus's 220 cows roam.
The oyster company is owned by Michael Watchorn, Terry Sawyer and John Finger, all marine biologists. They chanced upon this stretch of shoreline 10 years ago.
Mr. Sawyer said Tomales Bay -- with its cool, shallow waters and it's elongated shape -- provided the ideal climate for their needs. "The rapidly moving cold waters at the mouth of the bay make for a better oyster," he said.
Their oysters -- European flats, Atlantics, Kumamotos and Pacifics -- have made such a splash in California restaurants and markets that the men have to ration them to insure enough for customers.
"I'm not wild about earthquakes," Mr. Finger said, "but I've learned to deal with them. I'd much rather be here on the shore of Tomales Bay during a quake than in a tall building in downtown San Francisco."

HEADLINE: The Dow Rolls Past 4,200 as Stocks, Bonds and Dollar Rally

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
As the financial markets head into the corporate earnings season, stocks, bonds and the dollar rallied yesterday, with traders expecting stable interest rates, low inflation and higher corporate earnings.
But the weak dollar, which rose slightly yesterday on expectations that the Federal Reserve and other central banks would again defend it, could be the financial markets' undoing over the next few weeks. 
 Still, an ebullient stock market hit record levels yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average finished above 4,200 points for the first time, at 4,201.61, up 33.20 points. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 3.39 points to finish at 505.24, also a record high.
American markets are currently outperforming other financial markets. "U.S. stocks are the only game in town right now," said Thomas Gallagher, head of equity trading at Oppenheimer & Company. "You don't want to be in Japan. You don't want to be in Europe."
To Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis for A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, "The big picture is that it's still a bull market."
"But April is going to bring some classic showers," he added, "a timeout for stocks, probably in the third or fourth week of the month."
For one thing, analysts said, traders may be incorporating the expectation of higher first-quarter earnings into stock prices. Thus, when companies report strong earnings later this month, their stock prices may actually fall and drag down the rest of the market with them. If the earnings are less than expected, the drop will likely be steeper.
Yesterday, high-technology stocks took a beating on similar concerns, sending the Nasdaq composite index, rich in high-tech stocks, falling 4.33 points, to 813.72.
Stock traders, fearful that prices may be climbing too high too fast, were troubled by the collapse of some high-tech stocks that had led the market for months.
Sybase dropped 16 1/8, to 23, and was the day's most active stock with 32.2 million shares traded. The headlong plunge in price, caused by a troubled outlook for the company's data base software, wiped out more than $800 million of what used to be $2 billion worth of stock. It also contributed to the sharp fall in the Nasdaq index.
The dollar rose above Monday's post-World-War-II low of 85.85 Japanese yen and last Friday's postwar low of 1.3720 German marks. In New York, the dollar rose to 86.20 yen, from 86.07 yen on Monday, and to 1.3762 marks from 1.3723 marks.
Bonds edged higher, with long-term interest rates falling, deflecting more money toward stocks. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.37 percent from 7.38 percent. Since March 14, rates have been relatively stable at about 7.4 percent.
So far, the Dow is breaking milestones at a far faster rate than in the recent past. For example, after edging past 3,000 points on May 30, 1991, it took the Dow more than six months to cross 3,100 on Dec. 27, 1991, and six more trading days to cross 3,200.
By contrast, the Dow crossed 4,000 points on Feb. 23 and took only 21 trading days to cross 4,100, and eight days to cross 4,200.
The major stock indexes indicate that the market may be at a crossroads. The rally so far has concentrated mainly on blue-chip stocks. Since March 9, the Dow has consistently risen, advancing from less than 4,000.
By contrast, the S.& P. 500 has been flat at about 500 points for eight sessions in a row. And the Nasdaq composite index, consisting of some 4,900 stocks has been down or flat for five sessions in a row at below 820.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was normal, with 330.6 million shares changing hands.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.80 points, to 273.29, with advancing stocks outnumbering decliners by 1,437 to 846. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.31 points, to 467.30.
Among the biggest gainers, Moorco International, a specialized equipment maker, saw its shares rise 7 3/4, to 21 3/8, after the FMC Corporation offered to buy Moorco for $20 a share, or $223 million. FMC fell 1/4, to 60 3/4.
Shares of Valujet Airlines, rose 4 1/4, to 54 3/4, after the carrier reported gains in capacity for March. The American depository receipts of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the Japanese conglomerate, continued to gain in speculation about Matsushita's possible negotiations to sell MCA, the huge film studio. The securities gained 4, to 157 1/2.
Among the biggest decliners was the Pittston Minerals Group, a mining company. Its shares fell 3 5/8, to 14, after a Merrill Lynch analyst lowered his assessment to "below average" from "above average." Shares of Timberland fell 3 3/8, to 22 3/4, after the footwear company said earnings would be below Wall Street expectations.

HEADLINE: He Cheated a Charity, Unchallenged

 BODY:
William Aramony was president of the United Way of America for 22 years, until an embarrassed board of directors forced him out in 1992. He now stands convicted of siphoning off more than $600,000 of United Way funds for himself.
The Aramony scandal hurt local United Ways all over the country, although they had no hand in it. More important, it signaled the businessmen and women who sit on charity boards -- Mr. Aramony's and others as well -- that they are guardians of the public's trust, and must not treat the responsibility casually. 
 The United Way of America is not general headquarters for the 1,900 local United Ways, and does no public fund-raising. It is a separate organization that offers training and marketing services to help the United Ways that are its members -- 1,400 of the 1,900 -- charging them a fee for the services they use. Mr. Aramony and two colleagues skimmed from those fees and from the profits of a spinoff unit they created to handle some services.
It is commonly acknowledged that Mr. Aramony did much to strengthen the United Way of America. This may have blinded his directors to his shortcomings, but blind they were. They paid him $390,000 a year, plus $70,000 in perks and benefits, and approved a lucrative pension -- in addition to what he is convicted of taking illegally. Testimony at his three-week trial spun a tale of dalliances with at least four lovers -- one of them just out of high school -- cruising on the Nile, gambling in Las Vegas and weekending in an Upper East Side condo in Manhattan with a chauffeured car.
A former chairman of the United Way of America board -- Edward Brennan, chairman of Sears, Roebuck -- testified that he had received an anonymous letter in 1990, warning that Mr. Aramony was looting the organization and romancing a teen-ager. But a year later, when reporters were raising questions about Mr. Aramony, the board reportedly gave him a "resounding vote of confidence." He was forced out within three months.
Since then, with a new president, a reconstituted board that includes local United Way representatives, stricter controls and lower fees, the United Way of America has regained the local member organizations that pulled out at the time of the Aramony troubles. Total United Way fund-raising -- hurt by the recession as well as the scandal -- is almost back where it was before, at roughly $3.2 billion.
The United Way of America may be clean these days, but only because of a crisis that could have been avoided if its trustees had not been so trusting.

HEADLINE: History on the March;
New Standards, Attacked on the Right, Stress the Neglected

BYLINE: By JO THOMAS 

 BODY:
Jaime Kleinman, 16, took another look at the American Revolution and surprised herself by arguing that the British were right.
"They did everything for the colonists," she said. "They didn't deserve to be turned on." Many of her classmates at a Long Island high school, however, argued just as strongly that the British were wrong. 
 In a Brooklyn high school, a history class examined a drawing of the Boston Massacre by Paul Revere. "Where's the black man?" one student asked.
Absent, along with the snow that historians say was on the ground that day, was the Revolution's first American casualty, Crispus Attucks, a former slave. The class pondered this, along with the use of the word "massacre" for five deaths.
The schools are miles apart geographically and far apart economically. Yet both share new approaches to teaching American history similar to those recommended in voluntary standards proposed last fall by a task force at the National Center for History in the Schools at the University of California at Los Angeles, for which revisions are now under consideration.
The standards, which have been criticized by conservatives, suggest additions to course content to include the lives and contributions of Americans who have been underemphasized in the past. Students might be asked to assess the contributions of Prince Hall and Absalom Jones, former slaves who helped newly freed slaves in the 18th century.
Students are encouraged to bring a historical perspective to bear on the present, through debate and the use of the Socratic method, approaches long used by some of the best teachers to challenge students. They might be asked to describe the effects of the Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man on 20th-century revolutions in Mexico, Russia, China, Cuba and Vietnam.
Marshall Smith, an undersecretary of education, said the proposed standards "should be seen as the starting point of a reasonable and disciplined dialogue." Instead, they came under a heavy attack from conservatives led by Lynne V. Cheney, the former chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which originally commissioned the standards.
She and others argued that the new standards strayed too far from the subject matter of traditional American history, emphasized obscure figures in the name of political correctness and lacked the affirmative tone they say American history deserves. The authors responded that Mrs. Cheney mischaracterized the content, but the United States Senate voted 99 to 1 in January not to endorse the standards.
Yet far from the glare of the political debate, visits to six high schools in the New York metropolitan area found that history teachers in the classroom are already embracing the spirit of the standards.
Not always with success. In one city high school, a class divided into groups to analyze the New Deal but did not seem to know much about it. In a suburban school, a teacher asked students to pretend to be workers and managers in a late 19th-century factory. But none of the students knew the meanings of the words "ostentatious," "appalling," "barter," or "scab," much less about how 19th-century workers or managers might have approached labor negotiations.
For the most part, though, the new approaches to American history seemed to have a profound impact.
"When I teach American history," said Diana Javis, assistant principal at the John F. Kennedy High School in the Bronx, and a fan of the new methods, "I ask them: 'What will your grandchildren ask you about? History is a living story. It's your story.' "
She even asks students to interview their parents. "Parents love it," she said. "As one young lady was questioning her mother, the phone rang, and the girl got up to answer it. Her mother was very upset. She said, 'I'm talking about my life!' "
Steve Shultz, an assistant principal who has been teaching for more than 22 years, the last 12 at the Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, said: "Change makes us uncomfortable. But history is changing anyway. That's what history is all about."
 
 
Stuyvesant High
Debating Point: Hamilton's Vision
 From the windows of Stuyvesant High School's new building overlooking the Hudson River, students can see Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. Stuyvesant, with 2,800 students from every borough, is itself a monument to optimism and excellence, called by many the best public high school in America. All the seniors expect to go to four-year colleges. By late fall, it is not unusual to meet Ivy League scouts in class.
Two classes crushed into a room one morning for a debate over Alexander Hamilton. In Hamilton's time, Alan Krinsky, the moderator, said: "We were a rural nation, beset with problems. In 1789, North Carolina and Rhode Island reluctantly ratified the Constitution. The smart money was not on American survival. Alexander Hamilton was the first Secretary of the Treasury."
The debate: Whether or not Hamilton's vision was the right one for the time.
Speaking for Hamilton were Eugene Babenko, 16, and Christina Chan, 17. Speaking against him were Elaine Kung, 17, and Danica Lo, 16.
"Hamilton was a stand-up politician," argued Eugene. "His views, which may have been monarchist and pro-British, alienated his comrades at the Constitutional Convention, but this did not stop him." He went on to praise Hamilton's support for Federalism and his insistence that the central government assume the debts of the states.
"States like Virginia, which had paid their debts, now had to pay for others," Elaine retorted. "His economic policies benefited merchants at the expense of farmers."
"Hamilton protected an infant democracy," Christina argued.
"He protected the rich," Elaine shot back.
Ultimately, judged on evidence, reason, delivery, pertinence and quality of rebuttal, the moderator decided that the anti-Hamilton arguments had won by a narrow margin.
A few doors down, Warren Donin's African-American history class, an elective, was full, with 41 students jockeying for seats. This day's main discussion was over the word 'Holocaust,' and whether it should be used to describe the experiences of African-Americans or whether using the word trivialized the experiences of the European victims of the Nazis. The students failed to resolve the question, spilling out into the hallway at the end of the class, still passionately arguing.
When the students don't know what they think, Mr. Donin makes them take a position and defend it anyway.
"He turns everything into a question," Nick Malis, 17, said later. Is the Declaration of Independence a great document? I say, 'Sure. Why wouldn't it be?' 'Well, all 'men' are created equal. What does it mean?'
"When I come to this class. I'm happy. It's my favorite class. It's really changed the way I see."
Gary S. Laveman, the assistant principal, who oversees social studies, said of the standards' approach: "This is nothing new. I think you have to deal with American history realistically. When the Pilgrims came here, other people were living here. You're not inventing or reinventing anything. You're looking at what is here. The question is the emphasis. When Crispus Attucks gets as important as George Washington, we have a problem."
 
 
Robeson High
Crispus Attucks: Absence Noted
 It was the absence of Crispus Attucks that bothered the students in Keith Walter's class at the Paul Robeson High School for Business and Technology in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.
Students at the school are participating in the American Social History project underwritten by City University, the Aaron Diamond Foundation and the Board of Education. The project emphasizes the role of working men and women in American history.
On this morning, passing by signs ordering them not to wear hats or bandanas or Walkmen at school, the students watched "Tea Party Etiquette," a video that included the reading of an account from George Robert Twelves Hewes, a Boston shoemaker who saw the Boston Massacre and three years later took part in the Boston Tea Party.
The students found the British accents hard to understand, but they got the point that resistance to British policies came not only from George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, but also from ordinary people.
On the day that British soldiers, attacked by a mob, opened fire at what became known as the Boston Massacre, many young apprentices were in the crowd. The students looked at several renderings of this scene. Attucks appeared in only one depiction. The scruffy apprentices appeared in none.
"How can three pictures of the same event look so different?" Mr. Walter asked the class. "Why did they resort to violence?"
The students gathered in groups to talk about the questions and write their answers. The project stresses working together. The history classes are coordinated with literature classes for the same period.
"Our approach is student-centered," said Roberta Koza, assistant principal for communication arts. She teaches the literature part of the American Social History project. "We start with the self," she said. "Most of the self in this building is African-American. We're getting people to start making connections, to understand that they bring something to the table as well."
Last year, Ms. Koza taught two classes in this program, one regular class and one for honors students. To her delight, the students in the regular class, unaware they were not honors students, performed almost as well as the honors class.
"They rose to the occasion on all levels," she said. This year, all the juniors in the school are included.
 
 
Dix Hills, L.I.
Whose Liberty? Whose Tyranny?
 It was 9:10 A.M. in a comfortable schoolroom at Half Hollow Hills East High School in Dix Hills, a wealthy Long Island suburb. The dates chalked on the blackboard were 1763 and 1776. If anything looked like a traditional American history class, this was it. Then Gloria Sesso, who was among the teachers who helped draft the new national history standards, turned from the board to the students, and the illusion disappeared.
At the end of the French and Indian War, Mrs. Sesso said: "England passes the Proclamation Line of 1763. No one can go past the Appalachian Mountains. This land belongs to the Native Americans. Do you think it's a good idea?"
"It appeases the Indians," Benjamin Oren said.
"The British can't afford to keep troops there," Mrs. Sesso said. "It will create more trading privileges. She walked slowly up an aisle between the desks. "This sounds wonderful, but the colonists shout 'Tyranny!' Why do they think it belongs to them?'
"They fought for this land," one student answered.
"They thought they had the right to expand."
Mrs. Sesso stalked back to the blackboard, not satisfied.
"Why did they think the Proclamation Line was imprisoning them?" she asked. "Would you have supported the Proclamation Line? Who's right? Is England being unfair? Tyrannical?"
The answers to the questions were not in the textbook.
"It's important for someone to have control after a war, to maintain order," Brett Sherman said. "They were right in preserving order."
"Imprisoning them," said Mrs. Sesso in the tone of a district attorney. "You're really into freedom and democracy." The students shifted uneasily in their chairs.
"Next step," Mrs. Sesso said. "England has a program. They propose a stamp tax in 1765 to help pay for the war. The colonists think the Stamp Act is tyranny. Why?"
She handed out photocopies of arguments written at the time for and against it. "Who do you think has the stronger argument?" Hands shot up.
"The British case is destroyed by the colonists' case," said Duane Koh. "Everyone in England could have a say in Parliament, but a colonial person had no representative in Parliament. The colonists were right."
"The colonists were English," said Matthew Wurse, disagreeing.
"They were English, but now they're Americans," David Scheine said. "They have a different society."
"Is it tyranny?" Mrs. Sesso asked. "Patrick Henry gets up and says we should tax ourselves. All of a sudden, George Grenville is being hung in effigy. What does it mean to be hung in effigy? Is it a legitimate form of protest?"
"In Massachusetts, they go to Governor Hutchinson's house screaming 'Liberty! No stamps!' and they burn it down because he's in cahoots with the stamp tax. What's the matter?"
"It would make the British come down on them," Melissa Sharoun said. "They're being radical and challenging the social order."
"Who's exercising tyranny here?" Mrs. Sesso asked. "England or the mob burning down the house?"
There was no letup as Mrs. Sesso drew almost every student in.
"In most other classes, teachers tell you something, and you daze out," Lauren Chernick, one of Mrs. Sesso's students, said later. In history class, she said, "You're up. People want your opinion. It makes you want to understand it."
The heart of the morning's lesson, Mrs. Sesso said later, was the concept of liberty.
"I want them to identify that the nature of freedom means different things to different people," she said.
"You don't separate details from ideas," she said. "Otherwise, you're discussing hot air."
"There's a difference between education and indoctrination," she said. "I think American values are reinforced with the ability to choose and think. That's what freedom is about, making choices."
 
 
Boys and Girls High
Bitter Lessons Of a Slave Ship
 The sculpture outside the Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn looks like it might be one more security device, three gently curving slabs of concrete, side by side. Few of the 4,600 students bother to take a closer look as they go in and out of the nation's 14th largest high school.
Steve Shultz, a history teacher, goes outside with his classes and asks them to look again. Up close, they see a narrow band of bronze bas-relief showing families in chains. One figure kneels in agony. Perhaps it is a person being branded, perhaps whipped, perhaps both. The students look closely.
Then Mr. Shultz asks them to walk between the slabs, to crowd together inside the narrow curves. They see other strips of bronze filled with small faceless figures, despairing, packed together in the narrow hold of a slave ship. Some try to comfort others.
The figures have ropes around their necks. The loose ropes belong to the captives who have died. The students begin to talk. Up close, the stone reminds them of the sea, of the sky, its surface the texture of prison.
The students were not used to standing so close together, they said afterward. Because they had studied slavery, they thought about those who endured a passage to America and bondage.
Last year, the students were so moved that they sent poems, essays, drawings and letters to the sculptor, Ed Wilson, professor emeritus in art at the State University at Binghamton. They put these, with his answer, in a book they published themselves.
"History is more important than facts," Mr. Shultz said. "History is feelings. If you're doing it from a textbook, you can't capture that feeling."
Keeler Dunbar, one of Mr. Shultz's students, said: "In slavery, to give slaves knowledge was to give them power." She said the sculpture made her think "maybe they could be going through what I'm going through."
"My mother dropped out early in her third year," she said. "She always said education was No. 1. I'm going to live out some of her dreams."
Boys and Girls is a high school with few amenities, but Mr. Shultz helps his students learn to do outside research. The proposed standards also suggest that students take advantage of community resources.
Selena Judge went to the library of the New York Historical Society to look for answers to a quiz of 30 little-known history facts. "It was so fascinating," she said. "I found that Adams and Jefferson died on the same day in the same year.
"We take class discussions outside the class," she said. "Sometimes I drive my mother crazy, applying history to everything in the house."
Another student said Mr. Shultz's class had so inspired her she went "from a 34 to a 95 average in one semester."
"It's not cheerleading," Mr. Shultz said. "The kids see they're dealing with real history, their history. When you see the value, it goes beyond history."
 
The Journey, the Struggle The Tale of Our Past
 By Denetra Taylor
 
Everyday we complain about how
 hard life is
Everyday we die by the hands of our
 own race.
Everyday we are called niggers by
 people who are the same color as us.
Everyday we are on a journey.
I bring a tale unlike others those of our African sistgern and
 brothers.
Our ancestors were brought here
 against their will.
Many survuved, but many were killed.
They spent many months on a slave
 ship.
Their backs were blody from the
 white man's whip.
Bound together day and night.
Many of them never saw the light.
The men were humiliated
The women were raped
They were stripped of their humanity
 and they didn't know their own fate.
Aboard these ships were men, women
 and children.
They were treated like cargo and not
 like humans.
But this didn't stop them they went on
They strived and struggled for a new
 dawn.
For this reason we must go on and
 stay alive
We must go on, we must survive.
 Denetra Taylor, a 1994 graduate of Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, was part of a history class that produced a literary booklet about a sculpture outside the school that depicts a slave ship crossing.

A picture caption on Wednesday with an article about new approaches to teaching history in high schools misstated the subject of a student discussion in a hallway of Stuyvesant High School in New York City. The students were debating whether the word "holocaust" should apply to the experiences of African-Americans; they were not discussing the American Revolution.

HEADLINE: Mexican Aid Cutoff Pushed Into Defense Appropriations Bill

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
House and Senate conferees agreed today to a $3.1 billion supplemental defense appropriations bill requested by the White House but unexpectedly added a Republican-drafted provision that threatens to cut off all future loans and guarantees to Mexico.
The sponsor of the amendment, Representative Christopher Cox of California, said it was in retaliation for President Clinton's refusal to provide detailed information on his financial aid plan for Mexico that Congress demanded a month ago. 
 The measure, which would need the approval of the House and Senate, would take effect only if the Administration failed to make the documents available. "Given their lack of compliance so far, I am skeptical that they can comply," Mr. Cox said in a telephone interview.
The Administration was already facing a deadline of Friday to provide a broad range of documents, many of them classified, about contacts with the Mexican Government and the past use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which President Clinton drew upon to provide the aid without Congressional approval.
The fund operates under his discretion, and it is ordinarily used to stabilize the dollar in foreign exchange markets.
An Administration official said that he expected that various agencies of the Government, from the Treasury to the White House, would be in "substantial compliance" with the mandate by the weekend. "This is a bit broader," the official said, "but nothing we can't work with."
By attaching the new provision to the Pentagon money bill, the Republicans appeared to be trying to increase the pressure on the White House, which has urged quick passage of the military authorization.
But Administration officials said tonight that it was possible that the passage of the amendment could defuse some of the pressure on the Senate on a far tougher amendment that Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York has introduced to cut off all further aid to Mexico.
Senator D'Amato tried unsuccessfully to get the Senate to act on his provision, which was included in proposed midyear budget cuts, but it has not been taken up. The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate agreed tonight on a compromise to the midyear cuts, and part of the deal was an agreement to set aside Mr. D'Amato's measure.
The President moved on Jan. 31 to authorize a $20 billion loan through the Exchange Stabilization Fund to help stabilize the Mexican peso. He acted on his own after opposition mounted in Congress to an earlier plan that required its approval.
Congressional leaders initially gave Mr. Clinton's initiative its blessing, but grumbling continued among both Republicans and Democrats. And Republicans in particular have sought to embarrass the Administration by demanding inquiries into what the White House and Treasury knew of Mexico's crumbling economic condition before the peso was devalued last December.
By a 407 to 21 vote, the House of Representatives on March 1 adopted a Congressional resolution of inquiry that gave the White House until March 15 to provide all documents pertaining to the Mexican deal. The White House missed the deadline.
Members of the House and the Senate are scheduled to begin the first major recess of the 104th Congress on Friday. Amid the pending legislation is the emergency spending bill for the Pentagon that the Congressional negotiators agreed on today. The full House and Senate are expected to vote on the measure before the recess. The money is to cover the costs of unexpected operations in Haiti, Rwanda, Bosnia, Cuba and the Persian Gulf.

HEADLINE: Index of Leading Indicators Falls to Soft 0.2% Landing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
The Government's main gauge for predicting the economy fell two-tenths of 1 percent in February, the first decline since October and the biggest since mid-1993, the Commerce Department reported today.
The index of leading indicators now stands at 102.3, exactly where it was in August before settling into a pattern of small changes that offset each other. This pattern seems to have presaged the slackening from the unsustainably rapid economic growth of more than 5 percent in the final quarter of 1994. 
 "The leading indicators are right on track, not only confirming the emerging slowdown but also showing what sectors are being affected," said Gordon Richards, economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. He pointed to lower materials prices as a result of reduced demand, diminished orders for consumer goods reflecting a buildup in inventories, less optimism among shoppers because of rising interest rates and debt loads, and the toll that rates have taken on home building.
Analysts suggested that the deceleration shown in these and other indicators was likely to lead to an economic soft landing, in which growth would slow to less than 3 percent but the economy would not fall into a recession.
"You'd need to have a string of sizable declines" before worrying about recession, said Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank in New York. He said the chance of such a downturn this year remained under 5 percent.
And while some analysts believe the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates at least once more this spring, and possibly again during the summer, to keep inflation in check, today's report was quite reassuring on that score.
One reason was that the prices of items particularly sensitive to the business cycle was by far the biggest contributor to decline in the leading index. Another is that the proportion of companies reporting slower deliveries from suppliers fell slightly in February and, based on a report earlier this week, sharply in March.
This makes three straight months in which deliveries were made more speedily, a sign that industry is avoiding bottlenecks that fan inflation. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is known to pay special attention to this vendor performance indicator. The February decline was so small, however, that it was rounded to zero.
The other downward forces in the index for February were a drop in the money supply, a decline in new orders to factories for consumer products, a drop in the University of Michigan's index of consumer expectations, a shortened workweek, the issuance of fewer building permits and a rise in first-time claims for unemployment insurance.
Three components moved positively, with the surge in stock prices as represented by the Standard & Poor's 500 about twice as important as the other two combined. These lesser contributors were a rise in unfilled orders for manufactured durable goods and higher value of contracts and orders for new plants and business equipment.
The report on leading indicators had only a slight impact on the stock and bond markets, which ended the day with little change.
Companion indexes made up of components that tend to move at the same time as the overall economy or after it both moved higher at the latest reading. The index of coincident indicators rose three-tenths of 1 percent, its 13th straight advance following a two-tenths of 1 percent rise that was the first for any January since 1989.
The index of lagging indicators jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest increase in two years. This was unsettling to some analysts since it meant a second straight decline for the ratio of the coincident index to the lagging index. This ratio is regarded as a better predictor of turning points in the economy than the leading index itself.
About a year ago, in an effort to better capture cyclical changes, the department stopped applying an upward adjustment for normal economic growth but failed to persuade economists that this would make the leading index more useful as a forecasting tool.
"It's a coincident indicator at best," said Raymond A. Worseck, chief economist at A. G. Edwards, the St. Louis-based brokerage house.

HEADLINE: HOUSE VOTES TO CUT TAXES BY $189 BILLION OVER 5 YEARS AS PART OF G.O.P.'CONTRACT'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
The House tonight approved a Republican plan containing the heftiest collection of tax breaks in 14 years, overwhelming Democrats who denounced the package as a fiscally reckless gift to the nation's moneyed class.
The 246-to-188vote, largely along party lines, put the House's stamp on a plan that would reduce tax revenue by $189 billion over five years, with fully $105 billion of that in the form of a $500-a-child credit to taxpaying families. Billions of dollars more would go to breaks aimed at retirees, investors and corporations. 
 The bill now goes to a Senate, which is far less inclined toward major tax reduction this year, but whose leader, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, faces strong pressure from within his own party to follow the House's lead. The same conservative groundswell that was the engine behind the tax legislation is likely to be vital to Mr. Dole's own campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination.
But the Senate and Mr. Dole were in the shadows tonight. Today belonged to House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the architect of his party's success. He began it in symbolic fashion, reviewing a parade of circus elephants across the Capitol grounds, and ended it with the passage of what he has called the crown jewel of his party's political manifesto, the Contract with America.
"This is a good bill," Mr. Gingrich said late tonight. "It is paid for. It helps to create jobs. It strengthens families. it does what we ought to be doing. And it's the last step in the Contract."
Democrats tried four times to block or change the bill.
By a vote of 229 to 204, they failed to defeat a crucial procedural rule, setting the terms for the day's debate, that would have had the practical effect of keeping the tax bill from reaching the floor. They tried to replace it with their own substitute, written by the minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, but scores of Democrats joined Republicans to trounce that effort, 313 to 119.
They then tried to send the bill back to the Ways and Means Committee with orders to trim the breaks given wealthier taxpayers. But scores of Democrats joined Republicans to defeat that, too, 265 to 168.
Finally, they sought to block the bill on technical grounds, arguing that two clauses in the bill were actually tax increases, requiring approval by three-fifths of the House under the new House rules that Republicans changed in January with the explicit aim of discouraging tax hikes.
Three-fifths was a margin that Republicans could not hope to amass. But the chair ruled that the Democratic complaint was groundless.
With the action tonight, Republicans insured that they leave on Congress's spring break this weekend armed with the claim that they have fulfilled a fall campaign promise to vote on every item in the contract. Moreover, they will carry the rosiest sort of political news: a promise of the biggest tax break since Congress voted a $748 billion five-year tax cut in 1981, in President Ronald Reagan's first year in office.
Democrats, who showed unusual solidarity in battling the tax bill, were left to cultivate what they hope will be a major issue in the next campaign: a perception that Republicans are using their new-found power to shift billions from the poor to the rich.
All day, it was the theme of Democratic speeches.
"Finally, the end of the Contract," Representative Joseph Moakley of Massachusetts, a leading Democratic orator, said with unconcealed sarcasm, adding that for 92 days Republicans had "gutted school lunches, home heating assistance and student loans."
"And for what reason," he asked. "To pay for tax cuts for rich Americans. From the mouths of babes to the pockets of billionaires."
Republicans saw it differently. "The American people resent the fact that more of their money and more of their power and more control have been sent from where they live to this city," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the Budget Committee chairman. "They want their money given back to them."
Representative Porter J. Goss, a Florida Republican, said he and fellow Republicans were "keeping our promise: to reduce taxation, to curtail Uncle Sam's persistent, depressing reach into American pockets and wallets."
Indeed, Republicans and Democrats spent much of the day locked in statistical battle over which classes of Americans benefited most and least from the Republican tax breaks.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which produced the bill, said three-quarters of the tax cuts would go to households and the remaining 25 percent to "job creation," which is to say corporations. And three-quarters of the biggest tax break, the child credit to families, would fall to households earning less than $75,000, he said.
Democrats unfurled their own calculations: that taxpayers earning $200,000 would get an average break of $11,266 annually, while a $30,000-a-year family would net a paltry $124 a year.
Regardless, the practical effect would be to undo much of the $240 billion in higher taxes that the Clinton Administration and a Democratic Congress imposed for a five-year stretch in 1993. Republicans lost no time in pointing that out today.
"Join us in righting the wrongs of '93," cried Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip whose duty was to round up enough votes to pass the bill.
Mr. Archer said: "When this bill is passed, the tax-raising legacy of President Clinton and his party will officially be over."
The debate that began at midmorning, unrolled past sunset and droned long into the night, was at times passionate. But mostly, it bore the air of an argument with a foregone conclusion -- a chance not to change minds, but to lay out in stark terms basic differences in economic policies, and to play to powerful constituencies.
The Democratic argument was simple: We are the party of the working man; they are the party of the rich.
"For 16 years, all but the top fifth of Americans have seen their wages fall and their standard of living decay," said Mr. Gephardt of Missouri. "Each of us was elected to do the greater good, not to line the pockets of the wealthiest Americans. But that is exactly what the Republican bill does. Nearly half the benefits go to taxpayers earning $100,000 a year or more."
The Republican argument was equally spare: We are the party of economic opportunity; they represent Big Government.
"We provide fuel for the engine that pulls the train of economic growth by cutting capital gains taxes, repealing the alternative minimum tax, and by changing expensing for small business," Mr. Archer said. "The Democrats, who never met a tax they didn't hike, will again go off the deep end complaining about tax cuts. I have a simple message for the Democrats: it's not your money. It's the taxpayers' money.
The Democrats lost their best chance to thwart the tax bill at midafternoon when they lost the procedural vote on the legislative rule that set the terms of the floor debate.
All week, Mr. Gingrich and other Republican leaders had openly fretted over the prospect that the Republican factions unhappy with parts of the bill might use the procedural vote to express their dissatisfaction. One faction wanted to restrict the biggest tax break, for families with children, to middle-income taxpayers. Others opposed a clause that raised the pension contributions of Federal workers, or simply argued that granting tax breaks would make it harder to reduce the Federal deficit.
Had the groups united with Democrats to defeat the procedural rule, the tax bill would have remained bottled in committee, presumably until it was changed to make it more palatable. But when the vote came, only 9 of the 230 Republicans bolted and opposed the rule, and they were more than offset by 11 Democrats who joined the Republican majority.
The second vote was a foregone conclusion. Scores of Democrats deserted the party and joined Republicans to vote against the tax bill written by Mr. Gephardt.
Mr. Gephardt's substitute would have granted a far-smaller array of tax breaks, totaling $32 billion over five years, to help middle-income households that are facing college expenses or who are building retirement savings. Most of the cost of the tax breaks would have been offset by a $27.3 billion cut in Federal spending.
If Republicans advertised the tax cut as an investment in the nation's economic future -- some wore buttons proclaiming "Do it for our children!" -- the measure also fulfills the fondest tax-code aspirations of the party's most conservative and influential interests.
The religious right and other social conservatives won the tax credit for children. Families that care for an elderly member in their homes would receive another $500 tax credit. The party's anti-abortion wing secured a $5,000 tax credit for families earning less than $60,000 a year who adopt a child. That credit phases out at $100,000 in earnings.
The business interests who make up the party's core supporters were given more favorable terms for writing off the cost of equipment purchases. The bill does away with the alternative minimum tax, designed to catch profitable corporations that use loopholes to escape tax liability.
Investors and the financial companies that serve them won a lower rate on personal capital gains, new tax breaks for retirement accounts and an increase, to $750,000 from $600,000 in the amount of assets that can be shielded from estate and gift taxes.
According to the Treasury Department, those and other breaks would cost the Government $189 billion in lost tax revenue by 2000, and $630 billion by 2005. Republicans would pay for the first five years primarily by cutting $100 billion from the projected $2.7 trillion in spending on discretionary programs like highways, education and environmental cleanup. Which programs would be cut has yet to be decided.
Another $65 billion would come from changes in welfare programs that passed the House last month. And the remainder would be collected by raising Federal workers' pension contributions, making several temporary cuts in the Medicare program permanent, and selling off the rights to use difference frequencies of the broadcast spectrum.

Land Is Made of Gold, but Jobs Are Precious Few

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TARKWA, Ghana

 BODY:
Nine years ago, when Lucien Gerard began prospecting in the scrubby hill country on the edge of this old mining town, officials of Ghana's antiquated gold industry smirked at the thought of gullible Americans taking over what everyone here assumed to be a marginal property.
"It was sort of like a joke to them," Mr. Gerard said on the veranda of his white villa, which sits on a hilltop overlooking outsize earth movers that eat away day and night at the mountainsides below. "Look at the Americans pouring money into a low-grade area thinking they know what they are doing." 
 Indeed, the skeptics had their day in the slow early years of Mr. Gerard's company, Teberibie Goldfields, when, rather than digging for the gold nuggets commonly found just underground across much of this country, a small team of expatriates took their time methodically testing rock samples and surveying the hillsides.
But nowadays, with an annual production of more than 250,000 ounces and an estimated $350,000 a day in revenue, few feel anything but envy toward what has rapidly become Ghana's second-largest gold mining operation, ranking just behind the Lonrho corporation's huge Ashanti Goldfields Company.
"We figure we have about 6.7 million ounces of known reserves here," said Mr. Gerard, a leather-skinned Long Islander who is managing director of Teberibie, a subsidiary of the Pioneer Group, a Boston-based investment company. "That's a little bit deceptive, though, because every time we sink a new hole, we find more gold."
Teberibie's operations have been at the forefront of a mining boom that has swept much of this region, touching no place more than Ghana, whose colonial name was the Gold Coast.
Taking advantage of efforts throughout the region to open up long-closed economies, mining outfits from the United States, Canada, Australia and South Africa have rushed into the area over the last two years to start up new mines or take over old ones in Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and a handful of other West African countries.
Ashanti, a formerly state-owned mine that was privatized last May, has taken off in Ghana under the management of Lonrho, the operation's largest shareholder. Like Teberibie, its annual production has jumped. It amounts to 1.4 million ounces now, up from 300,000 ounces less than a decade ago.
The explosive growth of Ashanti has led the company to branch out and compete with big outsiders for new contracts in the region. In January, the Ghanaian giant won the rights to develop a major new mine in Mali.
"There have been mines in Ghana for hundreds of years, but in the past 10 or 12 years this has been seen as an emerging market, because the sector had been dormant for decades," said John A. Clarke, executive director of Ashanti Goldfields. "Now we are seeing other African countries decide to use their mineral sector as an engine for development. We've already been there, so we feel we have an advantage over our competitors."
As impressive as the Ashanti Goldfields record has been since privatization, mining experts say newer operations with more advanced mining methods represent the wave of the future because they require 60 percent fewer workers per ounce of production.
At Teberibie, rather than digging deep for rich veins, surface rock is fed into a conveyor-belt crusher. The resulting pebbles are washed on the plastic-draped hillsides in a cyanide solution that spurts from an intricate sprinkler system. Finally, the ore is extracted from another solution using electrolysis.
Where one might imagine the sound of pickaxes and shovels burrowing into a deep mine pit, virtually the only workers to be seen on Teberibie's 16-square-mile site are the drivers of trucks with tires as tall as a man that roll back and forth across the moonscape carrying ever more quarry to the automated crusher.
"We recover gold from rock that holds as little as a half a gram per ton," Mr. Gerard said proudly. "You don't see any gold until we're ready to pour the bars. That's what you call getting the squeak out of the pig."
But if such technological prowess cheers shareholders, many in this old mining region wonder if the march of progress is intended to deprive them of jobs.
"It used to be that when any mining site opened up, people would come from far and wide to look for work," said John Quarko, a retired manganese miner who now washes cars in the lot of Tarkwa's one motel. "It seems these new companies that are coming in are only interested in hiring watchmen and computer people."

HEADLINE: Ex-Members Of Gang See Defeat at Polls In Chicago

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 5

 BODY:
After weeks of tense and sometimes ugly campaigning, two former street gang members running for the City Council were handily defeated at the polls on Tuesday.
But today, as the backers of Mayor Richard M. Daley were celebrating his easy re-election to a third term, the young supporters of the gang candidates were promising better organized campaigns. We will keep trying, one vowed, "until we win and take us some power." 
 About a month ago, the two newcomers from the bleak housing projects and broken boulevards of the city's South Side had shaken the political establishment by forcing the incumbents into run-off elections in neighborhoods hard hit for years by unemployment, drugs and neglect.
Both the newcomers were backed by a political group with ties to the state's largest street gang, Gangster Disciples. Gang members by the dozens were recruited, trained and dressed in new shirts and ties and sent into the streets as political foot soldiers, passing out campaign literature and driving voters to the polls in a fleet of rented vans, a rolling display of democracy, Chicago style.
"We learned a lot about how politics works," said Mike Johnson, a 20-year-old volunteer in the campaign of the former gang member Wallace (Gator) Bradley. "We ain't going nowhere. We're going to keep fighting until we win and take us some power. That's the American way, right?"
One of the incumbents who survived Tuesday was Shirley Coleman of the 16th Ward. In what was considered to be a close race, Ms. Coleman beat the other former gang member, Hal Baskin, by a margin of 2 to 1. In an interview today, Ms. Coleman acknowledged the concerns and discontent of the young.
"This election," she said, "gives us a challenge to involve young people in the political process without them having turn to the gang image to do that."
Alderman Dorothy Tillman, who defeated Mr. Bradley by a margin of 2 to 1 in the Third Ward, said today that her victory was a clear message from the people to the gangs and their supporters.
"We're saying to the Bradleys of the world, leave our children alone," she said. "I'm fighting for the minds of our children. A parent can't compete with someone who is buying their children Nikes."
In addition to being a former gang member, Mr. Bradley is also a former prison inmate. In the city primary in February, he was one of five former convicts running for the City Council, a record number of convicted felons seeking public office in Chicago.
Only one of the five, Walter Burnett Jr., who served two years in prison for bank robbery, was able to win a council seat. He won over Wallace Davis 3d, the son of a former alderman who was sent to prison several years ago on corruption charges.
Mr. Burnett was endorsed and helped to victory by what is left of the once mighty Chicago Democratic machine, which also carried Mayor Daley to his victory.
Mr. Bradley and Mr. Baskin, who works for an anti-violence program in a public school, were opposed by loose coalition of regular Democrats and civil rights workers who cut their political teeth fighting City Hall. The two men were hurt at the polls by their rash statements and because of doubts about their ties to gangs, which continue to send people to the cemeteries and hospital rooms in this city.
The campaign between Mr. Bradley and Alderman Tillman had been one of the most widely watched in the city in an election when most Chicago voters stayed home.
Mr. Bradley, who is a 43-year-old grandfather, was a former enforcer for the Gangster Disciples. But he has also been heavily involved in the national gang truce movement.
Although, the police in Chicago and several other cities denounce that effort as a charade, youth workers like Autry Harrison of the Boys and Girls Club in the Robert Taylor public housing development say the truce movement and Mr. Bradley's role in it should be praised.
"There's less killing now, no doubt about it," Mr. Harrison said. "Gator is a big part of that. I wish he had won. He couldn't do no worse than who we got now."
Mr. Bradley and his supporters ordered 300 shirts, ties, skirts and blouses for his campaign workers to wear in place of their normal hooded sweat shirts and other clothes associated with the city's street gangs. Many of the young men, however, still wore their pants baggy and low around their hips.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bradley drove through his stronghold in Robert Taylor, checking on his workers.
"We don't want to do anything that will intimidate the voters," Mr. Bradley said, explaining why the ties were ordered. "We didn't have the ties for the primary. We learned."
Mr. Bradley saw a teen-age campaign worker dressed in a flowered colored shirt opened at the neck.
"You should put a tie on that," Mr. Bradley said.
"We ran out of ties," the boy said.

Cheating the Reformers: Ins and Outs of Welfare

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
SHON-DU has a little bulletin for the Mayor. He can crack down on welfare, impose all the rules he wants, fingerprint both of Shon-du's hands and put him through workfare hoops from here to his home in Brownsville and back. The Mayor can do that and more, but Shon-du will still manage to beat the system because he knows it inside out.
"They can't win," said the 27-year-old Brooklynite, who will only allow himself to be identified by his street name. "I'm ahead of them." 
 Shon-du was standing on the sunny steps of 330 Jay Street in Brooklyn one day this week, passing the time while his girlfriend applied for benefits upstairs. Jay Street is welfare central, the place where new applicants for Home Relief undergo their Employment Verification Review as part of the Giuliani administration's stepped-up effort to root out fraud and put welfare recipients to work.
Jay Street seemed the perfect place to get some firsthand testimony from people having trouble with the new system, which requires the "able bodied" on Home Relief to work 23 hours a week. Many on Home Relief are shaky people, disabled, addicted or so unfamiliar with work that workfare is anathema to them. The vast majority are legitimately in need, and adjusting to a new policy can be difficult. But on this particular day, Shon-du was at 330 Jay Street -- one of a small minority in the system, but just the kind of welfare cheat Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wants to throw off the rolls.
"I only got on welfare because it's easy," Shon-du explained. "Then, when you get used to it, you become addicted. Truly, I don't need it." Shon-du says it's been two years since he went on Home Relief, the welfare program for childless adults -- those presumed the most able to work. Shon-du can work. He is working.
IN fact, he has two jobs. "I'm loan sharking -- I won't lie," he admits, nearly two hours into our talk. He lends money to welfare clients, at 100 percent interest. "They come to me for drugs, Pampers, food, because they have no bank." He has the money for loan sharking because he saved up when he was a drug dealer and because of his other enterprise: he uses some of his welfare payments -- $176 twice a month, and another $116 a month in food stamps -- to help him buy counterfeit jeans and T-shirts.
"We go to the black market and get designer stuff," he said. "The stores in Chinatown, they got fronts." Shon-du has no peddler's license, so he borrows a van and sells his goods in Baltimore, where he won't get hassled by the police. "They see you're not selling crack, they give you some respect," he said.
He figures that if his girlfriend gets on welfare, he can get off and spend more time working.
Why not just go straight right now? "It takes money to put yourself in business." More money than he has, though he has more than he should to receive welfare -- about $8,000 stowed away, he claims.
THE Giuliani administration says it is investigating fraud more aggressively and will eventually catch up with the Shon-dus of the city. "I think we have a system with about as much integrity as you can build in," said Richard J. Schwartz, senior mayoral adviser. "We have found a significant number of people trying to defraud the system."
They have not found Shon-du yet, and he is not alone, he suggested. "A lot of these men can work," he said. "Welfare ain't enough, but it's a base."
Some of his friends are working for him, he said. All of them would lose their benefits if the authorities got wise. "But it's all off the books, so it's hard to prove." Shon-du says he keeps the welfare bureaucrats happy by keeping his appointments and doing his paper work. He even held a workfare job in the pre-Giuliani days. He worked in building maintenance for a year, hoping to get a full-time job. It never came through. Now Shon-du is on 30-day medical leave, exempt from workfare because of hemorrhoids, from which he really does suffer (though, he concedes, he can work).
"Workfare don't work, because they don't give you the job," he said. "They said in six months they'll get you a job, and then they don't. If they would give me a permanent job just mopping floors, I'd go to work. You know the best way to get rid of cheating? Guarantee every welfare recipient a job."
That's the funny thing about Shon-du. He works hard at his scams, but this former drug dealer and crack addict, smart enough to give up drugs, is also smart enough to know that he is functioning on the edges of society. For all his talk, this articulate young man with the copy of "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" under his arm and spotless new Nikes -- "I got me new shoes from hustling" -- keeps returning to his dream. It has nothing to do with hustling.
"I want into the construction union," he said. "They call me, and I'm out of here. That's my future. I just need an opportunity. I got so much power and control in my neighborhood, you'd be surprised. But I see better things in life. I'd rather be totally legitimate. I'm praying to get into the union. That's my way out of this misery."

HEADLINE: Tax-Cutters Finish First;
Gingrich Alters the Context of U.S. Politics, But the Power Lies With Clinton and Dole

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
With the passage tonight of a $189 billion tax-cut measure by the House of Representatives, Speaker Newt Gingrich has all but completed his self-decreed 100 days in the center ring of American politics.
He calls the tax bill the crowning jewel of his Contract With America. But for all his considerable achievements in the last three months, he lacks the power to assure that Americans will keep more of their paychecks. In a nice piece of political congruence, that power lies to a large degree with the two men considered most likely to compete for the White House next fall: President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader. 
 Both will inevitably hear the echoes of recent Presidential campaigns, when a permissive line on taxes has often proved fatal, as they weigh their strategies and ponder their impact on the campaign ahead. One thing is clear to them and to most other leading politicians here: Like Ronald Reagan a decade ago, Mr. Gingrich and his young followers in the House have succeeded by their boldness in drastically altering the context of American politics.
Now more than ever, it is perilous for politicians to oppose lower taxes.
"The days of tax and spend are over," said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, in today's House debate. "The days of smaller government and less taxes are at hand."
Fewer and fewer people here are disposed to argue with him.
Yes, the mood of the Senate remains less fiery than that in the House. If the Senate passes a tax-cut bill, it will almost surely be less sweeping and less tilted toward rich taxpayers. But there is now a real possibility of a Senate bill, and that in itself represents a big change in the last two weeks.
On March 19, Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who heads the Finance Committee, dismissed the idea of a tax cut with these words: "The best thing we can do for the taxpayers of this country is just try to move toward deficit reduction. And if that gets their mortgage rates down a point or two, that is more important than anything else that we can do."
Only two weeks later, he and Mr. Dole, whose views Mr. Packwood is widely believed to reflect, are singing a different song. Over the weekend Mr. Packwood talked not about a choice between cutting the deficit and cutting taxes but about the prospect of finding "room for a tax cut" within a balanced budget. Never mind what he had said before; never mind what revenue experts have said.
The country as a whole remains deeply divided on taxes. In the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, for example, 41 percent of the respondents said that the country could afford a tax cut now and 55 percent said it could not.
What has changed, of course, is the political atmosphere on Capitol Hill, and the person who has changed it the most is Newt Gingrich. When some House Republicans balked at his plan, he stood fast and said that, in the end, they would not dare to kill a tax cut.
He was right; most of the rebels caved in, some telling each other that the Senate would block the Gingrich proposal.
Perhaps, but the Senate breathes the same political air as the House. And Bob Dole cannot help but recall what happened to him in New Hampshire in 1988 as he looks forward to the first primary of his new Presidential bid, in that same state.
Seven years ago, George Bush stunned Mr. Dole, then the front-runner for the Republican nomination, by running television commercials that positioned the Senator on the "wrong" side of the tax issue in a state whose leading newspaper has made a decades-long crusade for lower taxes. The advertisements said: "Bob Dole straddled, and he just won't promise not to raise taxes. You know what that means."
Mr. Dole, beaten, lashed out at Mr. Bush on television for "lying" about his record, and he never regained his momentum. Many times since then, he has vowed that he would never allow the same thing to happen to him again, and if he does not produce a tax-cut bill this year, his rivals for the nomination, notably Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, will surely pounce on him sooner or later.
On the other hand, Mr. Dole must take care that in seeking to insulate himself against attack from the right he does not lose the moderate voters whom he would need in November. It is the classic conundrum that faces those who seek the Presidency, made all the more difficult for Mr. Dole by his work as majority leader, which requires him to take public positions on everything.
Mr. Clinton is fighting the House plan, trying to portray it as untimely and irresponsible. Today, he told reporters in an impromptu news conference, "I do not think it is wise to have a tax cut of this magnitude." He said he hoped the Senate would produce something better.
Although Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the budget director, Alice M. Rivlin, said on Tuesday that they would urge him to veto anything resembling the House measure, the President declared, "I do not want a pile of vetoes."
Nor does he want to get on the unprofitable side of the tax-cut debate. His own experience has shown him how painful that can be.
During the 1992 campaign, a rival for the Democratic nomination, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, talked of the need for pain and sacrifice to bring the deficit under control, while Mr. Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut. Mr. Clinton prevailed. But then in 1993, as President, he chose instead to back a package that, while including modest tax increases, actually made a sizeable dent in the deficit. He got no political credit for that from the voters as the Republicans drubbed his party in 1994.
So, as 1995 approaches, Mr. Clinton, too, has every reason to sign on to a tax cut that he can describe as his own moderate, responsible alternative.
Whatever the economic merits of the situation, however much all this may look like a replay of Reaganomics, which wildly inflated the national debt, the political imperative is clear: tax-cutters win elections.

HEADLINE: Stocks Close Mixed as Dow Retreats by 1.04, to 4,200.57

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday as gains in telecommunication shares and a rebound in technology issues balanced weakness in the dollar.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.04 points, at 4,200.57, after breaking 4,200 on Tuesday for the first time. Among broader market measures, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, which closed at an all-time high of 505.24 on Tuesday, eked out a gain of 0.33 point yesterday, to 505.57. The Nasdaq composite index, which includes many technology and telecommunications stocks, rose 2.60 points, to 816.32 
 On Tuesday, the Dow's advance meant the average had risen 9.6 percent so far this year. "People would have been pleased with this performance at the end of the year, much less in the first three months." said Peter DaPuzzo, senior trader at Cantor, Fitzgerald & Company. But as was evident yesterday, investors are concerned that their stocks are poised to fall after rising too far, too fast, he said.
One reason is the continuing weakness in the dollar. The currency slumped close to its postwar lows against the Japanese yen again yesterday even though the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve and other central banks stepped in to buy dollars. Later in the day, the dollar settled at 86.20 yen, unchanged from Tuesday. A weak dollar makes American stocks less attractive to foreign investors.
"The market is concerned with the dollar," said Alan Ackerman, a market strategist at Fahnestock & Company. "There is a sense that the dollar's weakness might postpone some foreign investors' commitments to equities."
Shares of telecommunications companies rose after Craig McCaw and his family said they would invest as much as $1.1 billion in Nextel Communications Inc. Technology stocks regained ground they lost on Tuesday, amid renewed confidence that company earnings will continue to grow.
"In the short term, everyone knows the techs' earnings look good," said Jim Benning, a trader at BT Brokerage. Still, "people tend to look out six months, and they're beginning to wonder how long the techs will sustain their growth -- especially if the economy starts to slow down."
Sybase Inc., which set off the Tuesday's slide in technology stocks, led the advance. The computer software company's shares plunged 41 percent on Tuesday after it announced it expected to earn 3 cents a share in the first quarter, a fraction of the 29 cents forecast by some analysts. The shares rose 1 3/8 yesterday, to 24 3/8..
Other technology stocks also recouped their losses. The Intel Corporation gained 1/16 , to 86 5/8, after dipping as low as 113/16 , and the Microsoft Corporation rose 3/4, to 70 5/8.
Adobe Systems Inc. jumped 2 1/2, to 50 3/4. Apple Computer Inc. was up 7/8, to 34 3/4.
"They've been knocking them down so much, at some point investors are going to find them reasonably priced again," Mr. Benning said.
Chemical stocks gained along with Du Pont, shares of which climbed 1 1/2, to 63 1/8, after adding 1 percent yesterday. The Seagram Company plans to announce by tomorrow an agreement to sell its 25 percent stake in Du Pont back to the company. Seagram gained 1/8, to 28 5/8.
Trading volume fell to 317.6 million, from 330.6 million on Tuesday. That is down from the average 332.2 million shares traded daily since the beginning of this year.

The Battle of the Studies: Is there competition at Nasdaq?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
IS Nasdaq a cartel, or does it just compete on some other basis than the narrowness of the spread at which stocks are quoted? Yesterday, Nasdaq and a group of market-makers released studies that they say prove that suspicions of collusion on pricing are unwarranted.
Until last year, the idea that Nasdaq was uncompetitive would have seemed absurd. There are about 400 market-makers -- brokers who stand ready to buy or sell Nasdaq stocks -- and it is common to see 10 or more of them listing prices on any given stock. 
 But then came a 1994 study by two economists, William Christie of Vanderbilt University and Paul Schultz of Ohio State University, which found that many Nasdaq stocks almost never were quoted in "odd-eighths," rather than in even-eighths like one-quarter or one-half dollar. Clearly, if some stocks are never quoted in odd-eighths, then the spread between what the dealer will pay for the stock, and what he will charge to sell it, must be at least 25 cents. The economists said they could find no other explanation for that other than to hypothesize collusion between market-makers.
That conclusion brought a Justice Department investigation and a private antitrust suit against 33 Nasdaq market-making firms. It also set Nasdaq to work sponsoring two studies, whose conclusions were released yesterday. A separate study was paid for by the market-makers. All the studies are slated to be discussed today at a conference at Vanderbilt.
"There is much less here than meets the eye," said Merton Miller, the Nobel Prize-winning economist from the University of Chicago, one of the people retained by Nasdaq for a study. "They stumbled onto a well-known phenomenon known as clustering," in which prices are more likely to be quoted at round numbers.
He said a study by him and four colleagues found similar clustering in several foreign markets. Mr. Miller conceded that there was somewhat less clustering on the New York Stock Exchange, but argued that was because specialists -- market-makers on the Big Board -- were given economic incentives to have orderly markets that moved only one-eighth of a dollar at a time.
The other study sponsored by Nasdaq was performed by Dean Furbush of Economics Inc., who argued that "the market structure makes any collusion inconceivable." He pointed to the large number of market-makers, and the ease of entry into the business, as proof. Mr. Furbush formerly worked for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Future Trading Commission.
The study for the market-makers, by Allan Kleidon of the Stanford Law School and Robert D. Willig, a Princeton economist and former official of the Justice Department's antitrust division, concluded that competitive economic factors accounted for the evident discrepancies found by Mr. Christie and Mr. Schultz, and argued that when adjusted for such factors the Big Board was just as likely to avoid odd-eighths quotes. They added that "it would be prohibitively difficult to establish and maintain collusion on Nasdaq" in part because it is so easy for others to become market-makers in a certain stock and undermine a cartel.
All of this would be so much academic quibbling if the stakes were not so high in antitrust suits. Mr. Christie, in a telephone interview, said that the latest studies were clearly brought on by the lawsuits and that "there is a distinction here between what we said, and what the lawyers said" in bringing the suits.
He said that when he and Mr. Schultz used the term collusion, they referred to it in terms of "implicit collusion" contained in a branch of economics called game theory. "It is not in anyone's best interest to narrow the spread," he said.
It is possible that when all is said and done, that might be the conclusion reached by all. For a variety of reasons, the current structure of the Nasdaq market does not provide much, if any, additional business to a market-maker who improves his quote on a stock. All other market-makers simply match the quote. There does appear to be intense competition between market-makers, but it is focused in other areas, like service, a willingness to buy or sell large blocks of stock and, in some cases, payment to brokers for sending orders to a particular market-maker.

South Korea Strives for a Market in Latin America

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: IQUITOS, Peru

 BODY:
To supply his new Daewoo dealership here, Moon Hyun Kim has drivers ferry South Korean cars over the Andes and then down jungle rivers to this bustling metropolis in the heart of the Amazon.
"In the last two years, Daewoo has opened 24 car distributors around Peru," said Mr. Kim in Lima, his command post for the South Korean conglomerate's export assault on this small market. One year after arriving from a Daewoo post in Carlstadt, N.J., the manager has peppered Peru's capital with 14 billboards, helping his company win 22 percent of the national car market. 
 Latin America is the only region of the world where the United States still ships more goods then it imports. But its status as the No. 1 exporter to the region is under heavy attack by aggressive Asian manufacturers. Asia's top five trading powers -- Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China -- recently supplanted Western Europe as Latin America's second-largest trading partner, after the United States.
Among the Asians, South Korea seems to be the most determined to carve out a chunk of a market that American manufacturers long took for granted as their own backyard. In addition to exporting cars, televisions, telephones and other consumer electronics, large South Korean companies are opening production plants in Latin America.
"In the 1950's and 1960's, Latin America was an American monopoly," Mr. Kim of Daewoo recounted in his American English learned in New Jersey. "In the 1980's, the Japanese started to take market share. Now, over the last four years, Korean manufacturers have been coming on very strong."
South Korea's drive into Latin America is partly a result of the growing reach of the Asian country's huge chaebols, or conglomerates. Flush with bumper profits, the chaebols doubled their overseas foreign investments last year, according to the Bank of Korea.
Much South Korean investment is aimed at using Mexico as a duty-free springboard into the United States market. Daewoo is preparing to assemble cars, refrigerators and washing machines in Mexico. Last year, Lucky Goldstar doubled its television production capacity at its Mexican plant.
But the South Koreans also aim to sell to Latin America, a region that in recent years has enjoyed the world's second-highest economic growth rates, after Southeast Asia.
"Normally, the Korean Government and the Korean companies have put a low priority on Latin America -- but that is changing fast," said Hyung Ho Lee, Peru director of Kotra, South Korea's official trade promotion agency.
Almost overnight -- actually, in the last 18 months -- South Korean cars have emerged as the best-selling imports in Peru, Brazil and Colombia.
"There is a great market for four-wheel drives down here, but American companies can't be bothered, so the Koreans flood the place," a United States Embassy economist complained in Lima.
In Brazil, which imports as many cars in one month as Peru imports in a year, Asia Motors and Kia Motors are the top importers. Rio de Janeiro's police department uses 50 new Kia vans. In addition, Hyundai is establishing a nationwide network of 25 dealerships. Alarmed by surging car imports, Brazil recently raised its tariff on such vehicles to 70 percent from 20 percent in February.
For Brazil, Latin America's largest market, Goldstar is planning to build a $50 million consumer electronics plant near Sao Paulo, and Samsung is planning a $32 million videocassette recorder plant in Manaus. Samsung is already producing fax machines and cellular phones in Brazil. Last month, Daewoo televisions went on sale here.
In Colombia, Daewoo started building buses last year. With thousands of South Korean cars clogging the streets of Bogota, Daewoo and Hyundai are studying the next step -- producing cars in Colombia.
In the last six months, Samsung, the largest chaebol, announced plans to build a $400 million television factory near Tijuana, Mexico; bought 15 percent of Entel, a Chilean telephone company, and started to negotiate huge purchases of gold and tin in Bolivia.
Expanding beyond cars and consumer electronics, South Korean companies are studying investments in Peru's oil, telecommunications and electricity generation sectors.
"There are very few American car companies here -- for Ford or G.M., Peru is not very important, they have a big market at home," said Mr. Kim of Daewoo. "Peru is a very small market. But for us, it is a very good market."
As ties with this Pacific Basin nation increase, South Korean money is flowing into company sponsorships and foreign aid projects -- areas that once were the domain of American companies and of the United States Government.
Goldstar, a major South Korean electronics supplier here, is the official sponsor of Alianza Lima, a club soccer team that often wins national championships. After Peru's President, Alberto K. Fujimori, visited Seoul in 1993, Peru granted South Korea a free port in return for an $18 million million grant to renovate the airport of Cuzco, Peru's major tourist destination. Not far behind the aid money, Daewoo recently opened a car dealership in Cuzco.

When the columnist Mary McGrory of The Washington Post criticized in passing "their most egregious and expensive blunder about the Soviet economy," the acting Director, Adm. William O. Studeman, huffed: "The most objectionable piece of fiction is the canard that the intelligence community's analysis of the Soviet economy was wrong. . . . The facts have been on the public record for any journalist who cares to do her homework." 
 The homework-skipper is the admiral. In 1988, when the C.I.A. made public its estimate that the Soviet G.N.P. was about half of ours, and that less than 16 percent of the Soviet economy was devoted to arms production, academics like Harry Rowan, Charles Wolf, Anders Aslund and Richard Ericson took sharp issue.
I went across the river to Director of Central Intelligence Bill Webster's office armed with their opposing view: that the Soviet G.N.P. figures were phony, that its economy was half its C.I.A.-estimated size, and that the portion going to arms was an unsustainable 30 percent, compared with 6 percent in the U.S. That would mean Moscow was on the brink of economic meltdown.
The assembled C.I.A. experts pooh-poohed this. When I suggested a "Team B" to challenge the C.I.A. evaluation, Director Webster looked toward his deputy, Robert Gates, who scornfully said, "It's the same different view." No independent assessment was permitted -- might hurt community morale, you know -- and the projections in Judy Sheldon's book "The Coming Soviet Crash" were brushed aside.
Result: The C.I.A. failed to alert the President and Congress about the inexorable Soviet collapse. The present D.C.I., in his starched white outfit wishing it all away, is in a curious state of institutional denial.
Now shift gears. After the fallout from the Ames affair and the resignation of Director Jim Woolsey, the agency faces months of headlines about its support of the Guatemalan Government -- especially its payments to an informant within the Government who has been "linked" by a Democratic Congressman to the deaths of an American citizen and an insurgent leader.
The New York Times promptly thundered editorial condemnation of the C.I.A.'s "disgraceful covert relationship with Guatemalan military thugs." President Clinton is displeased with the agency's apparent end run. Spook-bashers are salivating at the prospect of stories about abuses of secrecy, opening the way to whacks at the intelligence budget.
This has deep roots; two generations of liberals have been infuriated by our support of anti-Communist regimes in Central and South America. From the coup in 1954 that threw out Arbenz in Guatemala to the defeat of leftists in El Salvador and Nicaragua in the late 80's, C.I.A. agents carried out their assignment of helping stop the spread of Castro's Communism in our neighborhood.
Thanks partly to those C.I.A. covert operations, we won -- often messily, sometimes undemocratically, on occasion scandalously. But real war was being waged, and the alternative outcome -- Soviet-Cuban hegemony up to our Mexican border -- would have been far worse for democracy and human rights.
U.S. policy was the opposite of imperialism, and most C.I.A. operatives were not the villains or blunderers many in the media made them out to be.
Now, as the next wave of revulsion rolls in, we have to ask: Should we ever hire informers, none of whom would be played by Victor McLaglen? Do we hold ourselves responsible for all that these sleazy characters subsequently do?
Easy to say "stay clean." But if a C.I.A. operative claims he can recruit an informant inside the Hezbollah; or buy a line into the presidential palace in Pyongyang; or asks permission to guarantee safe haven to a military clique in Baghdad if a coup fails -- should the next D.C.I. insist that such inside sources not be describable as thugs?
Good ends do not justify evil means, but such dirty tricks that would save thousands of lives gain some moral coloration. Reform the C.I.A., but don't reform away its covert capacity.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Were the Government's mileage standards for cars a mistake?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
GOVERNMENT regulation is under harsh attack these days. So why has there been so little criticism of what was once among the most controversial interventions by Big Brother: corporate average fuel economy standards for new cars and trucks?
If only it were because the mileage standards worked so well that skeptics were converted to their virtues, everything would be fine. But I don't buy it. Indeed, Pietro Nivola and Robert Crandall, senior fellows at the Brookings Institution, argue in a new book, "The Extra Mile" (20th Century Fund), that the regulations have proved to be an exceptionally wasteful means of conservation. The story of how Americans learned to stop worrying and live with the mileage standards is a cautionary tale of our times. 
 The CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency) standard was born in the midst of the first energy shock of the 1970's. Higher fuel taxes were considered, but Congress rejected any increases. Only later were gasoline taxes increased and then only by token amounts.
Much of the opposition to higher taxes was at least nominally linked to fairness. It wasn't right, said Republicans and Democrats alike, to conserve oil at the expense of poor people, long- distance commuters and rural areas.
Environmentalists, however, offered a rationale for opposing taxes that touched a responsive chord among efficiency-minded economists. Consumers and auto makers were myopic, the argument went. Hardly anyone would voluntarily pay for high mileage cars, even if the savings at the pump more than offset the cost.
The average fuel economy for each auto maker's new car fleet was set at 18 miles a gallon for 1978, ramping up to 27.5 for 1985. And while Detroit initially opposed the standards, CAFE has become a widely accepted part of the regulatory landscape. "The standards did what they were supposed to do," says David L. Greene, a researcher at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
By one measure, at least, they did: The fuel efficiency of new cars has nearly doubled since the early 1970's. But by other benchmarks, the consequences are less clear-cut. Total consumption of oil is up, largely because growth in the number of vehicle-miles traveled has more than offset the improved efficiency of the auto fleet.
The explanation is obvious. More efficient cars use less fuel per mile driven and since prices at the pump (adjusted for inflation) are roughly they same as in the early 1980's, the average cost of driving an extra mile has actually fallen.
That, however, doesn't necessarily mean fuel efficiency standards were a mistake. If auto makers had not been forced to improve mileage, Americans would undoubtedly be consuming even more gasoline today. A better test, then, is how much Americans have paid in higher sticker prices and diminished performance. And here estimates range from 30 to 60 cents a gallon of fuel saved.
Is a small margin of protection against blackmail by Mideast oil exporters (along with a modest reduction in air pollution and traffic congestion) worth this price? Hard to say. What Mr. Nivolla and Mr. Crandall have no hesitation saying, however, is that the same ends could have been achieved at one-third the cost by taxing gasoline more substantially.
Recent research suggests that Americans do respond to higher fuel prices, both by driving less and by driving more efficient vehicles. What's more, the equity arguments against taxing fuel now seem overblown. James Poterba, an economist at M.I.T., estimates that outlays for gasoline are roughly proportional to total family spending over a wide range of incomes.
If mileage standards are so problematic, why isn't anyone complaining? Christopher DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute, argues that effective opposition to regulation is usually organized opposition. "Since the auto companies long ago accommodated themselves to CAFE standards," he says, nobody is carrying the banner of freedom from mileage rules, even in this deregulation-minded Congress.
And "accommodation" fails to capture the real advantage the auto companies derive from the rules. Complex regulations generally favor established corporations over newcomers, creating barriers to market entry and opportunities to make extra profits by charging uncompetitive prices. Mr. Crandall argues that the fuel standard limits the number of big, powerful cars sold each year, effectively organizing the large-car market as a cartel. It is no coincidence, then, that the industry has devoted so much attention in recent years to the luxury end of the car market.
There's a powerful lesson here. Don't just look at nominal costs and benefits when measuring the effects of regulations. For once they are on the books, there may be no way of getting rid of them even after they start doing more harm than good.

Let's Make A Deal Is First Order Of Business

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Montreal Expos began dismantling the major leagues' best team in the strike-shortened 1994 season, trading their No. 1 starting pitcher, Ken Hill, and their No. 1 relief pitcher, John Wetteland yesterday. But their general manager said the moves were not reminiscent of the San Diego Padres' self-destruction a few years ago.
The Expos, faced with paying huge salaries through the injunction-restored salary arbitration procedure, traded Wetteland to the Yankees and Hill back to the St. Louis Cardinals. They received primarily minor league players in return. 
 In another trade related to economics and salary arbitration, the Kansas City Royals sent center fielder Brian McRae to the Chicago Cubs for two minor league pitchers. Both the Expos and the Royals, seeking to slash their payrolls, may make more moves to achieve their aim.
While the trades flowed from the eight-month battle between the owners and the players over the game's economic system, they were also a sign that baseball is back. The last previous trade was the 12-player swap Dec. 28 between the Padres and the Houston Astros.
Clubs also started fueling their signing pens. The Mets signed John Franco, their free-agent reliever, for two years and $5 million, and the Baltimore Orioles signed their catcher, Chris Hoiles, to a five-year, $17.25 million contract.
The Expos won't be signing any of their players to those types of contracts. They have let go Larry Walker, their right fielder, as a free agent -- he is expected to sign with the Colorado Rockies this weekend -- and they may also trade their center fielder, Marquis Grissom.
In 1992 and 1993, the Padres, having finally reached contender status, traded or let go Fred McGriff, Gary Sheffield, Benito Santiago, Tony Fernandez, Randy Myers and Craig Lefferts because their owners wanted to slash the payroll.
"I don't think there's any comparison," Kevin Malone, the Expos' general manager, said by telephone from West Palm Beach, Fla. "You can never compare the situations. We're known for having one of the best scouting and player development systems. We have as many prospects as anyone. We can afford to trade and replace them with prospects. We feel we have quantity and quality. It's not like San Diego. We can move those guys and still keep competitive."
Malone did not boast that the Expos could expect to be as strong as their 74-40 record last year, but he said: "We'll still be good. We're going be younger and less expensive. With younger players, it's hard to predict their production. You're asking a lot when you're banking on young players. But we've done it in the past."
The Expos could have waited to trade Hill, who last season had a career-best 16-5 record, and Wetteland, who has had 105 saves the past three seasons, but they acted under a self-imposed deadline -- tomorrow, the day clubs have to tender contracts to about 100 players who are eligible for salary arbitration.
"We had to do it before the tender date," Malone said. "We could've tendered them, then tried to trade them. But we didn't want to be caught holding the ball. We had to weigh the risk of keeping them and having to pay that money. We felt we had a deadline."
Hill's 1994 salary was $2.55 million, Wetteland's $2,225,000. Salary arbitration could put them in the range of $4 million. The Royals felt equally uncomfortable with the prospect of going to arbitration with McRae, who last season batted .273 and had 28 stolen bases with a $1.9 million salary.
"Each club's going to have to do what they feel is most appropriate in their situation," Herk Robinson, the Royals' general manager, said in a telephone interview. "Brian is not an easy guy to replace, but pitching is a valuable commodity. We've got some good athletes in our organization. It was a decision we made in our best interest."
The Cubs sent the Royals Derek Wallace, who reached Class AAA last season, and Geno Morones, who was a Class A pitcher.
In returning Hill to the Cardinals, where he began his career, the Expos received pitchers Bryan Eversgerd and Kirk Bullinger and outfielder Darond Stovall. Only Eversgerd played in the majors last season, compiling a 2-3 record and a 4.52 earned run average in 40 games. The other two played in Class A.
Mel Rojas, who has substituted for Wetteland as the Expos' closer, will assume that role. The Expos will use one of their young pitchers in Hill's place or sign a lower-priced free-agent pitcher.
"I think there are some bargains on the free-agent market," Malone said.

HEADLINE: The Met: Power Meets Imagination

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
DO we build museums to honor the muse or to murder her? That question haunts the Met's new show, "The Architecture of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1870-1995." The Met's building gets bigger, its architectural style becomes grander and, as the gleaming walls of white limestone rise higher and higher, you begin to wonder whether the poor muse, that most mercurial of beings, has not been crushed beneath the massive weight of it all. But what a way to go.
Organized by Morrison H. Heckscher, the Met's curator of American decorative arts, the show traces the evolution of the museum's architecture, from the temporary quarters it once occupied on Fifth Avenue and 54th Street (Fortunoff's occupies the site today) to the sprawling labyrinth in Central Park. Presented to mark the 125th anniversary of the Met's founding, this is primarily a study in changing architectural taste. 
 Beyond that, the show depicts the dynamic interplay between power and the imagination, to use the terms the historian Lauro Martines applied to Renaissance Italy. The building of the Met paralleled New York's rise as a global economic force. Art was one of the symbols with which the city proclaimed that force and simultaneously masked it. The art museum declared the city's reverence for higher things than the money it took to build it. The show features designs by seven firms that have sought to express that dual function: to fuse power and imagination into architectural form.
More than a hundred architectural drawings, renderings and sketches depict their changing ideas about how to achieve this goal, and also their periodic efforts to give their often discordant ideas a semblance of unity. To today's eyes, however, it is the disunity of the parts that gives the building its contemporary appeal. The layering of period styles, the collision of parts that don't quite match, the occasional resurfacing of walls and floors buried beneath later additions: perhaps no other building in New York quite captures the contemporary taste for collage and fragmentation.
But the museum has always been a mirror of its time. Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould, the designers of the museum's first Central Park building, completed in 1880, used a Victorian Gothic style. The effect was rustic rather than grand, but it was sympathetic to the bridges and other picturesque structures that Vaux designed for Central Park, and it reflected the Romantic view of art as an epiphany of nature.
Serious metropolitan grandeur arrived in 1894 with a design by Richard Morris Hunt, the first American architect trained at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Victorian polychromy gave way to white limestone, Gothic windows to classical columns: at last, a Fifth Avenue dress to go with a Fifth Avenue address. With the arrival of McKim, Meade & White in 1904, the dress turned into a wardrobe. Under the supervision of Charles McKim, the museum acquired two new wings, in a subdued version of Hunt's Beaux Arts style. These extended the Fifth Avenue facade from 80th to 84th streets.
Severe black-and-white drawings present the master plan prepared in 1967 by Kevin Roche, the first architect since McKim to reconsider the museum as a whole. The drawings emphasize the low profiles of Mr. Roche's additions, designed to appease those who objected to the museum's continued expansion into the park. They also convey the master plan's admirable clarity. But they scarcely do justice to the feeling of radiance and openness that Mr. Roche brought to the Met.
The handsomest drawings in the show are those in which the muse seems to be guiding the draftsman's hand. Hunt's early sketches, in pencil on tracing paper, have the lightness of clouds; the building seems to be taking hazy shape in the architect's mind. Hugh Ferriss brings a touch of 1940's glamour to his rendering of designs by Robert O'Connor, a young architect who introduced the museum's first modernist designs, including the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium in the early 50's. Technical drawings from the late 19th century remind us that the period's technology was often more inspired than its art.
The premise of this show, which runs through Sept. 3, is that the museum's architecture is now complete. This will please park advocates, although, as one section of the show gently points out, the plan to put the museum in its present location originated with Central Park and city officials, not with the museum itself. And it was always understood that the building was not going to be a little boathouse.
The show clears up another popular misconception, about the meaning of those big rough blocks of stone that crown the columns at the museum's entrance. Are they a sublime symbol of becoming, a metaphor for the masterpiece yet to be carved? Not at all. What they symbolize is that, even in the Gilded Age, New York's economic power had limits. The stones, part of Hunt's 1894 plan, were originally supposed to be carved into sculptures; alas, the money ran out. But the happy result of this budgetary miscalculation is that the meaning of the stones is left to the viewer's imagination. And what more eloquent piece of symbolism could an art museum place atop a column? It's pleasing to think that in the encounter between power and imagination, the latter sometimes comes out on top.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S. and Allies Try to Prop Up the Dollar but Fail Again

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
Amid signs of increasing discord with its allies over the sharp fall of the dollar, the United States was joined today by Germany and Japan in largely symbolic moves to bolster the American currency. But once again, the Clinton Administration failed to reverse the dollar's decline.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin later took the unusual step of calling a small group of reporters in Washington to announce that the three countries had been acting in concert and to argue that "in effect what you have is a shared commitment to a strong dollar because it is in our interest and in the interests of the other economies of the world." 
 But the verbal commitment was considerably stronger than the financial one. Currency traders said that the repeated interventions today -- the second time in three days that central banks bought dollars in the market -- were relatively small in scale. The net result was unimpressive: The dollar was unchanged against the Japanese yen, ending the trading day in New York at 86.20 yen to the dollar, just about a half yen above its record lows set earlier this week. Against the German mark, the dollar was quoted in New York at 1.3742 marks, down from 1.3762 on Tuesday. [The dollar continued to show little change in Tokyo on Thursday.]
Choosing his words carefully, Mr. Rubin said that Washington's primary objective in trying to reverse the dollar's slide was to prevent the rising cost of imported goods -- from German machine tools to Japanese cars -- from causing higher inflation in the United States. At the same time, he insisted that the White House was not concerned that the weakness of the dollar would translate into a loss of influence for the United States, especially if other countries begin to conduct business around the world in other currencies.
At the same time, Mr. Rubin sought to put to rest a common belief among Wall Street traders that the United States did not mind a weak dollar because it helped put pressure on Japan to open its markets wider. "We have not and will not use the dollar as an instrument of trade policy," he said.
Mr. Rubin made the case that Germany and Japan were equally worried about the dollar's plight because their own goods were becoming more expensive and thus less competitive. A weaker dollar makes United States goods less costly for importers in nations whose currencies have gained in value.
But his insistence that the larger group of allies known as the Group of Seven shared the goals of the United States came in sharp contrast to statements today by several German officials, who made it clear that they saw the dollar as Washington's problem, not theirs. And the Germans argued that only Washington could overcome the dollar's weakness, chiefly by bringing the nation's budget and trade deficits under control.
"Stability begins at home," said Finance Minister Theo Waigel, Mr. Rubin's counterpart in Germany. In a particularly blunt assessment during a speech to a conference of German bankers in Bonn, Mr. Waigel said that "G-7 cooperation cannot be used to compensate for national deficiencies."
Speaking at the same conference, the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said the German central bank he oversees was reluctant to meddle with the currency markets to rectify a problem it saw as made in the U.S.A. Germany slightly lowered its interest rates last week in a move that helped make the dollar more attractive. But after causing a brief flurry the change was ignored by the markets.
"Currency stabilization depends above all on countries with weak currencies," Mr. Tietmeyer said. "They must pursue policies that create confidence."
Mr. Rubin declined to specifically respond to the comments by the German officials. It is a particularly sensitive issue in Europe, where there is growing concern that the rise of the mark to record highs could break apart the delicate relationships among European currencies -- and with it the hopes for a true economic integration of Europe. A strong mark further heightens Germany's power in the European Community, and makes it all the more difficult for other nations on the continent to attract investment and generate enough growth to reduce unemployment from painfully high levels.
Signs of discord and mixed signals are nothing new for the major allies, and they have a long history. Only rarely have such conflicting signals truly shaken markets around the world, though the stock market crash in October 1987 was partly blamed on open disagreements between the United States and Germany over the dollar on the eve of the crash.
In the latter half of the 1980's, however, the Group of Seven cooperation initiated by James Baker 3d, the Secretary of Treasury at the time, was considered much more important in maintaining international economic stability than it is today. And after today's back and forth, it is clear that Mr. Rubin cannot count on much more than grudging and half-hearted help from Germany.
And Tokyo, while more active, is unlikely to prove any more helpful. Japan's industrial leaders appear to have taken the latest bout of "endaka," or a strong yen, far more in stride than past increases of far less magnitude. Several Japanese executives have said in recent weeks that they view the current Japanese Government as so weak that there is little it could do to solve the trade problems that are causing Japan's surpluses and contributing to the weakness of the dollar.
So, once again, they are racing forward with plans to move more plants overseas, in hopes that they can adjust to a yen hovering at 85 to the dollar the same way they adjusted to one at 150, then 120 and then 100.
Mr. Rubin gave no hint that he was ready to recommend a deeper cut in the Federal deficit or a rise in interest rates to support the dollar, and he said that America's improvements in competitiveness should be enough to keep the dollar higher. "Over time," he argued, "the dollar should reflect fundamentals."
But he and the markets appeared to be talking past each other. Some on Wall Street suggested that President Clinton, in warning today that Republican efforts to cut taxes sharply risk "exploding the deficit," only fueled the fears that the Government was trying to contain.
"That's hardly the words of a guy who's buying dollars," said David F. DeRosa, director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
"This is strike three," he said. "All the efforts have failed to sustain the dollar."

Treasury Securities Gain Despite Weakness in Dollar

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities crept higher yesterday despite the continued weakness in the dollar.
Traders were taking on larger cash positions ahead of tomorrow's Government report on employment in March, traders and analysts said. 
The price of the 30-year bond rose 2/32 , to 1034/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.36 perent, from 7.37 percent on Tuesday. Shorter-maturity bill rates also performed well, down an average of 2 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Signs of a slowdown in consumer spending had only a muted impact on the market yesterday. The Commerce Department reported that its index of leading indicators, a key gauge of future economic activity, fell in February as higher interest rates put a leash to consumer spending. The index dropped two-tenths of 1 percent in February, its first decline since October and its largest since a drop of four-tenths of 1 percent in May 1993.
Analysts said weakening consumer demand was also evident in another Commerce Department report showing wholesale inventories rising a larger-than-expected 1.2 percent in February amid slower sales of big ticket items. Over all, wholesale sales were up a healthy 1 percent in February, with increases in auto and lumber inventories reflecting a drop in new home and auto sales.
While further evidence of a slowing economy usually bolsters bond prices, the market was focusing its attention on the weak dollar, which makes Treasury securities less attractive to foreign investors as well as being potentially inflationary. The market's uncertainty about the dollar is keeping a number of buyers on the sidelines.
"The market now appears to be tied to every whim of the dollar, in the short term," said Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. Still, he said, "I think right now that the long end of the market is the best of both worlds, and believe that the Fed's slowdown of the economy is achievable."
"Rates in the short end of the market would be somehwhat lower if not for the weakness in the dollar," he said.
In the municipal bond market, yields declined as investors were drawn by the higher yields offered in yesterday's $412 million bond sale by Washington State.
Many of this week's new offerings were sold at prices that produced yields below those of similar rated securities amid investor expectations that municipal bond sales will continue to fall behind last year's pace.
The Washington State 10-year bond was priced to yield 5.35 percent, or about 10 basis points more than a similar 10-year bond from Florida's $300 million offering on Tuesday. Both are rated double-A by the major rating agencies.
Traders said Washington bonds generally traded more cheaply relative to other state bonds in part because of the large amount of outstanding debt and memories of the 1980's default by the Washington Public Power Sytem on $2.25 billion of debt that was sold to construct a nuclear power system. Analysts say it remains the largest municipal bond default in history.
Good investor demand for the Washington State issue allowed the underwriters, led by Lehman Brothers, to reprice some maturities in the issue and lower yields. The maximum yield offered was 6.01 percent for bonds due in 2020, with a bond due in 2015 priced to yield 6 percent.
Serial bonds with shorter maturities were priced to yield from 4.45 percent in 1996 to 5.95 percent in 2013.
The Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal bond issues saw the average yield to maturity decline to 6.36 percent, from 6.37 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Kidnappings Soar in Latin America, Threatening Region's Stability

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
Every six hours, a kidnapping is reported in Colombia. Every four days a kidnapping is reported in Rio de Janeiro. But these two places, notorious though they may be, are just the tip of an iceberg of abductions looming over Latin America.
Huge income disparities, inefficient police forces, and near-total impunity for kidnappers are transforming Latin America into the world's top region for ransom kidnapping. The threat is inhibiting investment in the region and is forcing wealthy Latin Americans to use private guards, high walls and armored cars for protection. 
 A victims' group estimates that over the last three years $400 million has been paid in ransom in Colombia alone. But the toll goes far beyond ransom payments.
"Fear of kidnapping has cost the country many economic growth points, thousands of jobs, millions of dollars," Portafolio, a Colombian business newspaper, wrote in a recent editorial. "Who is going to invest and work to the maximum with such a high risk? It is absurd that one of the consequences of business success is to increase the probabilities of losing life, freedom, health and family peace. We cannot get out of underdevelopment with such a sword of Damocles."
Brian M. Jenkins, a deputy chairman of Kroll Associates, a New York-based company that specializes in executive security, estimates that last year Latin America had more than 6,000 kidnappings -- 4,000 in Colombia, 800 each in Mexico and Brazil, 200 each in Ecuador and Venezuela, and 100 each in Guatemala and Peru.
Latin American governments' official figures for the number of kidnappings are much lower, because of underreporting by victims' families and reluctance by governments to harm their images. "Governments seeking foreign investment and tourism have little incentive to publicize their kidnapping problems," Mr. Jenkins said.
In contrast, he said, the United States has fewer than a dozen kidnappings for ransom every year. There is concern, however, that Mexico's economic collapse could increase kidnappings there this year, and perhaps spill over into cross-border abductions.
Referring to an estimated $30 million ransom paid last June to free Alfredo Harp Helu, chairman of Mexico's largest bank, Banamex, Mr. Jenkins said that "in Mexico, the Banamex kidnapping was inspirational to criminals."
But the biggest problem remains Colombia, he said, adding, "Latin America is now the No. 1 region for kidnapping, and Colombia is the No. 1 country in the world." The list of hostages in Colombia includes nine Americans, the largest such group in the world.
Of the region's major kidnapping centers, Colombia is the only one in which political abductions play a major role. Pais Libre, a Colombian kidnapping victims' group, studied last year's kidnappings and concluded that guerrillas carried out at least half.
Peace talks with Colombian guerrillas are scheduled to resume this year after a three-year hiatus. Some Colombians speculate that the guerrillas are collecting American hostages to strengthen their hand at the negotiating table.
The guerrillas generally deny that they finance their operations through kidnappings.
"We have always been against kidnappings -- we have ordered a few political detentions," Jorge Briceno, the Revolutionary Armed Forces' spokesman for peace talks, told a Bogota newspaper, El Espectador, in February. "But we have nothing to do with economic kidnappings."
But a different voice was heard recently from the guerrillas when Pais Libre played a tape recording that it said was a radio conversation last August between a guerrilla commander and Wilma Garzon, the mother of a 31-year-old farm manager kidnapped on Oct. 30, 1993.
"The guy's already dead so we are going to charge you 10 million pesos to deliver his corpse," the man identified as the guerrilla commander said. "If you don't want it that way, we'll throw him in a hole somewhere."
Mrs. Garzon paid the money -- about $14,000 at the time -- but never received her son's body.
"The going price for an oil executive is $200,000," said Guy Squires, who has been working here for over a year to coordinate efforts to free five of the American hostages, missionaries for New Tribes Mission, a Florida-based Protestant evangelical group.
Guerrillas for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest guerrilla group, have demanded $5 million for the release of three of the missionaries, who were seized in Panama in 1993 and later brought into Colombia.
"We are a mission and we cannot afford to pay ransoms," said Mr. Squires, who was last in contact with the guerrillas by radio a year ago.
Mr. Squires and friends of other Americans kidnapped in Colombia complain of the low level of interest by the United States.
"We were passed off to aides and not allowed to speak to Senators," Mr. Squires said of his trips to Washington with wives of several kidnapped missionaries.
His concern is echoed by Eugene Harter, a writer who is a friend of Thomas R. Hargrove, a journalist who is one of the nine hostages.
Last September, the Revolutionary Armed Forces kidnapped Mr. Hargrove, an editor of scientific publications at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, an international development agency based in Cali, Colombia. The kidnappers demanded a ransom, reportedly $6 million, but center officials said they would not pay any ransom.
"His situation is just as big as the Beirut hostage situation," Mr. Harter said, contending that the plight of the American kidnapping victims in Colombia is largely unknown in the United States.
State Department officials have met with the family members and say only that they are following the cases closely. The State Department has issued a recommendation that Americans who visit the country remain in the major cities and avoid rural areas.
Security experts say most victims are seized from their cars. Some kidnappers use roadblocks, but others use their cars to block a victim's car and force it to come to a stop.
In the Barra neighborhood in Rio, the local authorities plan to construct gates to close access roads to this affluent neighborhood of 500,000 people. Barra has suffered 100 kidnappings since 1991. Critics liken the gates to medieval drawbridges.
Of the 14,000 Colombians estimated to have taken part in kidnappings last year, the police arrested or killed 350 -- fewer than 3 percent. Of 3,625 reported cases of kidnapping in Colombia in the last three years, the police rescued only 11 percent of hostages. For these crimes, only 70 people were arrested, tried and sentenced.
"It's become a wildfire industry -- so profitable that I don't see any end in sight," said Francisco Santos, a newspaper editor and former kidnapping victim who is president of Pais Libre.
To try to stop kidnappings, Ecuador created a separate anti-kidnapping police force in January, Rio de Janeiro doubled its force in February, and Colombia is adding 130 detectives to its anti-kidnapping unit.
Colombia's Defense Minister, Fernando Botero Zia, said in an interview that the Government was reorganizing anti-kidnapping squads and creating a national information bank to help catch kidnappers. He contended that the Government had a better success rate with solving urban kidnappings than the overall statistics would indicate.
"The Government is trying to make a great effort to control the problem," he said. "As we have more success against the guerrillas, we will have more success against kidnapping."
But in Colombia, Brazil and Mexico, some detectives have fallen victim to the temptation of stealing ransoms they were sent to pay in an effort to catch kidnappers. Others routinely kill kidnappers on the spot when they find them, often undercutting their own investigations.
"Police here like to fire their guns -- what they need is gray matter and investigative know-how," said Carlos Fragoso, a Rio de Janeiro criminal lawyer who has negotiated several hostage cases. "When the police kill the lowest level criminals at the hiding places, they never get to the leaders of the kidnap gangs."
Some business people are not waiting for the new police units to learn their jobs. "We are armoring an average of 10 cars a month," said Humberto Neiva, director of Riva, a Rio security company.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Welfare: Time Limits -- A special report.;
Iowa Plan Tries to Cut Off the Cash

DATELINE: DES MOINES

 BODY:
For all the tough talk around the country about cutting the Gordian knot of welfare dependency, Iowa is the only state that has cut off cash benefits to families because a parent refused to go to work or take other steps to get off welfare.
Even here, the state started removing parents and their children from the rolls only six months ago. Iowa has been unable to determine what became of most of the 881 families who have lost benefits so far. Some recipients say the new rules have prodded them to work, while others seem to have been pushed off a precipice. 
 Kathy Brundidge, 29, and a mother of three, was jolted from an 11-year reliance on welfare by the fear of losing her benefits. She now has a job checking people's eyes and fitting them for glasses. "If I didn't go to work, I was going to lose everything I was living off of," she explained.
But another woman, who got a job in a factory making boxes, was fired when she had to stay home with her sick 5-year-old. Then, when her benefits were reduced, she was evicted and fled to Ohio to avoid losing her children to foster care.
"Several churches went together to buy her bus fare," said Sharon Baker, director of Cross Ministries in Des Moines, who declined to name the mother to protect her privacy.
Republicans in Congress acknowledge that there is as yet no reliable evidence from Iowa or elsewhere about how drastic changes like time limits and cutoffs will affect the 4.5 million adults and 9.4 million children receiving cash payments nationally through Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program. But they say the time has come to transform a system that many in both parties feel has sapped people of their will to work and trapped generations of children in poverty.
As a centerpiece of its sweeping overhaul of social welfare laws, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives last month passed a bill going well beyond what is being tried in Iowa.
Iowa now denies cash welfare benefits to families if parents refuse to sign or comply with agreements that specify what they will do to get off welfare and how long they have to do it. Some are given years to attend college, while others agree to find a job within months. The state sets no absolute limit on how long a family can receive welfare.
In contrast, the House bill decrees that, with few exceptions, families that received welfare for a lifetime total of five years would never again be eligible for Federal welfare payments.
Republican legislators predict that most recipients will become breadwinners if they have no alternative. "Welfare is always there as a crutch," said Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. "Sometimes you knock the crutches out, and people will fall down. But they'll learn to walk."
But Democrats say an arbitrary time limit is too risky. "We don't know enough to say 'five years and you're out,' " said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. "It's possible you'll do intense damage to children."
Advocates for the poor fear that millions of families could wind up homeless, while destitute children flood already overwhelmed foster-care programs. And in Iowa, where a single parent must participate in welfare-to-work programs once her youngest child is 6 months old, some recipients worry that their children will be worse off.
"I don't see where working at minimum wage or barely above is going to help us," said Brenda Aldrich, a former bartender and mother of Gabriel, 6, and Blake, 2. Ms. Aldrich lost all her cash benefits because she did not cooperate with the state. She thought it was more important to go to her older son's ball games and tend to her little one, who is afraid of strangers.
The House welfare bill will be taken up soon in the Senate, probably in May. Key Republican senators have said that they agree with the basic thrust of the bill, which is to give states near-total control of most welfare programs and relieve them of the obligation to match Federal welfare spending.
Ten states other than Iowa have begun their own experiments with time limits on welfare, but those limits have not yet run out. This year, Virginia and Massachusetts passed laws to limit able-bodied welfare recipients to two years of benefits in any five-year period. Both states will have to win Federal approval before carrying out their plans.
Under the current system, about half of all A.F.D.C. recipients at any given time have spent more than five years on welfare, according to studies by LaDonna A. Pavetti, a researcher at the Urban Institute in Washington. Seven in 10 recipients have spent more than two years on welfare.
A profile of long-term recipients suggests just how hard it will be for many to find and keep jobs, especially ones that pay enough to support a family. A large share of chronic welfare mothers, surveys show, bore children while they were in their teens, never graduated from high school, have never been married and have had little or no work experience.
Contrary to the stereotype of the welfare mother who goes on the dole for years, recent research shows that many women cycle between welfare and low-wage jobs they quickly quit or lose. The reasons include conflicts with bosses, loss of child care, layoffs, and boyfriends jealous of the women's new-found financial independence.
 
The Iowa Experiment
Trying to Adjust To a New System

As part of a broader effort to give states leeway to experiment with welfare, in 1993 the Clinton Administration gave Iowa permission to begin a statewide test of a new approach.
Those who do not find jobs, participate in education and training programs, or take other required steps toward working are given three months more of full benefits, three months of reduced benefits and then are cut off altogether.
The state softens the impact of the rules by allowing families who sign the agreements to get off welfare, but then try and fail, to negotiate for more time. It also permits families to re-apply for welfare six months after they are cut off.
"There are people who will forever need assistance," said Deb Bingaman, the state's welfare-experiment coordinator. "And they will continue to get benefits if they make an effort to become self-sufficient. It may be 10 hours a week of volunteer work is the best they can do."
The state has tried to track the families who have been cut off, but public-health nurses sent out on visits have been unable to contact more than half of them.
"We get letters back with no forwarding address," said Mary Ann Riensche, patient-care coordinator at the Visiting Nurse Association in Waterloo. "We go by the house, and it's vacant. They're just plain gone."
The threat of losing all cash benefits has given some parents an urgent shove into the job market. In January, about 30 percent of recipients participating in Iowa's new initiative were working, generally part time. In comparison, 17 percent of those in a control group receiving welfare the old way, without the threat of a cutoff, were working.
But while the program has put more people to work, it has also led to homelessness and family breakup for at least some.
Others have simply moved to states that have looser rules -- a phenomenon that could increase if Congress allows the states to develop 50 different sets of welfare rules. The Visiting Nurse Association in Dubuque found that 13 percent of the families they tried to contact had left the state.
Still other families have turned to charities and other public-aid programs for help. Jim and Debbie Baker and their three young children lost their benefits five months ago but wangled a temporary rent subsidy from the state's general relief program. Mr. Baker, a construction worker, has applied for unemployment insurance. The Bakers, who live in Cedar Rapids and are not related to Sharon Baker of the church group, recently got a disconnect notice from the electric company.
"I swear on the Bible I didn't receive the papers from Promise Jobs," Mrs. Baker said, referring to the cutoff notice from the state's jobs program for welfare recipients. "I would have done what they wanted me to if I got them."
All the families in Iowa's program are struggling to adapt to a bureaucratic culture that has suddenly changed from one that dispenses checks to one that puts recipients to work.
"Before, they'd let you sit there 'til your children were in school," said Ms. Aldrich, 33, the former bartender. Never married, she has been a "full-time mother and father" since her oldest son Gabriel was born 6 years ago.
At first Ms. Aldrich, of Sioux City, did not take the state seriously when she was notified that her benefits would stop on April 1. As the date approached, her attention was more focused. She knew that she could not count on Gabriel's father, who was convicted of selling drugs and just got out of prison. Two-year-old Blake's father pays $220 a month in child support.
"I suppose I'll get a job," she mused recently, the newspaper classified advertisements at her elbow. "Maybe I'll call my worker and see if I can go back and fix it." She paused for second thoughts, then added, "We'll definitely have to look harder than I thought for this job."
Ms. Brundidge is among those who quickly adapted to the new rules. She first became pregnant when she was a high school senior and had her three children by a man who has worked off and on at fast-food restaurants. She never married him, and he never supported them financially.
"I had gotten myself in a mode where my daughter was 4 and I didn't want to work 'til she was 6 or 7," said Ms. Brundidge, of Cedar Rapids. "The new program didn't give me that option."
She started with a $5-an-hour factory job, but quit when the man she is now engaged to marry fell off a roof and her employer refused to give her permission to go home. "For $5 an hour, your family comes first," she said.
Her caseworker then put Ms. Brundidge to work as a volunteer in a job-placement office. There, Ms. Brundidge spotted a listing for an optician's position. She landed the full-time $6.50-an-hour job, which also offered training. She expects a raise to $7 soon, an amount "that would put me ahead."
But some mothers wonder how long their low-wage jobs will last.
Cherrie Sharkey, 26, has been on and off welfare for six years. Her caseworker told her that she had to report for a job-search and resume-writing program, but the hassle of arranging child care for Benjamin, 6, Cheena, 5, and Alexandria, 3, seemed to Ms. Sharkey more trouble than it was worth to do something that paid nothing.
"I got a job on my own," she said. "I didn't have time to do what they wanted me to."
She now works for $5.50 an hour flipping burgers and making pizzas at Mario's in Dubuque. Her take-home pay is less than $300 a week. And she has no confidence that her employer will long tolerate her lateness or absences when her children are sick.
"I was two hours late one snowy day because the kids had a two-hour delay for school," she said. "I got yelled at, but what can I do? I'm a single mother, and I don't have anyone to depend on."
 
The National Challenge
Untried Changes, Big Uncertainties
 President Clinton has crusaded for a two-year time limit on welfare benefits, but proposed a bill that would have dropped families from the rolls only if the parents did not try to find jobs. His bill also provided billions of dollars in new training, work and child-care programs.
The House bill gives states no extra money for job preparation or to support child care for working mothers. Instead, the states would get a block grant to divide as they wish. The grant would not automatically grow in hard times.
Some House Republican leaders are hedging about how they would cope with the casualties of their approach. A few months ago, Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia was touting orphanages as a solution for the children of welfare recipients kicked off the rolls.
But Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, chairman of the subcommittee that produced the House welfare bill, recently downplayed the orphanage option, saying in an interview that the Speaker had just been making "an offhand remark." Mr. Shaw said Congress would reconsider the legislation if it had tragic consequences.
"We're not going to put up with thousands of children going into foster care or with people starving," he said.
Mr. Shaw's tentativeness says much about the enormous uncertainties facing the nation if it goes forward with untried, systemic changes in welfare.
Several of the state experiments with time limits are exceedingly modest. For example, in Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, boasts of drawing a line in the sand for welfare mothers: two years, and you're off the rolls for good. But Wisconsin is only trying the approach in two small counties that have very low unemployment rates and a total welfare caseload of about 900, covering only 1 percent of the state's welfare recipients.
Mr. Thompson has warned that welfare overhaul will not save money in the short run, and may cost more: The state has increased its spending for counseling, job training, child care and transportation, and it may subsidize private employers who hire welfare mothers.
So far, Iowa's program has cost more than the old system, officials say. While the state is spending slightly less on grants to families, and the caseload has begun to decline somewhat, it is spending more on education, training, transportation and child care.
And Iowa, which has the third lowest unemployment rate in the nation and none of its largest cities, does not face the densely concentrated urban poverty of Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles or New York City. For example, there are only about 37,000 families on welfare in Iowa, compared with more than 300,000 in New York City.
Still, state officials believe that Iowa will eventually save money. They also point proudly to the rising proportion of recipients who are working.
"We're attempting to change a culture, not only of those who have received welfare, but of the people working with people on welfare," said Charles Palmer, director of the state's Department of Human Services.
In hope of helping parents qualify for better jobs, Iowa is trying to upgrade the skills of many welfare recipients, though studies have found limited results. The state has placed 4,000 people in education programs. Another 4,000 are wait-listed indefinitely.
Iowa has also provided somewhat more liberal allowances for child care. Still, state officials acknowledge that some women are finding it difficult to get off welfare because of a shortage of affordable child care in some areas. And the subsidy itself is limited.
For example, a single mother of two who works full time at $5 an hour still qualifies for a small welfare check, but will get only an extra $22 a week per child to pay for day care -- which costs $40 to $120 a week.
 
The Families
Staying Together, Breaking Apart
 A garden-variety problem with day care set off a disastrous chain of events that led to one Iowa family's undoing. Mrs. Baker, who heads a philanthropic alliance of Presbyterian churches, tried unsuccessfully to help the family and told their story.
The mother had signed an agreement with the state to go to college, which she believed offered her the best route to a job that paid enough to support her three children. She was put on a waiting list.
Her caseworker told her she would have to get a job in the meantime. A few weeks after she began working for $5.50 an hour, her 5-year-old got sick. The boy was running a fever and could not go to the day-care center.
The worker then told the mother that the only acceptable excuse for missing work was a doctor's note saying she herself was ill. So she left her son with a neighbor. When she came home, she found him alone and untended.
She stayed home with him and was fired from her job. Her welfare benefits were then reduced because she had not done what her worker required. Unable to pay the rent, the family was evicted, Mrs. Baker said, and slept in a friend's car.
Because of the family's homelessness, one of the children's teachers reported them to child-protection services. The child-protection worker told the mother that her children would be placed in foster care if she could not provide for them.
Mrs. Baker said she tried to persuade the woman to fight the system, but could not overcome a mother's fear of losing her children. All the woman could think of was escape to Ohio where she had a sister. This family became one of those that simply disappeared off the state's radar screen.
Sharon Brooks's son is another such case.
He had first gone on welfare four years ago, after he seriously injured his back at a construction site where he was working. By then, his wife had left the family. The son, who is 33, has a learning disability and cannot read beyond a fourth-grade level. Unable to hold down a manual labor job or to compete for more skilled work, he remained unemployed.
He and his three daughters were living with Mrs. Brooks in Des Moines when he began getting letters from the state about the new welfare rules. Mrs. Brooks, who has worked for 26 years at an anti-poverty agency, pleaded with her son to open the letters, but he told her to stay out of his business.
"It was a way of not facing the issue," she said. He became increasingly depressed, sometimes going on long crying jags. On Oct. 1, he and his children were among the first families to lose all cash benefits.
"For him, that loss was the straw that broke the camel's back," Mrs. Brooks said. "He didn't know how to deal with it. He saw no way out. Emotionally, he was not able to deal with the system he was in."
When he refused to seek counseling for his anger and depression, his mother told him he could no longer live in her home. He is homeless now, sleeping in his car or in shelters.
His three girls still live with their grandmother. The oldest, who is 11, told Mrs. Brooks that she hated her life and wished she were dead. "I'm kind of sad 'cause we don't have no parents around," the girl said recently to a visiting reporter.
The youngest daughter is having the hardest time. One recent chilly evening, the 8-year-old dressed defiantly for church in pink shorts and a skimpy T-shirt. Her grandmother told her she could not go unless she changed into something warmer. The girl stomped to her bedroom and slammed the door.
"I don't care," she screamed. "I hate you. I hate you. Liar. Liar. Liar."
When her older sisters boarded the church van, the youngest stayed behind, raging against forces she could not understand.

Chart: "RETHINKING WELFARE: Setting Limits"
 THE GOAL -- To fight welfare dependency and force all recipients to seek work.
 THE PROPOSAL -- In a bill that passed the House and is now before the Senate, families could receive cash payments for no more than five years.
 CURRENT LAW -- No Federal time limits.
 STATE EXPERIENCE -- Eleven states have begun experiments with time limits, and Iowa has recently cut off people who refuse to take job training and prepare to get off welfare, but no state has yet implimented an absolute time limit and the consequences are uncertain.
 SAVINGS -- A time limit would eventually slash the rolls and cut costs. But some recipients may end up on other local, state or Federal aid programs. (pg. B6)

HEADLINE: Christian Pineau, French Hero And Foreign Minister, Dies at 90

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Christian Pineau, a leader of the French Resistance who became one of postwar France's most active Foreign Ministers, died on Wednesday in Paris. He was 90 and had homes in Paris and Vence, a resort in the French Alps.
A gentlemanly politician and Socialist, he served as Foreign Minister from 1956 to 1958. During his tenure he signed the Treaty of Rome, one of the foundations on which the European Union is built, and spoke for France to a skeptical world in the Suez War in 1956. 
 He also sought solutions to France's colonial problems and worked to mitigate the cold war by shifting the focus from military confrontation to closer economic links.
Christian Paul Francis Pineau was born in Chaumont-en-Bassigny, Haute-Marne, the son of an Army colonel. His father died when he was young and his mother married Jean Giraudoux, the playwright.
He earned degrees in political science and law, and went to work for the Bank of France.
With the German occupation, he helped to found an underground newspaper, Liberation, and went on secret missions as a liaison between occupied France and Gen. Charles de Gaulle's Free French headquarters in London. He was captured twice by the Nazis in 1943. Tortured by the Gestapo and sentenced to death, he escaped the firing squad with forged identification papers and he was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp. He was liberated by American soldiers in 1945.
In the postwar Fourth Republic, he turned to politics and was elected to the National Assembly. His first Government position, his appointment as Food Supply Minister, came barely three weeks after his release from Buchenwald. He held a variety of cabinet posts in a succession of short-lived Governments. Just before he took charge of the Foreign Ministry he was designated Prime Minister but failed to cobble together a cabinet.
A courteous, well-dressed and modest man of distinguished bearing, Mr. Pineau once said the motto of his foreign policy was "negotiate, negotiate again, negotiate always."
He wrote children's books as well as memoirs of the Resistance, the Suez crisis, the Treaty of Rome and Nikita S. Khrushchev. His first children's book was titled "Tales From I Don't Know When" and dedicated to Giraudoux, his stepfather.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
An American REIT Will Invest in Mexico

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 6

 BODY:
The Mexican Government has approved a plan to allow an American real estate trust to invest in Mexican properties for the first time.
The trust, based in San Diego, hopes to profit from depressed Mexican real estate prices and demand for industrial space along the border. It plans to invest about $250 million from American corporate and public pension funds in Mexico over the next three years. 
 Such real estate investments are typically held for 15 years or more, real estate experts here and in the United States say. The money would provide the kind of long-term direct investment that the Mexican Government hopes will prevent a recurrence of the current economic crisis that developed when short-term investments were withdrawn in panic late last year.
Real estate projects in Mexico tend to be riskier than similar projects in the United States, but they can generate greater returns.
"We believe that Mexico is going to be very successful, and that whatever risk is involved will be offset by much higher yields," said Michael J. Dunigan, a San Diego real estate investor who is one of the principals in the newly former trust, which is called the Mexus Real Estate Investment Trust.
Until recently in Mexico, complicated rules restricted foreign ownership of land and property, making it difficult for Americans to enter the real estate market. But a ruling by the Mexican Finance Ministry last Friday cleared the way for real estate trusts to own property.
Alejandro Beuchot, executive vice president of the Mexican Investment Board, which worked with the Mexus group over the last two years to get the Government's approval, said that many American manufacturing plants situated in Mexico along the border had increased their export production this year and were looking to expand.
"But they can't because of the lack of capital caused by the crisis," Mr. Beuchot said. "The trust provides a great opportunity to raise money for the expansions."
Real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, have existed in the United States since 1960, but until now there has not been one totally dedicated to investments in a single foreign country.
The trusts essentially function as mutual funds for the real estate market, permitting a manager to pull together money from many different sources and invest it in various projects.
The records of such trusts have been spotty. Many failed to provide their promised returns and were hurt by the real estate collapse of the late 1980's.
Mr. Dunigan has worked in real estate investment and finance for 25 years. One of his two partners is Malin Burnham, an owner of the San Diego Padres who is chairman of the First National Bank of San Diego and head of Burnham Pacific Properties, a real estate investment trust. The other partner is George Codling, a San Diego developer.
Mr. Dunigan said two corporate pension funds and one trust fund of a public institution had already expressed interest in Mexican property investments. He said he was focusing on properties in Mexico City and along the border.

HEADLINE: Tax-Cutters and the '96 Election

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
With the approval on Wednesday night of a $189 billion tax cut by the House of Representatives, Speaker Newt Gingrich has all but completed his self-decreed 100 days in the center ring of American politics.
He calls the tax bill the crowning jewel of his Contract With America. But for all his considerable achievements in the last three months, he lacks the power to assure that Americans will keep more of their paychecks. In a nice piece of political congruence, that power lies mostly with the two men considered most likely to compete for the White House next fall: President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader. 
Both will inevitably hear the echoes of recent Presidential campaigns, when a permissive line on taxes has often proved fatal, as they weigh their strategies and ponder their impact on the campaign ahead. One thing is clear to them and to most other leading politicians here: Like Ronald Reagan a decade ago, Mr. Gingrich and his young followers in the House have succeeded by their boldness in drastically altering the context of American politics.
Now more than ever, it is perilous for politicians to oppose lower taxes.
"The days of tax and spend are over," said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, in Wednesday's long House debate. "The days of smaller government and less taxes are at hand."
Fewer and fewer people here are disposed to argue with him.
Yes, the mood of the Senate remains less fiery than that in the House. If the Senate passes a tax-cut bill, it will almost surely be less sweeping and less tilted toward rich taxpayers. But there is now a real possibility of a Senate bill, and that in itself represents a big change in the last two weeks.
On March 19, Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who heads the Finance Committee, dismissed the idea of a tax cut with these words: "The best thing we can do for the taxpayers of this country is just try to move toward deficit reduction. And if that gets their mortgage rates down a point or two, that is more important than anything else that we can do."
Only two weeks later, he and Mr. Dole, whose views Mr. Packwood usually reflects, are singing a different song. Over the weekend Mr. Packwood talked not about a choice between cutting the deficit and cutting taxes, but about the prospect of finding "room for a tax cut" within a balanced budget. Never mind what he had said before; never mind what revenue experts have said.
The country as a whole remains deeply divided on taxes. In the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, for example, 41 percent of the respondents said that the country could afford a tax cut now and 55 percent said it could not.
What has changed, of course, is the political atmosphere on Capitol Hill, and the person who has changed it the most is Newt Gingrich. When some House Republicans balked at his tax plan, he stood fast and said that, in the end, they would not dare to kill a tax cut.
He was right; most of the rebels caved in, some telling one another that the Senate would eventually block the Gingrich proposal.
Perhaps, but the Senate breathes the same political air as the House. And Bob Dole cannot help but recall what happened to him in New Hampshire in 1988 as he looks forward to the first primary of his new Presidential bid, in that same state.
Seven years ago, George Bush stunned Mr. Dole, then the front-runner for the Republican nomination, by running television commercials that positioned the Senator on the "wrong" side of the tax issue in a state whose leading newspaper has made a decades-long crusade for lower taxes. The advertisements said: "Bob Dole straddled, and he just won't promise not to raise taxes. You know what that means."
Mr. Dole, beaten, lashed out at Mr. Bush on television for "lying" about his record, and he never regained his momentum. Many times since then, he has vowed that he would never allow the same thing to happen to him again, and if he does not produce a tax-cut bill this year, his rivals for the nomination, notably Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, will surely pounce on him sooner or later.
On the other hand, Mr. Dole must take care that in seeking to insulate himself against attack from the right he does not lose the moderate voters whom he would need in November. It is the classic conundrum that faces those who seek the Presidency, made all the more difficult for Mr. Dole by his work as majority leader, which requires him to take public positions on everything.
Mr. Clinton is fighting the House plan, trying to portray it as untimely and irresponsible. This week he told reporters in an impromptu news conference, "I do not think it is wise to have a tax cut of this magnitude." He said he hoped the Senate would produce something better.
Although Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the budget director, Alice M. Rivlin, said on Tuesday that they would urge him to veto anything resembling the House measure, the President declared, "I do not want a pile of vetoes."
Nor does he want to get on the unprofitable side of the tax-cut debate. His own experience has shown him how painful that can be.
During the 1992 campaign, a rival for the Democratic nomination, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, talked of the need for pain and sacrifice to bring the deficit under control, while Mr. Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut. Mr. Clinton prevailed. But then in 1993, as President, he chose instead to back a package that, while including modest tax increases, actually made a sizeable dent in the deficit. He got no political credit for that from the voters as the Republicans drubbed his party in 1994.
So, as 1996 approaches, Mr. Clinton, too, has every reason to sign on to a tax cut that he can present as his own moderate, responsible alternative to Republican "wild men.".
Whatever the economic merits of the situation, however much all this may look like a replay of Reaganomics, which wildly inflated the national debt, the political imperative is clear: tax-cutters win elections.

HEADLINE: Major Retailers' Sales in March Were Weaker Than Expected

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In a sign that higher interest rates may be pinching consumers, the big retailers reported March sales figures yesterday that were weaker than expected.
Analysts and merchandisers alike had been prepared for a poor year-over-year comparison, if only because Easter fell much earlier in 1994 than it does this year. As a consequence, some sales that occurred last year in late March may be pushed into early April this year. 
 Easter-related buying trends is much more important for apparel makers than for so-called hard goods merchandisers, analysts said. Sales at major retail clothing chains were poor last month, continuing a trend that has been in place for months.
"Expenditures for home-oriented goods, like furnishings and consumer electronics, have been posting healthy gains," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, a monthly newsletter. But "there is a very distinct slowdown for spending in clothing."
But analysts said a possible shift in holiday buying did little to account for the steep drop in the sales figures reported yesterday.
"Even adjusting for the lateness of Easter, the numbers are crummy," said Robert Buchanan, a senior vice president at NatWest Securities.
"The Federal Reserve Board has been raising interest rates for a year, and wants to slow the consumer sector. There is no question in my mind that we are in the midst of a consumer slowdown."
A measure of overall sales performance at major retailers, the Goldman Sachs Retail Composite Index, rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month, compared with a 12.6 percent increase in March 1994. In February, the index, a weighted average of the same-store sales of 50 retailers, rose 3.5 percent.
Among the retailers, same-store sales fell 5.5 percent at J. C. Penney, 2.5 percent at Federated Department Stores and nine-tenths of 1 percent at Ann Taylor, according to Goldman, Sachs. Still, Kmart rose 5.5 percent, while Wal-Mart gained 2.8 percent.
Stock market investors reacted poorly to the sales figures, and pushed down prices of many retailers in heavy trading.
Among the biggest movers were the Dayton Hudson Corporation, whose stock fell $2.25, to $68.75. Ann Taylor fell $3.75, to $33. And Circuit City shares dropped $1.75, to $25.25.
Richard N. Baum, a retailing analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said the market's reaction was "a little bit schizophrenic."
"As negative as the market was to the March numbers, we think there will be a sales rebound in April due to Easter, and the stocks will have an upward move," he said.
Despite a possible rebound in April, Mr. Baum said "1995 will be a difficult year for retailers."
Mr. Baum and others are pessimistic about a possible surge in spending because for the last several months real average hourly wages have been flat to up slightly; installment credit continues to rise at a very rapid rate, and housing turnover, an important element for sales of so-called hard goods like furnishings, has fallen sharply as interest rates have risen.

Treasuries Increase in Price On New Signs of Slowdown

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended higher yesterday on growing confidence that the economy was slowing.
Reports by retailers of weak sales in March and and an increase in new claims for unemployment insurance for the week supported the market's view of a slowdown. But ahead of today's employment report few investors were willing yesterday to make large bets before the number was released, and trading was a lackluster. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 9/32 , to 10313/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.34 percent, from 7.36 percent on Wednesday. Short- maturity bills also improved, as unsubstantiated rumors of foreign central banks buying short-term securities circulated throughout the day.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said he was encouraged that the market finished near the top of its trading range yesterday going into the employment report. Wall Street, he said, is looking at the bond market more favorably "after focusing so much on the negatives like the dollar and higher commodity prices and inflation."
The bond market has been helped recently, he added, by interest from retail investors, rather than institutional investors. "When you have retail interest the Street stops trying to sell the market," Mr. Burtnick said. "Today there was enough retail interest to keep the shorts honest."
Other data released yesterday included housing completions as reported by the Commerce Department. The number of housing units completed fell 9.5 percent in February, the biggest monthly decline in more than three years.
Completions, which lag behind starts of new construction by six months, fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million, the lowest level since July 1994.
Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch, a market analysis firm, said today's employment report should confirm a slowdown. He said he expected a slowdown in the growth of real gross domestic product to about 2.5 percent in the second quarter of 1995 after an estimated 3.5 rate this quarter.
Mr. Palash said he saw the March employment report coming in on the moderate side, with a 175,000 gain in nonfarm payrolls and a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in the national unemployment rate, to 5.5 percent.
In the municipal bond market, bond prices rose as investors focused on bonds sold earlier in the week. Investors have recently been balking at the prices of new issues, saying that the nearly 50 percent drop in issuance during the first quarter has helped drive up prices to expensive levels.
As as a result, traders said, some investors have moved from new issue sales to the secondary market.
The Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues showed the average yield to maturity down two basis points, to 6.30 percent. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.

Gasoline Prices Surge on Worry About Tighter Summer Supplies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gasoline prices surged yesterday after problems at two refineries suggested that supplies could tighten ahead of the summer driving season.
On other commodity markets, platinum prices fell sharply on profit taking and cotton continued to climb. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 0.19 point, to 236.51. 
 The partial shutdown of a Koch Refining Company plant in Texas and continuing problems at a Sun Oil Company refinery in Philadelphia followed reports earlier this week that gasoline inventories fell sharply last week.
"That makes any news about closures more significant," said Monica Kelly, director of energy research at Pegasus Econometric Group in New York.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gasoline for May delivery jumped 1.2 cents, to 61.68 cents a gallon, the highest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since May 1993. It was the third consecutive strong advance in gasoline.
The rally pushed prices of crude oil and heating oil higher. May crude oil rose 21 cents, to $19.77 a barrel, and May heating oil rose 1.2 cents, to 49.21 cents a gallon.
Gasoline production typically declines in the spring as refiners close some units for seasonal maintenance. As a result, unscheduled closings like those at Koch and Sun can have a more substantial effect on prices.
Koch said it shut down a fluid catalytic cracker on Tuesday in Corpus Christi, Tex., that normally produces 50,000 barrels of gasoline a day, 40 percent of the refinery's total production. The unit will be restarted over the weekend, the company said.
Sun closed its 40,000-barrel-a-day catalytic cracker in Philadelphia last week. The company said the operation would not be restarted this week.
Platinum futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders took profits after a powerful five-day rally.
On Wednesday, platinum rose to its highest price since Sept. 7, 1990, after the Engelhard Corporation said it had developed a new pollution-control catalyst that uses the metal. The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would work with Engelhard to develop applications for cars.
April platinum fell $9.10 yesterday, to $452.50 a troy ounce.
Cotton rose the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound for the third consecutive day on the New York Cotton Exchange on signs of strengthening export demand for tight supplies of American cotton.
The May contract, which peaked at $1.10 a pound on March 13, settled at $102.22 yesterday.

Royals Shed Cone; Braves Get Grissom

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
David Cone, the American League Cy Young Award winner who only last week said he thought he would be traded because of his union activity, was traded yesterday, but the Kansas City Royals said they sent the pitcher to the Toronto Blue Jays for economic, not punitive, reasons.
The Montreal Expos, acting from the same payroll-tightening motivation, completed a frenzied two-day effort later in the day by trading their outstanding center fielder and leadoff batter, Marquis Grissom, to the Atlanta Braves for three players, including two major league outfielders, Roberto Kelly and Tony Tarasco. 
 Grissom thus joined pitchers John Wetteland, who went to the Yankees, and Ken Hill, traded to the Cardinals, as high-priced players eligible for salary arbitration who have been dispatched by the Expos.
The trading of Cone, one day after the Royals dealt outfielder Brian McRae to the Chicago Cubs for two minor leaguers, also followed a pattern in which high-salaried players have been acquired by clubs wealthier than the clubs that traded them.
The Royals acquired three minor leaguers for Cone, their No. 1 pitcher last season with a 16-5 record and a 2.94 earned run average. This marks the second time the Royals have traded Cone, who reached the majors with Kansas City in 1986, and the second time he has been traded to the Blue Jays.
By re-acquiring Cone, whom they originally obtained from the Mets for the last five weeks of the 1992 season, the Blue Jays displayed a determined effort to keep up with the Yankees, who have bolstered their pitching staff with the addition of the starter Jack McDowell and the reliever Wetteland.
During the recently concluded 234-day work stoppage, Cone became one of the most visible and articulate spokesmen for the union. He was often sought for television interviews, so his face and views were widely seen and heard.
Steve Fehr, the agent for Cone as well as McRae, is the brother of Donald Fehr, the baseball union's leader. When Steve Fehr was asked yesterday if he thought the trade was union related, he said, "I certainly hope that's not true."
Herk Robinson, the Royals' general manager, said flatly it was not true.
"It had absolutely nothing to do with his union activities," Robinson said by telephone from Haines City, Fla. "I talked to David two or three times over the winter. I told him I thought he was doing a good job. Somebody has to do that job. Nobody was offended by that. The reason we did it was we have to reduce our payroll. And we did not feel we could sign David for 1996 and beyond."
"I can't say it was as much a shock this time," Cone, a Kansas City native, was quoted as saying by The Associated Press. "This morning, my general manager and my manager didn't have much to say to me. After a while in baseball, you get a sort of sixth sense for these things."
Robinson didn't say, but other people in baseball believe the Royals will also trade another of their starting pitchers, Kevin Appier, in their payroll-slashing strategy.
Cone, 32 years old and a three-time National League strikeout leader, can be a free agent after this season, the third of a three-year, $18 million contract he signed with the Royals as a free agent Dec. 8, 1992. Half of his contract was paid in the form of a $9 million signing bonus that came not from the Royals' treasury but from the personal fortune of Ewing Kauffman, the owner, who died eight months later.
Robinson referred to the signing bonus in discussing Cone's labor status.
"I'm not sure many of the things he did on his behalf were not beneficial to helping the situation," the general manager said. "He had played in a small-market town, he was born and raised in one. He knew Mr. Kauffman personally paid much of his salary, the up-front money. He did not want to burden the ball club."
The Blue Jays gave the Royals two infielders, Chris Stynes and Tony Medrano, and a relief pitcher, David Sinnes.
In the deal for Grissom, besides Kelly and Tarasco, the Expos received a 20-year-old minor league pitcher, Esteban Yan, who was 11-12 with a 3.27 earned run average for Class A Macon last season.
Kelly, a former Yankee, is expected to be Montreal's starting center fielder. He hit .293 for Atlanta and Cincinnati in 1994 with 9 home runs, 43 r.b.i. and 19 stolen bases. Atlanta will pay much of Kelly's 1994 salary of $3.4 million.
Tarasco, 24, played in 87 games for Atlanta last season and hit .273 with five homers and 19 r.b.i. He started only 18 games and led the Braves in pinch-hits.
In Grissom, though, Atlanta is getting a center fielder who hit .288 in 1994 with 11 homers, 45 r.b.i. and 36 stolen bases. The Braves beat out the Florida Marlins and Boston Red Sox in acquiring the highly skilled defensive outfielder, who is from Atlanta and whom the Braves intend to offer a long-term contrct.
The trades yesterday were only a small part of the furious activity general managers are faced with. Today, the first day of mandatory spring training for the returning strikers, clubs have to tender contracts to players who are eligible for salary arbitration or let them go as free agents, and they have to offer arbitration to their players who became free agents last October or lose their negotiation and compensation rights.
Also on the schedule today is the opening of the union's camp for free agents in Homestead, Fla. Mark Belanger, the union official coordinating the camp, said he already has lined up an exhibition game for a camp team. The free agents are scheduled to play the Chicago White Sox in Sarasota on April 22.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Resume Their Climb

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off workers applying for jobless benefits climbed last week for the fourth time in five weeks, fresh evidence the economy has cooled from its strong pace at the end of the year.
New claims for unemployment insurance rose by 3,000,to a seasonally adjusted 341,000, the Labor Department said today. Claims fell by 10,000, to 338,000, in the week that ended on March 25, ending the first three-week string of advances in nearly a year. 
 The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims edged up to 342,500 last week, from 341,750 in the period that ended on March 25. It was the highest level since 347,750 in the period ended last July 30.
Many analysts prefer to track the less volatile four-week average because it smooths out the spikes in the weekly reports.

HEADLINE: Restaurants

BYLINE: By Ruth Reichl 

 BODY:
One night four gorgeous women walked into Zut! wearing huge fluffy pink hats that looked exactly like cotton candy. Every head in the restaurant turned to watch as they were seated at a front table. Those pink clouds were so mesmerizing that everyone in the long, dark room waited to see if the women would remove them. We waited all evening and when they finally got up and left, hats still firmly anchored to their heads, a collective sigh zipped around the room.
This display was particularly impressive, given the difficulty of making an entrance at Zut! The fabulously silly room captures most of the attention. The eye is first caught by the animals cavorting over the circular bar and then bounces to the chandeliers made of giant straw hats. By the time it discovers the musical giraffes, dancing rabbits and bridge-playing penguins on the wallpaper, it is hooked. There is so much to discover: sombrero mirrors, copper monkey panels, gold animals twinkling on the ceiling like urban constellations. This is one of the most playful spaces in New York City. 
 Comfortable, too. The banquettes, dressed up in the dark striped silk that was once reserved for dressing gowns, are plush and cozy. If you are lucky enough to be seated in one of the curved booths in the back, you can sink into the silk and watch the TriBeCa parade. People look good and enjoy themselves in this wonderful room, and three months into its run, it is already packed.
Beautiful waitresses scurry about, opening bottles from the impressive wine list; there is something attractive to drink at just about any price. The menu is another appealing document. It describes the upscale bistro fare with humor and presents a great many choices at a variety of prices. Those feeling expansive can order caviar for $35, while the more economy-minded can choose an entire three-course dinner for $28. Everything sounds delicious.
But from the moment the cottony bread appears on the table, it is clear that food is not Zut!'s strong suit. It is certainly possible to have a fine meal here, but it is equally possible to have a pretty grim one.
If you want to be happy when you eat at Zut!, I suggest beginning with the roasted beet salad. It glistens like garnets beneath a slick of fragrant truffle oil. The coq au vin, a smoky, meaty stew of chicken and red wine balanced on chickpea spatzle, makes a satisfying main course. This is fine bistro cooking, the sort of straightforward, unpretentious food that is France at its best. Warm chocolate bread pudding offers two kinds of comfort mixed into a single dish, a perfect dessert. And then, to cap the meal, why not a shot of Calvados in your coffee? It's the best of Paris and New York at a single dinner.
There are other likable dishes at Zut! I am fond of the chewy, garlicky, escargots in their little copper pot. I appreciate the quality of the veal chop, and I love the creamy flageolets topped with buttery bread crumbs that come with the rack of lamb. And while I find the tabbouleh salad distressingly dull, the pretty pyramid of grains drizzled with yogurt-lime dressing and served with a few little crayfish is perfectly acceptable. Unfortunately, there is not much else at Zut! that I would happily order again.
The salad has a dreary dressing. Oysters on two occasions were flat and completely lacking in liquid. The saucisson lyonnaise is dense and delicious, but the warm potato salad on the side is little more than a few cubed potatoes. And so it goes.
Salt can be a serious problem. Foie gras, a special one night, was overcooked and salty, although the caramelized apples on the side helped a little. The bouillabaisse, an impressive all-shellfish concoction featuring clams, mussels, scallops and shrimp with a lobster tail smack dab in the middle, was marred by a very salty broth. And the sauce on a special steak one night was salty enough to make my mouth tingle.
The steak frites is a better choice. The meat is slightly tough but tasty. The frites, a haystack of skinny fried potatoes, is so attractive it is hard not to reach out and grab a fistful as they go sailing past the table. Unfortunately, it turns out that they have sacrificed taste to appearance; they are all crunch and stone cold.
Both the skate and the black bass strike me as dull. And the choucroute, which should be rich with the mingled juices of the smoked pork chop, blood sausage and white sausage with which it is garnished, is thin and acid-tasting; the dominating flavor is cabbage and white wine.
Desserts have improved a bit since the restaurant opened, but they are still works in progress. Warm pear tarte Tatin comes in a soggy shell, and the lemon-lime mousse is bouncy enough to recall the consistency of Jell-O. A special chiffon cake filled with mascarpone and blackberries is as sweet and bland as a Twinkie.
Even so, I'd go back to Zut! It's fun. It's lively. The food might get better. But even if it doesn't, I now know what to eat, where to sit and when to wear my most outrageous clothes.
 
Zut!

Dollar Tumbles Below 84 Yen And Traders See New Weakness

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar continued to plunge to new lows against the Japanese yen in Asia today after tumbling yesterday.
At mid-afternoon today in Tokyo, the dollar dropped below 84 yen for the first time. 
 Still, many currency dealers wondered whether the Federal Reserve and other central banks would ultimately step in and buy dollars in an effort to prop up its value. Dealers said they were concerned about being caught short of dollars. On Wednesday, the Fed was joined by the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank in buying dollars on foreign-exchange markets for the second time in three days.
Data on United States employment in March, which are scheduled to be released today, also created a sense of wariness in the markets.
Dealers said they expected the dollar to tumble again should the payroll numbers come out weak, as expected, which would create a sense the Fed might hesitate to raise interest rates.
Yesterday, however, the dollar managed to hold onto some ground against the German mark and other currencies.
 "It's the calm before the next storm," Richard Vullo of the Bayerische Hypotheken Bank said about yesterday's trading. "The bad news is out there. We're just waiting to see what the number looks like."
The dollar touched a post-World-War-II low of 85.14 yen in European trading yesterday. In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 85.27 yen, down from 86.20 yen on Wednesday.
But by mid-afternoon in Tokyo today, the dollar had fallen to 83.82 yen.
The dollar also fell yesterday to a postwar low against the Swiss franc, sliding to 1.113 Swiss francs. It recovered to 1.1270 francs in New York, up from 1.1235 francs on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to 1.3735 German marks from 1.3742 marks and to $1.6070 British pounds from $1.6085. These currencies showed moderate change this afternoon in Tokyo.
Analysts warned that further weakness might be in store for the dollar, saying that they saw scant signs that Washington was ready to bite the bullet on the dollar.
"The world is running out of options to deal with the dollar," said Michael Aho, senior international economist with Prudential Securities in New York.
In the five trading sessions ending yesterday, the dollar fell 5.27 percent against the yen and 2.62 percent against the mark.
The International Monetary Fund has suggested that the United States may need to raise interest rates further if the dollar remains under pressure.

HEADLINE: Janet Fitchen, 58, Rural Sociologist And Anthropologist

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Janet Mathews Fitchen, a cultural anthropologist who studied rural poverty in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 58.
The cause was a brain tumor, her family said. 
 Dr. Fitchen brought the eye of an anthropologist and her profession's ethnographic methodology to the field of rural sociology. A professor of anthropology, she was the chairwoman of the department of anthropology at Ithaca College.
She wrote "Poverty in Rural America: A Case Study" (Westview, 1981), which surveyed pockets of poverty in the vast stretches of forests and fields of upstate New York. "I call it northern Appalachia," she told a reporter in 1984. "It is poverty that has been entrenched."
Her latest book was "Endangered Spaces, Enduring Places: Change, Identity and Survival in Rural America" (Westview, 1991). It chronicled the demographic, social, cultural, economic and agricultural changes transforming the Northeast. Both books are in print.
More recently, she researched poverty in other regions as an associate of the Western Rural Development Center in Corvallis, Ore. She had accepted a faculty appointment in the department of rural sociology at Cornell University and had planned to leave Ithaca College, where she had been a faculty member since 1977, at the end of the semester.
Dr. Fitchen was born in Manhattan but grew up on her family's dairy farm in Brewster, attending a one-room school. She graduated from Vassar College and received a master's degree in anthropology from the University of Illinois.
She did field work with Oscar Lewis in a Mexican village and received her Ph.D. in anthropology from Cornell.
Dr. Fitchen is survived by her husband, Douglas B. Fitchen, a Cornell professor; a son, John H., of La Jolla, Calif.; and two daughters, Katherine F. Nisbet of Bozeman, Mont., and Sylvia Fitchen of Tucson, Ariz.

HEADLINE: Alms for the Affluent

 BODY:
House Republicans approved the last major element of their Contract With America this week by proposing to hand voters a $189 billion tax cut over five years. At the same time, in a second, less splashy part of the bill, they proposed a $315 billion cut in discretionary spending (after accounting for inflation) over five years.
The tax cuts are tilted toward the wealthy; the spending cuts are tilted against the poor. The double whammy makes the contract an outrageously unfair transfer of income from the needy to the rich. 
 The tax bill, according to the Treasury, would cut taxes by perhaps $99 billion a year when phased in. About half the total (including corporate) cuts would go to the wealthiest 10 percent of households. A fifth of the cut would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of families. To help pay for the measure, the bill would cut more than $60 billion out of welfare programs and 17 percent out of discretionary programs by the year 2000.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, estimates that 70 percent of the House's spending cuts would come from the 20 percent of the budget that goes to low-income families. Food stamps, school lunches, housing assistance, day-care allowances and every other need-based program will shrink after taking account of inflation. By the center's estimates, low-income families would absorb two-thirds of the spending cuts, but reap only about 5 percent of the tax cuts.
The plan did not have to be this skewed. The Republicans could have chopped Government down to whatever size they wanted without tilting it severely against the needy. Indeed, to put its sorry budget policy together, the G.O.P. had to betray many of its own values.
The G.O.P. recognizes savings as the key to faster growth, yet House Republicans passed a contract that would encourage consumption with a tax cut of $500 per child. The G.O.P. says it wants to stimulate future investment, but then proposes to cut taxes on the sale of old investments.
The Republicans would write into the tax code new protections against inflation for investors, while wiping out some inflation protection for recipients of food stamps. The G.O.P. preaches the virtues of letting markets guide investors. Yet the contract jimmies the tax code so that investors in certain assets will pay negative tax rates -- in effect receiving a government check on top of their private earnings.
The audacious move to rewrite the Federal budget goes well beyond anything President Reagan attempted, let alone acccomplished. Roughly speaking, Congress did not cut taxes under Mr. Reagan. It substituted higher payroll taxes for lower income taxes, thereby putting little downward pressure on government spending. This time around, G.O.P. conservatives intend to make sure taxes drop lower, forcing government spending down as well.
Stepping beyond the contract, the G.O.P. pledges to balance the budget. Counting the tax cuts under the contract, the pledge would require Congress to knock about a third out of cuttable Government programs by 2002. Americans can judge for themselves whether they want a third of nearly everything the Government pays for -- from student loans to border patrols -- to vanish. But they should be shamed if Congress follows the House's lead and victimizes the most vulnerable.

HEADLINE: U.S. Scrambles to Block Oil Rigs From Reaching Serbia

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: ATHENS, April 7

 BODY:
In a secret transaction involving four countries, several companies and altered documents, two oil rigs have been shipped from Iran en route to Serbia in violation of the United Nations sanctions against Belgrade, Western officials say.
The shipment was discovered by the Central Intelligence Agency after it left Iran, officials said, and now the United States is trying to prevent the contraband from reaching its destination. 
 Apparently in an attempt to disguise the identity of the intended recipient in Serbia, which would use the equipment for its war machine, the original documents for the transaction described the contents in the ship's hold as oil-drilling equipment destined for Bulgaria, then Russia. The oil rigs had belonged to a Canadian company owned by a Serbian immigrant.
The documents were later altered to say the rigs were hydrological research equipment, destined for Macedonia, according to officials from several countries, who have seen the documents and are tracking the equipment. Western officials said similar shipments were planned if this one was successful.
"It is a particularly egregious example of a broader problem," said a Western diplomat who follows sanctions closely.
The broader problem, officials said, is that the sanctions have developed a huge leak in the southern Balkans, and traders and the Serbs are using so many false fronts that governments are finding it hard to stem the flow. Not since engines for fighter planes were smuggled into Serbia a few years ago has a single shipment in violation of the United Nations embargo so alarmed Washington, officials say. And now the high-stakes espionage drama continues.
Investigators are trying to keep track of the equipment, which is more than 100 trucks' worth and already in at least three countries -- and block it from reaching the Serbs, who have oilfields in the north and in a Serbian-controlled area of eastern Croatia.
"This is big stuff," a Western diplomat said. "The most important thing you can deny to Yugoslavia is oil."
With the United States having declined to send troops into the war zones of Bosnia and Croatia, sanctions against Yugoslavia are the centerpiece of Washington's Balkan policy. They are the means by which the United States hopes to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, the most powerful politician in Yugoslavia, to negotiate, end his support for the Bosnian Serbs and recognize the independence and boundaries of Croatia, Bosnia and Macedonia, all of which broke away from the old Yugoslavia.
The case of the oil-drilling equipment is highly delicate, and officials who answered questions did so only on the condition that they, and in some cases even their countries, not be identified.
The issue is delicate in part because about 700 tons of the equipment has already slipped through Greece and Bulgaria, and neither American nor European diplomats want to embarrass those countries' governments. In addition, Western intelligence agencies do not want the Iranians and the Serbs to learn how they found out about the shipment.
Slobodan Popovich, who works in the foreign press section of the Yugoslav Information Ministry, said he knew nothing about the shipment. "I doubt if anyone would," he said. He said that it would be a violation of the United Nations sanctions for anyone to sell such equipment to Yugoslavia, but that he did not think it would violate any law for Yugoslavia to try to buy it.
The Iranian Embassy here declined to comment, saying it knew nothing about the matter, and the Foreign Ministry's press office in Teheran declined to answer questions.
One of the most perplexing questions for investigators is why Iran would sell something of such military and strategic value as oil-drilling equipment to Yugoslavia, since Iran openly supports the Muslim-led Bosnian Government in its war with the Serbs.
One Western official speculated that Iran did it simply for the money. But some Western officials have not ruled out the possibility that even Iran did not know the ultimate destination of the equipment and that it might have been diverted after leaving that country, though they said this seemed unlikely given the control the Iranian Government exercises.
The shipping documents list the shipper of the equipment as Canadian Triton International, which is based in Calgary, Alberta. It is owned by Vladimir Katic, who Western officials said is a Serb who immigrated to Canada from Yugoslavia in 1966.
Canadian Triton is a small oil-drilling company whose only operations are in Iran, George Duchesne, a company official, said in a telephone interview from Calgary. Mr. Duchesne, who declined to give his position in the company, confirmed that Mr. Katic was the owner and said he did not know about his background.
Mr. Duchesne said he did not know why Canadian Triton's name was on the shipping documents. He said the company had leased the two rigs from a Yugoslav company in 1992 and had used them in Iran for one year. At the end of that time, Mr. Duchesne said, they belonged to Yugoslavia again.
"It's theirs," Mr. Duchesne said. "Is there a problem with their bringing their own stuff home?"
Based on interviews with American, Western European and Balkan officials in seven countries, it is possible to piece together this outline of events:
An Iranian ship, the Ershad, left Iran about Feb. 1, loaded with two rigs. It landed at the Greek port of Salonika about Feb. 20. The equipment, valued at $4.9 million, was consigned to a Bulgarian company.
When the United States, through its intelligence sources, determined that the equipment was headed for Yugoslavia, it approached all governments in the region.
One of the Security Council's sanctions resolutions -- No. 820, which was passed in April 1993 -- requires countries to detain all vessels and cargoes "suspected" of having been involved in violating sanctions.
When the American intelligence was first relayed to the Greeks, they were slow to react, European and American officials said.
A Greek Foreign ministry official who insisted on anonymity said Greece had not initially interfered with the shipment because under Greek law the Government has no right to stop a shipment in transit to a legitimate country, in this case Bulgaria, according to the shipping documents.
Later, under constant pressure from the United States and the European Union's sanctions monitoring office in Brussels, Greece put a hold on the rest of the equipment.
Before Greece acted, Western officials said, about 1,200 tons had already been hauled by trucks to Bulgaria. They crossed the border at Kulata, consigned to a company called Baypass, several officials said, including one who read from the shipping documents. Officials said they had not been able to locate the company.
It was after the shipment reached Bulgaria that the documents were altered, declaring that the cargo was hydrological research equipment, Western officials said.
American officials asked the Bulgarian Government not to allow the cargo to continue. But the Bulgarians said they could not interfere with the shipment since it was intended for Macedonia, a country against which there is no embargo.
The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said no one was available to answer questions about the case. The President's office said he was on a trip to North Korea and Mongolia with his spokesman and foreign affairs adviser.
Bulgaria notified the United Nations sanctions committee this week that 60 truckloads of the equipment passed through Bulgaria into Macedonia.
Some of it was loaded onto rail cars and was about to go to Serbia when American officials stepped in. The fully loaded rail cars sit on the tracks.
If the United States succeeds in persuading Greece and Macedonia not to release the equipment now in their custody -- and Western officials say it is by no means certain Washington will -- the deal will have fallen through for the Serbs, because the parts that have been held up are needed for the rigs to work.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From President's Speech

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 7

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's address today to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, as provided by the Federal News Service, a transcription company:
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at an historic moment in our country's history, on the verge of a new century, living in a very different kind of economy with a bewildering array of challenges and opportunities. In 1992 and in 1994, the voters spoke out and demanded bold changes in the way we govern and the policies we pursue. They know better than anyone else that they are living in a time with new challenges that demand new answers. In the last two years, my Administration has begun to meet those challenges. . . . 
 But it is not enough. Too many Americans don't yet feel any of those benefits. Too many still feel uncertain about their own future, and too many people are overwhelmingly concerned about the social and the underlying moral problems of our society.
And so in 1994 they voted to give the Republicans a chance to run the Congress. In the last 100 days, the House of Representatives has passed a series of bold initiatives. We will soon begin the second 100 days of this Congress.
In the first 100 days, the mission of the House Republicans was to suggest ways in which we should change our Government and our society. In the second 100 days and beyond, our mission together must be to decide which of these House proposals should be adopted, which should be modified and which should be stopped.
In the first 100 days, it fell to the House of Representatives to propose. In the next 100 days and beyond, the President has to lead the quiet, reasoned forces of both parties in both houses to sift through the rhetoric and decide what is really best for America. In making these decisions, it is absolutely vital that we keep alive the spirit and the momentum of change, but the momentum must not carry us so far that we betray our legacy of compassion, decency and common sense. . . .
We stand at a crossroads. In one direction lies confrontation and gridlock; in the other lies achievement and progress. I was not elected President to pile up a stack of vetoes. I was elected President to change the direction of America. That's what I have spent the next two, last two, years doing, and that's what I want to spend the next 100 days and beyond doing.
Whether we can do that depends upon what all of us in Washington do from here on out.
So I appeal today to Republicans and to Democrats alike to get together, to keep the momentum for change going, not to allow the energy and longing for change now to be dissipated amid a partisan clutter of accusations. After all, we share much common ground. . . .
In that spirit I come here today to outline where I stand on the remaining items in the Republican contract and the unfinished business of my New Covenant.
Let's begin with taxes. In 1993, I made a down payment on the middle-class tax cut I advocated when I ran for President. We cut taxes for 15 million working families. What that means on average is that this year a family of four with an income of $25,000 a year or less will have about $1,000 in lower tax bills. We did this to insure that nobody who works full time and has children should live in poverty. If you want to reform the welfare system, you must reward work and parenting.
So I want a tax cut to expand, to include more members of the middle class. . . . But this $200 billion tax cut, which is really more than three times that, if you look at it over a 10-year period, is a fantasy. It's too much. It's not going to happen. We can't afford it.
A realistic cut would be somewhere around a third of that. That's something we can afford. . . . Let's target a tax cut to the right people and for the right purpose. We have to choose. Do you want a tax cut for the wealthy or for the middle class? . . .
Let's take welfare reform. As I said, both of us -- both the Republican contract and my New Covenant -- have focused heavily on welfare reform. What do we agree on? That there ought to be a limit to welfare, that there ought to be flexibility for the states, that we ought to have the toughest possible child support enforcement and that people have to take more responsibility for their own lives and for children they bring into this world.
But the current House bill focuses primarily on cutting costs. It's weak on work and tough on kids. It punishes young people for past mistakes. . . . The House bill also punishes young children for the sins of their parents. I think that's wrong. . . .
But look what we agree on. We are near historic change, we can do this. We can make a difference, we can break the culture of welfare. And we can do something good for our country to support the values we all believe in. And we can give these children a better future. But to do it we're going to have to talk through our differences and get beyond the rhetoric to how these real lives work, and not stand on the sidelines posturing for political gain.
Let's take cutting the deficit. The balanced-budget amendment is dead, but now we have to get specific. How are we going to cut the deficit and move this budget toward balance? If we can focus on cuts, not making partisan points, that's the first step. There are cuts I can't live with, there are cuts the Republicans can't live with. Let's avoid them and make cuts we can all live with. . . .
Regulatory reform -- another big item in the Republican contract. There are lots of horror stories. Every one of you probably knows a story that shows where a bureaucrat overreached or there were too many regulations or there was too little common sense. I am committed to changing the culture of regulation that has dominated our country for a long time. . . .
We are working on these things to move forward, but we must do more. And yet, surely the answer is not to stop the Government from regulating what it needs to regulate. If the Republicans send me a bill that would let unsafe planes fly or contaminated meat be sold or contaminated water continue to find itself into city water systems, I will veto it. I will veto it. . . .
Crime. Crime was a big part of the New Covenant, a big part of why I ran for President. The personal security of the American people should be our first concern. And we delivered. After six years, we broke gridlock and I signed a crime bill that was endorsed by all the major law-enforcement agencies in the country. . . .
Now, if the Republicans wish to continue to try to repeal the commitment to 100,000 police, or to repeal the assault weapons ban, they have a perfect right to do it. But if they send me those provisions, I will veto them. On the other hand, while the rest of their crime bill needs some work, and I disagree with some provisions of it, it has some good points. If we can build on the '94 crime bill instead of tear it down, we can continue our efforts to make the American people more secure. So let's do that. Let's pass a crime bill we can be proud of, that builds the country up and makes our citizens safer. . . .
I haven't forgotten the need to reform health care. Everybody knows we still have problems. It costs too much. There are a lot of people who have inadequate coverage. There are a lot of people who have no coverage at all. And there are millions of Americans who could lose their coverage at any time.
So I call on Republicans to join me in taking this one step at a time, beginning with things the majority of them have long endorsed: first, making benefits portable, so you don't lose your health care when you change jobs; second, requiring coverage for families with a pre-existing condition, so a whole family doesn't lose health care just because there's been one sick child. . . .
Cutting education in the face of global competition -- as I have said repeatedly -- would be just like cutting the defense budget at the height of the cold war. It undermines our security as a people, and we shouldn't do it. . . .
I do not want a pile of vetoes. I want a pile of bills that will move this country into the future. I don't want to see a big fight between the Republicans and the Democrats. I want us to surprise everybody in America by rolling up our sleeves and joining hands and working together.

HEADLINE: Iraq Dismisses Limited Plan to Ease Sanctions

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 7

 BODY:
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister seemed today to dismiss as unacceptable a new Security Council plan that would allow his country to sell a limited amount of oil to raise money for medicine, food and other essential supplies.
The Baghdad Government says that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 1990 and modified after the Persian Gulf war prohibiting most exports and imports by Iraq are causing severe hardships for ordinary people. 
 The Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, told reporters after he met with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today that he had "strong reservations" about the Security Council resolution proposed by Argentina, the United States and Britain, though he indicated that he would be willing to look at a modified version.
The new resolution, which could be voted on as early as next week, would allow Iraq to sell $1 billion worth of oil every 90 days. The resolution would be in effect for six months but could be renewed. Under a previous Security Council resolution that has lapsed, Iraq would have been permitted to make only a onetime sale worth $1.6 billion to pay for the basic needs of people suffering from the trade sanctions.
The new measure stipulates that 70 percent of oil income would go to human needs in Iraq, including Kurdish-held areas of the north. Thirty percent would be earmarked for a compensation fund for victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
But Iraq, with some support from France and Russia, has been holding out for the broader lifting of limits on Iraqi oil sales under the terms of a resolution adopted by the Security Council in 1991. That resolution would allow President Saddam Hussein to resume sales under less stringent conditions when Iraq fully complies with the demands of a special commission monitoring the destruction of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
The head of the commission, Rolf Ekeus, is expected to present a report to the Security Council next week saying he is confident that cooperation has been sufficient in eliminating missiles and chemical weapons and that an effective monitoring system is now in place.
But on biological weapons, Mr. Ekeus is expected to express concern about a large quantity of imported growth cultures missing from Iraq's accounting that could be used to produce either vaccines or biological weapons.
Diplomats say that the Ekeus commission lists 17 tons of biological cultures, far more than a country would need for pharamceutical purposes, that have not been accounted for. Another 13 tons have been traced, but Mr. Ekeus says that until he can account for all the materials he cannot judge Iraq's capability.
The United States, which on those grounds alone can argue that Iraq has not satisfied all the demands of the resolution -- or proven it can live up to other agreements -- will try to head off a French and Russian move to lift sanctions.

Clinton Warns G.O.P. He Will Veto Bills
After three months of ceding the initiative to Congressional Republicans, President Clinton defined the limits of his willingness to compromise, saying he would veto bills dealing with legal and regulatory reform, crime, the use of United States troops in United Nations operations and compensation for property owners whose land loses value as a result of Federal regulations.
 While he did not specifically say he would veto the $189 billion tax cut bill enacted by the House as the climax of the Republicans' first 100 days, Mr. Clinton called it a "fantasy." "We can't afford it," he said. Page 1.

HEADLINE: Into the Woods in Asia;
Myanmar? North Korea? No Sweat for Hong Kong Firm

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 7

 BODY:
Francis Pike liked what he saw in North Korea on a reconnaissance trip for Peregrine Investment Holdings Ltd., the Hong Kong investment bank, in the fall of 1993.
 It was a place of pervasive tyranny and cultish obeisance to a "great leader." The Communist Government was an international pariah, accused by the United States and other Western countries of feverishly building nuclear weapons, shipping missiles to the Middle East, fomenting terrorism, kidnapping its critics abroad and crushing domestic dissent. And the country was overwhelmed by poverty. 
 "Clearly, their economy was a catastrophe," Mr. Pike recalled. "There really was no economic life there."
 It was, in short, the sort of place that Peregrine found appealing. For North Korea had one huge asset: opportunity. "They clearly gave the indication that things were going to change," he said. "I think they're expecting us to be able to bring in capital, companies and clients."
 Since that trip, Peregrine has formed a joint banking venture with the Daeson Group, which is controlled by the North Korean Government. And while Peregrine remains the only outside investment firm active in the country, it is also doing business with other countries where many investment banks may tread warily, or not at all.
 It was the first investment bank to move into Myanmar, formerly Burma, ruled by a military dictatorship. It was one of the first to go to Communist-ruled Vietnam. And, when other companies and banks stepped back after the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in June 1989, the newly created Peregrine only accelerated its activities in China.
 Such willingness to take gambles, combined with a talent for making friends in high places, has helped Peregrine grow from a start-up with $38 million to spend into a regional powerhouse in a little more than six years. But its willingness to strike alliances with some of Asia's more unsavory regimes, and accusations of unethical behavior ranging from market manipulation to plagiarism, have created a serious image problem for the bank.
 Its ties with the Myanmar Government, which crushed civil unrest in the late 1980's and continues to imprison the leader of the country's democratic opposition, have soured some of its investors, for example. The Quantum Fund N.V., run by the American financier George Soros, recently divested itself of 10,000 shares of Peregrine stock.
 While other Western companies have footholds in China and Vietnam, some human-rights advocates dislike what they regard as Peregrine's unapologetic embrace of dictatorial regimes. "We're strongly opposed to any business going into a country like North Korea or Burma or even China unless it is willing to press for human rights and a greater respect for the rule of law," said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia in New York.
 The Economist magazine noted recently that while other banks did business in China, "the difference is that Peregrine does not even affect to hold its nose."
 None of this fazes Philip L. Tose, Peregrine's chairman and co-founder, who contends that a dismal political or human-rights record of a regime is no reason to avoid a lucrative market. "Yes, there had been a very unfortunate incident which had a lot of coverage, shocked a lot of people," Mr. Tose said of the Tiananmen Square killings. "But underneath all that, nothing really had changed in terms of the fundamentals that had made people originally want to invest in those areas.
 "Our view," Mr. Tose said, "and it's a very controversial view, is that countries develop through economic dialogue. Simply introducing political democracy is not necessarily the first step that should be taken. It is better to increase the standard of living of the people, which in turn will lead over time to social change, political change, etc."
 Francis Leung Pak To, Peregrine's managing director and Mr. Tose's partner, said the bank had come to the conclusion "that these events were just a hiccup."
 "We decided we wanted to take advantage of depressed market conditions at the time," he said. Peregrine rapidly bought control of two companies which it used to expand its asset base and to raise capital.
 Mr. Tose also brushes aside ethical lapses by his bank. In 1993, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong reprimanded Peregrine for engaging in "trading activity which was, or was likely to be, prejudicial to the interests of the investing public" by buying back shares that it had previously sold in an effort to disguise the real market for those shares.
 "It happened at a time we were growing very fast and frankly we didn't have the right systems in place of checks and balances," Mr. Tose said. "We have now. I think a recurrence of something like that would be difficult."
 But tripping over the line of the permissible did not end there. Earlier this year, Peregrine published a long research report on the economic prospects of Myanmar. The report was intended to promote the group's own access to the military regime and the country's business community; the problem, however, was that the contents of the report were plagiarized from a report on Myanmar written by a smaller Hong Kong securities firm, Kerry Securities.
 Mr. Leung blamed the Myanmar office for the plagiarism, and said the office was not closely supervised. "That was an example of growing pains," he said.
 Whatever its public image, Peregrine has enjoyed a meteoric rise in Asian banking. It was founded in late 1988 by Mr. Tose, who had previously headed a Citicorp venture in Hong Kong, and by Mr. Leung, one of his rising stars there. The two men cobbled together $38 million (United States) from some of Hong Kong's wealthiest business leaders. Though the founders wanted to call their new firm Falcon, they could not obtain rights to the name, Mr. Tose said, so they chose Peregrine, a breed of the same bird of prey. "We like it because it's an aggressive bird," Mr. Tose said. "It typifies what we are."
 Since then, the capital base of Peregrine has soared to $550 million, which would put it at the lower end of the top 20 investment banks in the United States. It had revenue of $3.74 billion last year, up from $233 million in 1989. And while profit fell last year, to $82.5 million from $112 million in 1993, Mr. Tose said the results were not "nearly as bad as many of the international investment banking houses." Peregrine also managed to tighten its grip on the market for initial public offerings in China and Hong Kong, increasing its share to 75 percent from 60 percent in 1993.
 Analysts attribute much of the success of Peregrine to the founders' brilliant choice of investors. They include Li Ka-shing, one of the world's richest men, who made much of his fortune in Hong Kong's property market; Gordon Wu, a property developer, and Larry Yung, head of the Hong Kong branch of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, the mainland's principal investment bank.
 Peregrine has also built an impressive list of high-level contacts across Asia, where it has opened 25 offices in 14 countries, both its admirers and competitors say.
 Mr. Li, whose vast business empire includes ports in Hong Kong and China, hotels, telecommunications ventures, satellite services and electric power projects, made no bones about the importance of knowing the right people. And in Asia, he said, that usually means having influence with the right families.
 "If you were working in Europe or America at the turn of the century, your connections were vital," Mr. Li said. "Without them, you were dead. Asia is to a degree at that stage of development today. It's not quite, because everyone has moved on a little bit. But business, industry, government to a degree, are controlled by families just the way they were in the West at the turn of the century."
 Mr. Tose said he would like to reduce Peregrine's reliance on China and Hong Kong to half its business from the current 80 percent. As a result, the bank keeps pushing into other parts of Asia.
 Today, for example, it has 250 employees in the three major cities of South Korea and is the only foreign company with a seat on the Seoul stock exchange. In Myanmar, it has opened Peregrine Capital Myanmar Ltd., which among other things has invested in a shrimp-processing plant.
 For some people, sniping at Peregrine for its supposed cozying up to dictatorships smacks of sour grapes. "The success of Peregrine is a measure of the failure of competitors to take advantage of market conditions," said a Hong Kong banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The market here needed a local investment bank more in tune with their needs, particularly smaller companies that want to come to the market."
 A European banker here, who has watched Peregrine's march through Asia with some admiration, said he had one major concern -- that the expansion had gone too fast. "The jury is well and truly out," the banker said. "Management there is very thin. For a company that size it is surprising that decisions are made by three or four people. Clearly there is a lot of skepticism about whether they can manage a business of that size."

HEADLINE: Bad Jobs News for New York, But New Jersey Registers Gain

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
New York's unemployment rate rose last month, raising renewed concern that the economic lag that has plagued the state would continue to kill any chance of a significant recovery any time soon, Labor Department officials said yesterday.
 They said the possibility of additional layoffs of New York City workers, particularly in the health care sector, raised the prospect of even more unemployment. 
 Moreover, they said the slowdown in manufacturing reflected in yesterday's national unemployment figures could also worsen New York's inability to generate an economic recovery.
 "The possibility of additional job losses in the health care and hospital sector could become a major social issue in New York City," said Anthony J. Ferrara, acting regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 But in sharp contrast, employment conditions in New Jersey continued to improve, reflecting the state's break from the economic doldrums that have blanketed much of the Northeast.
 "In real terms, New Jersey continues to be the best economic performer in the Northeast, way ahead of Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania," Mr. Ferrara said.
 While the national unemployment rate rose slightly last month to 5.5 percent, up one-tenth of 1 percent from February, the unemployment rate in New York State rose to 6.6 percent, up from 6.1 percent in February, but down from the 7.9 percent rate a year earlier.
 The number of unemployed was 558,000, compared with 523,000 a month ago and 681,000 a year earlier.
 At the same time, New York City's jobless rate was 8.5 percent, down from 9 percent in February and 10.3 percent in March 1994. But Mr. Ferrara said last month's decrease in the city was not significant because it was based on figures that were not seasonally adjusted.
 In New Jersey, meanwhile, the unemployment rate last month fell to 5.8 percent from 6.1 percent in February and nearly two full points below the 7.7 percent rate a year earlier.
 Connecticut is not one of the 11 states for which the Labor Department provides separate figures when it releases national employment data.
 With the exception of New Jersey, Mr. Ferrara said prospects of an economic recovery in the Northeast region were apparently still stalled.
 "What we see is a very flat economy that is barely able to tread water," he said."
 And what might make conditions appear worse, officials said, was that the economic fall from the boom years of the mid-1980's to the late 1980's was so steep and unforgiving, particularly in the city's major economic areas of construction, insurance, finance and real estate.
 For example, Mr. Ferrara said New York State generated only 52,000 new jobs in the last year, giving it a ranking of third to last among the 50 states in new jobs.

HEADLINE: Rich Nations Criticize U.S. On Foreign Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
An organization of wealthy industrial nations issued a stinging report today criticizing the United States for moving to cut foreign aid when it already gives a smaller share of its economic output to such assistance than any other industrial nation.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group of 25 nations, said the United States, once far and away the world's leading donor, was setting a poor example by cutting its aid budget and warned that the move might prompt other countries to follow suit. 
 Using unusually blunt language, the report said that "this seeming withdrawal from traditional leadership is so grave that it poses a risk of undermining political support for development cooperation" by other donor countries.
The report said the United States had slipped to No. 2, well behind Japan, in the amount of foreign aid provided excluding military assistance. The United States provided $9.72 billion in 1993, compared with $11.3 billion for Japan.
It said the United States contributed 15-hundredths of one percent of its gross domestic product for economic aid, putting it last among the 25 industrial nations. The average among these nations was 30-hundredths of one percent, while Sweden, Denmark and Norway all give 1 percent of their overall output to foreign aid.
J. Brian Atwood, Administrator of the Agency for International Development, the Government's principal aid arm, welcomed the report, making clear that he intends to use it as ammunition in the Clinton Administration's fight to persuade Congress not to cut foreign aid. At a news briefing today, Mr. Atwood criticized Congressional committees for proposing to cut $3 billion from the $21 billion international affairs budget, which includes State Department spending as well as foreign aid.
The report was written by the O.E.C.D. Secretariat and was overseen by James H. Michel, the chairman of its development assistance committee. Mr. Michel was an assistant administrator of A.I.D. in the Bush Administration.

HEADLINE: Critics Claim Javits Chief Is Not Up to the Challenge

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: CORTLANDT, N.Y.

 BODY:
At a small hospital tucked among the sloping woods of this Westchester County community, Robert Boyle is considered a savior.
 As the volunteer chairman of the Hudson Valley Hospital Center, he brought in a new management team that helped rescue it from the brink of financial failure, turning it into a thriving competitor among the region's nonprofit hospitals. To admiring staff members, one administrator said, "he walks on water." 
 Mr. Boyle, the new chief executive of the troubled Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, is now facing a far more arduous challenge.
 He is charged with eliminating mismanagement, labor problems and mob corruption at the state-run center, which has been steadily losing money and business. His job will demand that he lower costs, modernize the center and promote it as an attractive convention destination, while overseeing 100 full-time employees and hundreds of other workers in the six labor unions operating there.
 "The problems are entrenched," says Stephen J. Morello, president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. "There's no shortage of challenge."
 Mr. Boyle, whose selection as head of the Javits Center was confirmed this week by the center's governing board, is a former owner of a concrete company in Tarrytown, a business that he says has given him insight into organized crime.
 But since Mr. Pataki nominated Mr. Boyle as head of the center, a number of questions have been raised about his experience and about the track record of the companies he has led. Because his experience is limited to running small- and medium-size companies, as well as serving on civic boards like the hospital's, some skeptics have questioned whether he is prepared to take on the huge task of operating the Javits Center.
 "The Javits Center is a major business enterprise with complicated issues," said Michael Cherkasky, who conducted a 1992 investigation of the convention center for the New York District Attorney's office and currently works as a managing director at Kroll Associates, an investigative firm. "This will not be a doable job if the person doesn't have experience with big business and in dealing with extensive labor problems."
 Other critics have wondered whether Mr. Boyle's personal relationship with Mr. Pataki -- who chose Mr. Boyle as his campaign treasurer last year and has yet to repay a $10,000 personal loan from him -- is evidence of an ongoing pattern of patronage and indifference at the convention center. "It certainly calls into question whether he has the requisite independence to take on this position," said Neil V. Getnick, managing partner in a New York law firm that specializes in commercial fraud and crime and is familiar with the Javits Center from his days as an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan.
 Mr. Boyle, who defended his qualifications in a recent interview, said he was not daunted by the skeptics or by the job ahead. "The challenge now is to sweep the place clean," he said. "I have a very difficult task, but I know how to do this. We'll do this a hell of a lot faster than anybody thinks it will get done."
 When Mr. Pataki nominated Mr. Boyle for the $125,000-a-year job, he cited Mr. Boyle's "extensive experience in finance, administration, labor relations, construction, budget control and crisis management."
 For most of his career, Mr. Boyle, 58, has been an entrepreneur with interests in concrete, construction and real estate. While few could dispute his success as volunteer chairman of the Westchester hospital, not all of his business dealings have fared as well.
 Federal Court records show that one of Mr. Boyle's partners in a concrete business was among a group of trustees who were removed from a pension board by the Federal Government, which said they had allowed a union official with ties to organized crime to misuse money.
 In addition, Mr. Boyle and his partners sold their concrete business to a company that Federal investigators have said is linked to the mob. That company is now in bankruptcy and still owes Mr. Boyle about $250,000 for the 1988 transaction. Also, a condominium project that Mr. Boyle tried to develop in Vermont went into bankruptcy midway through construction and is still faced with unsettled claims.
 "Given the history of the convention center, the Governor shouldn't want anyone other than someone with a perfect record of having no association with organized crime and a track record of running a convention center in a major city," said William J. Stern, a private investor who formerly headed the state's Economic Development Corporation. "The center has never been run by anyone with the appropriate experience. Now the beat goes on."
 Mr. Boyle acknowledged the pervasive existence of organized crime in the concrete and construction business, but he said he had successfully fought for more than two decades to keep it out of his own companies. He said he was not aware until long after the fact of any mob associations involving his partner or the purchaser of their company. And like other entrepreneurs, Mr. Boyle said, he lost money on some of his ventures.
 Mr. Boyle said that he planned to surround himself with managers who have convention center expertise, but that he did not want to disclose his specific plans for removing the mob element because doing so would "build up too much animosity" before his arrival. "I can't wait to prove the skeptics wrong," he said.
 After graduating from LaSalle University, Mr. Boyle began working for a New York City concrete company, where he advanced in administration and operations. By 1967, Mr. Boyle was a part owner of Westchester Concrete, a company in Tarrytown, N.Y., that he said eventually grew to generate $25 million in annual revenue, with 150 full-time employees.
 In more than two decades at Westchester Concrete, Mr. Boyle said, he gained "a lot of experience keeping corruption and organized crime out" of the company. He said he had negotiated more than 25 labor contracts, with unions including the United Steel Workers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
 In 1984, Westchester Concrete merged with N & W Concrete of White Plains and in 1988, the merged companies were sold for $4.5 million. For his 25 percent stake in the company, Mr. Boyle was to receive $1.1 million. But he and his partners did not receive all of the proceeds from the transaction, nor did they emerge from the concrete business unblemished.
 One of the partners, Louis Nappi, who held a 50 percent stake in Westchester Concrete, was one of a number of trustees removed in 1983 from the pension board of a teamsters local in New York. A Federal judge accused the trustees of allowing pension money to be misused by a union official who had ties to organized crime.
 The company that bought Westchester Concrete was Valente Industries of the Bronx, which later went into bankruptcy and still owes Mr. Boyle and his partners about $1.3 million. Federal inquiries have alleged that Valente, one of the area's largest suppliers of concrete, has links to organized crime. Valente officials have denied the allegations. Telephone calls seeking further comment from Valente officials were referred to John Hasluck, a New York lawyer at the firm of Crocco & DeMaio. Mr. Hasluck did not return calls.
 Mr. Boyle said he was never aware of Mr. Nappi's problems with the teamster pension board. He said, however, that he had warned Mr. Nappi "to stay out of those union trusteeships."
 Also, Mr. Boyle said that Mr. Nappi recommended that they sell Westchester Concrete to Valente. "I had never met the people from Valente until the night before we closed," Mr. Boyle said.
Mr. Nappi confirmed in an interview that the sale was largely at his instigation and he termed the transaction "a mistake."
 Another company owned by Mr. Boyle, Rogene Industries, has also taken its lumps. Set up as a shell company to manage some of the extraneous assets acquired when Mr. Boyle first bought Westchester Concrete, Rogene eventually ventured into real estate development, but with only marginal success. In its 28 years, Rogene has built a branch building for a Westchester County bank, rehabilitated an automobile showroom to serve as offices for Westchester Concrete and tried to develop a condominium community in Vermont during the 1980's.
 The Vermont project stalled shortly after getting off the ground, Mr. Boyle said. "Several lots were never developed," he said, and as a result, the condominium project has lost about $1.5 million and is still trying to settle claims.
 Since 1992, Mr. Boyle has worked primarily as a consultant, earning fees to manage A. Barletta and Sons, a family-owned construction company in Hazleton, Pa. Documents issued by Mr. Pataki's office cite Mr. Boyle's "expertise in corporate turnaround," and say that he "returned the company to seven-figure profitability" and "continues as board chairman and consultant to the company."
 What Mr. Boyle has actually done, however, is liquidate the assets of A. Barletta, which employed 80 workers and was operating under bankruptcy protection when he took it over.
 At the Hudson Valley Hospital, Mr. Boyle is chairman of the 30-member board of trustees, and is credited by hospital officials with providing important leadership and guidance to administrators. In 1988, when he assumed the leadership, the 120-bed hospital had an operating loss of $800,000, on revenues of $21 million, and the possibility of a shutdown loomed large.
 Under his guidance, the hospital reversed its course. By 1991, it had an operating surplus of $1 million, and the hospital expects another surplus this year. "He's the first board member who looked at the hospital as a business," said Jane Morabito, the hospital's vice president of patient services.
 About one mile from the hospital is the Pataki Farm, where the Governor grew up. When Mr. Pataki was a State Assemblyman in the late 1980's, he joined the hospital's board at Mr. Boyle's invitation. Mr. Boyle said that some time after that, he lent Mr. Pataki $10,000 to help subdivide the farm for development. "I told him I could help him," Mr. Boyle said. "I wanted some consideration when it was time to consider a builder."
 The property is still undeveloped, and Mr. Boyle said the loan had not been repaid. A $10,000 payment that he acknowledges receiving last year from Mr. Pataki's campaign committee was a bonus for volunteer work he had done on the campaign, not a repayment for the loan, said Mr. Boyle. "I probably had five or six hundred hours in," he said. "Bonuses were given to paid staffers and to volunteers. I felt I deserved it. I didn't want to be left out."

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Retreat, With Dow Falling 12.79

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks retreated yesterday as traders took profits from the week's record-setting rally.
 After recording its 16th high since Feb. 15 on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average declined 12.79 points yesterday, to 4,192.62. For the week, the Dow was up 34.93 points. But the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks edged up 0.34 point, to 506.42, a new high. And the Nasdaq index rose 0.89 point, to 814.69, helped by a rebound in technology stocks. 
 Declining stocks led advancing issues, 1,141 to 980, on active trading of more than 314 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Stocks were weighed down in part by concerns that a slowing economy would hurt corporate profits. Further evidence of a slowdown came after the Labor Department reported that manufacturers' payrolls shrank in March as the nation's unemployment rate inched up one-tenth of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
 Analysts said stocks were starting to look tired after their recent record-setting run.
 "The market has just kind of run out of gas," said Jay Meagrow, institutional trader at McDonald & Company.
 The market shrugged off another sharp drop in the dollar against the Japanese yen. The dollar settled in New York yesterday at a record low of 83.82 yen, down from 85.27 yen on Thursday.
 Wall Street has not been particularly worried about the dollar's slide, partly because it expects that the weak currency will help United States exports.
 But some analysts said further weakness in the dollar could make stocks vulnerable to the possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to attract foreign investors to the currency.
 Ron Hill, investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said the weaker-than-expected jobs data might also have given rise to worries that the economy could be slowing more abruptly than investors had expected.
 "There's a little question the slowdown may be a little less gentle than people expect and that would certainly be negative for profits," he said.
 Among technology stocks rebounding from recent profit taking, Micron Technology rose 1 3/8, to 76 1/4, and Intel was up 1 5/8, to 87 1/8.
 Du Pont fell 2 3/8, to 62 3/8, on concern over a planned reissue of a portion of shares that it repurchased from Seagram, the Canadian distiller.
 Seagram fell 1 3/8, to 26 1/2, in heavy trading on concern about its expected acquisition of 80 percent of MCA, the entertainment unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial.
 The New York Stock Exchange Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.05 point, to 273.73. The average share was down 1 cent. The American Stock Exchange index was up 0.48 point, to 469.35. The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of Big Board, American and Nasdaq issues -- was at a new high of 4,957.79, up 2.03, or four-hundredths of 1 percent.
 In Tokyo, stocks ended only slightly lower despite the sharp rise in the yen against the dollar. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed down 96.37 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent, at 15,719.50.
 "Sellers are becoming cautious, taking into account the possibility that the dollar may rebound if Japan unveils comprehensive measures to boost the economy and stem the yen's rising trend," said Kenzo Doi, an analyst at Kokusai Securities.

HEADLINE: Messinger Ventures West of 12th Avenue

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, April 7

 BODY:
Like New Yorkers, residents of China's largest city have a reputation for aggressiveness, savvy and style. But when it comes to comparisons, there is no Shanghai equivalent to Manhattan. With 14 districts instead of 5 boroughs, Shanghai has no single cultural, financial and political center.
 Nor is there an equivalent to Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger, who visited Shanghai this week with a dozen New York businessmen and three members of her staff. 
 One Chinese official wondered aloud what a local official was doing in China talking about international business, since government work of the districts here typically concerns only matters like housing and municipal infrastructure.
 Ms. Messinger described her tour -- Shanghai is the fourth of six Asian cities she is visiting -- as a way "to deepen economic, cultural and governmental ties between New York City and Asia."
 Yet the trip also seems to be a chance for her to act mayoral and to engage in the nebulous field that businessmen and politicians like to call "building relationships," relationships that may, or may not, lead to some meaningful investment or cultural exchange.
 Rudolph W. Giuliani has never traveled abroad as Mayor, but Ms. Messinger joins a long list of borough presidents who have journeyed far from home turf. Claire Shulman has visited Portugal, which has close historical ties to Queens, and herself went to China to promote Queens in 1988. Fernando Ferrer has pushed the Bronx in Israel. Howard Golden last year visited Brooklyn's sister city, Anzio, Italy.
 On Thursday, Ms. Messinger worked on her relationship with Han Zheng, head of Lu Wan district, who asserted that his district was actually the Manhattan of Shanghai. Lu Wan, something like the Upper East Side in size and temperament, is competing with two rival areas for Ms. Messinger's affection, which may lead to designation as an official sister district of Manhattan.
 Lu Wan's strongest draw is Huai Hai (pronounced HWAI-high) Road, the city's premier shopping street, even if nearly half of it is under construction. Mr. Han, looking clean-cut in a navy blue suit, showed off the street to his visitor on Thursday and was eager to impress her.
 "The first McDonald's in Shanghai is on Huai Hai Road," he boasted.
 Mr. Han spilled a long list of plans and statistics about construction and office space. Ms. Messinger studiously scribbled notes, nodding steadily.
 Over an eight-course lunch, Mr. Han got down to business.
 "How is the Chinese food in New York?" he asked.
 Ms. Messinger, grappling with a slice of sauteed squid that kept slipping between her chopsticks, replied diplomatically. "We have many different kinds," she said, "but none are as good or as beautifully served as this."
 Mr. Han, one of his aides noted, is widely expected to rise to a citywide post one day. What is Ms. Messinger's future, the aide asked.
 "She's going to run for mayor in two years," said one businessman on the trip, James Jao, chairman of the Long On Group, a conglomerate of trading and consulting companies based in New York.
 For those accompanying Ms. Messinger, the trip is a way to get formal introductions to officials in Asian cities where they want to do business.
 While other New York borough presidents say they usually pay for their own trips, the businesses represented in the delegation are paying for Ms. Messinger and her staff, although local Chinese officials are picking up most hotel and meal expenses. Ms. Messinger's husband, Andrew Lachman, a public school administrator, paid his own way on the trip, she said.
 Ms. Messinger, who said she had not officially decided whether to run against Mayor Giuliani in 1997, described the trip as an outgrowth of the work she already does as Borough President to encourage Asian investment in New York. The delegation, which has so far also visited Beijing, Changzhou, Seoul and Hong Kong and plans to visit Taipei.
 "People do business with their friends," she said. "We've been able on this trip to expand friendships and build on the relationships we already had."
 Andrew Breslau, her director of communications, put it another way: "Economic integration is proceeding. You have to surf it."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A New Mexican Bond Fails to Materialize

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 7

 BODY:
When Mexico's economic crisis was taking a turn for the worse in early January, Government officials promised that in two weeks they would introduce a new kind of treasury bond to replace those that were pegged to dollars and which had been identified as a principal cause of Mexico's economic troubles.
Three months later, the Government not only has failed to create a new bond, but officials now also concede that they are unlikely to bring to the market any version of the dollar-based bonds -- known as tesobonos -- this year. Instead, they say they will raise funds by offering commericial paper sometime after May that would be backed by loan guarantees from the United States, if the market accepts it. 
 "It is difficult to see any tesobono auction before the end of the year," said Alejandro Valenzuela, director of international affairs for the Mexican Finance Ministry and the Government's chief spokesman on Mexico's economic recovery plan. "The instrument today simply has no credibility."
Few investors will be sorry to see the bonds disappear. "Good riddance to them, absolutely," said Jeffry H. Taylor, an analyst at NatWest Washington Analysis. The success of the Government's new financing plans will lie in whether the recovery measures continue to progress, he said, and the market continues the slow improvement it has shown over the last two weeks.
"It may not be the best time to offer anything but I think it's a realistic scenario," Mr. Taylor said.
Mr. Valenzuela said: "We have to regain Mexico's reputation, but that takes time. Right now, there is no market for us. Not even short term."
He expects that situation to continue until at least May. Then the Government will test the market, probably with an issue of commercial paper handled by American commerical banks and brokerage houses.
"The candy on the post for the offering will be the U.S. guarantees," Mr. Valenzuela said. The guarantees, as arranged under the agreement signed by the two countries, allow Mexico to issue instruments backed by the United States Government for up to 10 years. He said the first offering could be pegged to the United States Treasury bill rate, plus 250 basis points.
"We have to sit down with the market makers and see what is the appetite for this kind of issue," he said. "We want it to be big enough to achieve a critical mass and reduce costs. But it is very important that the deal comes out as a good deal for investors and successful for us because it will be our first exit to the market after the crisis."
Thomas J. Trebat, head of emerging markets research at Chemical Bank in New York, thought that the Mexican officials might be overly optimistic in their target interest rate for the new offering. "It sounds tight," he said, "but possible."
Mr. Valenzuela said that if the proposed offering was successful, Mexico would try to move toward medium-term notes and then eventually long-term bonds.
As for the tesobonos, the Government has already all but put a stake through their heart. No auction of the bonds has been held since Feb. 15, and that auction was limited to $210 million. During 1994 the weekly tesobono auctions sometimes exceeded $1 billion.
Mexico's debt just in tesobonos grew to almost $30 billion by the end of 1994.
Mexico has since reduced the amount of outstanding tesobonos to approximately $15.5 billion. It has done so by using $7.5 billion from the International Monetary Fund and $5.2 billion from an aid package offered by the United States in January. Mexican officials anticipate that by the end of 1995, only about $5 billion in tesobonos will remain in circulation.

HEADLINE: Bold Plan Seeks to Wrest Control of Federal Lands

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

DATELINE: ALAMOGORDO, N.M.

 BODY:
When it comes to outsiders, especially those wearing military uniforms and suits, the ranching and logging families of Otero County have always been a little suspicious.
But one newcomer, a Los Angeles lawyer whose monogrammed white shirts and splashy ties contrast with his clients' dusty boots and jeans, has become something of a hero. 
 He is John Howard, 46, president of the Individual Rights Foundation, a conservative public interest law firm in Los Angeles. The foundation has joined with the county's ranchers, loggers and public officials in a sophisticated legal and political campaign to fight the Federal Government's efforts to curb environmental damage by restricting grazing and logging on public lands.
The centerpiece of the effort is a lawsuit that Mr. Howard filed in January in Federal District Court in Washington on behalf of the county and three of its wealthiest ranchers. In it, he argued that the Government had no authority to own and manage the public domain in New Mexico, and that control of the land should pass to the state and, ultimately, to Otero County (pronounced oh-TAIR-oh).
If the suit is successful -- and Mr. Howard says his foundation intends to take the case to the Supreme Court, if necessary -- it would completely change 150 years of ownership and management practices for more than 500 million acres of Federal land in the West.
"Because of how these lands have been managed, there has been a fundamental breaking of trust across the West," Mr. Howard said. "People at the local level are eager to claim more authority to determine what's best for them. For the last 10 years, the Federal Government has been giving these people the back of its hand."
The Justice Department and New Mexico's Attorney General, Tom Udall, a Democrat, say the constitutional theory underlying the suit has no basis in law and predict it will fail. In March, the Justice Department filed suit against Nye County, Nev., arguing that the steps the county's commissioners had taken under an identical legal theory to gain control of public land and intimidate Federal land managers were unconstitutional. Mr. Howard also represents Nye County in that case.
Conservationists say that the legal tactics used by Western ranchers, timber companies and mining conglomerates represent the well-financed efforts of a minority eager to cash in on lucrative Federal subsidies that support their way of life.
"What this is all about is money," said Faye Lee, a retired English teacher and publisher of "A Hoot and a Holler," a local environmental newsletter here. "The community has been all stirred up by a few people who see an opportunity to make a lot of money if the laws change. It's not going to work. Those lands are the public's lands. They aren't the domain of a few people who think it's theirs."
Mr. Howard's lawsuit is based on the Constitution's "equal footing" clause, which gives new states entering the union the same powers and authorities as the original 13 states. Mr. Howard believes that when Western states were admitted to the union, they were denied equal footing because the Federal Government retained vast amounts of land.
Mr. Howard argues that a 1987 Supreme Court decision, written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, lends credence to his interpretation. In that case, the Court voted, 5 to 4, to uphold Utah's authority to bar the Government from leasing lands underlying Utah Lake for oil and gas development. The Government contended that it had the right to issue leases because it owned the land beneath the huge reservoir. Utah said that under the equal footing doctrine, title to the lake bed passed to the state when it entered the union because the original states retained lands under navigable waters.
"The way I read that decision," Mr. Howard said, "Justice O'Connor is leaving the door open for our case. The message inherent in the Utah lands case is you get the votes if you ask the question."
But Lois Schiffer, the Assistant Attorney General for environment and natural resources, said the courts had consistently upheld the Government's authority to own and manage the public domain in the West.
The Government contends that when New Mexico became a state, in 1912, its constitutional convention voted to "forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within" its borders.
The Government also argues that the United States Constitution's property clause vests Congress with "power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations" with respect to Federal land.
Ms. Schiffer said: "What they are plainly trying to accomplish is a court decision on the question of whether counties or states have ownership of what we would regard as Federal land. We think the theory does not have merit."
It is almost logical that Otero County, which borders Texas on the south and is larger than Connecticut, is the scene of a legal shoot-out with historic ramifications. This tortured landscape of desert, steep mountains and thick alpine forests still has fewer than 50,000 residents and was once used by Billy the Kid to hide from his pursuers. Nearly 50 years ago, when the Army tested the first atomic bomb in the desert 60 miles northwest of Alamogordo, the county seat, Federal officials told local ranchers blown out of their beds that the giant blast was caused by an accidental explosion of an ammunition depot. It was the start, many residents say, of the distrust between citizens and the Government.
Slightly less than 90 percent of the land in Otero County is owned by the military, the Federal Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service. For most of this century, the patterns of ownership and management of these grazing and timber lands suited local ranchers and loggers just fine. The Government charged cattlemen a minimal fee to graze their animals on Federal land. The Forest Service paid for the roads that helped loggers clear-cut Ponderosa pine and fir from the Sacramento Mountains.
In the late 1980's, though, the Government began to restrict logging and grazing under pressure from environmentalists and Congress. Because of rules to protect endangered animals, the region's streams and other natural assets, the number of cows grazing in Otero County declined to 25,000 last year, from 35,000 in the 1970's. Similar rules led the Forest Service to restrict to 2.1 million board feet the amount of timber taken out of the Lincoln National Forest last year, as against 20.5 million board feet in 1988.
Many residents found other jobs in the county's increasingly diverse economy. Otero County is becoming a mecca for retired people and a center of small manufacturing and service industries, and its economy supports a civilian labor force numbering 20,000 jobs, swamping the timber, ranching and mining economy in size and importance.
But prodded by angry loggers and ranchers, who turned up by the hundreds at public meetings, Otero County unanimously approved ordinances in 1992 and 1993 that were intended to loosen the restrictions by giving the county more authority to participate in decisions on managing Federal land.
Then Charlie T. Lee, a prominent rancher, introduced leaders here to Mr. Howard, whose foundation agreed to represent the county in its lawsuit for $5 a month. The foundation is the legal arm of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture, a conservative research group.
The ranchers in Otero County say the issue of access to Federal resources is a historical right.
"This is about power," Mr. Lee said. "It's a struggle to re-establish the rights of people to live their lives and conduct their business with much less interference from environmentalists and the Government."

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Rose to 5.5% During March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
The slackened pace of economic growth showed up clearly in the job market last month as factories failed to add workers for the first time since September and the unemployment rate inched up one-tenth of a point, to 5.5 percent, Labor Department figures showed today.
 The March results, a bit weaker than expected, were further confirmation that the economy, as policy makers desire, is decelerating rapidly to about half its breakneck 5.1 percent growth pace of late 1994. 
 With the economy still digesting the impact of a doubling of short-term interest rates over the last 14 months, analysts said the Federal Reserve was quite unlikely to raise rates again soon, even though doing so would provide some support to the badly battered dollar.
 "What you see suggests the soft-landing scenario is right on track," said John R. Williams, a senior economist at Bankers Trust. "It's probably exactly what the Fed would like."
 The financial markets showed little reaction after the employment report was released this morning, although stocks and bonds slipped later in the day.
 Payrolls expanded by a moderate 203,000 last month, 41 percent less than in February, with the telltale temporary help category losing 35,000 jobs. Manufacturers' payrolls, which had swelled by an average of nearly 40,000 from October through February, contracted by 4,000 last month while the factory workweek and factory overtime each fell by 12 minutes.
 As a result, the output and operating rate of American industry may have fallen in March, a development that would "obviously attenuate inflationary concerns," said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
 Moreover, Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, said average hourly earnings advanced a modest three-tenths of 1 percent last month and only 2.8 percent over the last year.
 "There's no sign of inflation at all from wages," which account for more than two-thirds of business costs, Mr. Reich said in an interview.
 Separately, the Federal Reserve reported today that consumers took on $8.2 billion more in installment debt than they repaid in February, the third straight month in which credit-card, automobile and other nonmortgage loans expanded by less than $10 billion. By contrast, outstanding loans rose by more than $10 billion -- and in August by more than $15 billion -- in eight of the nine preceding months.
 Much of the payroll growth in today's job survey reflected jumps of 58,000 in construction and 42,000 in amusement and recreation services, both of which owed much to unseasonably mild weather. There was also a 36,000 gain in health services, its biggest in a year. Employment in the finance, insurance and real estate category climbed 17,000, recovering most of the losses it had suffered since August.
 But retail and wholesale trade was flat and the bulk of the overall payroll increase was the 159,000 jobs that the Government assumed were created by new businesses not yet picked up by its statistics.
 The Labor Department's survey of households, meanwhile, showed a 149,000-job increase that combined with 203,000 more people in the labor force to produce an unemployment rate of 5.46 percent, scarcely above February's 5.43 percent but one-tenth of a point higher after rounding. Before seasonal adjustment, this survey showed a gain of 600,000 jobs.
 The ranks of those jobless for more than six months rebounded last month by 140,000, to 1.3 million. This group now accounts for 19 percent of the unemployed, twice the proportion that prevailed before the 1990-91 recession, observed Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics.
 By region, the biggest change last month was an increase, to 4.6 percent from 4.3 percent, for unemployment in the Midwest, where manufacturing is an economic mainstay. The jobless rate also edged up in the South, to 5 percent from 4.8, and in the Northeast, to 6 percent from 5.9. The West, however, improved for the second straight month, with unemployment easing to 6.2 percent from 6.4, despite the fact that the rate for California edged higher. Illinois and Massachusetts both saw unemployment skid to about 4.5 percent, but the rate for New York rose five-tenths of a point, not a statistically significant amount, to 6.6 percent.
 The Labor Department's monthly tally also found that 7,610,000 employed people, or 6.1 percent, held two or more jobs last month, up 434,000 from the March 1994 level. Over the same period, however, the number of so-called discouraged workers -- people who have given up looking for jobs because they think it futile -- fell by 79,000, to 454,000.
 Last month, 55.6 percent of industries were adding to payrolls compared with 58.6 percent in February, the Labor Department also found. Among manufacturers the proportion was 46.4 percent, down from 50.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Turn Lower on Report Suggesting Inflation Threat

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
After four days of gains, prices of Treasury securities turned lower yesterday when a report suggested that inflationary pressures were still a threat.
 The report, the Columbia University inflation index, quickly pared early gains from a Government report that said the economy had added fewer jobs than expected last month, pointing to a slowdown. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 18/32 , to 10227/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.39 percent, from 7.34 percent on Thursday and back to levels a week ago.
 Traders said the selloff was caused by a rise in the Columbia University inflation index for March, which came in at 112.3, higher than the preliminary 111.9 in February, but lower than the revised February number of 113. The market had expected the index to fall to 110. Traders note that since the market has already priced in a slowing economy, any news suggesting otherwise will cause some investors to cash in and wait for more conclusive news.
 Earlier, bond prices briefly rose about a half-point after the Labor Department said the economy added 203,000 jobs, fewer than the 230,000 expected. In the same report, the nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.5 percent from 5.4 percent.
 Anthony Chan, chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio, said the decline in the factory workweek to 41.9 hours versus 42.1 "confirms the pause in activity that was seen in the recent orders components of the National Association of Purchasing index, the Chicago Purchasing index and the Philadelphia Fed regional survey."
 The gain in average hourly earnings, Mr. Chan said, suggested that although the economy's inflationary pressures might be dormant, they could reappear in the not-to-distant future. "Consequently, it is safe to say that the end to short-term interest rate increases is still not behind us," he said. "This view was reinforced by this morning's sharp upward revision in the Columbia University's inflation index for the month of February."
 Rosanne M. Cahn, chief economist, equity research department at CS First Boston, said she did not believe that the employment report would persuade the Fed to quit its current holding pattern. But if demand for labor firms, the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for loans could well be pushed up another 50 basis points, to 6.50 percent, when the Fed next meets, on May 23. "As this expectation is not currently embodied in the fixed-income market," she said, yields could fall lower over the next two months.
 In the municipal bond market, where investors have voiced concern that the shortage of new issues so far this year has made securities too expensive, prices were little changed yesterday, as increased demand from mutual fund managers offset concern about prices.
 The average yield to maturity for the Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues was down one basis point, to 6.29 percent, from the previous day. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Lumber Moves Up on a Report Of Louisiana-Pacific Cutbacks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Lumber prices recovered some ground yesterday after the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation said it was suspending some mill operations, reducing supplies to lumberyards and home builders.
 Rising prices for lumber, cotton and other commodities pushed the Commodity Research Bureau index to its highest since last June 17, rising 0.78 point, to 237.29. 
 Lumber prices rose after Louisiana-Pacific said it had stopped production at its mill in Walla Walla, Wash., and was considering similar action at two of its mills in Montana because of recent low prices.
 The closing at the Walla Wall mill could last up to three weeks, a company executive said, reducing supplies by an estimated eight million board feet a month.
 Lumber prices have been weak as higher interest rates slow the housing industry, reducing demand. About 70 percent of the lumber produced in North America is used in construction.
 May lumber rose $3 to settle at $264.20 for every 1,000 board feet on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
 The May and July cotton contracts rose their daily trading limit for the fourth consecutive day amid speculation that an export sale to China would drain already tight United States stockpiles.
 Traders said a large sale of cotton was made to China in the last few days, possibly as much as 300,000 bales, for shipment both before and after this year's crop was harvested.
 Cotton for May delivery on the New York Cotton Exchange rose the 2-cent daily limit, to $1.0422 a pound, while July cotton also gained 2 cents, to 99.10 cents a pound.
 Soybean prices rose after Brazil moved on Thursday to raise the minimum guaranteed price paid to farmers, which could put more soybeans into Government reserves and keep them off the export market. Brazil is the world's second-largest soybean producer and exporter after the United States.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Plunges to a Record Low Of 83.71 Yen, Off 16% on Year

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled again to a post-World-War-II low against the yen yesterday as Japanese institutional investors sold dollars to limit their potential foreign exchange losses on United States assets.
 Japanese insurance companies and banks have been selling dollars in expectation that the dollar could fall further against the yen, currency dealers said. 
 "The dollar is still looking for the bottom," said Hidetoshi Yanagihara, vice president and currency trader at the Industrial Bank of Japan in New York. "Japanese insurance companies and banks are hedging their U.S. investments."
 The dollar fell to 83.71 yen, its lowest since the end of World War II. In New York, it also set a record low, ending at 83.82 yen, down from 85.27 yen on Thursday.
 At yesterday's rate, the dollar is down 16 percent against the yen since the beginning of the year.
 The dollar has suffered because Japan has a $66 billion annual trade surplus with the United States, meaning its exporters have a steady supply of dollars to sell for yen when they send revenue back to Japan.
 Those sales intensified in March as exporters brought money home before the end of the fiscal year on March 31. Now, there is new pressure on the dollar as Japanese insurance companies and banks try to hedge their investments for the year.
 "It's a crazy market," Mr. Yanagihara said. Few Japanese investors or companies expected the yen to rise so far, so fast, he said.
 The dollar also suffered from expectations that the Bank of Japan would not cut a key interest rate. Many dealers expected a cut in the discount rate after Japanese officials hinted that one might be in the offing.
 Lower rates often hurt a country's currency by making deposits there less attractive. Many traders said they were skeptical about whether a rate cut would slow the yen's ascent because the Bank of Japan's discount rate on overnight loans to the country's banks is already at a record low 1.75 percent, compared with the United States discount rate of 5.25 percent.
 But the dollar was steady against other leading currencies yesterday. The dollar edged up to 1.3779 German marks, from 1.3735 marks on Thursday. After touching a postwar low of 1.113 Swiss francs on Thursday, the dollar ended yesterday at 1.1288 francs, up from 1.1270 francs in New York late Thursday.
 "The dollar is starting to form a base against the mark," said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "People still want to sell it for yen, though."

Finding Friends Among Competitors

BYLINE: By David Gonzalez 

 BODY:
NO money down.
 Down, more like broke and depressed, is how Jesus Rodriguez felt after an accidental fire incinerated his Bronx hardware store one July morning in 1992. Within hours, flames destroyed his business and five others that shared a bustling stretch of Tremont Avenue. They nearly destroyed any chance of rebuilding. 
 "What collateral did we have?" Mr. Rodriguez said. "Only our word and our track record."
 Those intangible assets were not enough for city officials, who had descended on the smoldering scene with promises of grants, advice and low-interest loans. No interest and red tape is what Mr. Rodriguez ultimately got from the city, while he's still trying to settle with his insurer.
 But if his word wasn't good enough for bankers or bureaucrats, it was enough to trigger the compassion of his landlord, other merchants and even his competitors, who came through with Sheetrock, tools and financing. Like a salesman who fervently believes in his product, Mr. Rodriguez did it himself, laying out the store design, painting walls and building displays.
 After nearly a three-year absence, he wondered if he and his father would sit in an empty store once they opened their doors. Never mind, the customers flocked to General Hardware before the doors were installed.
 "My first order came when they were taking a load of paint off the truck," Mr. Rodriguez said. "A guy was parked in a car and asked how much for the paint. We made our first sale -- $34.99 for five gallons."

MONTHS after the flames had died down, so too had Mr. Rodriguez's hopes of rebuilding. In his mind, the only image that he could conjure was the burned-out store where he had perfected his trade after dropping out of college.
 Although he was a partner in another hardware store, business there was slow, and creditors were bearing down on him. His wife dropped out of college and went to work, while his mother chipped in with baby-sitting duty when she wasn't working as a manicurist.
 City officials originally told him he could get a $250,000 low-interest loan. But the official who made that promise never returned his phone calls, Mr. Rodriguez said, while higher-ups later denied making any such offer. Months passed. Little happened.
 "They promised a lot but nothing came through," Mr. Rodriguez said. "We could have been in business two years earlier if they had kept their promises."
 But one of his biggest boosters was his father, Pedro, a former grocery store owner who was now his partner in hardware. In trying to rebuild the store, he got a glimpse into what his father went through when he immigrated from Cuba with nothing more than hope.
 "When we lost this business I felt sorrier for him than anyone else," he said. "He worked 20 years to build it and everything was lost in four hours. But he was able to keep himself together and he always had the feeling, if we did it once we can do it again."
 Mr. Rodriguez's landlord eventually financed his return to the block, although he lost time in rebuilding because of a bureaucratic glitch. A phantom street that was mapped but never built on the property delayed the issuance of a building permit. Construction finally began last year.
 Then he learned there was honor among hardware sellers.

THE Morales brothers from Uptown Lumber in the Bronx gave him Formica and Masonite for counters, telling him to pay when he could. A contractor donated metal beams left over from a job in Manhattan. Joey from the New Palace Paint Store a few blocks away lent him a paint sprayer for a week. Free.
 "I sell paint and sundries like he does," Mr. Rodriguez marveled.
 For a guy who grew up selling behind a counter, this was one lesson he had yet to learn. Tears come to his eyes when he talks about it.
 "It made me see things differently," he said. "You shouldn't take things for granted. You should always be grateful for what you got and be honest with yourself, because when you're down in the gutter, that's when you find out who your real friends are."
 A few days ago, the store was cold, but business was warming up.
 "Diga, primo," Mr. Rodriguez said to his customers. "Talk to me, cousin."
 Around him, the shelves and walls were crammed with everything from night lights to pipes and pans to kitchen sinks, as workers hauled in bags of cement. If he doesn't have it in stock, he tells customers where they can find it down the street.
 While he always prided himself on price and service, he said the struggle to reopen made him even appreciate how hard his customers have to work for their money.
 "We've brought down the markup a good percentage," he said. "It's good that people see you're not here to make a killing and you try to provide the best service you can. Don't turn anybody away, because we didn't have anybody turn us away."
 At least nobody in the hardware business.
 Talk to me, cousin.

On the Face of It, Yankees' McDowell Is Excited

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., April 7

 BODY:
Jack McDowell shaved off part of his beard but left a Fu Manchu mustache and enough facial hair to possibly create trouble. Danny Tartabull strutted into camp and declared himself on time and ready. Buck Showalter began the opening of Spring Training II with an obsessive look that did not exist around the replacement Yankees.
 The Yankees attracted roughly 250 fans to their training complex today, three times as many as the replacement team drew for its first session. McDowell, John Wetteland and Tony Fernandez have been added to a team that had the elite record in the American League last year. 
 Did someone whisper pressure?
 "We got a chance to win it all, a real good chance," said McDowell. "All eyes are on us as the team to beat. That's a good place to be."
 The best place to be for the Yankees was simply in a uniform and on the sun-drenched field. Most players admitted that being back before fans was exhilarating. Like every spring, everyone felt a pennant was possible on the first day. Fans and players alike.
 "We kind of have a sour taste in our mouth after what happened to us last year," said Tartabull. "It looked like we would be there in the post-season. Then the unthinkable happened. It's unfinished business for us. We have work to do once we step on the field."
 Before McDowell tossed a pitch, the former White Sox right-hander was the target of one fan's hostility. Standing about 20 feet away from a bench on which McDowell sat with the pitching coach, Billy Connors, the man shouted at the unsigned pitcher about the players' strike and its effects.
 "How many jobs were lost because $5 million wasn't enough, Jack?" the fan asked. "How much was lost in the South Florida economy? One-hundred million dollars?"
 McDowell never turned around, never flinched and the fan eventually left when the workout began. Proving to be as cool and as he is shrewd, the 29-year-old former Cy Young Award winner has also declined to discuss his negotiations because he figures no one wants to hear about $20 million contracts now. But McDowell stressed his preference for a long-term deal.
 "I'm looking to stay put and know I'm going to stay put for a number of years," said McDowell, who spent his first seven seasons with Chicago before leaving after last season. His agent is due here this weekend to negotiate with the Yankees.
 The owner George Steinbrenner's policy allows mustaches that do not grow below the upper lip. McDowell might have violated that regulation with facial hair that resembles that of Goose Gossage of Yankee years past. McDowell's beard has been trimmed, but his mustache drooped to his chin with a patch of hair beneath his lower lip.
 "It's something that's important to him," said Showalter, who took McDowell for a ride in his golf cart. "If it's important to him, then it's important to me. Jack is getting off to a clean start and trying to make a good impression."
 McDowell said he missed his beard. "I've been wearing it so long," he said. "Hopefully, I'm fitting in and we can win a championship."
 He later added: "It doesn't really have to be a story, does it? Baseball is back. Can we discuss baseball?"
 There were six hours of baseball, a morning workout for established players and an afternoon session for everyone else. Typically, Don Mattingly received the loudest and longest ovation. Typically, Tartabull, Paul O'Neill and Jim Leyritz hit the loudest and longest homers. Tartabull was also ribbed incessantly by teammates for not returning phone calls in the off season.
 "If I were a fan, I would be psyched that the real players are back," Tartabull said. "Major leaguers are major leaguers. You saw that today."

 
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The Yankees tendered contract offers to JACK McDOWELL ($5.3 million), JOHN WETTELAND ($2.225 million), JIM LEYRITZ ($742,500), PAT KELLY ($810,000) and SCOTT KAMIENIECKI ($235,000) -- all at the salaries they made last season. They can file for arbitration between next Wednesday and Friday.

Baseball's Unemployed Work Out and Wait

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., April 7

 BODY:
They put their uniform pants on, like players in baseball's 28 other training camps, one leg at a time. They ran laps and sprints, did calisthenics, threw, took batting practice. The only difference in this 29th camp was that the players who began the belated version of spring training did so without jobs.
"We're going to call ourselves the Homestead Homies, the team of the misfits," Randy Velarde, formerly of the Yankees, said at the end of the 1-hour-50-minute workout. 
 On the first official day of spring training for regular major leaguers, 29 jobless players showed up today for the start of this camp organized by the union. They are baseball's free agents, unsigned players of varying talents who do not belong to any team and so have nowhere to work out. They are all hungry for work, but the nearly eight-month strike set back the clubs' timetables and reduced their budgets for signing players.
Many of these players will still be jobless when the season opener is played April 25, which has made anxiety an uninvited visitor in the camp.
"I'm going to be here for however long it takes to land a job," said Mike Felder, an outfielder who has played with four teams in his career.
More players are expected in the next few days. More scouts are expected, too, than the one who arrived at camp today.
Some of the the game's best free agents remained at home while their agents intensified negotiations with prospective employers. The players in camp generally ranked below that top category of players, and if they get jobs at all will command salaries far below the multimillion-dollar level popularly associated with coveted free agents of the past.
"There's no disgrace being here," said Dave Stewart, a pitcher with 14 years of major league experience. "There's no reason to be ashamed about being here. If there wasn't a strike, we wouldn't be here."
But Chris Sabo, formerly with the Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore Orioles, reflected the anxiety of the players here when he said: "You would think the teams, if they want you, would want you before games start. There are only 10 or 11 games. You'd think they'd want you to get used to your teammates. I'm not going to sit down here forever."
The camp, which might be called Camp Fehr after the union leader Donald Fehr, is being operated by the Players Association in an effort to help the more than 150 free agents be in shape to play when, and if, they are offered contracts.
"We want to make sure we get them into as good a shape as we can without getting them hurt, and get them out of here as quickly as possible," said Jackie Moore, a former major league manager and coach, who is running the camp. ("I'm a free agent like everybody else here," he noted.)
Located about 30 miles south of Miami, the complex is the newest in Florida. Completed in 1991 at a cost of $22 million, it was devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, six months before the Cleveland Indians were scheduled to move in. An $8 million repair has made the facility seemingly as good and attractive as any, starting with the pink facade of the stadium, which is the centerpiece of the five-and-a-half-field complex.
Working out in the stadium today were some players who could offer strong competition for many major league teams. "I'd take this club now and go to Phoenix with it," said Moore, referring to one of the two new expansion sites.
The group on hand for the first workout lacked only a closing relief pitcher. It could field Dave Magadan at first base, Mariano Duncan or Scott Fletcher at second, Velarde at short, Sabo at third, Mickey Tettleton as the catcher and Howard Johnson, Mike Devereaux and Felder, Candy Maldonado or Lloyd McClendon in the outfield.
Stewart, Bobby Witt, Todd Stottlemyre, Scott Sanderson and Erik Hanson would form the starting rotation.
Velarde is here because the Yankees, he said, offered him a $200,000 salary, less than a fifth of his 1994 salary of $1,125,000. "I expected a cut," he said, "but that's chopping you off, leaving nothing but toes."
Asked how long he would stay in camp, he said: "It's hard to put a timetable on it. I'd hoped to be just a couple days. I'm saying that optimistically, but who knows. I don't plan on being here the whole camp. I would like to think just a week and if nothing happens in a week, I'd probably just go home."
But the plans are mixed. When Devereaux was asked how long he would stay in camp without a job, he said: "Did I bring enough clothes? Well, I'm not going to go home in a week if I'm not signed."
And Tettleton said: "I haven't even thought about it. I'm just glad to be back in a baseball atmosphere."
Tettleton and his fellow campers found one new touch to their environment -- women leading their calisthenics. Ann Marie Miller and Peggy Rose were among the exercise leaders, assigned by Reebok, the shoe manufacturer that had planned to be one of the sponsors of an all-star tour of major league players if the strike had continued.
"It looks like they're in pretty good shape," Miller, a New York exercise physiologist, said of the players.
Some of the players liked the plan Moore has adopted for their workouts. Figuring veterans know what they have to do to get into shape, he will let them proceed at their own pace.
Derek Lilliquist liked the absence of P.F.P. -- pitchers' fielding practice, which is a hated staple of all other camps. "The only thing we didn't do that we'd normally do in camp is cover first a hundred times," he said. "I know where first is."
But he and the other pitchers will soon become reacquainted with it just in case. "What they don't know," Moore said, "is tomorrow they will be introduced to it again."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From House Speaker's Address on the First 100 Days

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the speech to the nation tonight by Speaker Newt Gingrich, as provided by the Federal News Service, a transcription company:
Thank you for joining me tonight and for this chance to give you, the American people, a report on the new Congress: what we've been doing, what we hope to do, and how we're working to keep faith with what you sent us here to do. . . . 
 Last September, the House Republicans signed a Contract With America. We signed this contract and made some promises to you and to ourselves. You elected us, and for the last 93 days we have been keeping our word. With your help, we're bringing about real change. We made Congress subject to the same laws as everyone else. We cut Congressional committee staffs and budgets by 30 percent. And we voted on every item in the contract. And I can tell you tonight we're going to sell one Congressional building and privatize at least one Congressional parking lot.
While we've done a lot, this contract has never been about curing all the ills of the nation. One hundred days can't overturn the neglect of decades.
The contract's purpose has been to show that change is possible, that even in Washington you can do what you say you're going to do.
In short, we wanted to prove to you, and I think to us, that democracy still has the vitality and the will to do something about the problems facing our nation. And it seems to me that whether you're a conservative or a liberal, that is a very positive thing. . . .
What I want to talk with you about tonight is not just what a new political majority on Capitol Hill has accomplished in 100 days, but how all of us together, Republicans and Democrats alike, must totally remake the Federal Government, to change the very way it thinks, the way it does business, the way it treats its citizens. After all, the purpose of changing Government is to improve the lives of our citizens, to strengthen the future of our children, to make our neighborhoods safe and to build a better country. Government is not the end. It is the means.
We Americans wake up every morning, go to work, take our kids to school, fix dinner, do all the things we expect of ourselves, and yet something isn't quite right. There's no confidence that Government understands the values and realities of our lives. The Government is out of touch and out of control. It is in need of deep and deliberate change.
Now, when that change is accomplished, then perhaps Americans will be able to sleep a little better at night and wake up feeling less anxious about their futures. . . .
We sincerely believe we can reduce spending and at the same time make Government better. You know, virtually every institution in America except Government has re-engineered itself to become more efficient over the last decade. They cut spending, provided better products, better education and better service for less.
But I believe we must remake Government for reasons much larger than saving money or improving services. The fact is, no civilization can survive with 12-year-olds having babies, with 15-year-olds killing each other, with 17-year-olds dying of AIDS, with 18-year-olds getting diplomas they can't even read.
We must start by recognizing the moral and economic failure of the current methods of government. In these last 100 days, we have begun to change those failed methods. We outlined 10 major proposals in the contract that begin to break the logjam of the past. The House passed 9 out of 10.
We passed the balanced-budget amendment in the House with bipartisan support. It has been temporarily defeated in the Senate by one vote. . . . Don't be discouraged. Senator Dole has said he will call it up for another vote. The momentum is with us. And with your help and your voice, I believe it is possible this amendment will pass later in this Congress.
As promised, we introduced a constitutional amendment on term limits, but we failed, even though 85 percent of House Republicans voted for it. . . . I pledge to you that term limits will be the first vote of the next Congress. So keep the pressure on. Keep your hopes up.
In both the House and the Senate, we passed the line-item veto, just as you asked. It's remarkable that a Republican House and a Republican Senate are giving such a strong tool to the President of the other party. I believe it shows our good-faith determination to cut spending.
Other contract proposals have passed the House and are being worked on in the Senate. . . .
The purpose of all this change is not simply a better government. It is a better America. A truly compassionate government would replace the welfare state with opportunity, because the welfare system's greatest cost is the human cost to the poor. . . .
We need to promote economic growth by reducing regulation, reducing taxation and reducing frivolous lawsuits. And everywhere I go, Americans complain about an overly complicated tax code and an arrogant, unpredictable and unfair Internal Revenue Service. This summer we will begin hearings on bold, decisive reform of the income tax system. We're looking at a simplified flat tax and other ways to bring some sense to the disorder and inequity of our tax system. . . .
I want to reassure all of you who are on Social Security or who will soon retire that your Social Security is fine. No one will touch your Social Security, period. But we must make sure that the baby boomers' retirements, which are coming up in the next century, are as secure as their parents'. Unfortunately, the money the Government supposedly has been putting aside for the baby boomers' Social Security is not there. The Government has been borrowing that money to pay for the budget deficit. So when the baby boomers get set to retire, where's the money to pay them going to come from?
"Well," you might ask, "can't the Government just borrow more money?"
The honest answer is "no". No system, no country is wealthy enough to have unlimited borrowing.
The answer is clear. The key to protecting the baby boomers' Social Security is to balance the budget. That way, by the time the baby boomers retire, the Government will be financially sound. It'll have the money to pay them.
The problem is not Social Security, after all. Social Security would be fine if the Federal Government would stop borrowing the money. The Government can stop borrowing the money when we balance the budget. It is just that simple. . . .
Next month we will propose a budget that is balanced over seven years. The budget can be balanced even with the problems of the Federal Government. It can be balanced without touching a penny of Social Security and without raising taxes. In fact, spending over all can go up every year. We simply have to limit annual spending increases to about 3 percent between now and 2002. The key is the willingness to change, to set priorities, to redesign the Government, to recognize that this is not the 60's or the 70's. This is the 1990's, and we need a government to match the times.
As I said, Social Security is off the table. But, you know, that leaves a lot on the table -- corporate welfare, subsidies of every special interest. Defense is on the table. I'm a hawk, but I'm a cheap hawk.
As the budget battle rages over the coming months, you'll hear screams from the special-interest groups. I'm sure you've already heard the dire cries that we're going to take food out of the mouths of school children, that we're going to feed them ketchup.
The fact of the matter is, all we did was vote to increase school lunch 4.5 percent every year for five years and give the money to the states to spend because we thought they would do a better job than the Federal Government of managing the children's meals and the school lunch program. . . .
Whatever the arguments, this remains a country of unparalleled possibilities. I was talking the other day to a fellow who does business in Europe. He said what impresses people overseas is that Americans can change faster than anybody. That's why we're competitive once again in the world. We as a people have the natural ability to respond to change. That is what we do best when the Government is not in the way. Our potential is as great and prosperous as it's ever been in our history. From now on, all roads lead forward.

HEADLINE: Renewed Repression in Kenya

 BODY:
Kenya's President, Daniel arap Moi, has an easy answer for critics who charge that his Government is corrupt and dictatorial. They are, he says, all in league with Uganda-based Communist guerrillas out to overthrow his Government.
The latest to be smeared by him are Kenya's conservative Roman Catholic bishops. In a pastoral letter Sunday, the bishops lamented that "too many of our people are living in fear," and complained that "it would seem there is no law, no justice, no protection, except for the powerful." Similar concerns have been expressed by international human rights organizations and the State Department. 
 The bishops join a long list of critics threatened with or subjected to retaliation by the thin-skinned Moi regime. The brunt of repression has fallen on parliamentary opponents, two of whom were briefly detained this week, and independent human rights advocates. An emblematic case is Koigi Wamwere, now on trial for his life on what Amnesty International considers trumped-up charges. A determined opponent of tribalism, brutality and corruption, Mr. Wamwere has been a political prisoner for most of the past two decades.
The Moi Government has also threatened to expel the Nairobi correspondents of Time, Newsweek and The Washington Post. Earlier this year, it briefly detained United States Ambassador Aurelia Brazeal, even though this Clinton appointee had made a point of muting the vociferous human rights advocacy of her Republican predecessor.
Mr. Moi seems worried that accurate reporting could threaten Kenya's privileged position among foreign investors and aid donors. Kenya has successfully marketed itself as East Africa's most stable and one of its economically most promising countries. This reputation has drawn multinational corporations to Nairobi, brought millions of dollars in tourist revenues and attracted substantial foreign aid. International donors recently pledged $800 million in new aid to Kenya, and the United States alone plans to give nearly $20 million for 1995.
Ordinary Kenyans have not benefited much from the aid and tourist spending. Annual per capita income is a mere $340. But those close to the regime have done a lot better. That is why the Moi Government has always been attentive to international opinion. That opinion must now be heard, before the last remnants of independent politics, and Kenya's stability itself, are lost.

HEADLINE: In America;
The New Slavery

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The transaction took place right beside me, in the chill of early morning, on a slatted bench at the edge of Central Park. The dealer counted the money, folded it, and nodded. The buyer slid the packet, probably containing heroin, into his jacket pocket.
"Thank you, my brother," said the buyer. The dealer smiled. The two young men stood and clasped hands, then walked off in different directions. 
 Thank you, my brother. Thank you for the opportunity to shoot up, to get high, to wallow in the degradation of addiction, to contract disease, hepatitis perhaps, or maybe AIDS. Thank you so much, my brother.
Whenever I see black people involved in any way in the drug trade I think of the prototypical Uncle Toms, the black Africans who sold their brethren into slavery. Thank you, my brother. Excuse me while I clamber aboard this ship. Thank you.
Something similar is happening with drugs. Much of the heroin and cocaine that comes into the United States is shipped through Nigeria, which has become one of the world's great drug-smuggling and money-laundering centers. Enormous amounts of drugs produced in Asia and Latin America are delivered to Europe and the United States by networks headquartered in Nigeria. It is estimated that a third to nearly a half of all heroin that reaches the U.S. passes through Nigeria. Couriers from Nigeria are in prisons around the world. The U.S. State Department has classified Nigeria as an international drug trafficker -- in effect, an outlaw nation -- and has imposed sanctions. But the trafficking and the money-laundering continue.
The effect of this flourishing of evil in a country that once was the pride of its continent has been deeply tragic. Drug abuse in Nigeria and neighboring countries has surged. And Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, the Washington-based lobbying group, said, "The dramatic increase in drug consumption in South Africa is directly attributable to Nigeria."
Thank you, my brother.
Narcotics trafficking is not the only evil flourishing in Nigeria. A report issued last fall on the country's human rights abuses was titled, "The Dawn of a New Dark Age." Succinctly put, Nigeria is in shambles. Gen. Sani Abacha's military dictatorship has crushed all opposition. There is not even the pretense of a democracy. The economy has collapsed, despite extensive oil resources. There is 100 percent inflation and extreme unemployment. The per capita income, which was $1,000 in 1980, has plunged to $250.
Nigeria has become a nation of sorrow, its crumbling infrastructure mirroring its economic, social and educational decline.
Mr. Robinson has organized a national campaign, supported by a large group of prominent American blacks, to push for the restoration of democracy and the rule of law in Nigeria. Except for the color of the oppressors, Mr. Robinson noted, there is very little difference between the abuses in Nigeria today and the abuses that prevailed for so long in South Africa.
"Nigeria should be completely isolated," Mr. Robinson said. "Politically, economically and socially."
It is highly unusual, probably unprecedented, for American blacks to speak out so loudly about the abuses of a black African regime. It is a major step, a triumph of outrage over a deeply imbedded (and profoundly destructive) sense of collective mortification. We have closed our eyes and kidded ourselves for too long. It is only in the never-never land of denial that barbarism by blacks is less evil than barbarism by whites. When someone denies you your freedom, or puts a bullet in your mother's heart, or a needle in your baby's vein, the correct response is not thank you, my brother.
Randall Robinson would like the United States to boycott Nigerian oil. Until changes are made, he would like the international community to treat Nigeria as a pariah. He is on to something. Barbaric behavior, by anyone, cannot be tolerated.
I would like to see a similar high-profile effort launched by African-Americans against some of the evils occurring here at home. Randall Robinson knows there is great power in ostracism. It is a lesson that more of us need to learn.

HEADLINE: Fish Don't Observe the 200-Mile Limit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your coverage of the fisheries dispute between Canada and Spain helps inform the public of a problem global in scope: too many people chasing too few fish. Such a situation cannot continue indefinitely. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations has recently warned that some 70 percent of the world's fish stocks are either fully utilized, overfished or rebuilding from previous overfishing. 
 Nonetheless, at the same time catch effort continues to grow. The dispute between Canada and Spain is but one manifestation of the pressures in a number of world locations created by the reality of a finite resource and economic pressures for continued exploitation.
Your March 28 and March 31 news articles on the dispute contain an inaccuracy about the relevant law of the sea. In the March 31 article you say, "Canadian initiatives, for example, led to the extension of territorial seas from 3 miles to 200 miles." Canada has not extended its territorial seas to 200 miles; the 200-mile limit of Canada refers to the limit of the Canadian exclusive fishery zone, a zone that has a basis in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and in customary international law.
There is a substantial difference between the two zones. In the territorial sea the coastal state has total sovereignty with the exception of the necessity to recognize the right of innocent passage by ships of other states. In the exclusive fishery zone the coastal state has sovereign rights over fishery resources and other designated functional rights and jurisdictional capacities.
The dispute between Canada and Spain is occasioned by the fact that the fish do not respect the 200-mile limit and swim beyond it into the high seas, where they become subject to capture by fishing vessels of other states.
The problem of such "straddling" stocks is being addressed by an ongoing fishery conference at the United Nations. It will be in the interest of effective fishery management worldwide that a multilateral agreement be achieved so that unilateral actions of the type seen in the northwest Atlantic do not have to be repeated.

McDonnell Douglas Gets Order for Dutch Copters

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation beat a French-German venture yesterday for a Dutch military helicopter order valued at $845 million. The Government chose an upgraded version of the Apache attack helicopter, flown by the United States Army during the Persian Gulf war, over the prototype Tiger, produced by Eurocopter, which is 60 percent owned by Aerospatiale of France and 40 percent by Daimler-Benz Aerospace of Germany. 
 The award was good news for McDonnell Douglas, which has seen its aerospace business decline because of military cuts and the recession in the worldwide air travel industry. The Dutch Parliament will negotiate the final contract, which is expected to call for 30 helicopters.

The Daily Digital

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY SEE THE handwriting on the computer screen saying, "NEWSPAPERS ARE EXTINCT." Some of these anxious folks work for newspapers and are fairly described as prematurely gray. Some are politicians frankly impatient for the day. Some are professional historians, expert in the burial of the horse and ocean liner. Some are professional futurists who, when television first appeared, airily predicted the burial of film and radio.
That newspapers live on borrowed time is not a new idea. I have always thought them a precarious business, no matter how great the journalism. Just think about the technology of The New York Times: it trucks processed trees from the forests of Canada down into the center of New York, stamps the pulp with inked impressions, cuts, folds and bundles the product into individual papers and trucks these back toward the readers, two-thirds of them scattered along the East Coast from Richmond to Portland, Me. Every day. 
 And every day, this method of distributing news grows more, well, charming. That is why both the adventurous and fainthearted among us are anxiously turning news dispatches into electronic packets and launching them into the still-primitive Internet, hoping that our journalistic seed will flourish in electronic form. But much of this energy is misdirected. The technology of the newspapers of 2020 is already in sight. It's the content that warrants fretting.
NEWSPAPERS DO CONFRONT A SHORT-TERM problem. Big advertisers, who used to pay 90 percent of a big daily's cost, continue to shift their allegiance to other media, thus forcing on readers an increasing share of newspaper costs. And now computers are poised to strip newspapers of those highly profitable small-print ads that list Help Wanted and Houses for Rent and Sale. Computers are good at keeping lists and searching them for precisely your size Tudor in the town you want at a price you can handle. The time is near, therefore, when computers at home or at a shopping mall kiosk will take over the classified business and, for a fee, print out the list of homes you want to inspect or the jobs you want to seek.
Computers are also good at digging up last week's reviews of the movies in your neighborhood and ordering your tickets. They can dredge up last month's travel article about Mexico along with the airline schedule and hotel roster. And they can quote stock prices any time of day together with a thorough briefing on the company's profits and competition. If newspapers don't learn to transform their listings and archives into a computer business, someone else will.
Even now, computer screens and desktop printers are good enough to convey that kind of raw data and archival research -- by and large information that you already know exists and specifically want. Although such information has been appearing in newspapers, it is not journalism.
And fortunately journalism -- that melange of engagingly written and illustrated reportage, analysis and opinion about the most important, surprising and interesting events of the day -- does not sit well on computer screens. Real reading on the best of screens is cumbersome and disorienting. Random scanning is even harder. The convenience of getting a package of selected, ordered, palpable and portable news on paper will keep good newspapers in business for at least another generation -- until these same conveniences can be rendered electronically. But sooner or later, they surely will be.
Of all the speculative designs for the electronic newspaper of that hardly distant day, I favor two models that are likely to coexist through much of the 21st century. Call them The Tabloid Tablet and The Ephemeral Express.
The tablet will be a portable screen the size and thickness of this magazine. It will project articles and information downloaded from a home computer or, eventually, a satellite transmitter. The "cover" of the tablet can be a familiar front page, with posterlike illustrations and summaries of articles that reflect the values and judgments of a particular journalistic team. Touch any headline or image and the screen will display a longer article or chart and related indexes to still other material on related subjects.
The tablet's cover images can be as rudimentary as a book's table of contents or as vibrant as the front of USA Today. On every page, the touch of an image will bring forward both what you asked for and some unexpected material, thus replicating the fun of leafing through a newspaper. Every page on the portable screen could also carry an advertisement, which at your touch would bring up more information about a product or service. In time, the tablet will also learn to respond to spoken commands and, when you're driving, to read its contents out loud.
Still more readable and scannable will be The Ephemeral Express, a journal printed every night by your home computer on endlessly re-usable paper in inks that disappear after 24 hours. As thick as you choose, this sheaf will contain extensive coverage of the subjects you've requested and also articles and advertisements that the editors you have chosen judge suitable for someone with your professional and personal profile.
You will be able to read this journal anywhere, like a newspaper, but you'll return all its pages to the computer for re-use in future editions. On command, the computer could retain and file any article or image you designate, and print it out on ordinary paper at any time. Obviously you could subscribe with this machine to any number of newspapers and magazines.
These are not pipe dreams. The Knight-Ridder Information Design Laboratory, headed by Roger Fidler, has been experimenting with designs for a hand-held flat-panel computer screen that he calls a "personal information appliance." And Jerome Rubin, the chairman of the News in the Future program of M.I.T.'s Media Lab, has shown a strong interest in printing on paper with "reversible ink."
So it is not technology that will kill off newspapers. On the contrary, technology will give them new functions and features and a global reach. The newspapers that prosper in the next century will be the ones that offer the best journalism, that master the subjects about which they write and acquire the talent and expertise to appraise and explain an infinite variety of events.
Oddly, that simple, self-evident proposition will be resisted in some newspaper companies because it turns the habits of decades upside down. All too many papers have prospered by investing heavily in manufacturing and marketing while shortchanging the newsroom. That is because new technologies have been cutting factory costs -- virtually eliminating printers, for example -- while traditional news gathering has become steadily more expensive.
The ultimate economies of distributing information are at hand. Volumes of news, customized for each subscriber, can be sent around the world and into the home at trivial cost. But gathering that news, assessing its significance and explaining it to readers with varying needs and interests will become ever more labor-intensive. Newspapers can trust the fermenting computer industry to perfect the technologies that will gradually replace their presses and delivery trucks. It's talent that they will need to survive in the digital age -- gifted editors, reporters and image artists who can find meaning in the approaching information glut

HEADLINE: If They Built a Memorial to the War In the Streets

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
The war memorial may be our most distinguished form of "victim art." For generations, American cities have carved out special places to honor those who have sacrificed their lives for a cause. From Augustus Saint-Gaudens's Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw to Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial, artists have sought to wrest dignity and meaning from conflict and death.
The projects presented on these pages, many realized on site via computer graphics, commemorate people killed in a war that may never be officially declared. They are casualties of urban violence. School children, subway riders, shop clerks: people who found themselves on the losing side of a battle for the right to dwell in cities without risking their lives. 
 These seven projects were inspired, in part, by those impromptu offerings -- flowers, photographs, handwritten testimonials of love and remembrance -- that have blossomed on New York City streets in recent years like some exotic new perennial. These ephemeral offerings mourn individuals. But they also lament a set of collective losses: loss of community, of control, of respect for the dignity of life. When The Times Magazine asked Ellen F. Salpeter, executive director of Threadwaxing Space, a not-for-profit Manhattan exhibition space, and Anne R. Pasternak, executive director of Creative Time Inc., a national public arts organization based in New York, to commission the proposals, the hope was that the memorials would suggest ways to give the civic dimension of random street crime an enduring, public form.
An enduring form on a more intimate level is practiced by a Manhattan outfit called the Victim Services Agency, a kind of Red Cross for the urban wounded. The agency is misnamed, really, for the task of its social workers is to convince crime victims that they are actually heroes. It is to help them regain power over their lives.
The artists who created these projects have faced a similar challenge. Though occasioned by social calamity, their projects are offered in the optimistic belief that a city can shape its fate.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Neil Estern -- AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER?
"Urban violence and murder within the community take such a variety of forms that I am inclined to look for a universal symbol," says Estern, a veteran public monument sculptor whose most recent commission is a life-size sculpture of Fiorello LaGuardia. His proposal for a bronze figurative sculpture located in Central Park links contemporary tragedy to the story of Cain and Abel -- the first murder, according to biblical tradition.
Cain holds the rock; Abel tries to deflect the blow. But the two figures are intertwined, irrationally inseparable. In the 19th century, Realist painters sought to depict the heroism of everyday life. Estern's sculpture evokes the daily inhumanity of life in the urban jungle.

Laurie Anderson -- THE BLOOD FOUNTAIN: MONUMENT TO MURDER
Red liquid gushes from a groove at the top and an opening on one side of Anderson's 50-foot-high monument. As the liquid flows down the sides into a circular pool at the base, it stains the white marble scarlet. The pool is ringed with red lights that illuminate the fountain at night. Anderson, a world-renowned performance artist and musician, adheres to the City Beautiful ideal of adorning major civic spaces with heroic sculpture. A fountain of blood is probably not what City Beautiful architects had in mind, but then they did not envision a city where children pass through metal detectors on entering school.

Glenn Ligon -- MEMORIALS
"For after all life is but a procession of shadows, and God knows why it is that we embrace them so eagerly, and see them depart with such anguish, being shadows," wrote Virginia Woolf in "Jacob's Room," her fictional elegy for a young man killed in World War I. Ligon's project makes a painful stab at pinning down fleeting lives: a series of plaques commemorating murder victims, each mounted on a wall near the site where the murder occured. A photograph, dates of birth and death and brief quotes by friends or relatives recalls the victim with yearbook poignancy.
The city is full of plaques marking the lives and homes of great achievers. Ligon's placques would mourn the death of potential. "Murder is the end of possibility," writes Ligon, a 34-year-old conceptional artist whose works have been exhibited at the Whitney. "We say: 'He was turning his life around' or 'She was just about to start her first real job.' " (PHOTOGRAPH BY FRED R. CONRAD/THE NEW YORK TIMES)
 
Gary Simmons -- JUST TO GET A REP
 
Killed for a pair of designer sneakers: that was early shorthand for the moral disintegration of inner-city youth and for the predicament of a society that is very good at creating a desire for status symbols, less resourceful when it comes to inspiring people with the hope.
Simmons's memorial, a set of gilded metal footprints modeled after sneaker soles, commemorates those who had not yet reached the age of 25 when they lost their lives. And the site -- a subway station -- reinforces the theme of transitory life. Simmons, whose work is frequently about the influence of black youth culture on the overall American society, says: "The memorial is both a cautionary reminder and perhaps a comfort to those who look down at their feet when they are afraid to make eye contact with another passenger while riding the train." (FRED R. CONRAD/THE NEW YORK TIMES)
 
Pepon Osorio -- FAMILIAS
 
We make the dead work hard. It's not enough that, in life, they had to drive a cab, punch a keyboard, wait on tables. After they're gone, we call on their memory to restore a sense of wholeness to the communities that failed them.
To memorialize taxi drivers slain on duty, Osorio, a Bronx-based artist known for his community art, proposes a series of "portraits" -- videotapes, personal memorabilia -- installed inside working cabs. The portraits would focus also on the survivors, to show how their families were affected by the loss. Osorio says that "this is not an installation about mourning; rather, it serves as a vehicle to enhance awareness and instigate meaningful change." (FRED R. CONRAD/THE NEW YORK TIMES)
 
Mel Chin -- GOUGE
Caryatids are cruel. Classical columns sculpted into human form, they stare out impassively from the facades of buildings, unmoved as they survey the cityscape of human ups and downs. Mel Chin, celebrated for work that deals with environmental and social issues, has created a caryatid in negative, a fallen architectural angel. Gouged with deliberate brutality out of two marble columns, thereby jeopardizing the stability of the building they support, Chin's ghostly figure wants to rock the scale of values that ranks real estate higher than life.
"Gouge" also protests what Chin calls the "janitorial approach to tragedy," those "evasive and sanitizing strategies that the modern world invents to keep our minds free from contemplation and reaction." Sweep it up, scrub it down, turn it into tabloid fodder. (DIGITAL IMAGE MANIPULATION BY TAM MILLER AND DALLAS MOORE)
 
Carrie Mae Weems and Jeffrey Hoone -- ODDS ARE AGAINST YOU
All it takes is a dollar and a death wish. Or, as they used to say, your money or your life. Weems and Hoone's memorial is a pop art take on fate, a look at the city as a diabolical pinball arcade. Designed for a public site in Harlem, the project would be modeled after the machine used to select each week's winning Lotto numbers. A new ball pops up every 21 minutes, corresponding to the national murder rate. The balls are color-coded to represent the ethnicity of the victims; the numerals represent their ages.
"Odds are against you" suggests how precipitously the stakes have risen in the city of economic extremes. As the middle ground drops away, the options narrow: it's instant riches or sudden death. But, hey, you never know. (DIGITAL IMAGE MANIPULATION BY TAM MILLER AND DALLAS MOORE)

HEADLINE: [APPEARANCES];
FEEL THE BURN

BYLINE: By Mary Tannen; Mary Tannen regularly contributes to the Magazine. Her new novel, "Loving Edith," will be published next month.

 BODY:
TEN MINUTES AFTER MEETING CAROLE Maggio for the very first time, I was lying supine on the bed in her hotel room while she sat in a chair by my head chanting "pump, pump, pump." She's from Los Angeles and doesn't stand on ceremony. Besides, she has a mission. She wants to persuade people to use exercise instead of surgery to help their aging faces look younger, and she has written a book to show them how -- "Facercise," due out this month from Berkley Publishing.
When I walked in the door, Maggio destroyed any resistance I might have had by taking two Polaroids, front and profile. I was not allowed to smile, duck my head or arrange my hands across my chin -- usual ploys when confronted by a camera. As a result, it was all out there: the incipient dewlaps, the crooked mouth, the crevasses some call smile lines. I was appalled. Most people are, Maggio said. (She's had women return the photos, believing they'd been given the wrong one, and Maggio has had to point out that the "stranger" in the picture was wearing the exact same blouse.) Your own aging face is a terrible thing to confront. If Maggio said she had exercises that would give me wider eyes, higher cheeks, a plumper mouth and a firmer chin, I was willing to suspend disbelief. 
 Maggio's own face is testimony to her method. All right, she wears plenty of makeup, maybe even false eyelashes, but at 49 she has skin that's virtually wrinkle-free. Her cheekbones are high and broad. When she invited me to feel, I discovered they were muscle, not bone. She created those cheeks and she can flex them at will. In conversation, Maggio uses her face the way a dancer uses her body, with economy -- distinct muscles expressing particular emotions. For 11 years she's been pumping the muscles of her own face, though she claims she can make a visible difference in others in a matter of days.
Her method is to work individually with a client for three intensive, consecutive sessions. She has done faces in London, Tokyo, Jordan and Brunei, and they love her in Hollywood. She showed me before and after photos of a 42-year-old woman who traveled that week from Tennessee and booked a room in the same hotel so that Maggio could help her overcome the effects of Bell's Palsy, which had left her face paralyzed on one side. The first picture was of an attractive blonde with one side of her mouth pulled down. In the second photo, her mouth was straight. When the woman left after three days, Maggio said, "I can't even pull away from her, she's hugging so hard."
Maggio put me through 10 exercises lying down and 3 sitting up. I used my fingertips for resistance and also to prevent effort lines. She taught me to isolate each muscle. (I tended to use all at once.) As in weight training, she had me "go for the burn," picking my head up from the bed to increase the tension. She encouraged visualization -- "imagine the sides of your face lifting."
I promised to exercise faithfully, morning and night, 11 minutes a session. Maggio wanted me to exercise in taxicabs, while driving, while talking on the phone. Sleep on your back, she said, with the pillow under your knees; put tape on your forehead so you don't frown in your sleep. I could promise only to be faithful, not fanatical.
My friends and I used to think facial exercises were a big joke. But we were younger then. Now that our faces are lengthening into something out of Grant Wood's painting "American Gothic" (the one with the pitchfork), some of us are casting about for wholesome alternatives to surgery. Exercise has worked on our bodies to keep them lifted and firm, why not our faces?
LAST FALL I RECEIVED VIDEO AND AUDIO tapes, plus a booklet of face exercises, from Laura Hart of Newton, Mass. (Face Life, 800-905-2211). I handed the packet off to G., who ever since she hit 40 has been threatening to go under the knife to restore the chin of her youth. I completely forgot about having given G. the tapes until a couple of months later when I found myself looking across the table at her during a dinner party, wondering what she was using on her face. It looked plumper, less lined. Then I remembered -- the exercises.
The difference between the methods of Maggio and Hart is the difference between Los Angeles and Boston. Maggio gives clients three days to master the 13 exercises; Hart advises building up to her 40 exercises over the course of three weeks. Hart, who is 55, demonstrates each exercise on the video, mentioning such refinements as "almond-shaped nostrils" and "rainbow-arched brows." Instead of going for the burn, she flexes, then stretches, individual muscles or muscle groups.
Adepts who've mastered the routine can dispense with the tapes and do the exercises once a day for 10 to 20 minutes. (Hart says she can do them in 7.) At the beginning of Hart's video, there are some striking befores and afters. In three months, one dieter lost her double chin, yet filled out her cheeks.
Maggio and Hart don't claim that exercise will do much for skin. They maintain that working muscles makes them thicker and shorter. Plumped-up muscles lift droopy skin and fill in for decreasing subcutaneous fat.
I began pumping away, using Maggio's exercises, hoping for miracles. In a matter of weeks, I seemed to be getting more compliments from women, more flirtatious interest from men. No longer the helpless victim of aging, I was bending time's arrow the other way.
When I called some plastic surgeons in New York to ask about facial exercises, however, they were less than encouraging. Dr. Helen Colen cautioned that exercise doesn't do much for the skin and could even deepen lines. Working the masticator muscle could give someone a square jaw. From Laura Hart's before-and-after pictures of herself, I could see that she had definitely acquired a square jaw. But it was firm. Dr. Mark Erlich said that aging was a problem of sagging skin and disappearing subcutaneous fat and he didn't see how exercising muscles could help. He did say that in surgery now, muscles are being tightened by elevating them with sutures, sort of like a pleat, to create a more natural-looking result. Exercise might bring some benefit -- a fuller, firmer face -- but he didn't see it as a great source of promise.
Now six weeks into the exercises, after careful and considered scrutiny of my face next to those Polaroids, I can't say I'm seeing miracles. But the cheeks are higher and fuller, the mouth plumper and more symmetrical, the chin more resolute. The biggest changes are inside my head. This souped-up face feels stronger and sexier. And as my friend T. once said when we spotted a certain hot Hollywood actress who was reveling in the notice she was attracting on the street, knowing she was the most beautiful woman on the block if not in the universe, even though we could plainly see a sag below her chin: "It's conviction. It's all conviction."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Hyundai Accent;
Immigrant With an Education

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
ONE of my pet peeves, one that I have muttered about in my beard until I am gray in the face, is the taste that car makers have for alphabet soup. The auto executives even admit privately that their nomenclature -- offering J30's, MX-6's, C280's, etc. -- creates confusion within their own offices.
But regular names have their problems as well. My wife has insisted for years that we will never buy a Mitsubishi because it is too hard to say. And you hear some strange pronunciations of Toyota's Paseo. But the name that seems to confuse more Americans than any other is Hyundai. 
 Consensus notwithstanding, the cars are not "Huh-Yundaze." Nor are they "Hi, Undies." No, unmangled, Hyundai should rhyme with Sunday. But it is certainly fitting that the Korean company's new offering is called the Accent.
For 1995, the latest little kid on the block can be had as a three-door hatchback or a four-door sedan, and the cars replace the Excel, which has gone to sit on its laurels as Hyundai's biggest seller, albeit not one that distinguished itself for quality.
As one of America's least expensive automobiles, the Excel posed warranty and image problems for the manufacturer even as the car helped to establish the Koreans as a real force in the market. Now, though, Hyundai says that it has addressed quality-control issues and that it expects big things of its new small model.
The Accent, five years in the making, is indeed quite different from its predecessor. It is a bubble of a car, slick and short, with little overhang at the rear. Bumpers flow smoothly into the body for aerodynamic advantage, and they can be thumped at 5 miles an hour without damage. Side-impact protection has also been improved, and the sides of the body are made from single pieces of steel to cut vibration while reducing weight.
That saves fuel, of course, and plastic is used extensively in the battle against heft and cost. In fighting trim, including plastic hubcaps, the Accent sedan weighs a paltry 2,100 pounds or so, making it lighter than a two-seat Mazda Miata. Fuel economy is rated at 29 miles a gallon in town and 38 on the highway with the manual transmission.
The test car was of the four-door variety, done up in today's hot color and perfect for Easter. In short, it was an egg in the purplest purple I've seen. Hyundai calls it "indigo pearl," but then the marketing guys also call some of the seven other colors things like cashmere and noble white.
A week's worth of driving evoked more interest from other drivers and their passengers than I expected. But whether the stares and finger-pointing -- mostly from women -- were a result of the all-new profile or the eye-popping color is hard to say.
The least expensive Accent is the plain-jane "L" hatchback at $8,484. A fancier version has a sticker of $8,984, and the sedan costs $9,484. (All figures include a $405 delivery charge.) The test car was tagged at $11,404, with $1,920 worth of accessories in the form of a four-speaker stereo system, air-conditioning, power steering and a manual, tilting sunroof.
The car did not have anti-lock brakes, a $650 option, or the $730 electronic four-speed automatic transmission. The standard transmission is a five-speed stick.
The car rolls on all-season tires mounted on 13-inch wheels that look stingy even on a subcompact. What is surprisingly generous, though, is the car's trunk. It is easy to load, with liftover at bumper height, and the cargo capacity is a roomy 10.7 cubic feet.
For a tiny car, the surprise extends to the back seat, where legroom is adequate and headroom is quite good. The lower cushions are a bit short, but four adults can manage nicely -- if they don't have to manage for too far. The cushions are extremely hard.
Also, like so many cars today, the Accent has rear windows that go down only partway. And the knobs for all of the windows are guaranteed to make you cranky. The knobs are plastic, shallow and hard to grip, and they make heavy work of opening and closing the glass.
Up front, buckets flank a wee console from which the shifter sprouts. And like the rest of the car, the front compartment is an odd mix of Spartan and serendipity.
There are no power side-view mirrors, for example. No power locks or windows. There is no tachometer. But there are adjustable seat belt mounts, a feature usually associated with luxury cars. And the Accent has grab handles, front and rear. There are remote latches for the trunk and fuel-filler lids. It even has a dead pedal for the driver's left foot.
Dual air bags are also standard, and the designers have managed to tuck a good-sized glove box under the passenger bag.
With the hood, you have to fend for yourself, lifting and propping, but the lid is light. The engine should pose no difficulties, Hyundai says, since it is what the company calls "self-adjusting." That means there are self-adjusting valves -- three for each of the four cylinders -- and an electronic ignition to minimize maintenance. The 1.5-liter engine, mounted sideways and sending 92 horsepower to the front wheels, has the distinction of being the first ever developed "in house" by a Korean manufacturer.
The designers in Seoul also opted for four-wheel independent suspension, and they gave the car a wheelbase an inch longer than that of last year's Excel, while whacking more than 7 inches off the car's length.
All of that translates into a reasonably pleasant experience. The engine moves the car with sufficient zip, and the usual thrash and whine of such small beasties has been kept to a minimum. Given its low price and high utility, one might even rate the car as A-O.K. If one were into alphabet soup.

INSIDE TRACK: Short on price, short on length. Probably not for the long haul.

HEADLINE: No Sprawl, Please. This Is Connecticut.

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
UNLESS a lot of thinking in Connecticut changes for the better, Laura Weir Clarke warns, in two decades the state could look like -- horror of horrors! -- northern New Jersey.
That means, she said, a place of sprawling malls and superstores with huge parking lots, gridlock traffic congestion, more air pollution, more noise and less open space, fewer barns, fewer trees, fewer fields, fewer traditional New England vistas. "We could see the utter degradation of the Connecticut landscape in 20 years," she said. 
 Ms. Clarke is executive director of the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, an organization that notes its 20th anniversary this year. It has headquarters in Hamden in a building that fits its name and purpose, a 19th-century building that once was a boardinghouse for single workers at Eli Whitney's nearby gun factory.
The trust is a small organization -- some seven full- and part-time workers -- and for most of its existence has concentrated on preserving historic buildings. More recently, however, it has become involved in opposing "commercial sprawl," what it considers the overdevelopment of the state's suburbs with huge shopping malls and megastores that have contributed to the economic decline of the cities and are now, the trust feels, equally imperiling the suburbs by gobbling up farms and other open spaces and worsening the quality of life for people who live there.
The quality of life in the suburbs, Ms. Clarke said, has not been so wonderful in recent times anyway. "For most people over the past 10 or 15 years, the American dream has been a total myth," she said. "The life style they wanted isn't working."
The problem, she said, originated with the cookie-cutter makeup of suburban towns, which originated at the end of World War II when people started moving out of the cities. The towns developed into grids of neat lots and neat homes but with no real sense of neighborhood that the new suburbanites had once enjoyed in the cities: shopping in neighborhood stores, walking to church and schools, knowing people who lived nearby. Instead, they got isolation on progressively bigger and bigger lots and the need to have a car handy to get to the shopping center, sometimes miles away, or anywhere else.
"The neighborhood, the fabric that held society together, was gone," Ms. Clarke said. So also was the original supposition that living in suburbia would be inexpensive. New schools had to be built and most youngsters had to be bused to them because of the distances involved. The bigger schools cost lots of money but since land had been set aside in large chunks for commercial and industrial development, the new tax dollars that would come pouring in would solve the new economic problems. At least, that was the theory.
The gurus of the new suburbia, Ms. Clarke said, were the professional town planners and some of the more enlightened of them now admit they were wrong in many of their past actions. "Today, there are a lot of neo-traditionalist planners who once thought that mixed use would ruin the towns," she said. Now, she added, they feel the towns should have a blend of homes, business, industry and open spaces, and all in scale. The giant mall or giant single business, once regarded as desirable, is no longer held in such esteem.
In fact, some towns in the state are now reacting with what borders on paranoia to what might be described as the invasion of Wal-Mart.
The Connecticut Trust reports that at least half a dozen Connecticut towns have been targeted over the past several months by Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest retailer, with headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., which has a reputation of underselling small local merchants until they go out of business.
The local reaction to proposed new Wal-Marts has been swift, exemplified in New Milford when some 150 residents turned out to denounce a plan for a 163,000-square-foot shopping center on Route 7, a road already considered very dangerous for motorists. In Old Saybrook, even before it was known whether Wal-Mart or some other big retailer planned to build a 124,000-square-foot retail store on Route 1, local merchants were huddling together to discuss a concerted effort to oppose the store, which, it was estimated, would attract some 6,000 shoppers daily and close to 8,000 on Saturdays to a community of about 10,000 residents.
The major fact about such proposals in most towns, however, is that they are perfectly legal under local zoning laws, approved by local planning and zoning commissions and the professional planners they hired. Ms. Clarke said now that there is a general realization that megastores are not the panacea they once were believed to be, and that residents should pay more attention to what kind of zoning is currently in place.
The problem of towns losing their identities to suburban sprawl has prompted the Connecticut Trust to sponsor two conferences to be held this month.
The first, on Thursday at Guilford Community Center, will be about the character of small towns deteriorating because of pressures from developers. The second, on April 28, at Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury, will be concerned with superstores and how they are advancing the problems of traffic congestion, air pollution, destruction of older buildings and loss of small businesses.
Both conferences, scheduled from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M., are expected to attract people active in historical preservation and some worried town officials. (The fee for each session will be $35; for more information or to register, call 562-6312.)
Ultimately, however, Ms. Clarke said, the decision on what will happen to Connecticut's towns will be made by the people who live there.
"People should study the planning and zoning regulations that have fostered commercial sprawls in their towns and then not let up on planning and zoning commissions," she said. "These old formulas can be broken. I think that in addition to town plans of development, there should also be a retail plan that supports small businesses instead of one that supports commercial sprawl. Big commercial centers should not be allowed to stretch out along major roads and highways.
"And regional planning is needed. People should protest the bureaucracies in towns and their small town mentalities. And they should challenge the Federal standards on roads. We don't need more highways. We need more roads on a smaller and more scenic scale."
A major advantage to keeping suburban towns in scale, she added, is that the cities, devastated by the loss of business, would benefit by the return of huge stores that are no longer welcomed in suburbia.
Ms. Clarke is a native Texan and if anyone wants to see a state that has been successful in maintaining its character, she said, Texas is not the place to go. It is replete with commercial sprawl. "Texas has been up for sale to the highest bidder for years," she said.
The successful state, she said, is Vermont. Since 1970, by state law, Vermont has prohibited big commercial developments that do not meet strict requirements on water and air cleanliness, impact on the transportation system, and -- most importantly -- on scenic beauty. She thinks Connecticut might learn a major lesson from Vermont.

HEADLINE: GREAT OUTDOORS;
After Years of Disease, There's a Wary Joy In Bivalve as the Oyster Season Begins

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: BIVALVE

 BODY:
DR. HAROLD HASKIN, father of modern oyster studies, co-discoverer of the MSX oyster parasite and the name behind the Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory, reached into a freshly dredged sample of Delaware Bay bluepoints and selected a fat specimen four inches across. He pulled an old iron oyster knife from his pocket, jammed the flat end into the shell's hinge and twisted to reveal a mass of healthy, yellowy-pink flesh that nearly overflowed its generous container.
"Very nice," said Dr. Haskin, a retired Rutgers zoology professor, aboard an oyster boat making a test run out of the oysterishly named port of Bivalve. One at a time, he lifted the four layers of delicately frilled gills, and slicing a membrane to show a pair of full, meaty lips. "They really are beautiful animals." 
 A healthy oyster is an especially beautiful and welcome sight around these parts nowadays. Tomorrow, for the first time since 1991 and only the third time in a decade, oyster boats are expected to depart from Bivalve and head down the Maurice River to the seed beds of the Upper Delaware Bay. As has been done for two centuries, the oystermen will transplant their catch a few miles down to a saltier part of the bay to grow fat and flavorful.
And as they have done for the last 30 years, they will pray that their stocks will not be wiped out by the parasites with the comic-book-villain names that have nearly destroyed New Jersey's oyster industry.
In its heyday during the first half of the century, New Jersey oystering was the stuff of legend. About 500 tall-masted oyster schooners brought up to 2.4 million bushels a year into Bivalve, then a bustling town with a seasonal population of 5,000 and a railway line that ran from the loading docks straight to Chicago.
But in 1957, disaster struck. A miscroscopic parasite dubbed MSX (for Multinucleated Sphere Unknown) killed 90 percent of the population within three years. MSX ran its course by 1979, but in 1985 the unrelated Dermo parasite wiped out 90 percent of the population again.
Steve Fleetwood, general manager of the Bivalve Packing Company, the town's only remaining business, remembers crying as he watched a dredge haul up load after load of dead oysters after Dermo hit.
"It was just shells and meats coming up on the belt," Mr. Fleetwood said. "They just opened up and the meat fell right out. You might as well go home."
Oystermen called off the season for the next three years, then caught a modest 700,000 pounds of oyster meat between 1990 and 1991 -- about $3 million worth -- only to see Dermo return with a vengeance. There has been no oystering since. Dermo has also devastated the once-mighty oyster beds of the Chesapeake Bay, and Virginia and Maryland authorities are reporting no substantial improvement there.
Last fall, though, the Haskin Lab, an arm of Rutgers University quartered next door to Bivalve Packing, found an increase in both the number and size of the oysters on the 14,000 acres of state seed beds. Explanations include the above-average rains in recent years, which have lowered the salinity in the bay, making it less hospitable to Dermo, as well as the possibility that the oysters that have survived the plague may be genetically resistant to Dermo. Those oysters have now had three growing years without a harvest.
"There is enough of an indication that you may be able to harvest some oysters and get an economic return on them," said Joseph Dobarro, principal fisheries biologist of the bureau of shellfisheries in the Department of Environmental Protection's division of fish, game and wildlife, who works out of the Haskin Lab.
In order to thwart Dermo, which flourishes in warm water as well as salt, the lab recommended a two-week transplanting season starting in April instead of May, a move that required new legislation.
"We want to give the oysters a chance to acclimate before seeing the plague," Mr. Dobarro said. Scientists are also asking the oystermen to begin harvesting on the planting grounds, which they lease from the state for 50 cents an acre, within a month or two, before Dermo has a chance to set in.
In a normal five-month growing season, an oyster can add up to an inch after being transplanted. Mr. Dobarro said he did not know how much growth to expect in a short season.
In the meantime, though, Dermo -- which does not physically affect humans -- has taken its toll on the oystermen as well. Dozens of them have had to sell their aging boats because they could not keep them up.
"A lot of them have been crabbing or fishing, doing whatever they can to get by," said Larry Hickman, captain of the J. Roberts Bateman, a converted schooner that Bivalve Packing purchased from a strapped oysterman.
Bivalve Packing itself has survived by boxing and shucking oysters caught in Long Island Sound by its Connecticut-based parent company, Tallmadge Brothers. Bivalve Packing has also opened two large marinas for recreational fishing boats on the Maurice, a broad, flat ribbon of dark blue that winds through the golden marshes of southern Cumberland County.
Only 25 oyster boats are going out this year, down from 59 in 1991. Mr. Fleetwood, the 42-year-old great-grandson of a Port Norris oysterman and one of five year-round residents of Bivalve, will be captaining one of them. He has spent the last week scurrying back and forth between his cramped corner office and a converted 63-foot schooner, the Peter M. Paynter, making sure the 97-year-old craft is bayworthy.
Mr. Fleetwood noted that even if the industry's gamble pays off and the transplanted oysters survive, oystermen face more problems in the marketplace. One is cheap competition, mostly from the Gulf of Mexico, which is blessed with natural oyster beds and produced 18 million pounds of oyster meat in 1993, about 52 percent of the nation's catch.
The other is a decline in demand, due partly to the wave of negative publicity that followed several fatal cases of shellfish-related hepatitis in the last decade.
"That 'death on the half shell' stuff just about killed us," Mr. Fleetwood said.
Mr. Dobarro said shellfish's bad rap is undeserved, especially in the Delaware Bay, whose marshy banks are nearly unpopulated and whose water, though murky with phytoplankton, is unpolluted enough to drink.
"Eating shellfish is safer than eating red meat," Mr. Dobarro said.
The nationwide drop in oyster consumption, from 75 million pounds in 1956 to 33 million in 1993, may also have to do with changing American tastes. The days when no Thanksgiving turkey was complete without oyster stuffing are long gone.
Fortunately for New Jersey, the Delaware Bay oyster still has a good name among shellfish partisans. Its superior shelf life and fine flavor and texture allow it to command up to three times the price of a Gulf oyster. Indeed, if the oyster Dr. Haskin opened -- zesty, firm and succulent with a delicate, sweet broth -- is any indication, 1995 could be a very good year.
But even if disaster strikes again, Mr. Fleetwood said he had no choice but to be optimistic.
"I look forward to it coming back every year," he said. "You might as well quit if you don't."

Leave it to Cuomo to point the finger of blame for his defeat at such things as changing social attitudes, the international economy, Japanese manufacturing skills, etc. -- everywhere but where he should. He was a mediocre governor who gave us higher taxes, loss of jobs, lower bond ratings, budget failures and government inefficiency. 
 Of course, he was skilled at covering his shortcomings with intricate oratorical arguments, but the bottom line is simply this: We, the voters of New York, find him to be a far better tortilla-chip salesman than Governor.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Funds Roar Back After Dismal '94

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
NOW that's more like it!
Mutual fund investors, battered by bad markets in 1994, are now breathing a sigh of relief, even of pleasure, after the funds' strong showing in the first quarter of 1995.
Bond funds rebounded, stock funds soared -- indeed, practically every kind of fund, except those that invest overseas, turned in its best performance in several years. The funds that Americans own the most -- those that hold home-grown equities -- jumped 7.4 percent, according to Morningstar Inc. Last year, those funds were modestly in the red, losses that have now been wiped out by the first quarter's spectacular gains. 
 Whether the surge is simply a snap back from last year's losses or something more sustainable remains, of course, unknown. "I keep coming back to our measures of the length of this bull market, and it makes me nervous," said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. Last year was more of a lull than a correction, he said, adding that stock funds have been rising for almost four and a half years. Historically, fund rallies have lasted about three years.
"But if you take that away, and you buy that there will be a flat to declining dollar, there's a case to be made for another 4 to 5 percent increase" in fund returns, Mr. Lipper said. "Add that on to what has already occurred, and you would have a very good year."
As far as fixed-income funds go, some bond market seers are forecasting a quiet year, in which investors will receive interest payments but are unlikely to see any appreciation in bond prices. But some money managers fear the future may be more volatile than some investors expect -- even if interest rates fall. For example, if long-term rates decline just a little bit, homeowners will start paying off their mortgages again. This means people who invested in mortgages will get their principal back "at exactly the worst time to have to reinvest in lower rates," said Daniel Dektar, a portfolio manager for Smith Breeden Associates. That would come as another blow to fund investors, who have only recently returned to bond funds after pulling out billions of dollars last year.
The recent stock fund rally seems to have confirmed investors' confidence that, over the long haul, equities are the best place to put their money. Americans have been rewarded for their willingness last year to pour billions of dollars into stock funds while the market was dropping; in the last 12 months, diversified stock funds have returned 9.6 percent, only a tad less than their average historical return of 10 percent a year.
Of course, some investors may be disappointed because they would have fared even better if they had put their money in a fund that tracks a market index, rather than relying on a portfolio manager. For example, Vanguard's fund that mimics the S.& P. 500 index zoomed 9.7 percent in the first quarter, more than two percentage points more than the average managed stock fund.
BUT such lagging performance has been common for at least the last decade. One reason is that analyzing, buying and selling stocks costs more money than just tracking an index, and costs eat away at returns. Some mutual funds also carry a lot of cash, which helps them when the market plunges and allows them to pay off departing shareholders, but drags down performance when stocks shoot up.
Perhaps the most important factor last quarter, however, is that mutual funds tend to own a lot of smaller companies' stocks, and those stocks did not gain as much as those of giant corporations. In fact, funds that stick to smaller issues rose just 5.8 percent last quarter, while those that specialize in bigger stocks that pay dividends (the category known as growth and income) climbed 8.1 percent.
While small stocks generally outperform their larger brethren over long periods, years can go by, as they did throughout most of the 1980's, when investors prefer big companies' stocks. Some analysts suggest that the current resurgence in the shares of giant corporations indicates investors are uncertain about the economy and looking for the safety that a big, diversified company can provide.
It certainly paid to keep money at home. Funds that invest all their money in foreign stocks fell an average of 5.1 percent, dragged down by the meltdown in Latin American markets that caused even the best fund investing there to lose more than 20 percent.
Such funds, along with those that explore emerging markets, dominate the losers' list for both the last quarter and the last 12 months.
Usually, a declining dollar helps American funds that invest overseas, because a stock that is valued in yen or marks or francs is suddenly worth more dollars. But the Japanese stock market fell almost 20 percent, more than wiping out the benefit American investors got from the falling greenback.
The other big loser: gold funds, which dropped 1.5 percent.
Otherwise, an unusually wide variety of funds prospered last quarter. Funds that often move in opposite directions tended to rise in tandem.
For instance, funds that look for cheap stocks and are known as value investors rose sharply; so did those that look for companies with accelerating earnings and are known as growth investors.
In fact, they scored almost identical gains (the Vanguard fund that mirrors the growth stocks in the S. & P. index rose 9.7 percent, while the value index fund rose 9.6 percent).
But those similar gains mask some underlying turmoil, money managers say. In a continuation of last year's pattern, groups of stocks moved quickly into and out of favor, and then back again, a phenomenon known as sector rotation.
That pattern has been particularly pronounced in the area of high-technology stocks. Last year, funds that specialize in high-tech stocks were the only group to post double-digit gains.
But they paid for their success in the last two weeks of January, when they declined sharply. Then they took off again, and plunged again. They ended the quarter up 6.2 percent, but it was a wild ride.
"Yeah, we've been through about six rotations, and now people are dumping tech and buying cyclical stocks," said Garrett van Wagoner, who manages the $130 million Govett Smaller Companies, the top diversified fund of the last 12 months and one of the quarter's winners.
Nevertheless, technology stocks should continue to climb, Mr. van Wagoner contends. He points to a lot of big trends driving technology issues, including the popularity of Intel's Pentium computer chip and of CD-ROM players, the promised introduction of Microsoft's Windows 95 program, and the exploding volume of computer communications over the Internet. A stock like Intel, which zoomed by about one third last quarter, "probably needs to rest," Mr. van Wagoner conceded. "But I wouldn't want to short it or not to own it."
A similar passion for technology stocks, especially those related to semiconductors and personal computers, rules many of the first quarter's winning fund managers, including Ron Elijah, who manages the $330 million Robertson Stephens Value and Growth.
He also has a stake in an even hotter sector: health care stocks, which have benefited from a boom in takeovers. He particularly likes the shares of health maintenance organizations like United Healthcare Corporation, Healthsource Inc., Humana Inc. and Coventry Corporation ("That's my takeover candidate," he said.) The aging population and Government cost-cutting efforts make him optimistic about the future for these kinds of medical stocks, but Mr. Elijah steers clear of most biotechnology offerings. "I like companies selling a product that people are already using."
A third sizzling sector in the quarter was financial services. Funds that focus on financial stocks rocketed 10.2 percent in the quarter, with a few bank specialists, including SIFE Trust, gaining more than 13 percent.
TO some extent, bank stocks are just bouncing back from the pounding they took last year, after the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, said Sam Marchese, president of SIFE (which, when the fund was founded in the 1960's, stood for Selected Insurance and Financial Equities).
"Banks will benefit from a stable interest rate environment, and will do better to the extent that environment includes lower rates," Mr. Marchese said. He is hopeful that rates will fall as the economy slows, but remains concerned about the effects of the falling dollar, which might eventually force the Fed to raise interest rates again.
Making sector bets was not the only road to success in the first quarter, or even the best one the top fund in the period was Venture Advisers' $50 million Retirement Growth fund, which is widely diversified. Graham Tanaka, president of Tanaka Capital and manager of the fund, said he deliberately buys both big stocks and small ones, both growth stocks and value stocks, all to reduce risk.
What ties together the fund's roughly 30 core holdings is that all the companies have something going on that will cause them to surprise Wall Street with the strength of their earnings, he said. So while his fund owned familiar stocks like Intel, it also scored big with Score Board Inc., which makes baseball cards, and Thomas Group, a small management consultant.
While he usually focuses on individual companies and their prospects, Mr. Tanaka said he does look at the stock market, though on a very long-term, once-a-generation basis. But looking at the demographics give him hope. Americans saving for retirement should start saving and investing more by the end of this decade. And that, he said, "should be a very favorable environment for stocks."

TAXES
Numbers Don't (Always) Lie
Would it be humanly possible to come up with tax cuts universally considered fair? Of course not. Seventeen experts will get out calculators and show, with mathematical certainty, 17 different evaluations -- which just might be linked to those experts' politics. And so it was when the House passed its tax cuts last week -- triumphantly waving the Contract With America. Republicans pointed proudly to cuts that bulged to 4.4 percent for the middle class and trickled down to 2.9 percent for the wealthy, while Democrats complained that the wealthy would get an outsized share of the cuts. Yes, both were probably right. But more to the point: the Senate is likely to have different ideas, and a Clinton veto looms if it doesn't. In any case, can the nation really afford a tax cut now? In a poll, 55 percent of Americans said no.
 
ENTERTAINMENT
Mr. Bronfman Goes Hollywood
The lure of Hollywood is powerful, and laden with risk. Sony found that out, losing billions on Columbia Pictures. And Matsushita found it out in its stormy ownership of MCA. But Edgar Bronfman Jr. of Seagram wants to try his hand anyway, agreeing last week to buy 80 percent of MCA from Matsushita. The deal involves some big reshuffling of corporate money -- Seagram's getting the cash by selling most of its Du Pont stake for $8.8 billion -- as well as marking a big shift by Seagram, from drinks to entertainment. And it will undoubtedly involve some big reshuffling in Hollywood, for MCA is likely to lose Lew Wasserman, its 82-year-old chairman, and it's unlikely that Steven Spielberg would keep providing the studio with his golden touch.
 
ADVERTISING
Where There's Smoke . . .
Cigarette ads on television are illegal, of course -- have been for two decades. It couldn't be clearer. Or could it? If a sports arena advertises cigarettes to fans, and the camera lingers on those ads, does that constitute television advertising? The Justice Department says it does -- though arenas and stadiums are loaded with such ads -- and last week it settled its first lawsuit to close that loophole, as Madison Square Garden agreed to keep the offending ads out of camera range. The Garden called the deal a "formality," since it had removed tobacco signs in November. But the agreement sends a clear signal to other sports sites. Just days later came word that the Marlboro sign at Shea Stadium would be moved to be less visible to cameras.
 
TRANSPORTATION
Taxing Interstate Tickets
Taxes. Everywhere you go, taxes. And now, if where you go is across state lines by public transportation -- yes, another tax. It used to be that states didn't tax interstate tickets -- the Supreme Court apparently barred that in 1948. But last week the Court said no, that was different -- New York wanted then to tax a bus company's gross receipts. Now it says the ticket price itself is fair game as long as the trip originates in the state -- that way there's no danger of taxing a company twice for the same ticket. But the question is whether states, no matter how starved for cash, would want to take the political heat for levying what would undoubtedly be an unpopular tax. For passengers, not transportation companies, would be hit hardest.
 
COMMUNICATIONS
Whatever You Say, Mr. McCaw
Craig McCaw had a lot of money burning a hole in his pocket after selling his company to AT&T, and he knows a lot about wireless communications. Nextel, once a high flier in that very field, was badly in need of an investor. So last week, in a marriage that both surely hope was made in technology heaven, Mr. McCaw said he and his family would invest $300 million now -- and perhaps $1.1 billion over six years -- in the struggling company. The deal: Nextel would scrap its effort to build a nationwide cellular network -- "been there," said Mr. McCaw, "done that" -- and focus on private dispatch networks, like those for truck or taxi fleets. Nextel's stock sold for a quarter of what it did in the fall before jumping on this news; for $1 billion, it would probably have gone into the diaper business.
 
BANKING
Adding Up Chase's Parts
In banking, bigger is better, right? Consumer banking, corporate business, global lending -- adding up to a strong, diverse business. That's what giants like Chase Manhattan believe, and Chase is doing fine at it -- its profits growing steadily. But some investors like things simple and easy to size up. If something looks muddled, they want to break it into bite-size pieces -- parts, they bet, worth more than the whole. That's clearly what's happening at Chase. Last week a money manager named Michael Price -- known for pushing to wring all the value he can out of companies -- said he'd bought 6.1 percent of Chase, and the stock shot up 10 percent.
 
THE ECONOMY
Too Hard a Landing?
What gives? The markets like signs that the economy's slowing to a nice even pace, and most of the week the Dow industrials bumped to new highs for that very reason. But when word came Friday that the unemployment rate had reversed course and risen to 5.5 percent -- a sure sign of slowing -- stocks retreated, with the Dow ending up off 12 after being off 36 earlier. Could things be slowing too much? Manufacturing lost a lot of jobs, and total payroll jobs rose just 203,000. "We can kiss the soft landing goodbye," said one economist. But the Administration was more upbeat -- it needs that soft landing badly -- as Labor Secretary Reich saw the economy in a steady "glide pattern."
 
AIR POLLUTION
Smog? Cars Have It for Dinner
Forget "zero emission" vehicles, the lab-coat name for electric cars. The latest answer to foul air is a "negative emission" car. No, there's no Mobius strip of a tailpipe, twisted in on itself and spewing exhaust into some Star Trek-style parallel universe. Well, not exactly. Last week Engelhard, which developed catalytic converters in the 70's, came up with a way for cars to, essentially, devour any smog in their path. A new catalyst would break down existing smog, or ozone, into breathable oxygen -- but would do nothing for the car's own exhaust. Sound far-fetched? The stock market didn't think so, as Engelhard stock jumped 30 percent in a day, and futures prices for platinum -- a key part of the process -- hit a four-year high. An unanswered question: after it eats all Los Angeles smog, will it eat Los Angeles too?
 
GEOGRAPHY
Take a Left at the Berlin Wall
Be realistic. With national boundaries sometimes seeming to shift by the day, with countries born and countries dying, no one could possibly keep up. You could easily forget that a faraway place called the Soviet Union had, well, gone through some changes. So Dow Jones should certainly not be faulted for featuring, on its just-released '94 annual report, a globe with these words: Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Peso or Dollar Wages? In Mexico, It Matters

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
JORGE ORTEGA and Kimberly Rustad have a lot in common. They are both young Americans. They both live here. And they both love their jobs. But one is paid in dollars and one in pesos, and because of the Mexican currency crisis, that has made a world of difference.
Mr. Ortega is paid in dollars, and for him life is coming up roses -- much like the roses that now cost the equivalent of just 75 cents a dozen on Reforma, the elegant boulevard that runs through the heart of Mexico City. With the peso falling by half against the American currency since the devaluation last year -- to about six to the dollar from three -- the flowers would have cost nearly twice that four months ago. 
 "It's like somebody's given you two to three months of bonuses at the beginning of the year," said Mr. Ortega, the 31-year-old director general of the Burson-Marsteller public relations office here.
But Miss Rustad, a 25-year-old mathematics teacher at the American School here, gets paid in pesos. She now earns the equivalent of what a hamburger flipper gets, in dollars, at a McDonald's in the United States. And when her students asked her to use her salary in a currency conversion problem, she refused. It is too depressing to see the truth spelled out on a blackboard, she said.
Dealing with a flip-flopping local currency is an issue not just for the 520,000 American expatriates in Mexico. More than 2.58 million Americans live and work outside the United States, often at a cost of three to four times that of domestic employees.
Giles C. Archibald, managing director of William M. Mercer, an international consulting firm, said companies usually pay their expatriate employees in dollars when a foreign operation started, and then switch to the local currency after the business was under way. Typically, senior executives continue to be paid in dollars.
Generally, employers try to assure that their expatriates enjoy the same standard of living abroad as they would at home, and use devices like housing subsidies, education allowances and cost-of-living adjustments to narrow whatever gaps may exist. But whatever the currency of the paychecks, a shift in exchange rates can alter everyone's plans and expectations. The peso crisis is the most telling recent example.
For their part, Mr. Ortega and his wife, Tracy, have taken modest advantage of the devaluation. A few weeks ago, when the exchange rate was about five pesos to the dollar, they bought a compact-disk player for about $80. In December the equipment would have cost about $140. And while they usually shop for their two-year-old daughter, Anna, on trips to Miami, where they used to live, Mrs. Ortega recently bought her some leather Keds sneakers at a Mexico City mall for $19, instead of the pre-devaluation price of $40.
For Mr. Ortega, the arithmetic of the exchange rate can be irresistible. "If I take a client to a restaurant and the bill comes to 240 pesos, I have a tendency to divide by 6 and say, '$40. Not bad,' " he said. "But I can't do that. I have to remember that I have a peso-based company. I bill my customers in pesos. At the end of the year I'll have to convert to dollars. But for now it's in pesos, and 240 pesos is 240 pesos."
And Mr. Ortega's boss at the home office in Miami should not assume that his subordinate is living high on the hog. Many big-ticket items like flights back to the United States are still priced in dollars, as is rent, often the single biggest monthly expense. Many Mexican landlords have lived through and learned from several devaluations.
Moreover, inflation is expected to top 50 percent for the year. On April 1 Mexican sales taxes were raised to 15 percent from 10 percent.
And because many American expatriates intend to return to the United States, many of their loans and investments are based in dollars. For example, Mr. Ortega and his wife are paying off dollar-based student loans.
But Miss Rustad is worse off. She has watched the buying power of her peso-based salary shrink so much that she had to ask her family to make the payments on the 1991 Chevrolet Cavalier she bought when she graduated from Marquette University that year.
"I think of spending my pesos as soon as I get them, because they're not worth anything now and they could be worth even less tomorrow," she said. "It's not even worth changing them to dollars anymore."
Miss Rustad has already told the school that June 15 will be her last day there and that she plans to pack the belongings she has not sold into her Cavalier and drive home to Minnesota.
"I love what I'm doing here, I love the students and I love the school," she said. "But it gets to the point where I say that I need to make money, too."
She is not alone in her plans to leave; six of her fellow teachers and three of her four roommates are heading back to their homes in the United States as well.
For the first time in several years, more Americans are leaving Mexico than arriving. The classified advertising columns in the local English-language newspaper, The News, are filled with ads for household furnishings that departing Americans are desperate to unload.
It's not just the Americans paid in pesos who are leaving. Many with dollar-based paychecks are being called back home, because their employers think it will be cheaper to hire local workers who can be paid in pesos, according to Deborah L. Riner, chief economist for the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico.
Mr. Ortega, who says he is careful with money, said he had resisted the temptation to look at the extended buying power of the dollar as anything but temporary. "I say to myself, 'Don't get caught up in this,' " he said. "Besides, I'm surrounded by people who get paid in pesos. Hearing their stories rubs off and I end up being more cautious."
For Miss Rustad, the time for caution has passed. When she took her job teaching eighth-grade math at the American School in September 1993, she knew she would not make a lot of money. But at about $2,000 a month, the salary wasn't bad. That sum included extra money she earned by tutoring students at home and coaching a soccer team at the school.
Her life in Mexico has changed since she read during her Christmas vacation in Minnesota that something had gone wrong in Mexico. "I thought it was one of those things that was just going to pass," she said. "But it got worse."
BY the time she returned from Christmas vacation, she knew she had already lost much of her purchasing power.
And the peso, instead of improving, has continued to deteriorate. Suddenly, her monthly income of 6,000 pesos was worth only $1,000, and dropping. She had to cancel a ski trip to Utah in February because she could not afford the flight. She held off seeing a doctor for her sinus condition because it cost too much.
Her spirits dropped as low as the peso. The final straw came when the school said it would increase salaries by 6 percent, which seemed absurd to Miss Rustad after a devaluation of almost 50 percent, not to mention raging inflation that has sent up some costs, like electricity, by 20 percent in the last month.
Miss Rustad said she hoped to get a graduate degree in mathematics after she returns to Minnesota. But the one thing she knows is that some change is necessary.
"I make less than I would at McDonald's -- I figured it out," she said. "My mother is paying my debts and I'm 25 years old. I think it's time I pay my own debts. My mom says, 'Don't worry,' but even in these times that can only go so far."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Cutting Taxes and Causing Heartburn

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS if more than a year of rising interest rates hasn't made investing enough of a challenge, the tax bill passed by the House last week would add a brand new dimension to financial decision-making.
A little-noted facet of the tax-cutting bill, which Republicans have called the crown jewel of their Contract With America, indexes capital assets for inflation so you no longer pay taxes on phantom profits, those that just maintained -- and did not enhance -- your buying power. 
 Assuming the measure survives the Senate, where it has drawn considerable skepticism, investors could fairly easily obtain the benefits of an adjustment for future inflation. But the tactical question of if and when to do so looks almost fiendishly complex.
For stocks and other assets acquired after 1994 and held for a minimum of three years, there is no problem -- you would simply raise your cost, or tax basis, by the amount of inflation that occurred since 1995. The higher the cost, the less your taxable profit on the sale. The gauge to be used is the price deflator issued by the Government in its quarterly calculation of gross domestic product.
Take, for example, someone who bought $10,000 of stocks early in 1995 and sold them three years later for $14,000. Under present law, the investor would probably have to pay taxes at the 28 percent capital gains rate on the $4,000 profit -- a tax bite of $1,120.
But under the Republican plan, the gain -- and the tax -- would be less if prices rose. If inflation averaged 4 percent over the three-year period, the original $10,000 purchase price would be adjusted upward for tax purposes by 4 percent a year, to $11,249. So the profit would be $2,751 instead of $4,000, and the tax bill would be $770 instead of $1,120.
Further, excluding from taxes 50 percent of the capital gain, which the bill also does, would push the $770 liability down to $545.
For people with such mid-length investments, indexing seems a fairly unambiguous blessing. But for those with stocks, bonds or other long-held assets, the choice is harder.
The measure says assets bought before 1995 can be indexed in the future, but only if the investor immediately pays taxes as if the assets were sold on Jan. 1, 1995. For people with successful long-term investments, this could amount to a huge tax bite now in exchange for reduced taxes later.
Since you can always sell stock and immediately buy it back -- so long as you have a profit rather than a loss -- the law would provide the same effect automatically and without paying commissions or other transaction costs.
The home you live in also qualifies for indexing, though you wouldn't need to pay any tax until you really sold it. Even under current law, however, relatively few homes generate capital gains liability.
"Very few people would get any benefit from indexing their houses," said Mark S. Mullet, a tax aide to Senator William V. Roth Jr., a Republican from Delaware.
Collectibles can be indexed, too, but only if the taxpayer picks this option instead of paying a tax rate of less than 28 percent; you can't have both.
Tax specialists and others who have begun to fathom the effect on individual investors -- assets of the typical small business would also be covered -- say that indexing is likely to be at least mildly attractive to most investors with pre-1995 assets, though certainly not all.
"If they can afford to pay the tax and get on an indexing system, that would usually be a good thing to do," said C. Clinton Stretch, director of tax legislative affairs for Deloitte & Touche, referring to investors already owning assets with paper profits. "But it's not free," he added. "You have to come up with the cash" to pay Uncle Sam.
But he and others noted that there are many factors to be considered and that individual situations are quite different. Prominent among the considerations are these:
*Age Indexing would typically be of little benefit to an elderly person who intended to leave, say, a stock portfolio to his children. The cost basis of their inheritance would step up to the market value at the time of death, wiping out any capital gains tax liability.
*Activity People who trade stocks or other assets often would have a relatively current basis. So indexing would tend to have limited appeal, unless inflation were to be very high in a given three-year period.
*Profits Since the benefit increases with the part of a gain that is attributed to inflation, the greatest benefit is to those who expect to hold an asset for a long time and who also expect high inflation.
In other words, you need to evaluate a combination of factors, including how long you expect to hold an asset, how much inflation you anticipate in coming years and what return you could make on the money you might decide to send to Washington now.
Indeed, their interaction suggests that you would need to analyze your assets on a stock-by-stock and property-by-property basis.
THE availability of indexing is also likely to help govern the composition of portfolios, said Dennis E. Ross, a tax partner at the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell and a former senior Treasury Department tax official. "You might want to pick stocks that are positively impacted by inflation," such as natural-resource companies, he said. In an inflationary period, you would probably at least stay even since your nominal, or inflation-related, profit would not be taxed.
And corporate managers, according to Bruce Beardslee, a managing director of Smith Barney Inc., might be induced by indexing to put more emphasis on raising stock prices rather than rewarding shareholders with higher, unindexed dividends.
While indexing capital gains has broad conceptual appeal, it has significant opposition on economic and practical grounds as well as political vulnerability to charges that it mainly helps the well-to-do.
Theoreticians contend that assets like real estate should not be indexed without also adjusting the tax-deductible mortgages that finance them. This produces what Mr. Ross called "a kind of imbalance" in the economic system. The American Bar Association has been a particularly strong opponent of one-sided indexing, which it believes will lead to revived tax-sheltering shenanigans.
But the biggest threat to adoption seems to be administrative complexity, which would require intense record-keeping and probably "an accounting system that does not exist," Mr. Stretch of Deloitte & Touche said.
Imagine, for example, trying to calculate inflation adjustments for dividends reinvested over a 20-year period or for monthly purchases of mutual-fund shares. The argument is said to have made a strong impression on Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee.
Still, Britain is said to have largely remedied the problems experienced by its indexing system created under Margaret Thatcher. And the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's chief trade association, expresses less concern than it had previously.
Most funds now provide holders with data on their average per-share cost, an institute spokesman said, adding, "I assume the computer wizards can work it out."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: COLLEGE POINT;
Megastore Wares Include Worries As Well as Jobs

BYLINE: By THOMAS H. MATTHEWS 

 BODY:
Megastores are coming to the College Point Corporate Park in Queens, the Economic Development Corporation announced last week. Unsurprisingly, residents are worried about noise and traffic and, above all, the possibility that small merchants may not survive.
But development corporation officials say that if the site is fully developed, it will bring 1,000 new jobs and take in $200 million worth of business a year that would otherwise be lost to suburban stores. 
 Both Toys 'R' Us and Kids 'R' Us are scheduled to open in fall 1997 and will be next to a planned 12-theater movie house operated by National Amusement Company on land owned by the city but to be sold to Triangle Equities, a New York City private developer. The Triangle project, on a 9.4-acre piece of land at the Whitestone Expressway service road, Ulmer Street and Linden Place, will cost $26.5 million, the corporation said.
In all, 550,000 square feet are to be developed at the park. Besides the city-owned land, there are two privately owned parcels: 25 acres owned by the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of New York and 7 acres belonging to Triangle. Pepsi has earmarked its land, bought in 1985 as a site for a bottling plant, for 330,000 square feet of retail space in a single-story building, said Clay Lifflander, president of the development agency. Triangle is looking for retailers for its 100,000-square-foot space. In January, PriceCostco, a retail food warehouse, appeared before Community Board 7 to discuss tentative plans put a Costco store in the park. Company officials did not respond to requests for information.
Community leaders fear superstores will irreparably harm College Point, a community of 25,000 people on the East River. So ingrained is the tradition of patronizing small stores that residents, many of whom are employed in local factories, began mobilizing last summer as soon as the agency revealed plans to bring megastores to the park.
Built in the early 60's, the corporate park has since included light industries and warehouses. But for several years, it has been used for corporate office space.
"When we first developed that area, it was as an industrial park, but now it's become attractive to retailers and so they're bringing them in," said Eugene Kelty, chairman of Community Board 7. "We don't want to hurt the little town."
But officials say College Point will reap benefits. "This will create 1,000 permanent jobs and competition, and we view competition as good," Mr. Lifflander said.
New York City loses $3 billion every year because shoppers seek out lower prices at suburban stores, Mr. Lifflander said. "The majority of people want this."
But Mr. Kelty attacked the agency's figures as vastly inflated. .
"One thousand jobs, that's a bogus statement," he said. "Where are those jobs coming from?" He speculated that the new stores might transfer workers from other branches.
The College Point Board of Trade, an organization that represents 175 local businesses, supports the plans for a Toys 'R' Us, Kids 'R' Us and a multiplex, saying they will fulfill genuine needs in the area. But a giant discount store like Costco is different, Fred Mazzarello, board of trade president, said.
"A price club has 14 or 15 departments, each equivalent to a store," Mr. Mazzarello said. "They have hundreds of free parking spaces and on top of all that, they're selling at a huge discount."
"A store like that would wipe out the stores in our area." THOMAS H. MATTHEWS

HEADLINE: Financial Fear And Retirement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Another Day Older And Running Out Of Time" (March 26) accurately assesses today's retirement savings problem. 
 While I certainly concur with the article's assessment, one of the most important causes of this situation was not clearly stated. Congress has routinely tinkered with pension rules to limit tax expenditures and to raise revenue.
Since enacting the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (Erisa) of 1974, Congress has passed an average of one new law each year that has significantly affected pension plans. Each measure was primarily concerned with limiting Federal revenue losses instead of improving pension policy.
As a result, the percentage of American workers covered by employer-sponsored pension plans has remained virtually constant since 1982.
Qualified pension plans are integral to the economy of the United States. They provide an efficient way for employers and workers to save; they pay retirement benefits to tens of millions of Americans; they provide an important source of capital for investment in our economy and they equitably insure that middle-income people receive the same incentives as corporate executives receive.
To encourage the creation of a greater number of these plans and an expanded coverage of American workers, we must reduce excessive Government regulations, simplify existing rules and preserve the current tax incentives.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Seeking the High-Profit Staples of Tomorrow

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
RON BARON began the Baron Asset Fund in the summer of 1987, not long before the crash in October. In a way, that timing proved fortuitous. Most of the fund's cash had not been invested before prices plunged, leaving him with plenty of cash to search for bargains. He generally looks for stocks with niches or demographic factors that will cause them to soar, and has compiled a record far better than most small company stock funds -- up more than 10 percent in the first quarter of this year and a compound annual return of 14 percent over the last five years.
In the 12 months ended March 31, the fund was up 21 percent, a performance all the more impressive because the fund largely stays out of technology stocks, the stars of the last year. That performance has started to bring in the cash. The fund grew from $87 million at the end of 1994 to $161 million at the end of the quarter.
 FLOYD NORRIS
Q. What's cheap these days? 
 A. Heilig-Meyers, for example. It's come down from $37 a year-and-a-half ago to $21. And that is without any interruption in the company's growth process.
Q. Why did it come down?
A. It came down because people are anticipating that a recession will have an impact on their growth. The reason we're excited about it is because they sell furniture in small towns. They're not selling $10,000 couches in New York, they're selling $400 couches in the South, the Southeast and the Midwest.
People need to buy furniture. It's not a luxury; it's a necessity. They're very good at managing credit. The margins on stores that are four years old are 15 percent and on one-year-old stores are 7 percent.
We're able to make longer-term investments at very attractive prices because we don't have to have every stock performing all the time. And when stocks come down, and we like their businesses, we're able to buy them.
Q. Technology was the big star last year and most funds that did reasonably well were loaded up on it. You weren't.
A. We've never invested in technology because it changes so fast. We've elected not to invest in companies whose businesses can be here today and gone tomorrow, but we do have a technology component in our portfolio in that we invest in DeVry, which provides technology-based education. You know that the Government says 80 percent of the jobs by the year 2000 will require an education beyond high school. DeVry is the beneficiary there.
We also invest in Robert Half International, which provides programmers to companies that are changing the way they configure their office. It's a provider of temporary accountants and temporary lawyers and temporary programmers and highly skilled office assistants and administrators who know how to use computers. All the regulations that come from the Government, for family leave and Americans with Disabilities Act and health care coverage and wrongful-termination litigation, makes permanent workers expensive and therefore companies want to use temporaries whenever they can. Robert Half has the most profitable temporary business of the publicly traded companies.
Q. You also bought a lot of Charles Schwab this year.
A. We're trying to find talented managements which operate fast-growing businesses, highly profitable businesses in sunrise industries, as opposed to sunset industries. We're investing in communications and financial services and media and entertainment, gaming and temporary help and health care and where people are going to create the jobs of the future.
When we talk about Schwab, it gets to our schematic investing, and one of the things that we're trying to do is take advantage of the changes that we see. We're not predicting the stock market; we're not predicting the economy. What we are focusing on is what's happening within the economy. And what is evident is that the demographics are changing tremendously. One factor is the aging population and another is a tremendous surge of baby boomers. Charles Schwab is going to benefit from the huge population of baby boomers who haven't saved enough to retire.
Q. There are a lot of brokers out there. Why Schwab?
A. People have discovered that the only way they can have enough money to retire is by investing in equities, and they do that through mutual funds. Charles Schwab is a tremendous innovator in the distribution of mutual funds.
We think that the customers' assets at Schwab, now about $130 billion, will reach $500 billion by the year 2000.
Q. How much of your fund's sales come through Schwab?
A. A good portion of it right now, which is one of the reasons why we've been able to buy Schwab stock and feel comfortable. When some people look at Schwab, they say, "Gee, why should Charles Schwab sell at twenty times earnings when everyone else in the brokerage business sells at ten times earnings?"
Q. They do indeed say that. What's your answer?
A. They're not a broker. It's a different firm. Charles Schwab doesn't have any brokers. They have telephone operators. They're spending $80 million to $100 million on this technology enabling them to answer all these telephones and provide all these services.
Q. What are you paying Schwab?
A. We pay 35 hundredths of a percentage point, based on the assets of our fund held in Schwab accounts.
Q. That's coming out of a 12B-1 marketing fee?
A. Yes, that and part of it from my management fee.
But they have made me and people like Mario Gabelli and Dick Strong competitive. They've made everyone who's a little guy competitive with big guys. Financial planners can deal with Schwab just like they can deal with Fidelity or Vanguard.
Peter Lynch said that anyone who worked in a mall in the 1960's and saw what Gap was doing and didn't buy it deserved not to make money. Here I am in a mutual fund business and I see that my mutual fund wasn't growing in sales before it got into Schwab and now it's growing tremendously. So here we are with an inside view. How can I not buy the stock?
Q.Let's move on. You seem to like nursing homes.
A. We're very excited about that business. There have been some tremendous changes in the industry. Six or seven years ago there was a nursing shortage; now nurses are getting fired so there isn't a nurse shortage, and the cost of nurses represents about 50 percent of revenues.
Second, you're taking care of sicker patients in nursing homes than you have previously. Therefore you're getting more revenues per bed and therefore more profits per bed.
Q. Which nursing homes do you like the best?
A. Our largest holding is Manor Care, which we regard as the Cadillac in that industry. We think that its business values are somewhere around $50 a share and the stock's trading around $31.
If we get lucky in Manor Care and they separate the hotel business from the nursing home, then the stock will be $40 this year. Now the other big nursing home is Summit Care, which has really talented management.
Q. Medicare is obviously a big business for nursing homes, but Medicare cutbacks have been talked about in Washington and every state house in the land. That doesn't sound like good news to me.
A. This is one of the great stories. You used to have to care for patients at a hospital at $1,000 a day. Now nursing homes can take a $50,000 bed and spend $15,000 on that bed -- putting in oxygen, rehab facilities -- and care for that patient for $300 a day.
When the Medicare cutbacks come, these guys are going to be the beneficiaries because they are going to take care of them in a nursing home. Let the cutbacks come.
Another beneficiary will be Olsten Corporation, which provides care at home. So as Medicare comes around, the nursing homes are going to benefit and the home health care company is going to benefit.
Q. The stock has slipped.
A. The stock came down pretty sharply from $40 to $31, so we have doubled our position at Olsten as well. And I guess in the past couple of weeks the stock has popped from $31 to $36 again.
What's happening at Olsten is that they have two businesses. One of them is home care, and the other is staffing. The staffing business is doing great. They're running ahead well into double digits, and they're signing a lot of contracts with big corporations to provide temporary help.
Temporary help is a very exciting industry, a $23 billion industry growing 13 percent a year. Olsten is one of the leading providers of general staffing personnel. In addition to that, half their business is home care.
