HEADLINE: Mr. Obama's Internet Agenda

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama recently announced an ambitious plan to build up the nation's Internet infrastructure as part of his proposed economic stimulus package. Upgrading the Internet is a particularly smart kind of stimulus, one that would spread knowledge, promote entrepreneurship and make this country more competitive globally. 
 The United States has long been the world leader in technology, but when it comes to the Internet, it is fast falling behind. America now ranks 15th in the world in access to high-speed Internet connections. A cornerstone of Mr. Obama's agenda is promoting universal, affordable high-speed Internet.
 Mr. Obama, who had notable success with online fund-raising and voter turnout, spoke during the presidential campaign about the transformative power of the Internet to improve Americans' quality of life. He argued that it could, among other things, reduce health care costs, create jobs and make it easier for citizens to participate in government decision-making.
 In a speech this month about his economic stimulus plan, he said that he intends to ensure that every child has a chance to get online and that he would use some of the stimulus money to connect libraries and schools. It is a critical goal. Children trapped on the wrong side of the digital divide are deprived of a fair chance to educate themselves and to compete for high-skill, high-paying jobs.
 Mr. Obama has also been a strong supporter of ''network neutrality,'' the principle that Internet service providers should not be able to discriminate against any of the information that they carry. Net neutrality laws are necessary to ensure that Internet service providers do not block content they disagree with or give financial breaks to big tech companies, squeezing out smaller competitors and stifling innovation.
 Mr. Obama will need to work with Congress -- and fight against corporate lobbyists -- to accomplish some of his goals. Some he can achieve on his own. With the right appointments to the Federal Communications Commission, he should be able to get good net neutrality regulations.
 ''This is the Eisenhower Interstate highway moment for the Internet,'' argues Ben Scott, policy director of the media reform group Free Press. Restoring America to its role as the world's Internet leader could be an important part of Mr. Obama's presidential legacy.

HEADLINE: Governor to Unveil a Low-Cost Student Loan Program

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson plans to announce on Tuesday the creation of a low-cost student loan program to help 45,000 students in New York State secure credit and cope with tuition increases at both public and private colleges. 
 The program would provide $350 million in loans each year, with the state spending $50 million next year to start the fund, and $10 million annually. The state is now recruiting banks to underwrite the loans, which the state would buy using revenue from tax-exempt bonds. 
 Mr. Paterson said in a prepared statement that he was financing the program despite the state's estimated $15 billion budget deficit because it was essential to keep New York competitive with other states offering similar incentives. It comes alongside Mr. Paterson's plan to raise tuition by $350 a semester at the State University of New York and the City University of New York, the first increase in four years.
 ''In a time of rising borrowing costs and tightening lending by private banks, this new lower-interest student loan program I have proposed will help ensure New Yorkers have access to the funds they need to finance their college educations,'' the statement read.
 It added that the program would help the state ''retain the best and the brightest young minds as we seek to return New York to economic prosperity.'' 
 Students who are residents of New York and attending public or private college in the state would be eligible. Students at two-year colleges would be eligible for a maximum of $20,000 in loans, while undergraduates at four-year institutions could receive as much as $50,000. Up to $70,000 would be available for combined undergraduate and graduate studies. 
 State officials said the program would have interest rates lower than students could get from private lenders.
 The interest rate is expected to be about 8 percent in the first year of the initiative, and adjusted annually based on market conditions.
 ''One of the big problems in the student loan program is that it is drying up,'' said Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the budget division of the governor's office. ''People who were able to get loans last year can't get them this year.'' The state's $50 million initial investment would help capitalize a default reserve fund that officials said was a critical element of the program's structure.
 The creation of a low-cost student loan program was one of the central recommendations of the Commission on Higher Education, which studied the condition of higher education in New York for more than a year and issued a report with its findings this summer. Currently, New York's 1 million students in college and graduate schools have $2 billion in private loans, the report found. One commission member said New Yorkers typically paid as much as 12 percent interest on their loans, while students in Texas, one of many states with a low-cost loan program, paid 6 percent.
 The report also noted that public colleges were chronically underfunded, and expressed ''grave concern'' that the quality of the education available was being steadily eroded.

HEADLINE: Churches Welcome Quirky Approaches to Spread Their Message

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THIS time of year, advertising is filled with religious imagery. But typically, little of it is actually sponsored by religious organizations. That is starting to change as churches seek to take advantage of the seasonal opportunity to communicate with prospective members.
 The change comes as anecdotal evidence suggests that the worsening economy may be sending more people to churches, synagogues and other houses of worship as financial setbacks bring some to their knees -- at least figuratively. 
 Denominations like the United Church of Christ have tried advertising before, running campaigns that play on the unexpectedness of encountering a pitch for religion amid more prosaic spiels for soup, soap and soft drinks. Such campaigns have been criticized for making accommodations with Mammon, even if in pursuit of a higher purpose.''Some would say it's a bad thing, vulgar or unacceptable,'' said Michael Watras, president at Straightline International, a brand consulting company in New York. ''But I would not.''
 ''Everyone has to deliver the message,'' Mr. Watras said, ''so you have to explore the best avenues of delivering that message today,'' particularly when ''you have a different kind of world than even not so long ago.''
 He added: ''Advertising plays a part in getting the word out, and in this case the word happens to be the Word.''
 The most visible current campaign is an assertive effort from the Collegiate Churches of New York, with a budget estimated at more than $1 million. The campaign is being described as the first from the church to use a variety of media, including television, print, posters and the Internet (collegiatechurch.org).
 There is even an eye-catching tactic that Collegiate is calling reverse graffiti: The theme and logo of the campaign, ''Positive and inclusive,'' along with the church's Web address, are power-washed into a dirty spot on a sidewalk, usually near a phone kiosk or bus shelter displaying a poster from the campaign.
 The Rev. Robert Chase, the founding director of Intersections, a multicultural and multifaith initiative of Collegiate, acknowledged that the church is ''using a variety of techniques from the advertising world'' to help disseminate ''a sacred message.''
 After all, Mr. Chase said, Jesus ''preached in parables, which are a story-telling technique.''
 ''I think advertising is simply a technique; it's value neutral,'' Mr. Chase said. ''It can be used to exploit, or it can be used to promote positive messages.''
 And what this campaign is selling ''is certainly more of an enduring product than the latest potato chip,'' he added.
 The timing of the campaign makes sense, Mr. Chase said, because ''there's a higher interest in the church than at other times of the year, which filters into the culture.''
 As for the timing with the financial crisis, that is a coincidence.
 ''This was in place before the economy crashed,'' Mr. Chase said. ''God works in strange ways, I guess.''
 ''People who are at a loss right now are looking for a sense of community, a place to have some of the larger questions about the meaning of life answered,'' he added. ''We want to be sure those folks have a place they can call home.''
 The campaign's theme is expressed in ads that carry headlines like ''You're invited. So are your questions,'' ''Faith is a verb,'' ''You don't have to accept everything to be accepted'' and ''Diversity is what unites us.''
 The ads promote the four churches of Collegiate -- Fort Washington Collegiate Church, Marble Collegiate Church, Middle Collegiate Church and West End Collegiate Church -- as ''united in social justice, affirmation and spiritual growth'' and invite people to ''find your own faith in a welcoming, supportive community.''
 The Web site was created by the New York office of an interactive agency, Gravitate Design Studio. The media planning and buying for the campaign are being handled by the Ingenuity Media Group. The campaign was created by Gotham, a New York agency that is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which created campaigns for the United Church of Christ.
 The Collegiate campaign is meant to be ''not preachy,'' said Peter McGuinness, chairman and chief executive at Gotham, to underline the intended message that ''whoever you are, you have a place in a church that's nonjudgmental and inclusive and diverse in its views.''
 Reinforcing the lighter side of the campaign, in addition to the reverse graffiti, are T-shirts, umbrellas and coffee mugs bearing the ''Positive and inclusive'' theme and logo, a plus sign inside a pair of brackets.
 ''We're also doing pew pads,'' Mr. McGuinness said, laughing.
 That kind of humor is also being displayed in a campaign to rebrand a cable channel owned by Trans Video Communications that is affiliated with the Catholic Archdiocese of Brooklyn. The channel, formerly the Prayer Channel, is now known as Net, for New Evangelization Television.
 The campaign, by Cesario Migliozzi in Los Angeles, features an unusual spokesman for religious television: the Devil. 
 He urges viewers to eschew ''good TV'' for ''bad TV'' like ''reality shows with mindless plots'' and ''offensive'' music video clips.
 ''We could have easily said, 'Net is the network you've been praying for,' but we need to get eyeballs,'' said Michael Migliozzi, partner and creative director at Cesario Migliozzi. ''The idea of having a little devil telling you not to do it would be a lot of fun.''
 The campaign for Net, with a budget estimated at less than $200,000, includes TV and radio commercials, ads on buses and a diabolical Web site (stopgoodtv.com) in addition to the channel's regular Web site (netny.net).

HEADLINE: Filmgoers Seek Cheer; Studios Toil To Deliver It

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
In these troubled times, America's film studios are hard at work on planned pictures about a battered boxer; the post-apocalyptic wasteland; a bad human-resources executive whose job is to fire people.
 Where is Busby Berkeley when you need him?
 If moviegoers have delivered a message in the last few months, it is that they want their films, for the moment, at least, to be a lot more fun than their lives. 
 Among topics connecting with viewers since financial markets collapsed in October: animated penguins (''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa''), holidays (''Four Christmases''), dancing teenagers (''High School Musical 3: Senior Year'') and vampires who don't bite (''Twilight'').
 What did not work nearly so well were the historical calamities of ''Australia,'' the missing children and mayhem of ''Changeling,'' or jihad -- no matter how far it was kept from the billboards -- as in ''Body of Lies.'' Even so, studios have continued to green-light a number of such sober, serious films in the face of global economic mayhem. 
 Hollywood, it seems, is still trying to get this recession thing sorted out. 
 Over the past three months the major studios, their specialty divisions and some of their biggest independent producers have been moving toward production with some films that are noticeably more downbeat than those that have buoyed the marketplace lately.
 The mismatch speaks more to the film industry's internal dynamics than to any lack of common sense. Scripts that had been in development for a year or more were finally judged ready to shoot just as the jolt of an economic crisis hit the national psyche.
 So pictures conceived in the bubble were being born as it burst. That is leaving studio executives with slightly tougher, more challenging schedules than they might choose were they to start from scratch today -- or forcing them to make difficult choices.
 Thus, Universal Pictures now says it is not planning to shoot the once seemingly imminent ''Bobby Fischer Goes to War,'' a drama about the 1972 chess showdown between Mr. Fischer and Boris Spassky. But the studio is jumping on a comic-book adventure fantasy, ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,'' with Michael Cera.
 In a further complication, studios have slowed their planning as they wait to see whether members of the Screen Actors Guild, whose contract expired months ago, will authorize a strike as early as January.
 The next wave of selections will be lighter. ''Family comedies, romantic comedies, buddy comedies are going to be an easy sell,'' said Michael Shamberg, a producer whose best-timed credits include ''The Big Chill,'' which caught the baby boomers on a life-cycle bump in 1983, and the corporate expose ''Erin Brockovich,'' which opened as the market hit a frothy top in 2000.
 Last week Daily Variety reported that Warner's New Line unit had won an auction for film rights to the stage musical ''Rock of Ages.'' That might point toward a brighter approach to the studios' current development, if literary sales were not so few and far between these days. 
 Of script, book and stage play sales -- the stuff of movies in the far future -- Jeremy Zimmer, a partner at United Talent Agency in Hollywood, said: ''I can't notice a significant change at this point, other than that there's a lot less activity.'' 
 Still, Alcon Entertainment and its collaborators are pushing ahead with ''The Book of Eli,'' to begin production in February for distribution by Warner Brothers in 2010. If the national mood remains grim, this science-fiction film, directed by Albert and Allen Hughes, promises to be grimmer: Denzel Washington plays a loner who must battle his way through a ruined America.
 Similarly, Paramount is still lining up ''The Fighter,'' to be directed by Darren Aronofsky, with Mark Wahlberg as the boxer Mickey Ward, known as Irish, and an actor yet to be named as his drug-battered trainer. The studio also has ''Up in the Air,'' directed by Jason Reitman, in which George Clooney plays the human-resources guy who cares more about his frequent-flier miles than about the people he fires; it is closer to production.
 Other projects promise to be on the serious side as well, notwithstanding the signals from the audience in the last few weeks. 
 Those include ''The Tourist,'' from Spyglass Entertainment, in which Tom Cruise is expected to play a threatened American traveler; ''The Last Airbender,'' from the filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan and Paramount, about an ''avatar'' that must save the world; and an untitled movie from Warner, directed by Clint Eastwood, based on the book ''Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation,'' about how rugby helped unite race-torn South Africa.
 In a much earlier downturn, Berkeley cheered millions of moviegoers by choreographing ''Gold Diggers of 1933,'' a song-and-dance spectacular about down-and-out actors on Broadway. The film, itself a successor to ''Gold Diggers of Broadway'' from 1929, was a hit and spawned sequels aplenty, even as the Great Depression slogged on.
 By 1931, in fact, Hollywood had already gotten the message. Along with the prestige releases ''Cimarron'' and ''Trader Horn,'' and the Victorian melodrama ''East Lynne,'' two of that year's Academy Award nominees for best picture were comedies: ''Skippy,'' about two boys and a dog, and an adaptation of ''The Front Page,'' the stage classic about cynical Chicago reporters.
 Lakeshore Entertainment, for its part, earlier this month began filming one of several future movies that aim to make matters feel less depressing. It is a new version of ''Fame,'' the high-energy dance musical about students at the High School of Performing Arts in New York, for distribution by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
 The original lifted spirits back in 1980, when inflation was at 14.4 percent, and the unemployment rate was 7.5 percent, only a little worse than now. 
 As ''Fame'' was released, on May 16 of that year, the Iranian hostage crisis had stretched into its 195th day. The movie took in a relatively modest $21 million at the box office. But 7 of that year's top 10 films in terms of revenue, including ''Airplane!,''''Stir Crazy'' and ''9 to 5'' -- now a stage musical set for a Broadway opening in the spring -- were comedies.
 (In another stab at the teenage dance genre, Paramount is close to shooting a remake of ''Footloose,'' which starred a young Kevin Bacon in 1984.)
 Still, none of this was really a factor, as Lakeshore executives began assembling their cast for the remake a year ago. 
 ''I think it just stemmed from what was happening in television,'' Robert Burke, Lakeshore's executive vice president for worldwide marketing, said in a telephone interview.
 ''You know, 'American Idol,' 'Dancing With the Stars,' '' Mr. Burke added. ''The hopes for this are high.''

HEADLINE: 2-Parent Black Families Showing Gains

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The number of black children being raised by two parents appears to be edging higher than at any time in a generation, at nearly 40 percent, according to newly released census data.
 Demographers said such a trend might be partly attributable to the growing proportion of immigrants in the nation's black population. It may have been driven, too, by the values of an emerging black middle class, a trend that could be jeopardized by the current economic meltdown. 
 The Census Bureau attributed an indeterminate amount of the increase to revised definitions adopted in 2007, which identify as parents any man and woman living together, whether or not they are married or the child's biological parents. 
 According to the bureau's estimates, the number of black children living with two parents was 59 percent in 1970, falling to 42 percent in 1980, 38 percent in 1990 and 35 percent in 2004. In 2007, the latest year for which data is available, it was 40 percent.
 For non-Hispanic whites, the figure in 2007 was 77 percent, down from 90 percent in 1970.
 While expressing skepticism about an increase so large in such a short time in the number of black children living with two parents, a number of experts said the shift was potentially significant.
 ''It's a positive change,'' said Prof. Robert J. Sampson, the chairman of Harvard's sociology department. ''It's been hidden.'' 
 The 2007 figure, itself, was more or less hidden among the nearly 1,400 tables in the 2009 Statistical Abstract of the United States, a portrait-by-numbers of the nation released Tuesday by the Census Bureau. 
 Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University, said that before 2007, a child living with two unmarried parents was usually classified as living with either a mother or a father, depending on who was the head of the household. 
 ''The unmarried parent was invisible,'' Professor Cherlin said. Given a new category, ''living with both parents, not married to each other,'' he added, ''I think the news is that the Census Bureau estimates that about 3 percent of American children are living with two unmarried parents. Because of the increases in living-together relationships, this is probably a higher figure than a generation ago.''
 Other experts generally embraced the direction of the statistics, if not the dimension of the changes they suggest.
 ''What we might be seeing is more cohabitation,'' said Kay S. Hymowitz, a scholar at the Manhattan Institute, a research group.
 Douglas S. Massey, a sociology professor at Princeton, cautioned that ''a bad economy does not make for stable marriages, so it is possible that we may see a reversal in 2008.''
 Professors Massey and Sampson recently edited a retrospective for the annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science on Daniel Patrick Moynihan's seminal study of the black family. 
 One contributor, Frank F. Furstenberg, a sociology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, cites converging trends of single motherhood by race, with the number of non-Hispanic white children living with two parents declining over a generation. 
 ''These racial differences have waned as a growing number of black women have begun to exercise greater control over their fertility,'' Professor Furstenberg writes, ''and as white women have started to experience the same sorts of constraints that blacks were feeling about their prospects of forming a lasting marriage when Moynihan focused on their plight.'' 
 Among other facts, the Statistical Abstract reveals that West Virginia is the only state in which more people have died since 2000 than have been born; more Burmese were granted asylum than people from any other country; more people speak Italian at home than Arabic; beds injure more people than bicycles; per capita consumption of tea has surpassed that of fruit juice; enrollment of college students from Saudi Arabia and Iran has returned to the levels before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 Also, women make up a majority of pharmacists, bartenders and bus drivers and nearly half the medical students granted degrees; bottled water consumption is up at the same time that per capita water use nationally is down; 91 percent of the nearly 12 million surgical and other cosmetic procedures performed in 2007 involved women; consumer complaints against airlines soared to 10,960 last year from 6,452 the year before. Among adults, Jews no longer outnumber Mormons; 57 percent of teenage girls reported having sexual contact in the previous 12 months. 
 Americans are spending more on prescription drugs ($259 billion in 2007, compared with $72 billion in 1995); the number of people living on the Atlantic Coast of Florida has risen 13 percent since 2000; gambling revenue at American Indian sites nearly doubled to $26 billion since 2002; nearly half of Americans under age 5 are Hispanic or nonwhite; the number of people 75 and over has doubled since 1980 to 18 million; only 5.5 percent of workers age 16 to 24 are represented by unions. 
 The Statistical Abstract includes a wealth of data from the Census Bureau and other sources. Most of it had been previously released, but not necessarily in context or in such an accessible format.

HEADLINE: After Profit Declines, Best Buy Plans to Cut Workers

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
MINNEAPOLIS-- The Best Buy Company, the consumer electronics retailer, said Tuesday that its third-quarter profit sank 77 percent as consumer spending declined.
 The company also said it would offer buyout packages to about 4,000 employees at its headquarters and slash spending in a move to cut costs, news that sent the retailer's stock soaring. 
 Best Buy, based in Richfield, Minn., said it would offer enhanced buyout packages to nearly all its corporate employees while cutting capital spending by 50 percent in 2009. 
 The chain also plans to open ''significantly'' fewer stores in the United States, Canada and China and said it might have to lay off workers depending on how many employees accept the buyout. The company had about 150,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal workers as of April, according to a regulatory filing.
 Best Buy's third-quarter profit was $52 million, or 13 cents a share, in the three months ending Nov. 29, compared with $228 million, or 53 cents a share, in the period last year.
 Revenue climbed 16 percent, to $11.5 billion from $9.93 billion. Sales at stores open at least 14 months fell 5.3 percent during the quarter.
 Shares of Best Buy rose $4.11, or 18 percent, to $27.68.
 Executives called the last three months the ''most challenging consumer environment'' in the retailer's history.
 ''We believe that there has been a dramatic and potentially long-lasting change in consumer behavior as people adjust to the new realities of the marketplace,'' the chief executive, Bradbury H. Anderson, said in a statement. ''We also believe that customers will continue to reward those retailers who understand their needs and desires, and offer relevant solutions at fair prices. Yet we clearly recognize that these changes require us to make significant adjustments.''

HEADLINE: Finding Good News In Prices

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Very few Americans alive today can remember a time when prices across the economy were falling. But they're falling now.
 The cost of fruits, vegetables, clothing and vehicles are all dropping. Housing prices have been falling for more than two years, and a barrel of oil costs about $45, down from $145 in July.
 The inflation report released by the government on Tuesday showed that the Consumer Price Index was 3 percent lower last month than it had been three months earlier. It was the steepest such drop since 1933. 
 These declines have raised fears of a deflationary spiral -- fears that help explain the Federal Reserve's surprisingly large interest rate reduction on Tuesday. And there is good reason to fear deflation. Once prices start to fall, many consumers may decide to reduce their spending even more than they already have. Why buy a minivan today, after all, if it's going to be cheaper in a few months? Multiplied by millions, such decisions weaken the economy further, forcing companies to reduce prices even more.
 But a truly destructive cycle of deflation is still not the most likely outcome. For one thing, the price of oil cannot fall by another $100 in the next few months. For another, the federal government will soon, finally, be fully engaged in trying to stimulate the economy. 
 In mechanical terms, the Fed's rate cut is actually a decision to pump more money into the economy (which will cause short-term interest rates to fall). Starting next year, the Obama administration is planning to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on public works and other programs.
 All else being equal, more money sloshing around an economy causes prices to rise. In this case, it will probably keep them from falling as much as they otherwise would have.
 So amid all the legitimate worries about deflation, it's worth considering what may be the one silver lining in the incredibly bad run of recent economic news: The cost of living is falling.
 Jobs are disappearing, bonuses are shrinking and raises will be hard to come by. But the drop in prices, which isn't over yet, will make life easier on millions of people. It's possible, in fact, that the current recession will do less harm to the typical family's income than it does to many other parts of the economy.
 The reason is something called the sticky-wage theory. Economists have long been puzzled by the fact that most businesses simply will not cut their workers' pay, even in a downturn. Businesses routinely lay off 10 percent of their workers to cut costs. They almost never cut pay by 10 percent across the board. 
 Traditional economic theory doesn't do a good job of explaining this. During a recession, the price of hamburgers, shirts, cars and airline tickets falls. But the price of labor does not. It's sticky. 
 In the 1990s, a Yale economist named Truman Bewley set out to solve this riddle by interviewing hundreds of executives, union officials and consultants. He emerged believing there was only one good explanation. 
 ''Reducing the pay of existing employees was nearly unthinkable because of the impact of worker attitudes,'' he wrote in his book ''Why Wages Don't Fall During a Recession,'' summarizing the view of a typical executive he interviewed. ''The advantage of layoffs over pay reduction was that they 'get the misery out the door.' ''
 Companies resort to cutting jobs and giving only meager pay increases, increases that are even smaller than the low rate of inflation that's typical during a recession. This recession may well be the worst in a generation -- but thanks to the stickiness of wages, the pay drop for most families may not be much worse than that of a typical recession. 
 The forecasting firm IHS Global Insight predicts that prices will fall by an additional 1 percent in 2009. That would bring the total drop, from the summer of 2008 to the end of 2009, to roughly 4 percent. But you can be sure that most executives will not force their workers to take a 4 percent cut in their paychecks. The fears about morale will be too great. 
 Strange as it sounds, the drop in prices will keep real incomes -- inflation-adjusted incomes -- from dropping too much.
 I don't mean to make things sound better than they are. The economy is bad and getting worse. A deflationary spiral remains a real threat, even if it's not the most likely result. No matter what, unemployment is headed much higher.
 People who keep their jobs, meanwhile, will suffer through some stealth pay cuts -- higher health insurance premiums, for instance. Raises will also remain meager in 2010, even if prices start rising again. Like every other recent recession, this one will force families to take an effective pay cut, and a significant one.
 But the drop in prices will still soften the blow. And at this point, American families can use any bit of economic help that they can get.

HEADLINE: The Future of Recycling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Back at Junk Value, Recyclables Are Piling Up'' (front page, Dec. 8) makes the point that markets for American recyclables are now global and revenues from their sale have dropped precipitously as the domestic and world economy contracts. 
 But the volatility of commodity markets has always caused recycling revenues to be on shaky ground. In fact, the large growth in municipal recycling programs, which took off in the 1990s, occurred when local governments' share of revenues from recycling was nonexistent or uncertain at best. Only over the last five years have localities come to view recycling programs as more secure revenue generators. 
 What puts recycling at greater risk in the current downturn than during previous periods is the high level of stress on all aspects of the local government tax base. Under such conditions, recycling may be seen as a nonessential service to be cut back or eliminated, thereby wiping out years of public education and citizen outreach. 
 It is hoped that President-elect Barack Obama's stimulus package, which targets ''green'' jobs and local public works, also will include the recycling infrastructure. 
 Eileen Brettler Berenyi Westport, Conn., Dec.

 The writer is the publisher of a yearbook on recycling and other solid waste facilities.
 To the Editor:
 Despite the woes of the recycling industry, it is important to note that the glass packaging industry is aggressively moving forward with its plans to make all containers out of 50 percent or more recycled material by the year 2013. 
 Unlike other industries, the glass packaging industry does not rely on foreign markets like China to do its recycling for it. We recycle domestically, creating American jobs and helping the environment by reducing the amount of energy and resources needed to create each new container. 
 We need recycled material to achieve this goal, and we continue to encourage all Americans to recycle glass.

HEADLINE: Further Cuts In Output By OPEC Are Likely

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The OPEC cartel is preparing to announce its biggest production cut in decades, as producers struggle to contain a collapse in prices amid a global recession, Saudi Arabian and other OPEC representatives said Tuesday.
 But that did not stop oil prices from falling again as the market focused on the dire state of the global economy. Oil futures shed 91 cents to settle at $43.60 a barrel in New York, putting OPEC under pressure as its members meet Wednesday in Algeria for their fourth gathering since September.
 Saudi Arabia, the world's top exporter, and other producers said that OPEC was considering a cut of two million barrels a day, or the equivalent of 2.5 percent of global production, to ''bring things in balance,'' according to the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. 
 It would be the third cut announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in three months, and comes on top of previous pledges to slash daily production by a total of two million barrels. OPEC producers account for about 40 percent of the world's oil.
 In a move reminiscent of the 1998 oil crisis, when prices fell below $10 a barrel, OPEC will also appeal to producers outside of the cartel to trim their own production by 600,000 barrels a day. 
 Russia, the biggest producer outside of OPEC, is sending a high-level delegation to Algeria and said it would act in concert with the cartel to help prop up prices. But other producers that had collaborated with OPEC in the past, like Mexico and Norway, have ruled out any action.
 A big cut in production is a risky gambit by producers who fear their revenues will plummet next year but who run the risk of derailing any economic recovery if they act too aggressively. As ministers flew into the Algerian coastal city of Oran, the Federal Reserve in Washington cut its benchmark rate to a record low near zero in a bid to jump-start the American economy. 
 For the ailing economy, the only ray of light in recent months has been lower oil prices, which have pushed gasoline down to an average of $1.66 a gallon, far less than the record above $4 reached over the summer. If OPEC succeeds in reversing the tide in the oil market in coming months, it might bring gasoline prices back above $2 a gallon.
 But the oil collapse, while great for consumers, is devastating oil producers. OPEC is racing to get ahead of falling oil consumption around the world. The sudden economic slowdown has trimmed demand and swelled oil supplies, pushing down prices at record speed. Oil prices have fallen by about 70 percent from their July peak. After rising above $145, they plummeted to $40 a barrel earlier this month.
 Analysts are skeptical of OPEC's ability to engineer a quick turnaround, or stick with its past pledges to reduce production. Tuesday's comments ''could be the Saudis throwing down the gauntlet to test other producers to see if they will cut production,'' said Jan Stuart, an oil energy at UBS. ''But it is still pretty significant.''
 Representatives of Algeria, Kuwait, Qatar and Libya have all spoken in favor of a big cut in production in recent weeks. Iran and Venezuela, which need higher oil prices to balance their budgets, favor a production cut of two million barrels a day beyond the cuts already agreed to.
 ''We have to make a very strong decision,'' Rafael Ramirez, the oil minister from Venezuela, told reporters in Algeria. ''What's important is that there's consensus to cut and that we have to make a big cut.''
 While their needs differ, the world's major oil producers all have budgets that require oil prices well above $40 a barrel to balance, except for Qatar, according to analysts at UBS. But this time prices have fallen so fast they seem to have scared even the group's most conservative producers. 
 Significantly, the Saudi minister wasted little time in proposing the larger-than-expected cut as soon as he arrived in Algeria on Tuesday, breaking with his usual tradition of giving away little ahead of OPEC meetings. 
 If prices keep falling, producers will either have to slash spending programs or run budget deficits. Saudi Arabia recently said that $75 a barrel was a fair price.
 ''Supply is somewhat in excess of demand; inventories are also higher than normal,'' Mr. al-Naimi told reporters.
 A large cut would imply that Saudi production would fall below 8 million barrels a day for the first time since 2002. The kingdom said it pumped about 8.5 million barrels a day in November, down from its peak of 9.7 million barrels this summer. In a report this week, Arjun Murti, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, doubted the Saudis would be willing to bring their production below 8 million barrels, which he called ''a line in the sand.''
 One problem for OPEC is that compliance with previous agreements has been spotty, and there is no guarantee that producers will stick with anything they agree to on Wednesday. 
 While OPEC said it would reduce production by 1.5 million barrels a day at the end of October, for example, not every country has followed through. Analysts believe OPEC producers have taken out 800,000 to 1 million barrels a day in November. 
 OPEC has not faced such a challenging environment since at least the 1980s. The main problem is oil consumption has taken a plunge in the major developed economies of the United States, Europe and Japan. But more worryingly for the oil producers, China might follow. The International Monetary Fund said on Monday that it might cut its 2009 forecast for China's economic growth in half, to 5 percent, as evidence mounts that the global downturn may spread to the developing world. The warning came as China said its industrial output grew at the slowest pace since 1999. 
 This means that the growth of China's oil demand, which had been one of the main drivers of oil prices in the last decade, could come to a virtual standstill. Some analysts are even forecasting a drop in Chinese consumption in the fourth quarter as the country's exports plummet.
 Few analysts expect OPEC to be able to stabilize the market quickly. In such an environment, the best the cartel can hope for is to set the stage for oil prices to rebound once the global economy recovers.

HEADLINE: Florida Water Board, Voting 4 to 3, Approves U.S. Sugar Deal in the Everglades

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Hector Florin contributed reporting from Clewiston, Fla.

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
Florida's water managers agreed to buy nearly 300 square miles of land from United States Sugar on Tuesday, approving a $1.34 billion deal that could reshape the Everglades, the sugar business and several small towns that have relied on agriculture for decades. 
 The decision by the board of the South Florida Water Management District, by a vote of 4 to 3, with one abstention, moves the state closer to completing its largest and most expensive environmental acquisition. But supporters and opponents said economic uncertainties could keep the deal from closing. 
 Board members were so concerned about the worsening financial picture that they added an amendment to the contract that says its debt burden from the purchase must not ''adversely affect'' the district's core operations, like flood control. 
 ''What we did today was put the district in the strongest possible position,'' said Shannon A. Estenoz, who voted yes. ''We provided ourselves a large enough escape hatch, if you will.''
 United States Sugar said in a statement that the change was a ''nonmaterial modification'' and did not need approval from its board. But the acquisition still faces obstacles. 
 Tuesday's vote begins a 60-day auction period, in which competing offers -- one has been made, by a family-owned farming company called the Lawrence Group -- must be considered by United States Sugar's shareholders.
 Florida Crystals, a politically powerful competitor that owns strategically located land for restoration, has also sued to stop a state court from approving the state's contract.
 ''There's still a lot of work to do,'' said Michael W. Sole, secretary of Florida's Department of Environmental Protection. ''Discussions and negotiations with other parties are going to be very real and very hard.''
 Several board members said their main concern was financing. The most pessimistic district estimates show the deal costing $3.4 billion over 30 years, when the costs of borrowing are included, an expense that could require a 22 percent cut to its budget. 
 Michael Collins, the board's most vocal critic of the purchase, said the cost would kill projects already approved and financed, including an effort to help Florida Bay by turning already acquired farmland west of Miami into wetlands.
 ''That project's gone,'' Mr. Collins said. ''A lot of projects are gone.''
 Even supporters of the deal acknowledged that the district ran the risk of spending beyond its means.
 ''The simple answer is that the district can't afford to do this on our own,'' said Jerry Montgomery, a board member and senior vice president for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, who voted yes. 
 Mr. Montgomery said he hoped the Obama administration would see the state's purchase as a vital part of its plans for green jobs. 
 Ms. Estenoz said all Florida residents would benefit from the additional water storage, which would make flooding and droughts less severe. Eric Buermann, the board's chairman, compared the acquisition to the purchase of Louisiana and Alaska. 
 ''This is not as large as Alaska, but in the history of Florida it is almost as big,'' Mr. Buermann said before the vote. 
 Environmentalists generally agreed. ''No one in the state would have bet that we'd be able to advance a monumental land acquisition of this scale,'' said Kirk Fordham, chief executive of the Everglades Foundation. ''This allows us to move forward with restoration in a less expensive and more natural way.''
 Getting to that point could take at least a decade. In announcing the plan six months ago, Gov. Charlie Crist said the acquisition was as important as the creation of Yellowstone National Park because it offered a chance to restore the original ''flow-way'' between Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades. In a statement Tuesday night, Mr. Crist said, ''This land acquisition is the most important step in the history of true Everglades restoration.'' 
 But the contract approved Tuesday does not include plans or financing for transforming the land. State officials acknowledged that the shape of their effort could not yet be determined because it depended in part on land swaps with other sugar growers and money from Congress. 
 ''It will take six years to make a good plan,'' said Paul N. Gray, an ecologist with Audubon of Florida. 
 During that time, United States Sugar will continue to farm, leasing back its land for $50 an acre, a discount of about $200 off the market rate that has led some critics to call the deal a corporate bailout. 
 The state can seize control after seven years. 
 What happens at that point remains unknown. Governor Crist has said he will create an economic redevelopment plan for the areas most affected by the purchase, and especially the 1,700 employees of United States Sugar. But residents and local politicians said their needs had been pushed aside or ignored. 
 In Clewiston, a town created by United States Sugar in the 1930s, few residents voiced approved of the sale. Like many others, Lori Williams, who was serving customers at the Common Grounds coffee shop downtown, said she worried about the company and the town's businesses. 
 Her husband, James, has been employed by United States Sugar for three decades, Ms. Williams said. And even though could receive a large payout from the sale, she said it would not be enough to offset the extinction of his daily routine, of the life he loved. 
 ''My husband has been there since he was 17 years old,'' she said. ''It's all he knows.''

HEADLINE: In Fraud Case, Middlemen In Spotlight

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG; Reporting was contributed by Alison Leigh Cowan, Alex Berenson, Michael J. de la Merced and Zachery Kouwe.

 BODY:
As a go-between who shepherded clients and their money to Bernard L. Madoff, Walter M. Noel became so prosperous that he was only too happy to show off his good fortune to the world.
 In 2002, Vanity Fair dispatched the photographer Bruce Weber to shoot a lavish spread of Mr. Noel's wife and their five grown daughters at his home in Connecticut (''Golden in Greenwich,'' read the headline). That was followed, in 2005, by a Town and Country story on the Noel family's tropical retreat in Mustique. 
 These houses -- joining Mr. Noel's addresses in Palm Beach and Southampton and on Park Avenue -- were visible evidence of his investment empire, the Fairfield Greenwich Group, which had $14.1 billion in February. 
 Mr. Noel's firm, including four sons-in-law as partners, now has the distinction of being the biggest known loser in the Madoff scandal, to the tune of $7.5 billion. 
 For Fairfield Greenwich and a handful of other big feeder funds that were essentially pouring billions of dollars each into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, a lucrative business evaporated last week when federal prosecutors said Mr. Madoff had been operating what may have been the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.
 Mr. Madoff puts his own fraud at $50 billion and discussed details of it with federal prosecutors in New York on Tuesday, according to people briefed on the meeting. 
 The Fairfield Greenwich Group charged clients an annual fee of 1 percent of assets invested for providing access to exclusive hedge funds and performing due diligence on them, in addition to a fee of 20 percent on investment gains each year, according to people close to the fund's operations. At that rate, an investment of $7 billion paid Mr. Noel's company $70 million annually, and then $140 million more in a year in which Mr. Madoff reported a 10 percent gain (he steadily reported returns of 10 to 12 percent).
 Other middlemen for Mr. Madoff's vehicles -- like J. Ezra Merkin and his Ascot Partners fund and Gerald Breslauer, a financial adviser in Los Angeles who invested with Mr. Madoff on behalf of Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg -- also collected millions in fees, though they may have had different arrangements. 
 Mr. Merkin and his Ascot fund took 1.5 percent of assets. On Friday, New York Law School filed a lawsuit in Federal Court in Manhattan against Mr. Merkin and Ascot. The suit claims he abdicated his fiduciary responsibilities and issued false and misleading documents. Mr. Merkin's lawyer said he intended to defend the lawsuit vigorously. 
 The Tremont Group, a unit of Oppenheimer that is in turn owned by MassMutual, had $3.3 billion with Mr. Madoff, while Optimal Investment Services of Geneva, a unit of Santander of Spain, puts its exposure at $3.1 billion. Other big investors include Kingate Management at $3.5 billion, Union Bancaire Prive of Geneva at $1 billion and Bank Medici of Vienna at $2.1 billion, demonstrating the worldwide reach.
 Mr. Noel's largest fund, the $7.3 billion Fairfield Sentry fund, invested exclusively with Mr. Madoff. Mr. Noel has not disclosed how much of that was his own or belonged to family members and how much was his investors'. One of his daughters said, through a spokeswoman at Rubenstein Public Relations, that ''a very substantial part of each family member's personal assets was invested with Bernard Madoff alongside those of our investors.''
 Fairfield Greenwich is based on East 52nd Street, though Mr. Noel worked frequently from Fairfield with his partners, Jeffrey Tucker, formerly of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Andres Piedrahita. The 78-year-old Mr. Noel had a master's degree in economics and a law degree -- both from Harvard -- and had worked for decades in banking before he founded Fairfield Greenwich, which established itself primarily as a marketing entity.
 ''As it grew beyond, you know, an informal, personal concern where Walter and a couple of people were investing money for his friends, they developed as a marketing force to put Madoff and investors together,'' said George L. Ball, a former executive at E. F. Hutton and Prudential-Bache Securities who became friends with the Noels decades ago when both lived in Greenwich.
 Mr. Noel met Mr. Madoff in the early 1980s and the businesses of both men grew symbiotically. Mr. Noel was as good a salesman as Mr. Madoff could have wished for. Mr. Noel is routinely described as affable, assured, graceful and nonaggressive. ''He's a terribly good person, almost in the sense of Jimmy Stewart in 'It's a Wonderful Life' combined with an overtone of Gregory Peck in 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' '' Mr. Ball said.
 Mr. Noel grew up in Nashville and met his future wife just after law school, when mutual friends set them up on a blind date. 
 They built a modestly prosperous life in Greenwich, and were perhaps best known among associates for their Christmas cards-- ''the people with five stunning girls,'' in the words of a family friend. 
 ''As we know, Walter's success came after several thin years,'' wrote John J. McCloy, a banker from Greenwich who described himself and his wife, Laura, as the Noels' ''best friends for more than 30 years,'' in May in a letter recommending the Noels to membership in a private club. 
 In an interview, Mr. McCloy declined to name the club and said that he and his family had not invested with Mr. Madoff. 
 Mrs. McCloy went on to praise the Noels for their ''personal charity.''
 ''Monica is a person, when friends have been down on their luck, who will quietly send a check in the mail, or airline tickets,'' she said. 
 The Noel sisters went to prestigious colleges in the United States -- Harvard, Yale, Brown, and two at Georgetown -- but their spouses are largely from abroad, which helped the company extend its global reach. 
 Mr. Piedrahita, who is married to Corina Noel, grew up in Bogota, Colombia, went to Boston University, and made a career in the marketing of hedge fund products before becoming a partner in the firm in 1997. Lisina Noel's husband, Yanko Della Schiava, worked for two textile firms in Italy and ''markets F.G.G.'s offshore funds throughout Southern Europe from his base in F.G.G.'s Lugano representative office,'' according to the company's Web site. Alix Noel's husband, Philip Jamchid Toub, is from Lausanne, Switzerland, and is also involved in marketing the firm's offshore funds in New York. Marisa Noel's husband, Matthew Brown, went to St. Mary's College in San Francisco and also has a marketing position at the firm.
 A fifth Noel daughter, Ariane, lives in London and is married to Marco Sodi, an Italian financier.
 David Patrick Columbia, the editor of NewYorkSocialDiary .com, said they had burst on the New York-Southampton social scene in the last few years. ''They bought a Stanford White house near Lake Agawam a couple of years back,'' he said. The house has been valued at $9.4 million. 
 People in the industry continue to question Fairfield's due diligence. Michael Markov, a hedge fund consultant, said that he was hired by a fund two years ago to look into Fairfield Sentry's returns and found that it was ''statistically impossible to replicate them,'' he said. 
 Mr. Markov said that he found only one hedge fund whose returns correlated to Mr. Madoff's. That was the Bayou fund, which was prosecuted by the government for fraud in 2006.

 667 Fifth Avenue (20th Street), Brooklyn, (718) 285-9425, eurotripbrooklyn.com
 Eurotrip's name is the same as the title of a forgettable teenage comedy, an ''American Pie'' knock-off with a rail pass; it is also the awkward if endearing name of a gastro-bar in Brooklyn's South Slope that serves the neighborhood well. While college basketball games play reassuringly on the TV above the bar, the kitchen serves Mittel-European comfort food in what might be called recession-era portions. 
 Take the fried cheese ($10), a paperback-size slab of breaded Edam on a pile of crispy roasted potatoes. A gooey, crunchy, sizable mess, it gets surprising shades of flavor from the a tangy tartar sauce and pile of lingonberry jelly. Or the halusky ($7), a traditional Slovak dish, is just as straightforward and filling, a potato dumpling mac-and-cheese topped with crispy bacon chunks. Though listed as an appetizer, it is more likely to satisfy than whet an appetite. Or more to the purpose of a bar, line your stomach.
 There is a heartfelt attempt to support central European viniculture, but it is better to ignore wines like the Egri Bikaver ($7), a funky and unpleasant Hungarian red. Instead, stick to what the region does best, and choose from the 20-plus different beers, including a handful on tap, such as the creamy Bavarian hefeweizen ($6 pint). It is exactly the right companion for the Wanderwurst ($11), three different grilled sausages stacked on a pile of sauteed onions and warm sauerkraut. The night I was there, it included bratwurst, knockwurst and chorizo, a Euro trip. The sausages change regularly.
 The menu makes some sudden detours, and if a dish feels wrong (pork egg rolls, chicken on penne), trust your instincts. But all is forgiven if you end with a hot Berlin cider ($8), with fresh sage and bourbon. It is a mug of grown-up comfort, just right for the season.

HEADLINE: Electoral Rot Nearby? The Russians Don't See It

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: ZHODINO, Belarus 

 BODY:
The voting monitor began his rounds on election day here at Polling Place No. 7. ''Issues? Violations?'' he asked the poll workers, glancing around like a casual sightseer. They said no, so he left.
 The monitor, Kholnazar Makhmadaliyev, breezed from one polling site (''What's up? Things O.K.?'') to another (''Everything fine here?''), shaking a lot of hands, offering abundant compliments and drinking brandy with this city's mayor. 
 Such went Mr. Makhmadaliyev's stint on a large observer mission led by the Kremlin that concluded that Belarus, a former Soviet republic and an ally of Russia, had conducted a ''free, open and democratic'' parliamentary election in late September. 
 The Kremlin monitors' version of reality, though, clashed with the one described by a European security group, whose own monitors dismissed the election as a sham tainted by numerous shortcomings, not the least of which was vote rigging. 
 The monitors dispatched by the Kremlin did not report anything like that. Nor did they raise concerns about Belarus's security service, still called the K.G.B., which had exerted harsh pressure on the opposition, imprisoning several of its leaders over the last year and thwarting their campaigns. Or about state-controlled television broadcasts repeatedly branding opposition leaders as traitors.
 Or, for that matter, about the final results: a sweep of every seat in the 110-member Parliament by supporters of President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, often described as Europe's last dictator.
 The Kremlin under Vladimir V. Putin has sought to bolster authoritarian governments in the region that remain loyal, and these election monitoring teams -- 400 strong in Belarus alone -- are one of its newer innovations. They demonstrate the lengths to which the Kremlin will go to create the illusion of political freedom in Russia and other former Soviet republics, even though their structures of democracy have been hollowed out. 
 The monitors play a critical role in creating a democratic veneer, solemnly giving their customized assessments and formal reports, which are promoted by the government-controlled media. They also provide a counterweight to observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who denounce the same elections.
 The goal for the Kremlin is to convince the public -- and, perhaps, even foreigners -- that these governments are lawfully elected and representative of the popular will.
 ''These monitors really illustrate what is happening in the post-Soviet space,'' said Andrei Sannikov, an organizer of European Belarus, an opposition movement. ''The monitors bless everything -- in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, places where we know there are no real elections. These leaders want to be accepted and seen as truly democratic, even though they are unreformed and unchanged. They want to present themselves as equal to the American president.''
 Ultimately, Mr. Sannikov said, ''they want some kind of legitimacy, especially in the eyes of the West.''
 A Sphere of Influence
 By backing these leaders, Russia has also reaped economic benefits and maintained its regional sphere of influence. It has done so even while seeking to destabilize pro-Western neighbors, most notably when it invaded Georgia in August in response to what it said was Georgian aggression. Belarus, which has 10 million people, is the only former Soviet bloc nation to Russia's west that maintains warm ties with the Kremlin.
 The United States and its NATO allies have also sought good relations with many of the authoritarian governments in the region, to offset the Kremlin's influence, to maintain military bases and to increase business opportunities. Still, the West has generally refrained from endorsing the results of elections in these countries.
 Senior Russian officials tend to tie themselves in knots explaining how governments that have crushed opposition movements can conduct fair balloting. The officials refer to Western election monitors as a tool that the West uses to smear Russia and other former Soviet republics.
 Vladimir A. Pekhtin, a vice speaker of the Russian Parliament who supervised the Kremlin monitors in Belarus, said every recent election in the former Soviet Union had been democratic and fair. He included countries like Uzbekistan, whose president has ruled since the end of Communism and was re-elected last year with 88 percent of the vote.
 Asked about the conclusions of Western monitors in Belarus, Mr. Pekhtin said, ''They just made it up, invented it, to try to show that there was some kind of rot.''
 Still, even some insiders acknowledge what is at work here.
 Igor Y. Yurgens, an adviser to President Dmitri A. Medvedev who is the chairman of a liberal-leaning research group set up by Mr. Medvedev, described the Kremlin missions as doing little more than currying favor with neighbors.
 ''It's a pretty clumsy thought that the near abroad can be consolidated only through this, through being polite to the authorities in place,'' he said.
 ''They regard it as a diplomatic endeavor -- be good to your ally,'' Mr. Yurgens said, referring to the Kremlin. ''Don't poke him in the eye when the whole of the West is poking him already.''
 An Unlikely Monitor
 As he canvassed polling places at a rate of one every 5 to 10 minutes, Mr. Makhmadaliyev, the Kremlin's monitor in Zhodino, allowed that he knew little if anything about Belarus's political situation. That is understandable, given that he is from a village in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, in Central Asia.
 The observer teams typically work under the umbrella of the Commonwealth of Independent States, an alliance of former Soviet republics controlled by Moscow. In Belarus, many monitors were Russians, but some were from friendly countries like Tajikistan that had particularly checkered human rights records.
 Mr. Makhmadaliyev, 60, won a parliamentary seat last April in Tajikistan, where the elections tend to be as fair as those in Belarus. A member of the ruling party, he received 86 percent of the vote, officials said.
 He had received no training in election monitoring, he said, but that did not concern him. His sole aim, he said, was to assess whether election day was orderly in Zhodino, a city of 65,000 about 25 miles from the capital, Minsk.
 Rumpled and courteous, he wore a blue armband that identified him as an official observer. He took no notes. And everywhere he went -- polling sites in schools, recreation halls and apartment buildings -- the responses to his brief questions were the same.
 ''Everything is fine here,'' said Larisa A. Chichina, the senior official at Polling Place No. 7. 
 He pronounced himself satisfied.
 Still, to judge an election based only on whether people can physically cast ballots is a little like reviewing a restaurant based solely on the quality of its waiters.
 Election experts say it is equally important to determine whether candidates can conduct their campaigns without pressure, whether the government denies the opposition access to the news media, particularly state television, and whether votes are tabulated fairly.
 But Mr. Makhmadaliyev said he would not delve into those issues in Zhodino.
 ''It doesn't interest me at all,'' he said. ''I am interested in whether people can vote on their own, whether people are given the freedom to vote.''
 (The monitors later released a report declaring that the overall election climate, including the news coverage, had been free and fair throughout Belarus.)
 Mr. Makhmadaliyev also said he saw no reason to conduct post-mortem interviews with the two candidates in the district to ask about their experiences. If he had, he would have heard the loser, Aleksandr V. Volchanin, from the pro-Western opposition, contend that the vote count had clearly been falsified.
 Election officials said Mr. Volchanin, a 46-year-old paramedic, received 24 percent of the vote, but he said the tally was highly suspicious because of a delay of several hours in announcing it.
 ''I think that they were very strongly thinking about what figures they wanted to put out there,'' Mr. Volchanin said.
 The winner, Dr. Vasily V. Lutikov, 51, a Lukashenko supporter, said Mr. Volchanin was looking for excuses. ''Of course, he is going to complain,'' Dr. Lutikov said. ''He is upset -- no one voted for him.''
 A Kremlin Counterattack
 The rise of these shadow monitors can be traced in part to Russia's presidential election in March 2004. Mr. Putin won a second term in a landslide, but there was a major blemish: the O.S.C.E.'s observers called the contest far from democratic. This seems to have spurred the Kremlin to counterattack.
 Russia began a campaign to undercut monitors from the group, which is an alliance of more than 50 countries that includes Russia and other former Soviet republics.
 The Commonwealth of Independent States, which had been sending informal monitoring teams, adopted a formal policy of doing so, officials said.
 The missions are now overseen by a former director of Russia's foreign intelligence service, Gen. Sergei N. Lebedev, whom Mr. Putin installed as the commonwealth's executive secretary last year. General Lebedev said that the West applied double standards, scrutinizing elections in the former Soviet Union far more closely than those elsewhere.
 ''We have a principle -- the main principle -- which is to objectively evaluate the situation, and not interfere in internal affairs,'' he said. ''We cannot evaluate the political system of a country. Our main goal is not to find shortcomings, as Russians say, to find bugs.''
 Mr. Putin, the current prime minister and former president, and his aides have lately evinced even more hostility to the O.S.C.E., calling for drastic cuts in its monitoring teams. They have also imposed such heavy limits on the group that it refused to monitor Russia's presidential election in March 2008. (The Kremlin monitors did -- and found no problems.)
 In the end, the Kremlin monitors in Belarus seemed to play just the role envisioned for them: helping to neutralize negative findings by the Western ones.
 As Lidia M. Yermoshina, chairwoman of Belarus's election commission, put it: ''If you are guided only by the O.S.C.E. report, you might become desperate. You need something to cheer you up.''
 Mr. Lukashenko had invited the Western monitors because he said that he was confident that they would endorse the election and that he was hoping for better relations with the West, which had imposed stiff sanctions on Belarus after opposition leaders were imprisoned in 2006. 
 But the Western monitors came down hard, so it was no surprise that the state-controlled television news focused mostly on the Kremlin teams.
 Even Mr. Makhmadaliyev, the Kremlin's monitor in Zhodino, made a television appearance.
 ''At all the polling places, we have noted a very good mood among the people,'' he told a reporter. ''They are coming to elect those who most deserve it.''
 With that, he hustled to his next stop, walking past a large sample ballot that directed people to vote for Mr. Lukashenko's candidate.

HEADLINE: Goldman Reports a $2.1 Billion Loss

BYLINE: By BEN WHITE

 BODY:
During the boom years on Wall Street, there was good, and then there was Goldman good. In these dark days, there is bad, and then there is Goldman bad. 
 The long, profitable run at Goldman Sachs officially ended on Tuesday when the bank reported its first quarterly loss since it went public in 1999.
 But the loss, $2.12 billion, was less than many analysts had feared, and Goldman ended its fiscal year in the black -- a remarkable feat given the losses that have hobbled so many other banks. 
 Shares of Goldman soared on the news, jumping 14.35 percent, or $9.54, to $76, amid a broad stock-market rally prompted by a sharp reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. 
 Many investors concluded that Goldman retains underlying strength, despite serious questions about whether it can be as profitable as it once was. Goldman, which transformed itself into a bank holding company several months ago, can no longer take the risks it once did and faces far greater regulatory oversight. 
 ''If one assumes that the charge-offs will dissipate and the company's fortunes will improve given the stimulus being provided to the economy, Goldman's outlook is much better than its fourth fiscal quarter results would imply,'' Richard X. Bove, analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, wrote in a note to clients. 
 Even after the rally on Tuesday, Goldman shares were down 64.66 percent for the year. 
 Goldman sidestepped earlier losses in the financial crisis by staying out of the high-risk subprime mortgage market and taking an early bet against the United States housing industry. But the bank has been unable to avoid taking big markdowns after nearly 30 percent declines across global equity markets in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Nov. 28.
 Goldman's quarterly loss, which amounted to $4.97 a share, begins a run of what is expected to be poor banking results. Morgan Stanley will report its earnings on Wednesday, and is expected to announce a loss of around $400 million.
 In the fourth quarter of last year, Goldman earned $845 million, or $1.81 a share. For the year, Goldman earned $2.32 billion, or $4.47 a share, an 80 percent drop from $11.6 billion, or $24.73 a share, last year. 
 The bank stayed profitable in a year that brought the emergency sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and government rescues for the insurer American International Group and for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation's largest mortgage finance companies. 
 ''Our results for the fourth quarter reflect extraordinarily difficult operating conditions, including a sharp decline in values across virtually every asset class,'' Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, said in a statement. ''While our quarterly performance obviously didn't meet our expectations, Goldman Sachs remained profitable during one of the most challenging years in our industry's history.'' 
 Revenue in Goldman's big trading and principal investment business was negative $4.36 billion, in contrast to $6.93 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. 
 Goldman slashed compensation and expenses and benefits by 46 percent in 2008, to $10.93 billion, reflecting a lower reserve for bonus payments because of the bank's poor performance, including a decline of $490 million in the fourth quarter. 
 None of Goldman's top seven executives will take a bonus for this year. Morgan Stanley has made a similar decision. 
 Employment at the firm, which had been 32,569 at the end of the third quarter, decreased 8 percent in the fourth quarter. Goldman has said it would reduce head count by a total of 10 percent, but some analysts say they believe that it will need to make deeper cuts to reflect declining revenue and a slowing global economy. 
 Goldman also benefited from a lower tax rate in 2008. The bank said it had an effective tax rate of 1 percent for the year and paid $14 million in taxes, down from 34.1 percent in 2007, when it paid $6 billion. Goldman said the decrease was ''primarily due to an increase in permanent benefits as a percentage of lower earnings and changes in geographic earnings mix.'' 
 After the announcement, Moody's Investors Service, the debt rating agency, downgraded the long-term senior debt ratings of Goldman Sachs to A1, from Aa3. Other ratings were affirmed but the outlook on them remains negative. 
 David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, said it an interview that about $1 billion in losses came in real estate investments while $600 million came in its stake in the shares of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. 
 ''Over time, a lot of those are great investments,'' he said, reiterating the belief within Goldman that these were largely unavoidable losses that will be reversed as market conditions improve. The same cannot be said for banks with huge holdings in subprime mortgages and related securities that may never recover much of their value, according to Goldman executives. 
 Mr. Viniar said it was too soon to say when markets might recover but that huge efforts by governments in the United States and around the world should begin having positive effects. 
 Mr. Viniar, reflecting a view privately expressed by Goldman officials, said he did not believe that the bank needed to make an acquisition to help its balance sheet. 
 Speculation has centered on Goldman's buying a retail bank or a trust bank that manages money for large institutions and wealthy individuals.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Plunged 19% in November

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The construction of new homes plummeted in November by the largest amount in almost a quarter-century as builders slashed production in the face of a recessionary economy.
 The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new home starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 625,000 from a downwardly revised level of 771,000 in October. 
 That is a drop of 18.9 percent, the steepest since March 1984. The total is far below the 740,000 pace that Wall Street economists expected.
 Applications for building permits, considered a good sign of future activity, fell by 15.6 percent to 616,000, from an upwardly revised figure of 730,000 in October. Economists expected an annual rate of 700,000 permits, according to a survey by ThomsonReuters. 
 The housing starts and permit figures are at all-time lows, breaking records that were set last month.
 Builders continue to be discouraged by the prospects of a housing turnaround amid what's likely to be the worst recession in decades, spurring rising unemployment and foreclosures.
 More dour housing news came Monday, as the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo housing market index held at a record-low level of nine in December for the second straight month.
 ''It is going to be a very cold winter indeed for homebuilders,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist for forecasting firm MFR Inc., wrote in a note to clients Monday.
 Index readings higher than 50 indicate positive sentiment about the market. But the index has drifted below 50 since May 2006 and has been below 20 since April.
 Builders began new single-family homes at an annual rate of 441,000 last month, the department said, 16.9 percent below October's figure of 531,000. That is the steepest drop in single-family home starts since January 1991.
 Tighter lending standards, rising defaults and fear about the housing market's future have sidelined buyers, an absence felt acutely by homebuilders such as D.R. Horton, Pulte Homes and Centex Corporation.

HEADLINE: (Not So) Standard Procedure

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
The medical tool's catchy name, CyberKnife, evokes digital accuracy. But the way the federal Medicare system treats CyberKnife seems anything but precise.
 CyberKnife is a new but fast-growing radiation treatment for prostate cancer, spurred by radio and newspaper ads that stress its convenience and results. The chief selling point is that CyberKnife treatments take five days instead of the eight weeks for conventional prostate cancer radiation, although many experts say they believe that the medical evidence is inconclusive on whether it works as well as those older methods. 
 But geography may play as big a role as medicine in determining which men diagnosed with prostate cancer are eligible for CyberKnife. As it turns out, Medicare pays for the treatments in 33 states -- but not in 17 others. 
 States that do not provide coverage include big ones like California and Texas, but also less populous places like Alaska and South Dakota. Medicare will pay for a man's CyberKnife treatments in New Hampshire, but not across the border in Vermont. 
 The disparities result from a policy principle as old as Medicare itself, in which officials in Washington leave many reimbursement decisions to the discretion of 15 regional contractors around the country. A dozen of them willingly pay for CyberKnife treatments among other prostate options. But three of the regional contractors have balked at covering CyberKnife, saying there is not enough evidence of its long-term effectiveness against prostate cancer. 
 Many health policy experts applaud refusing reimbursement for treatments not supported by medical evidence. But some also point to CyberKnife as emblematic of the inconsistent way that the federal Medicare budget -- expected to be $477 billion in the current fiscal year -- is spent, region to region. 
 ''Most policy makers think that, in general, we would want to do more national coverage decisions, partly because there's a concern that the evidence review in most local regions isn't very good,'' said Dr. Steven D. Pearson. He is president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an organization partly financed by the insurance industry that is pushing for the use of evidence in medical decisions.
 ''You can live on one side of the street and get a procedure, but on the other side of the street you can't,'' Dr. Pearson said.
 At an average Medicare cost of $29,000, CyberKnife prostate treatment is not cheap. But it can be less expensive than some other radiation methods, which may cost as much as $50,000. And so, if CyberKnife became the standard treatment for prostate cancer, Medicare might save significant money. An estimated 219,000 men in this country are expected to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in the coming year, most of them of Medicare age.
 Leo Stutzin, 73, a retired art and theater critic for The Modesto Bee in California, had tentatively chosen CyberKnife treatments for his prostate cancer after doing Internet research a few months ago. But because his doctor told him he would have to pay for the treatments himself, Mr. Stutzin is now undergoing two months of almost daily treatment with a more conventional radiation method that Medicare does cover in California. 
 ''Medicare is a national program,'' Mr. Stutzin said. ''If it's available in Connecticut and Virginia, it should be available here.''
 Most medical claims to Medicare are paid routinely. But questions frequently arise when it comes to newer treatments and technologies. And over the years, Medicare has resolved only about 300 such questions with blanket national coverage rulings. Meanwhile, thousands of other coverage policies have been -- and continue to be -- decided region by region. CyberKnife is among the starker examples of how widely coverage can vary from one region to another. 
 The principle of local decision-making traces to the creation of Medicare in 1965. Because some doctors and lawmakers had argued that federal meddling in medical decisions would be tantamount to ''socialized medicine,'' Congress allowed for regional autonomy in reimbursements. 
 Over the years, there have been complaints about the system, as when a 2003 report by the Government Accountability Office criticized Medicare for regional differences in covering a treatment for Parkinson's disease tremors. Medicare responded by declaring that it would cover the treatment throughout the nation. 
 But some experts argue that the regional system is more efficient than having the federal government dictate national coverage in every case. And Medicare officials say the regional contractors -- generally units of private insurance companies -- have no financial motive to withhold coverage, because the companies receive the same payment from the government regardless of what treatments are covered. 
 ''Our guidance to them is that if there's no evidence it works, they shouldn't pay for it,'' said Dr. Steve Phurrough, Medicare's coverage director in Washington. ''The CyberKnife is a good example of a technology where you can review the evidence and come to different conclusions.'' 
 A national coverage decision on CyberKnife is not currently in the works, according to a Medicare spokesman, Donald E. McLeod. It remains to be seen whether a Democratic president will seek changes in the system. Dr. Pearson, of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, said that while coverage variations might not yet be a front-burner issue for President-elect Barack Obama, ''It would be consistent with your archetype of what a Democratic administration would start to consider as one of its policy options -- to someday address the inconsistency.'' 
 The three Medicare contractors that have declined to cover CyberKnife for prostate cancer are TrailBlazer Health, Palmetto GBA and Noridian Administrative Services. The affected states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming.
 In response to a reporter's questions, Palmetto, whose Medicare jurisdiction includes California, issued a statement saying that its medical directors had reviewed the evidence about CyberKnife. They concluded that the literature supporting its long-term effects on prostate cancer was sparse and that leading doctor groups believed that treating the disease with CyberKnife remained in the ''investigational'' stage, Palmetto said in the statement. 
 ''We have all seen the medical problems and complications when pharmaceuticals and therapeutic modalities are released for general use before their effects are fully known,'' Palmetto said.
 CyberKnife, made by Accuray of Sunnyvale, Calif., was allowed onto the market by the Food and Drug Administration in 1999 as a treatment for brain and spine tumors. Two years later the F.D.A. authorized it for use throughout the body. Accuray, as well as hospitals and clinics that operate the CyberKnife machines, which cost $3 million to $5 million, have been promoting their use on various cancers, including lung and pancreatic cancer -- and, increasingly, prostate cancer.
 According to Accuray, patients can get by on fewer treatments because the machines deliver highly focused beams of radiation at heavier doses than conventional systems. But some leading radiation oncologists worry that the cumulative radiation that CyberKnife delivers over a course of prostate treatments -- ultimately lower than what patients would receive in standard therapy -- is not adequate to treat the disease. 
 ''They are basically pushing the envelope,'' said Dr. William R. Lee, a radiation oncologist at Duke University. ''If they're right, it's going to be an important advance. If they're wrong, there's a potential for a big downside.''
 With about 80 patients studied under the regimen in published peer-reviewed research over five years, the results for CyberKnife are promising. Yet, because prostate cancer is frequently slow-growing, Dr. Lee argues that five-year data with so few patients may not be very meaningful. Others raise concerns that high daily doses may increase radiation side effects that can show up years after treatment. 
 The board of the radiation oncology society, the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, or Astro, has called CyberKnife promising, but raised questions this year about the evidence supporting its use in prostate cancer, saying ''there is not sufficient or mature data to demonstrate equivalency to existing standard treatment modalities.'' The statement also applied to other brands of the technique, which is known as stereotactic body radiation therapy. 
 Citing the variety of proven treatments for prostate cancer, one member of the Astro board, Dr. Louis Potters of North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, said that advertising CyberKnife directly to consumers could confuse patients, who have to choose the best treatment from an already bewildering array of options. 
 ''Patients are becoming commodities and prostate cancer is the ultimate example,'' Dr. Potters said. 
 Some critics of Astro, though, say the group has its own financial motives in preferring previous forms of external radiation -- which, because they involve more trips to the doctor, tend to be more profitable for radiation oncologists. CyberKnife's proponents include Dr. Matthew R. Witten, a doctor in New York State -- where Medicare pays for the treatment. Dr. Witten, a Long Island physicist, runs the CyberKnife program at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, which actively advertises the treatments. 
 Dr. Witten said CyberKnife should be viewed in the context of the way radiation oncology has evolved in the past -- with new methods being developed and pushed into service before long-term clinical data is available. 
 ''The data with CyberKnife are not as mature as with other treatment modalities,'' he said. ''But from what I see with our patients, anecdotally, they are doing wonderfully.''

HEADLINE: A Shopping Nexus Outside Washington Plots a Future as an Urban Center

BYLINE: By EUGENE L. MEYER

DATELINE: TYSONS CORNER, Va. 

 BODY:
This intersection in Fairfax County is a mecca for shoppers: it is the Washington region's largest retail center, with 5.9 million square feet of shopping, and it includes the country's 10th-largest mall. It is also due for a major makeover -- after the sinking economy rebounds. 
 In October, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors accepted the recommendations of a 36-member task force that had labored for three years on a plan to turn this traffic-clogged maze of malls and office parks into an urban center that has more housing and is less dependent on cars. This month, the supervisors said they would move quickly in 2009 to pass regulations allowing for greater density, consistent with the long-range plan for Tysons. 
 The plan has been widely applauded as a forward-thinking blueprint to convert this ''edge city,'' 13 miles from downtown Washington, into the epitome of ''smart growth'' by 2050. The area is ultimately envisioned as having high-rise apartments adjoining four new rail transit stations built along an extension of the Metro system, shuttle buses, a pedestrian-friendly street grid, urban parks and outdoor plazas.
 The plan aims to be a guideline to be followed over decades, which is fortunate, because it was being completed just as the economy took a sharp downturn. 
 Macerich, a national shopping center company based in Santa Monica, Calif., now owns the 300-shop Tysons Corner Center, the original mall here. The company has short-term plans, which were approved by the county in January 2007, to turn acres of parking into 3.4 million square feet of office, hotel and residential space and some additional stores. But it is not clear how soon this will happen. ''Our plans are really tied to market demands,'' said John E. Harrison, the vice president for development at Tysons. 
 Similarly, Theodore N. Lerner, the developer who built Tysons Corner Center as well as Tysons's second major mall, has indefinitely postponed constructing an office building here -- his fifth, announced by his firm two years ago -- ''due to current economic conditions,'' he said in an interview.
 As it stands, Tysons is the nation's 12th-largest employment center, based on its 26.7 million square feet of office space, according to an analysis by Integra Realty Resources. Altogether, there are 115,000 retail and office workers and 17,000 residents at Tysons. This ratio is ''just out of whack,'' said Stuart Mendelsohn, a land-use lawyer, former county supervisor and task force member. If the plan is carried out, by 2050 Tysons will have an estimated 150,000 full-time residents, who will be able to walk to work, restaurants and shops. 
 Today, nearly half of Tysons's 1,700 acres are streets and parking. In all, the area has more than 35 million square feet of commercial space, more than the downtowns of Miami, St. Louis or San Diego. 
 The once rural ''corner'' that defines Tysons is the intersection of Routes 7 and 123, now major commuter routes in Washington's Virginia suburbs. The Capital Beltway, the highway ringing the nation's capital, adjoins Tysons, and Dulles International Airport is a short toll road away. ''All roads really lead to Tysons,'' says Christopher Gladstone, president of Quadrangle Development, a Washington firm active in the area.
 The coming of the Beltway in the mid-1960s made Tysons Corner accessible to shoppers across the Potomac River in Maryland as well. In 1968, Mr. Lerner opened Tysons Corner Center, and in 1988, he opened Tysons II, now known as the Galleria, a more upscale version of his original mall. Mr. Lerner, who owns the Washington Nationals baseball team, has since sold both malls but remains a substantial landholder in the area. 
 The growth of Tysons has slowed with the economy. This year, one new office building has been completed, though it awaits approvals before occupancy. This 325,000-square-foot structure, known as Park Place II, adjoins a future Beltway exit. About 10 percent is leased, to the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson. 
 One other Class A building is under construction: a 13-story, 295,000-square-foot office tower at 1850 Towers Crescent Drive. As yet, it has no tenants. It is being built by Quadrangle and is to be completed next August.
 No other new projects are expected for a while. ''In this environment, this is it, until the economy turns around and there is a need for additional space,'' said Robert H. VeShancey, a managing director for the leasing agent, Jones Lang LaSalle. 
 When completed, the Towers Crescent project will include a pedestrian bridge to the sprawling Tysons Corner Center. The mall, in turn, will link to one of the four new Metro stations, which are scheduled for completion in 2013. A 300-unit apartment building will ultimately be part of the Towers Crescent complex, but its start awaits an upturn in the market, Mr. Gladstone said. 
 Work on the long-term plan for Tysons began when the economy was flush with optimism and cash. Over three years, the Tysons task force held 45 meetings, leading to this fall's final report. The task force's vision has generally been applauded, although some critics contend it is too heavily weighted to the wishes of developers and that it plays down the potential impact of the traffic and the need for infrastructure improvements in the face of rising density.
 ''We were supposed to protect the neighborhoods,'' said Amy L. Tozzi, a retired federal employee who lives in a nearby condominium and who was a citizen representative on the task force. ''Instead, the developers held sway.''
 As the task force work progressed, 30 Route 7 property owners, including several car dealerships, joined to devise a single redevelopment plan that is consistent with the committee's recommendations. Their chief architect is Doug Carter of McLean, Va. ''Tysons Corner can become a textbook example of how to turn an absolute planning catastrophe into a textbook example of ecologically sensible, sustainable architecture,'' Mr. Carter said. 
 The Metro stations could be a catalyst to such an end. But ultimately, even the boosters acknowledge, the grand designs of planners remain subject to the laws of supply and demand.
 ''What is the status of the market when Metro arrives, and who's willing to build on speculation then?'' Mr. Carter said. ''This very much depends on market forces, the reality of life. If the market's not there, that will slow things up.''

HEADLINE: A Record Drop in Consumer Prices

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Consumer prices fell at the fastest rate on record in November, while home construction skidded nearly 20 percent to its lowest levels in 50 years, according to government data released Tuesday. 
 The new reports offered further evidence of the ''weaker prospects for economic activity'' cited by the Federal Reserve as it cut its target overnight interest rate to a range of zero to 0.25 percentage points, a record low.
 The Labor Department reported that consumer prices fell for the second consecutive month, at the fastest rate since the government began keeping track in 1947. 
 Prices at cash registers and gas pumps across the country were a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent lower in November from the month before, led downward by a 17 percent decline in energy prices.
 The core rate of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was flat for the month.
 The price of gasoline plunged 29.5 percent while the cost of fuel oil fell 13.6 percent. Food and beverage prices crept up 0.2 percent in November, their slowest rate of growth all year, while clothing prices were up 0.3 percent.
 The unadjusted year-over-year inflation rate was 1.1 percent, the government reported.
 ''I've never seen the economy slam on the brakes as much as it has in the last three months,'' said Bill Hampel, chief economist at the Credit Union National Association. 
 Meanwhile, new data showed the nation's housing market continuing to lag. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted 625,000 in November, far below Wall Street's expectations. 
 The housing starts in November represented an 18.9 percent decline from the previous month and were 47 percent lower than November 2007. New-home construction in October was revised downward to 771,000 units from an earlier estimate of 791,000. 
 ''This is mind-bogglingly awful,'' Ian Shepherdson, United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. ''The only consolation here is that unless sales drop much further from their already fantastically depressed level, the pace of new construction is so low that inventory will fall quickly. Right now, though, housing is still a disaster area.''
 Building permits, a measure of future construction, also fell sharply in November, dropping by 15.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted 616,000.

HEADLINE: From Albany, Move to Trim Pension Plans

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Danny Hakim reported from Albany, and Steven Greenhouse from New York. Michael Barbaro and Joel Stonington contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson on Tuesday proposed a steep rollback of some of the generous pension benefits that have been an alluring feature of government work for decades, initiating a contentious reckoning with public employee unions.
 The governor is proposing to reduce benefits for newly hired state and municipal workers, including those in New York City, by placing them in a new pension category. The New York City portion of the plan was developed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 ''We've made too many promises and asked for too few sacrifices,'' the governor said during an address to the Legislature. ''We're going to have to change our culture as we know it.''
 The pension proposal was part of an austerity budget unveiled by Mr. Paterson. 
 One of the most controversial elements of the pension proposal would require the city's police officers and firefighters to work 25 years and reach age 50 before they qualified for a full pension. At present, they can qualify for a full pension after 20 years of work, regardless of age -- a coveted perk known as ''20 and out.'' 
 ''Giving with one hand while taking away with the other simply makes no sense,'' said Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, who said that the city had only recently granted raises that made it more competitive with suburban police forces.
 ''This proposed change to the pension for future police officers will undo any progress made on compensation issues,'' he said.
 Under the governor's proposal, workers in the state pension system would have to work until they were at least 62, instead of 55. The changes would apply to all state workers, many city employees, including teachers, and employees of a number of municipalities outside New York City.
 New workers would also have to contribute 3 percent of their pay to the pension system for their entire career; currently the contributions stop after 10 years of service. And workers would no longer be allowed to use overtime in their last year of service to bolster their future pension payments. 
 Mr. Paterson's move is reminiscent of steps taken by many American corporations over the last two decades, including changes initiated by the Big Three automakers several years ago. While states are grappling with shortfalls amid the deepening recession, New York's situation is particularly dire. Not only is the state faced with a $15.4 billion deficit, but New York's main financial engine, Wall Street, has been diminished by the credit crisis.
 Further, while savings from pension changes take years to fully pay off, the value of pension funds has already been depleted by the market's decline. 
 Still, the governor's budget will not pass without a major battle in Albany, and changes to the benefits of city workers require approval by the City Council. 
 Union leaders have close ties to lawmakers and have expressed outrage that years of negotiated benefits are being swept aside. The Web site of the Civil Service Employees Association called Mr. Paterson's budget ''possibly the worst in recent history.''
 And some of the proposals have been floated before, and rejected, though the global financial crisis may have changed the political calculus even for legislators in Albany.
 Mr. Paterson does have a stick to pressure unions into accepting his pension plan: layoffs. His budget proposes to lay off only 521 employees in a work force of nearly 200,000.
 He demurred Tuesday when asked whether steeper layoffs could be expected if the unions balked at his demands. 
 ''I don't want to jump ahead of a negotiation or threaten the public employee unions,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''The public employee unions are saying probably the same things that most of us would say if we represented the workers, but inevitably they do have to come to a conclusion that there has to be some redress for this budget deficit.''
 Other proposals by the governor call on current state workers to give back a previously negotiated 3 percent salary increase next year and defer a week's pay until they retire. His budget would also require future retirees to significantly increase their contributions for health care coverage. 
 In the city, pensions for uniformed service members -- who include police officers, firefighters, sanitation workers and corrections officers -- would vest after 10 years of service rather than the current 5, meaning that at least 10 years of work would be needed to qualify for even a minimal pension. 
 The city would also change the way pension payments were calculated to mitigate the common practice of uniformed officers accumulating hundreds of hours of overtime in their final year to maximize their future benefits.
 The governor's office also said that to help finance pensions, the bill would require all new uniformed workers in New York City to contribute 5 percent of their salary until they have 25 years of service. For many uniformed workers, that 5 percent contribution would be a significant increase above what they paid now.
 The Bloomberg administration estimated that the proposed pension changes would save the city $5.4 billion over the next 20 years.
 Mayor Bloomberg was quick to applaud the proposal.
 ''Right now,'' he said ''we are paying full retirement benefits to people in their 40s. And especially as people are living longer, we simply can't afford to do it forever.
 ''Our pension system is one of those areas where spending has grown to an unaffordable rate. And we simply have to find a way to rein it in,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference on Tuesday.
 One New York City detective, a 19-year veteran who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to violate Police Department rules, said that ''20 and out'' was ''one of my whole reasons for becoming a police officer.''
 ''I would say undoubtedly 95 percent of the people who come on this job, that's a significant reason why,'' he said. ''They don't do it for the money.''
 Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the budget was ''essentially a de facto reopening of a contract unilaterally to cut wages'' because it would require newly hired teachers to continue contributing 3 percent of their pay after 10 years, the point at which most current teachers stop.
 But after years of Albany lawmakers sweetening pensions to please labor leaders, some analysts thought the governor needed to go much further. 
 ''It's a return to the early '90s status quo,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative research group. ''I wouldn't call it pension reform.''
 Charles M. Brecher, research director for the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed watchdog group, praised the move. 
 ''Pension costs have been growing rapidly,'' he said. ''Pension benefits are far more generous than what exists in the private sector, and it's a necessary step to get some structural balance in the state and city budget.''

HEADLINE: Obama's $10 Billion Promise Stirs Hope in Early Education

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
It was the morning after the presidential election, and Matthew Melmed, executive director of Zero to Three, a national organization devoted to early childhood education, could barely contain his exultation.
 Mr. Melmed fired off an e-mail message to his board and staff, reminding them of President-elect Barack Obama's interest in the care and education of the very young and congratulating Mr. Obama for campaigning on a ''comprehensive platform for early childhood.''
 Mr. Melmed was not alone in his excitement. After years of what they call backhanded treatment by the Bush administration, whose focus has been on the testing of older children, many advocates are atremble with anticipation over Mr. Obama's espousal of early childhood education. 
 In the presidential debates, he twice described it as among his highest priorities, and his choice for secretary of education, Arne Duncan, the Chicago schools superintendent, is a strong advocate for it. 
 And the $10 billion Mr. Obama has pledged for early childhood education would amount to the largest new federal initiative for young children since Head Start began in 1965. Now, Head Start is a $7 billion federal program serving about 900,000 preschoolers.
 ''People are absolutely ecstatic,'' said Cornelia Grumman, executive director of the First Five Years Fund, an advocacy group. ''Some people seem to think the Great Society is upon us again.''
 Despite the recession, Mr. Obama has emphasized his interest in making strategic investments in early childhood education. Asked if the financial troubles might force him to scale back, Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the transition, said, ''We simply cannot afford to sideline key priorities like education.''
 It is not as though Mr. Obama is running against the wind. Major philanthropists including Bill Gates; Warren Buffett's children; and George B. Kaiser, an Oklahoma oil billionaire, are financing education efforts for the very young. And the chairman of the Federal Reserve and many governors have said that expanding early childhood education should be a national priority.
 Driving the movement is research by a Nobel Prize-winning economist, James J. Heckman, and others showing that each dollar devoted to the nurturing of young children can eliminate the need for far greater government spending on remedial education, teenage pregnancy and prisons.
 Now that new initiatives seem likely, experts are debating how best to improve America's early childhood system, which they call fantastically fragmented, unconscionably underfinanced and bureaucratically bewildering. Some hesitate to use the word ''system'' at all.
 ''It's a patchwork quilt, a tossed salad, a nonsystem,'' said Libby Doggett, executive director of Pre-K Now, a group that presses for universal, publicly financed prekindergarten.
 There are federal and state, public and private, for-profit and nonprofit programs. Some unfold in public school classrooms, others in storefront day care centers, churches or Y.M.C.A.'s, and still others in tiny centers run out of private homes.
 ''California has 22 different funding streams for child care and preschool, and that mirrors the crazy labyrinth of funding sources coming out of Washington,'' said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who is the author of ''Standardized Childhood: The Political and Cultural Struggle Over Early Education.''
 Debates cut many ways. Some advocates want the nation to start by expanding services to all 4-year-olds. Others say improving care for infants and toddlers cannot wait. Some insist that middle-class and wealthy children must have access to public preschool. Others say the priority should remain with the poor. 
 Mr. Obama's platform, which Mr. Duncan helped write, emphasizes extending care to infants and toddlers as well, and it makes helping poor children a priority. It would also provide new federal financing for states rolling out programs to serve young children of all incomes.
 Outright opponents are fewer, and certainly less influential than they once were. In 1971, President Richard M. Nixon vetoed a bill that would have underwritten child care for everyone, arguing that the bill ''would commit the vast moral authority of the national government to the side of communal approaches to child rearing over against the family-centered approach.'' 
 For years after that, conservatives blocked many early childhood initiatives, but resistance has diminished in recent years.
 The last major federal initiative came in 1994, when the Clinton administration worked with Congress to create Early Head Start, which serves pregnant women and children from birth to age 3. Since then, states have largely carried the ball.
 In 1995, Georgia became the first state to commit to making prekindergarten classes available to every 4-year-old. New York and Oklahoma followed with similar plans in 1997 and 1998. But in New York, at least, the effort is far from complete. 
 During the Bush administration, federal financing for early learning programs has fallen. At the same time, many states have made substantial new investments in publicly financed classes for disadvantaged 4-year-olds, according to Pre-K Now. 
 In 2007, total spending by state governments for preschool education reached $3.7 billion. Six entities have outlined plans to offer classes to all preschoolers, regardless of income: Florida; Illinois; Iowa; Louisiana; Washington, D.C.; and West Virginia.
 ''Expectations and investments are soaring now as never before in the nation's history,'' Sharon Kagan, a professor of early childhood policy at Teachers College at Columbia University, said in a paper she wrote last year and presented at a conference last month.
 In Illinois, Mr. Obama supported efforts to expand child care and education. His interest traces, at least in part, to Barbara T. Bowman, the mother of Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser. Ms. Bowman leads early childhood education for the Chicago Public Schools. ''I talked with him a lot about these issues, but he understood it from the beginning,'' she said. ''He was always on board. I don't think I was the person who convinced him.''
 That person may have been Irving B. Harris, a Chicago philanthropist who helped finance Mr. Obama's campaigns for the Illinois Senate, said Harriet Meyer, president of the Ounce of Prevention Fund, a nonprofit devoted to child development issues founded by Mr. Harris.
 ''Irving could mesmerize you,'' Ms. Meyer said, ''and Barack met with Irving many times.'' 
 Ms. Meyer recalled a 2001 reception her group hosted in Springfield to discuss prekindergarten issues. She said only one lawmaker showed up: Mr. Obama, at the time a state senator.
 In his presidential campaign platform, Mr. Obama pledged to establish a Presidential Early Learning Council to coordinate federal, state and local policies; to quadruple financing for Early Head Start; to provide federal challenge grants for states to use for early care and education programs; and to expand home visiting programs for low-income mothers. The platform emphasizes improving quality, not just reaching more children.
 One program that embodies many of these features is Educare, a national consortium of early childhood centers financed by taxes and several family foundations. The first Educare Center, built in 2000 on the South Side of Chicago, offers all-day care and education to about 150 children from 6 weeks to 5 years.
 Marquia Fields, who works at a Target store, leaves her 2-year-old son, Winter, and his infant sister, Summer, at the Chicago Educare Centerfrom 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each workday. On a typical morning, Winter scoots down the hall to his classroom, where he joins seven other children and three teachers, since a high teacher-child ratio is a requisite for quality toddler care. 
 After breakfast, the children sit on a rug while teachers read a story, then practice recognizing the letters of their name. At midmorning, Winter romps in a gymnasium, and after lunch, he naps before arts and crafts.
 ''It's learning through play,'' Ms. Fields said. ''They learn routines. They learn boundaries. They learn to share, to express emotions instead of lashing out.''
 Educare costs about $18,000 a child, roughly the annual tuition of an elite Manhattan nursery school. By contrast, spending per child in state prekindergarten programs ranges from $10,494 in New Jersey to $2,335 in Florida. 
 Whether the top figures sound outrageous or like sound investments depends on how much one believes the research that shows large paybacks for the careful nurturing of poor children.
 One much-cited study is of a preschool program that offered high-quality services to a few dozen black children in Ypsilanti, Mich., in the early 1960s at a two-year cost per child of about $15,000. The study found that the investment, 40 years later, had rendered economic returns to society of some $244,000 per child, much of that in savings from reduced criminal activity. Critics have challenged the findings, in part because of the small number of children involved.
 Mr. Obama's platform accepts the broad logic of the Ypsilanti study. ''For every one dollar invested in high-quality, comprehensive programs supporting children and families from birth,'' the platform says, ''there is a $7-$10 return to society in decreased need for special education services, higher graduation and employment rates, less crime, less use of the public welfare system and better health.''

HEADLINE: Apple's Chief to Skip Macworld, Fueling Speculation

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
For the last 10 years, attending Steven P. Jobs's annual keynote address at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco has been a sacred pilgrimage for Apple enthusiasts. That ritual has now ended.
 Apple announced on Tuesday that Mr. Jobs would not appear at the Macworld conference in January and that the company's presentation would instead be delivered by Philip W. Schiller, Apple's senior vice president for worldwide product marketing. Apple also said it would withdraw from the conference after this year's event. 
 The news unleashed a wave of speculation among Apple fans about what this portends for the computer maker's lineup of products -- and for Mr. Jobs's health, which has been subjected to intense scrutiny in the last few years. 
 In a statement, Apple strove to undercut any downbeat interpretation of the news. 
 The company said that it was abandoning Macworld because it was able to unveil new products at its own events, like its Worldwide Developers Conference, held in June in San Francisco, and what has become an annual event each September at its campus in Cupertino, Calif., devoted to the iPod.
 The company is also now in a position to broadcast those events online and in its growing network of 250 well-trafficked stores around the world, reaching a broader audience than it could inside any single convention hall.
 ''Phil is giving the keynote because this will be Apple's last year at the show,'' said Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman. ''It doesn't make sense for us to make a major investment in a trade show we will no longer be attending.''
 Despite that explanation, the news that Mr. Jobs would not be making his anticipated public appearance at Macworld struck the predictable chords of anxiety among those who follow Apple. As bloggers and analysts traded rumors and theories about what it all means, Apple investors also reacted to the news, sending Apple shares down as much as 6 percent in after-hours trading.
 Mr. Jobs is a survivor of pancreatic cancer and has appeared unusually thin at recent appearances, though Apple says his health is fine.
 Another explanation is that Apple's slate of new product announcements in January is so unexciting that it does not require the considerable presentation talents of Mr. Jobs himself. In past years Mr. Jobs used the Macworld stage to unveil the iPhone and the thin MacBook Air.
 The Apple rumor mill has predicted that for January's show Apple is readying a new version of the Mac Mini, a boxy computer that is sold without a monitor, and a smaller version of the iPhone. If true, neither announcement would induce paroxysms of delight in the Apple faithful.
 ''Maybe they do have some surprising news and they are giving Phil Schiller a chance to introduce some exciting products,'' said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. ''But the likelihood of that is low.''
 Apple has appeared in recent months to be making an effort to shine the public spotlight on executives other than Mr. Jobs. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief operating officer, delivered a presentation to press and analysts at the October introduction of new Macintosh laptops. 
 Apple executives have also said they have a succession plan, but they have not publicly discussed it.
 Tuesday's announcement was a clear blow to IDG, a technology media company based in Framingham, Mass., that has been staging Macworld since 1984. This year's conference has already been hit by the news that several large companies, including Belkin, a computer accessories maker, and Adobe, the software publisher, would be scaling back their presence at the show for economic reasons. 
 Paul Kent, an IDG vice president and the general manager of the Macworld show, said he expected roughly the same number of exhibitors and attendees at the show in January as last January. He would not comment specifically about Apple's news, but he affirmed IDG's commitment to staging the show.
 ''We look forward to many successful years of Macworld to come,'' Mr. Kent said, reading from a prepared statement.

HEADLINE: Iowa Ex-Governor Picked for Agriculture Secretary

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Jeff Zeleny reported from Chicago, and David M. Herszenhorn from Washington.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama has selected former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa to serve as his agriculture secretary, according to officials familiar with the decision, and will make the announcement on Wednesday as he works to round out his remaining cabinet nominations.
 Mr. Vilsack, who briefly sought the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2008 race after serving two terms as governor, is a strong proponent of renewable energy and developing the nation's alternative fuel industry. He will be joined at a news conference here by Senator Ken Salazar, Democrat of Colorado, who will be nominated as interior secretary. 
 Mr. Vilsack's nomination comes at a time of extraordinary tumult for the American agricultural industry, which not only has been battered by the recession, but is also increasingly entangled in the contentious debate over energy policy. The Agriculture Department is also contending with a sharp increase in the demand for food assistance in the wake of the economic turmoil.
 Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Vilsack are regarded as staunch advocates of ethanol and other bio-fuels as a way to reduce the nation's reliance on foreign oil. And Mr. Obama and Democrats in Congress are working on a major economic stimulus package, in which they intend to promote the creation of thousands of new jobs tied to ''green energy'' industries, including the production of solar and wind energy.
 One of the first major decisions Mr. Obama and Mr. Vilsack may have to make is whether to grant the ethanol industry's requests for billions in federal aid in the stimulus bill, which Mr. Obama has said he hopes to sign into law quickly, perhaps on his first day in office.
 ''The big issue for him and any incoming secretary is going to be biofuels, that's the sector that right now is in such a volatile position,'' said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit group that is a leading critic of federal farm subsidies. American farmers, Mr. Cook said, are ''hitched to both the food system and the energy system, both of which are oscillating.''
 Mr. Vilsack, 58, sought the presidential nomination for about three months, dropping out shortly after Mr. Obama entered the race. At the time, Mr. Vilsack criticized the campaign as a process that rewarded intense fund-raising over innovative ideas. He endorsed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and served as a co-chairman of her campaign, often criticizing Mr. Obama as lacking experience for the job.
 But during the general election, Mr. Vilsack energetically campaigned for Mr. Obama, promoting their common ideas on renewable energy and rural growth. Late last month, Mr. Vilsack told friends he did not believe he would be selected because he had not been interviewed, but Democrats familiar with the process said the two men got along well during a recent meeting in Chicago.
 Mr. Vilsack, like the president-elect, is a strong advocate of combating global warming and developing alternative sources of energy. He was the co-chairman of a task force last year on climate change for the Council on Foreign Relations, which recommended phasing out subsidies for mature biofuels, including corn-based ethanol, as well as reducing tariffs on imported biofuels like Brazilian sugar ethanol.
 ''Let us build a 21st-century rural economy of cutting-edge companies and technologies that lead us to energy and food security,'' Mr. Vilsack wrote in one of several op-ed articles he had published during the campaign. ''Such an investment will revitalize rural America, re-establish our moral leadership on climate security and eliminate our addiction to foreign oil.''
 Tom Buis, president of the National Farmers Union, said Tuesday evening that the biggest challenge facing the next agriculture secretary would be writing rules for the new farm bill. Mr. Buis praised the selection of Mr. Vilsack, who as governor promoted the use of alternative energy as a means of revitalizing rural America.
 ''Governors understand what's going on out there,'' Mr. Buis said. ''With the severe economic conditions in rural America, it's good to have someone who understands the challenges we face.''
 Mr. Vilsack, a native of Pittsburgh, moved to Iowa to live in the hometown of his college-sweetheart-turned-wife, Christie Vilsack. His career in politics was unexpectedly born in 1986 when a disgruntled resident of Mount Pleasant barged into a City Council meeting and killed the mayor.
 Mr. Vilsack stepped in to serve as mayor. He later ran for the State Senate and in 1998 was elected governor in a campaign that even his closest friends did not believe he could win.
 Mr. Vilsack, who has spent the fall semester as a political fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, works as a lawyer in Des Moines. Four years ago, he was among those who were considered to be a running mate for Senator John Kerry. Mr. Vilsack was not on the short list of candidates to join Mr. Obama's ticket.
 Experts said Mr. Vilsack's experience as governor of a major corn-producing state makes him intimately familiar with many of the issues, but it also raises questions about whether he will be partial to growers of the crop that his state is known for.
 ''You can't be a politician from Iowa and not be identified with a pro-corn, pro-ethanol stance,'' said Mr. Cook, who leads the Environmental Working Group. ''I just hope he will be more realistic and shoot straight with the public about what the prospects are of this in terms of energy independence.''

HEADLINE: FED CUTS KEY RATE ALMOST TO ZERO; OBAMA MAPS PLAN

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and JACKIE CALMES; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve entered a new era on Tuesday, lowering its benchmark interest rate virtually to zero and declaring that it would now fight the recession by pumping out vast amounts of money to businesses and consumers through an expanding array of new lending programs.
 Going further than expected, the central bank cut its target for the overnight federal funds rate to a range of zero to 0.25 percent and brought the United States to the zero-rate policies that Japan used for years in its own fight against deflation. 
 Though important as a historic milestone, the move to an interest rate of zero from 1 percent is largely symbolic. The funds rate, which affects what banks charge for lending their reserves to each other, had already fallen to nearly zero in recent days because banks have been so reluctant to do business.
 Of much greater practical importance, the Fed bluntly announced that it would print as much money as necessary to revive the frozen credit markets and fight what is shaping up as the nation's worst economic downturn since World War II. 
 In effect, the Fed is stepping in as a substitute for banks and other lenders and acting more like a bank itself. ''The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth,'' it said. Those tools include buying ''large quantities'' of mortgage-related bonds, longer-term Treasury bonds, corporate debt and even consumer loans.
 The move came as President-elect Barack Obama summoned his economic team to a four-hour meeting in Chicago to map out plans for an enormous economic stimulus measure that could cost anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion over the next two years.
 The two huge economic stimulus programs, one from the Fed and one from the White House and Congress, set the stage for a powerful but potentially risky partnership between Mr. Obama and the Fed's Republican chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
 ''We are running out of the traditional ammunition that's used in a recession, which is to lower interest rates,'' Mr. Obama said at a news conference Tuesday. ''It is critical that the other branches of government step up, and that's why the economic recovery plan is so essential.''
 Financial markets were electrified by the Fed action. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 4.2 percent, or 359.61 points, to close at 8,924.14. 
 Investors rushed to buy long-term Treasury bonds. Yields on 10-year Treasuries, which have traditionally served as a guide for mortgage rates, plunged immediately after the announcement to 2.26 percent, their lowest level in decades, from 2.51 percent earlier in the day.
 Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds edged down to 7.215 percent on Tuesday, from 7.355 on Monday. Yields on riskier high-yielding corporate bonds remained in the stratosphere at 22.493 percent, almost unchanged from 22.732 on Monday.
 By contrast, the dollar dropped sharply against the euro and other major currencies for the second consecutive day -- a sign that currency markets were nervous about a flood of newly printed dollars. Some analysts predict that the Treasury will have to sell $2 trillion worth of new securities over the next year to finance its existing budget deficit, a new stimulus program and to refinance about $600 billion worth of maturing government debt.
 For the moment, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bernanke appear to be on the same page, though that could abruptly change if the economy starts to revive. Fed officials have already assumed that Congress will pass a major spending program to stimulate the economy, and they are counting on it to contribute to economic growth next year.
 In more normal times, the Fed might easily start raising interest rates in reaction to a huge new spending program, out of concern about rising inflation. 
 But data on Tuesday provided new evidence that the biggest threat to prices right now was not inflation but deflation. 
 The federal government reported on Tuesday that the Consumer Price Index fell 1.7 percent in November, the steepest monthly drop since the government began tracking prices in 1947. The decline was largely driven by the recent plunge in energy prices, but even the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, was essentially zero.
 Mr. Obama's goal is to have a package ready when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 6. His hope is that the House and Senate, with their bigger Democratic majorities, can agree quickly on a plan for Mr. Obama to sign into law soon after he is sworn into office two weeks later.
 The Fed, in a statement accompanying its rate decision, acknowledged that the recession was more severe than officials had thought at their last meeting in October.
 ''Over all, the outlook for economic activity has weakened further,'' the central bank said.
 ''Labor market conditions have deteriorated, and the available data indicate that consumer spending, business investment and industrial production have declined.'' 
 The central bank added: ''The committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.''
 With fewer than 10 days until Christmas, retailers from Saks Fifth Avenue to Wal-Mart have been slashing prices to draw in consumers, who have sharply reduced their spending over the last six months. On Tuesday, Banana Republic offered customers $50 off on any purchases that total $125. The clothing retailer DKNY offered customers $50 off any purchase totaling $250.
 Ian Shepherdson, an analyst at High Frequency Economics, said falling energy prices were likely to bring the year-over-year rate of inflation to below zero in January.
 The Fed has already announced or outlined a range of unorthodox new tools that it can use to keep stimulating the economy once the federal funds rate effectively reaches zero. On Tuesday, Fed officials said they stood ready to expand them or create new ones to relieve bottlenecks in the credit markets.
 All of the tools involve borrowing by the Fed, which amounts to printing money in vast new quantities, a process the Fed has already started. Since September, the Fed's balance sheet has ballooned from about $900 billion to more than $2 trillion as it has created money and lent it out. As soon as the Fed completes its plans to buy mortgage-backed debt and consumer debt, the balance sheet will be up to about $3 trillion.
 ''At some point, and without knowing the timing, the Fed is going to have to destroy all that money it is creating,'' said Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 ''Right now, the crisis is created by the huge demand by banks for hoarding cash. The Fed is providing cash, and the banks want to hoard it. When things start returning to normal, the banks will want to start lending it out. If that much money is left in the monetary base, it would be extremely inflationary.''

HEADLINE: The Great Unraveling

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

DATELINE: Hong Kong 

 BODY:
 The stranger, a Western businessman, slipped into the chair next to me at an Asia Society lunch here in Hong Kong and asked me a question that I can honestly say I've never been asked before: ''So, just how corrupt is America?''
 His question was occasioned by the arrest of the Wall Street money manager Bernard Madoff on charges of running a Ponzi scheme that bilked investors out of billions of dollars, but it wasn't only that. It's the whole bloody mess coming out of Wall Street -- the financial center that Hong Kong moneymen had always looked up to. How could it be, they wonder, that such brand names as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and A.I.G. could turn out to have such feet of clay? Where, they wonder, was our Securities and Exchange Commission and the high standards that we had preached to them all these years? 
 One of Hong Kong's most-respected bankers, who asked not to be identified, told me that the U.S.-owned investment company where he works made a mint in the last decade cleaning up sick Asian banks. They did so by importing the best U.S. practices, particularly the principles of ''know thy customers'' and strict risk controls. But now, he asked, who is there to look to for exemplary leadership?
 ''Previously, there was America,'' he said. ''American investors were supposed to know better, and now America itself is in trouble. Whom do they sell their banks to? It is hard for America to take its own medicine that it prescribed successfully for others. There is no doctor anymore. The doctor himself is sick.''
 I have no sympathy for Madoff. But the fact is, his alleged Ponzi scheme was only slightly more outrageous than the ''legal'' scheme that Wall Street was running, fueled by cheap credit, low standards and high greed. What do you call giving a worker who makes only $14,000 a year a nothing-down and nothing-to-pay-for-two-years mortgage to buy a $750,000 home, and then bundling that mortgage with 100 others into bonds -- which Moody's or Standard & Poors rate AAA -- and then selling them to banks and pension funds the world over? That is what our financial industry was doing. If that isn't a pyramid scheme, what is? 
 Far from being built on best practices, this legal Ponzi scheme was built on the mortgage brokers, bond bundlers, rating agencies, bond sellers and homeowners all working on the I.B.G. principle: ''I'll be gone'' when the payments come due or the mortgage has to be renegotiated.
 It is both eye-opening and depressing to look at our banking crisis from China. It is eye-opening because it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the U.S. and China are becoming two countries, one system. 
 How so? Easy, in the wake of our massive bank bailout, one can now look at China and America and say: ''Well, China has a big-state-owned banking sector, next to a private one, and America now has a big state-owned banking sector next to a private one. China has big state-owned industries, alongside private ones, and once Washington bails out Detroit, America will have a big state-owned industry next to private ones.'' 
 Yes, an exaggeration to be sure, but the truth is the differences are starting to blur. For two decades, a parade of U.S. officials came to China and lectured Beijing on the necessity of privatizing its banks, said Qu Hongbin, the chief economist for China at HSBC. ''So, slowly we did that, and now, all of a sudden, we see everybody else nationalizing their banks.''
 It's depressing because China in many ways feels more stable than America today, with a clearer strategy for working through this crisis. And while the two countries are looking more alike, they appear to be on very different historical trajectories. China went crazy in the 1970s, with its Cultural Revolution, and only after the death of Mao and the rise of Deng Xiaoping has it managed to right itself, gradually moving to a market economy. 
 But while capitalism has saved China, the end of communism seems to have slightly unhinged America. We lost our two biggest ideological competitors -- Beijing and Moscow. Everyone needs a competitor. It keeps you disciplined. But once American capitalism no longer had to worry about communism, it seems to have gone crazy. Investment banks and hedge funds were leveraging themselves at crazy levels, paying themselves crazy salaries and, most of all, inventing financial instruments that completely disconnected the ultimate lenders from the original borrowers, and left no one accountable. ''The collapse of communism pushed China to the center and [America] to the extreme,'' said Ben Simpfendorfer, chief China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.
 The Madoff affair is the cherry on top of a national breakdown in financial propriety, regulations and common sense. Which is why we don't just need a financial bailout; we need an ethical bailout. We need to re-establish the core balance between our markets, ethics and regulations. I don't want to kill the animal spirits that necessarily drive capitalism -- but I don't want to be eaten by them either.

HEADLINE: Allies See Germany Trying Bailout With a Thimble

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
Does the German government simply hate John Maynard Keynes? Or does it just have an enduring and passionate love for Herbert Hoover?
 Faced with a once-in-a-generation recession, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel knows what it is not going to do: spend money like it is going out of style. At a time when the global benchmark for decisive leadership boils down to the number of zeros that are attached to economic stimulus packages, Germany has taken a different path.
 Mrs. Merkel, displaying a defiant streak that in the French news media has earned her the sobriquet ''Madame Non,'' refuses to crank up the printing presses in earnest. By contrast, the prime minister of Britain, Gordon Brown, has slashed his country's value-added tax and is spending more freely. 
 Even Mrs. Merkel's own council of economic advisers has criticized her for not spending more as the German economy, Europe's largest, careens into a severe contraction that -- and here is the real sticking point -- threatens to export even greater misery to the European Union's weaker economies. 
 On Tuesday she pledged to come forth with a new spending plan in January, and speculation in the German news media put the total at close to $28 billion, on top of a $44 billion stimulus package announced earlier. All in all, it struck many experts as an inadequate response from the world's greatest exporting country. 
 Jeers about Mrs. Merkel's economic strategies have become de rigueur, rankling the corps of German politicians who worked feverishly to pass a $700 billion banking bailout package within a single week in October and have, after all, promised a good chunk of change already. 
 ''What was urgently necessary for the banks was done, as well as in any country,'' said Kurt J. Lauk, head of a business group closely affiliated with Mrs. Merkel's Christian Democrats. ''And there was a first stimulus package. So we don't need to hide from France or Britain.''
 Still, the stimulus packages offered so far pale in comparison to plans floated in the United States by the transition team of President-elect Barack Obama for a program of $700 billion to $1 trillion. 
 Mr. Lauk says Mrs. Merkel will not be a new Herbert Hoover, who seemed to do his best to drain the United States economy of its remaining lifeblood even as it tumbled into the Great Depression. 
 But her reluctance to follow other Western countries' lead has puzzled many allies and struck some of Germany's critics as oddly ascetic. 
 Peer Steinbruck, the German finance minister, has indicated concern over budget deficits and has characterized the British effort to kick-start its moribund economy as ''crass Keynesianism.'' In his view, European pressure for greater spending masked a desire to exploit the German taxpayer for the benefit of the country's neighbors. 
 To the question of why Germany did not simply spend its way out of recessions, as Keynes, the great British economist, suggested, Mr. Steinbruck shot back, ''Just because the lemmings chose the same way does not make it the right one.'' 
 Berlin appears to have other grudges against its European neighbors, often tinged with a measure of contempt for what it sees as their failings. 
 In its view, other countries scream for more German spending -- some of which would go to Italian shoes, for example, or French wine -- because they refused to make the hard choices in recent years that reinvigorated the German economy. 
 A series of labor reforms underpinned the German renaissance and have helped its unemployment rate fall despite the crisis, German officials say. But the measures were initially deeply unpopular and claimed political casualties. 
 One of those was Mr. Steinbruck, who lost his job as the powerful governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. He seems disinclined to let European colleagues off the hook now. 
 Fulminating against debt-fueled spending also resonates deeply with the German public. It may be true that only the oldest Germans have any personal recollection of the great inflation of the 1920s. 
 But most people are aware of the history, and the social chaos that ensued. The recent labor market reforms have also heightened fears for financial security. 
 Whatever the reason, Germans are the antithesis of the stereotype of the profligate Americans -- at least the profligate Americans of recent decades -- preferring to save as a hedge against what they often view as an uncertain future. 
 Peter Bofinger, a professor of economics at the University of Wurzburg and a rare admirer of Keynes among German economists, said this strain in the country's political culture can be misunderstood as a self-lacerating streak. Efforts to ease human suffering, after all, provided Keynes with his ethical impulse in the first place. 
 ''During every lecture I give, someone always comes up with the question, 'How are we going to handle our debt,' '' Mr. Bofinger said. ''You see this in personal conduct, and it is manifesting itself politically now as well.''
 Indeed, Mrs. Merkel's poll numbers point toward a victory for her Christian Democrats in elections that will come late next year. 
 A certain level of perfectionism also pervades German thinking about how money should be spent. In a recession, many economists would call this virtue a vice, but that has not stopped German officials from working through the details. 
 Mrs. Merkel is herself planning to huddle with state premiers in coming weeks to hammer out what additional public works projects could be financed. 
 ''If we could simply start building bridges overnight as Obama wants to do, then great,'' said Klaus F. Zimmermann, president of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. ''But some investments take years. I don't understand why the world doesn't comprehend this.''
 But as they watch their economies nosedive, what many European Union countries cannot comprehend is why the German government is so averse to temporarily running large deficits, and as the pressures rise they are growing less shy about airing their grievances. 
 Speaking of the relations among European countries, John C. Kornblum, United States ambassador to Germany in the Clinton administration, said, ''You are having an air-clearing experience -- confrontation, you might call it.''

HEADLINE: Paterson Proposes Austere Budget to Close Historic Deficit

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Michael Barbaro and Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting..

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
The Paterson administration, working to close the largest deficit in state history, unveiled an austerity budget on Tuesday that would include 137 new or increased taxes and fees, loosened restrictions on gambling and $9 billion worth of spending cuts. 
 Education would be particularly hard-hit, with an actual cut of $700 million in state aid in the next fiscal year, not just a reduction in projected spending growth. Increased aid for operating expenses and pre-kindergarten, which had been expected as part of a settlement in a long-running lawsuit, would be delayed by four years under the plan. Tuition at the State University of New York and the City University of New York would also be increased. 
 Medicaid spending would rise by about 1 percent under the plan, although the projected spending for hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers would be cut by more than $1 billion. 
 Gov. David A. Paterson's spending plan also calls for closing or merging seven smaller state agencies, eliminating property-tax rebate checks, curtailing general municipal aid to New York City and closing 13 prison camps or detention centers.
 The governor, addressing the Legislature, acknowledged that getting lawmakers to pass his budget would not be easy. 
 ''The other day somebody threw a pair of shoes at President Bush,'' he said. ''At the end of this budget presentation, if that's the most severe punishment I get, I'll sign for it now.''
 New York City would be hit hard by the proposal, which would eliminate more than $600 million in general purpose aid over the next two years on top of reductions in education aid. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the budget cuts would deprive the city of about $1 billion, potentially forcing him to order layoffs beyond the 500 he has already announced. ''We can't print money,'' he said. ''At some point, there is only labor left.''
 Mr. Bloomberg, who took pains to praise the governor for ''acting responsibly,'' nevertheless criticized him for cuts that he said would affect New York City disproportionately. 
 Some Democrats said the budget plan would weigh too heavily on poor and middle-class New Yorkers by ending property tax rebates and increasing licensing fees for a wide variety of workers with modest incomes, including barbers, bail enforcement agents, home inspectors, notaries public, manicurists and cosmetologists. Republicans said there were too many tax increases. 
 Loosened restrictions on gambling would allow more retailers to sell Quick Draw tickets, expanded hours at gambling facilities across the state and the installation of hundreds of video slot machines at the Belmont Park racetrack on Long Island, a controversial plan opposed by Assembly Democrats. 
 The total state budget, including federal matching funds, would be $121.1 billion. Spending of state funds would increase by only half a percent under the plan, a turnabout from years of spending rates well above the rate of inflation. 
 Mr. Paterson's plan would close a $15.4 billion deficit for the balance of the fiscal year that ends on March 31, and the next fiscal year. He is introducing his budget more than a month early as the state grapples with twin calamities -- the collapse of Wall Street, its main financial engine, and a deepening recession. 
 Mr. Paterson's budget is sure to touch off a contentious fight with the Legislature, which must approve it, and with labor unions across the state that have strong ties to lawmakers. Negotiations will be hampered because no clear leader has emerged to guide the Senate next year after elections last month left Democrats with a narrow majority in the chamber. 
 ''We simply cannot raise taxes when our economy is struggling,'' said Dean G. Skelos, the current Senate majority leader and a Long Island Republican. ''The governor's budget does not appear to include any plans to create new jobs and strengthen our economy.''
 The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, was more supportive, pointing out that education and health care constituted more than half of the budget.
 ''There is no way we can address a deficit of the magnitude that we are facing without finding savings in those two major areas,'' he said.
 While there were no broad-based income tax increases, there were all manner of new taxes, fees, fines or other assessments, expected to raise $4 billion next year. 
 The tax proposals are likely to touch almost every New Yorker in some way. The most notable new tax is an 18 percent levy on sugary soft drinks. But many other existing taxes would increase. The tax on car rentals would rise to 6 percent from 5 percent. Taxes on beer and wine would more than double. Taxes on gasoline, cable and satellite TV service, cigars and flavored malt beverages would also go up. And the cost of owning and operating a car would rise significantly, with 16 fee increases. The governor also proposed allowing wine sales in grocery stores and drug stores, which is expected to raise $105 million in the next fiscal year, mostly through licensing fees. 
 While the plan did not include an income tax increase for the wealthy, an idea pushed by Assembly Democrats, the state expects to raise $120 million next year by limiting the amount that millionaires can deduct from their state taxes. 
 Unions braced for a battle. 
 ''Kids did not create this crisis, and they should not bear the burden of it,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the New York City teachers' union.
 In a joint statement, George Gresham, the president of 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, and Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said, ''Today is a dark day for health care in New York.'' They added, ''These are staggering cuts that would shatter New York's health care infrastructure.''
 Mr. Paterson, for his part, said his plan sought shared sacrifice and included reductions across virtually every area of government.
 ''Adjusting our state budget to reflect this new fiscal environment will be an extraordinary challenge,'' Mr. Paterson said. His budget, he added, would begin ''the difficult process of fundamentally re-evaluating both how we manage government and what the state can afford to spend in a time of plummeting revenue.''

HEADLINE: British Bank Rescue Plan Is Under Fire

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- Gordon Brown's plan to rescue British banks slowed a growing crisis of confidence and became a model for the rest of the world, including the United States. The British prime minister's apparent initial success led some newspapers to christen him Flash Gordon, in honor of his alacrity and vision in facing the banking crisis.
But less than two months later, the plan is attracting mounting criticism from lenders, economists and opposition politicians for failing to fix the credit markets. And Mr. Brown himself acknowledged as much last week when he said the government was working on a ''second stage'' of the banking rescue. 
The first stage failed to thaw credit markets. Despite giving billions of pounds to banks, in exchange for shares, the government has been unable to prevent banks from hoarding the capital to protect themselves in uncertain economic times.
''There is no sign yet of significant easing of credit conditions. In fact, some banks are tightening the credit conditions,'' said Michael Taylor, a senior economist at Lombard Street Research in London.
Some analysts said the idea that recapitalizing banks would repair the lending market was flawed from the beginning because it was contradictory. On the one hand, the policy was meant to make banks reduce risk. On the other, it pressured them to lend more, which meant taking more risks.
''Current policy objectives are conflicting and incoherent,'' said Michael Coogan, director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders. ''The government needs to decide on its key priority. The tug of war with lenders being pulled in every direction at once needs to end.''
Vincent Cable, the finance spokesman for the opposition Liberal Democrats, said the multiple objectives of the recapitalization plan were ''canceling themselves out.'' He added that restoring lending must be a priority or ''the economy is threatened to be throttled.''
Britain agreed to inject $:50 billion ($78 billion) into Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and the mortgage lender HBOS in exchange for large equity stakes it would use to pressure the banks to ease lending. The idea was to eventually sell the stakes when the market recovered.
A separate credit line to back interbank lending, interest rate cuts and a fiscal stimulus package worth $:20 billion was supposed to further grease the lending market.
Though interbank lending rates started to decline slowly in October, they remain relatively high as banks hoard capital amid concern about rising loan defaults. For instance, banks failed to pass on the recent Bank of England rate cuts to customers -- the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage fell by 0.71 percent in November compared with a 1.5-percentage-point cut in the central bank rate.
Mr. Brown hoped that the capital injection would give banks enough capital to remain liquid while they wrote down bad assets and rebuilt their balance sheets so they could lend again. On Wednesday, Alistair Darling, chancellor of the Exchequer, attacked banks for not fulfilling their part of the deal, saying that with billions in taxpayers' money invested, the general public was ''looking for something in return.''
But the rescue plan had two inherent flaws the government failed to notice, some analysts said. First, the capital injection came in tandem with higher capital requirements intended to shield British banks from the effects of a deteriorating economy. The capital injection made banks stronger as they faced a worsening economic climate, but it did not give them enough capital to revive lending, said John Hitchins, head of the British banking team at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London.
The second flaw was that it failed to properly assess the risks of toxic assets that remained on banks' balance sheets and did nothing to help banks reduce the risks linked to any new loans.
''When everyone is at risk of losing their job, how do you assess the risk of your lending?'' said Matthew Sharratt, an economist at Bank of America in London.
The Bank of England quickly reduced interest rates to make loans more affordable for borrowers but with interest rates moving closer to zero percent and banks no more willing to lend, some analysts said Britain needed to be careful not to fall into a Keynesian liquidity trap. In that situation, monetary policy stops having any effect at all, as happened in Japan in the 1990s and could happen in the United States, which lowered key interest rates to historic lows on Tuesday.
Martin Weale, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London, which also advises the government, said the flaw of Mr. Brown's rescue plan was that it was too small. He said the solution was to pump almost three times as much capital into the banking system.
''In a normal crisis about 10 percent of G.D.P. is used to recapitalize the banks; we only put 3 percent of G.D.P. in there,'' Mr. Weale said. ''Banks are still cautious because they need more capital.'' But a further capital injection would also increase the government's shareholding in banks or even bring them fully under government control.
As the International Monetary Fund predicts Britain's economic output to fall 1.3 percent next year, compared with 0.7 percent in the United States, the government is coming under pressure to find new ways to support the economy.
The question is how. Mr. Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said he was considering a range of options, including a national loan guarantee plan, favored by the opposition Conservative Party, that would underwrite commercial or even household loans.
Another option would be for the government to pool toxic assets into a separate entity, a so-called bad bank, with the hope of freeing up banks' balance sheets and recouping some of the investment later, similar to the original structure of the troubled asset relief program in the United States.
In the meantime, time is running short for Mr. Brown, especially as the country heads toward an election that could come as early as next year. The mounting pressure became visible in Parliament on Wednesday when in an embarrassing slip of tongue he announced his government ''saved the world.'' He meant to say it saved the British banks.

HEADLINE: At Meeting In Brazil, Washington Is Scorned

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Simon Romero contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.

DATELINE: SAUIPE, Brazil 

 BODY:
Latin American leaders took another step away from the decades-old orbit of the United States at a meeting here that brought together nearly all of Latin America and the Caribbean, but excluded the United States and Europe. 
 And in the process of convening the leaders of 31 countries, Brazil once again flashed its credentials as the undisputed leader of Latin America.
 But the host country's highly popular president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, an ally of the United States, did not prevent the leaders from celebrating the inclusion of Raul Castro, Cuba's president, and from using the occasion to attack the United States and Europe for their roles in causing the global economic crisis that is roiling this region as well. 
 ''Cuba is returning to where it always should have been,'' Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's president, told reporters. ''We are complete.''
 The United States became a punching bag at the three-day conference, which ends Wednesday, in this tourist haven in Brazil's Bahia State. Mr. Castro was hardly alone in assailing the United States and what he called its ''neo-liberalist'' model for the credit crisis, which is affecting many other economies. 
 ''In the middle of an unprecedented global crisis, our countries are discovering that they aren't part of the problem,'' Mr. da Silva said. ''They can and should be fundamental players in the solution.'' 
 The timing of the meeting, just four months before the next Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago, was significant, analysts said. That meeting, first convened in Miami in 1994 at the urging of President Clinton, will include the United States and Canada but will exclude Cuba. 
 Mr. da Silva did his part to upstage the Summit of the Americas, even sending planes from Brazil's air force to ensure the presence here of presidents from poorer countries in Central America and the Caribbean. President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia were the only heads of state who did not attend. Vice President Francisco Santos of Colombia said that Mr. Uribe, a staunch American ally, stayed home to cope with the aftermath of deadly floods.
 The meeting drew together diverse coalitions of the region's countries, including the recently formed Union of South American Nations, or Unasur, a grouping that has held meetings in recent months that also excluded the United States.
 ''There is no question that this is about exclusion, about excluding the United States,'' said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy research group in Washington. ''Brazil is demonstrating its enormous convening power.''
 With the rise of China as a principal export destination and the visit last month by President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia to court Latin American leaders, there are more frequent reminders that the United States is becoming an ever more distant player in the affairs of the region, said Riordan Roett, the director of the Latin American Studies program at Johns Hopkins University. 
 ''The United States is no longer, and will not be ever again, the major interlocutor for the countries in the region,'' he said.
 One by one, the presidents saluted the inclusion of Cuba in the meeting, an expression that indicated a frustration with the efforts by the United States to exclude Cuba from similar hemispheric deliberations, said Michael Shifter, the vice president of the Inter-American Dialogue. 
 Many of the leaders, including Mr. da Silva, called for lifting the United States embargo of Cuba. ''This is a further step in the process of ensuring that Cuba occupies its rightful place of dignity in the region and throughout the world,'' said Bruce Golding, the prime minister of Jamaica.
 But even as the Latin American leaders spoke of their collective power and growing unity, regional strains have been evident. 
 In Bolivia, Oscar Ortiz, the president of the Senate and a prominent critic of President Evo Morales, called on Unasur, the new regional body, to investigate further recent killings in northern Bolivia, which a Unasur commission described unequivocally as a massacre.
 The region's leaders continue to struggle to pick a leader for Unasur. Tabare Vasquez, Uruguay's president, said in October that he would oppose the nomination of former President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina, a stance that reflects the tense relations between the countries in the past year.
 Tension has also been increasing between Ecuador and Brazil, with President Rafael Correa of Ecuador expelling executives from Odebrecht, a major Brazilian construction company, and disputing a loan by Brazil's powerful national development bank, which finances public works projects throughout Latin America. 
 But these disputes may have more to do with Brazil's rising regional profile as its multinational corporations compete more aggressively for business beyond Brazil's borders. In Mr. da Silva, Brazil has a leader who has been adept at relieving tension through diplomacy, even as Washington's diplomacy has become largely inoperative in much of the region. 
 ''Lula is a leader who practices the politics of the bear hug, by thinking all problems can be solved by a warm embrace,'' said Larry Birns, director of the Council of Hemispheric Affairs, a research group based in Washington.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 17 about a meeting of Latin American and Caribbean leaders in Sauipe, Brazil, referred incorrectly to the absence of the presidents of Peru and Colombia. They were the only two South American heads of state who did not attend -- not the only heads of state who were not there. (Leaders of 10 other countries did not participate.)

HEADLINE: Obama Team Has Forged Another Link With Clintons

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It's official. The old Clinton gang really is back together again. Answering the phones these days for the co-chairman of President-elect Barack Obama's transition, John D. Podesta, is none other than Betty Currie. 
 Emerging from retirement in southern Maryland to volunteer at Obama headquarters, Ms. Currie was the personal secretary to President Bill Clinton, who became caught up in an independent counsel investigation into his trysts with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Since leaving the White House, Ms. Currie, 69, has shied from publicity and kept a low profile in Hollywood, Md., where she lives with her husband, Bob, and Socks, the presidential cat, which she took with her after Mr. Clinton left office. 
 Ms. Currie, who works with local nonprofit organizations and serves on the Alcohol Beverage Board of St. Mary's County, declined to discuss her work for Mr. Obama or her recent life, citing a transition office policy against volunteers giving interviews. 
 Compelled to testify to a grand jury five times about Mr. Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie is widely admired in Clinton circles for her loyalty and effectiveness.
 Mr. Podesta, who was Mr. Clinton's last White House chief of staff, said it was natural for him to call Ms. Currie back to service.
 ''Of course I asked her because in the 30 years we have worked together, I have never known anyone with more grace, dedication and public spirit than Betty,'' he said. ''And she has one mean Rolodex.''
 Ms. Currie is the latest familiar face from the Clinton era to assist Mr. Obama's team. In addition to Mr. Podesta, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, his White House counsel and his economics, energy and environmental advisers all served in the Clinton administration. So did most of the cabinet officers he has chosen and many of the transition aides conducting agency reviews. And the newly designated secretary of state is Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 A longtime secretary in agencies like the Peace Corps, Ms. Currie left government to work for Democratic presidential campaigns in 1984 and 1988 before joining Mr. Clinton in 1992. She then served in Mr. Clinton's transition until he picked her to be his secretary. She stayed through all eight years, calmly managing the intersection of power and policy.
 Other Obama aides said they expected Ms. Currie to help out through the transition but not to return to the White House after the inauguration.
 Ms. Currie has kept in touch with the Clintons and donated $750 to Mrs. Clinton's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination this year. When she ran into Mrs. Clinton last spring, she told a writer from Southern Maryland Newspapers, Mrs. Clinton asked about Socks. 
 U.S. News & World Report has reported that Socks, now 19, has cancer.

HEADLINE: Ken Salazar

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
As he prepares to take office, President-elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of his administration. Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration.
 Chosen for: Interior secretary 
 Would bring to the job: A decade's worth of practice in water and environmental law in the private sector; two decades in government working on Western land-use issues, including water and natural resources; and experience in an assortment of political offices, including currently as a United States senator from Colorado, where he has been a supporter of renewable energy development. He also brings Latino roots and a powerful personal story: One of eight children, he grew up on a remote ranch in Colorado's impoverished San Luis Valley without electricity or running water. 
 Is linked to Mr. Obama by: Congress. Both came to the Senate in 2004 and lived in the same building in Washington. Mr. Salazar became one of Mr. Obama's most energetic supporters during the presidential campaign, pushing hard for him in Colorado and New Mexico, states he argued were important for Democrats to win. He delivered a nominating speech for Mr. Obama at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, and since the election has grown even closer to him, advising Mr. Obama's transition team. 
 In his own words: ''How we improve our energy security and reduce our dependence on foreign oil is the central national security, economic security and environmental security challenge of the next decade. It will determine whether we will continue to be entrenched in conflicts over resources in every corner of the world. It will determine whether we will triumph in our fight against oil-funded extremists and terrorists. And it will determine whether our economic fortunes will hinge on the price of oil that OPEC sets, or whether the U.S. will stand independently, as the world's innovator for clean energy technologies.'' (speaking at the Denver World Affairs Council, Nov. 16, 2007)
 Used to work as: A farmer and rancher, as well as an environmental and water lawyer in the private sector for 11 years. From there he entered government and politics, serving as chief legal counsel for Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado and also as executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources. From 1999 to 2004, he was Colorado's attorney general before winning his Senate seat. Mr. Salazar and his wife, Hope, have also owned small businesses in Colorado, including a Dairy Queen and several radio stations. 
 Carries as baggage: Not much. He is respected in Colorado by politicians of both parties for his measured approach and is praised as an honest broker, particularly by environmentalists, but also by business interests. A few environmental groups may fault him for his pragmatism, and some within the oil and gas industry may disagree with his cautious stance, like favoring a phased approach to opening Colorado's Roan Plateau to drilling. But the larger issue opened by his nomination is a political one: What happens to his Senate seat, particularly now that Colorado, which historically has favored Republicans, has elected a Democrat, Representative Mark Udall, as its other senator. It will be up to Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. to choose among an array of eager fellow Democrats should Mr. Salazar's nomination be approved. 
 Also known for: His prominent family, which can trace its lineage to the Spanish settlers of Santa Fe, N.M., in the late 1500s. The family is also emerging as a political force in the West, with Mr. Salazar's older brother, Representative John T. Salazar, being vetted by the transition team for agriculture secretary (it ultimately went to former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa). The two brothers, who share an interest in land-use and energy issues, are also heavily involved in veterans' issues, with Senator Salazar advocating for better mental health services for troops returning from Iraq. Senator Salazar is also known for being even-keeled, personable and willing to get along with politicians who do not necessarily share his views. And he, like many of Mr. Obama's appointees, loves a good game of pick-up basketball, though recently he has not been able to play as often as he would like. 
 Biography: Born March 2, 1955, in Alamosa, Colo. ... bachelor's degree in political science from Colorado College and a law degree from the University of Michigan. ... married to Hope for 23 years. ... two daughters, Andrea and Melinda, and one granddaughter, Mireya.

HEADLINE: Honda Cuts Profit Forecast for a 3rd Time

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Honda, the Japanese carmaker, issued its third profit warning of the year on Wednesday, the latest sign of the drastic drop in demand that has hammered the global car industry. 
 Honda lowered its full-year forecast for net profits by 64 percent, to 185 billion yen ($2.11 billion), for the year ending March 31, highlighting how tough the market has become as consumers, constrained by tight credit conditions and worried about the gloomy economic conditions, hold back spending even on the smaller and more fuel-efficient cars that had been expected to help Honda survive the current crisis better than many of its rivals.
 ''The environment is worsening day by day, and we see no sign of a recovery,'' Honda's president, Takeo Fukui, said at a news conference in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg News. ''Our task is to respond to a sharp drop in sales.'' 
 The profit warning came as the yen rose against the dollar to levels not seen for 13 years. The Japanese currency has appreciated steadily against the dollar and the euro in recent months -- a huge worry to Japanese companies because it makes their products more expensive in the United States and Europe. 
 Honda estimates that for every yen the dollar declines, it loses about 18 billion yen in operating profit. The dollar was trading at 88.80 yen Wednesday afternoon. A year ago, it was at about 111.60. 
 The rising yen has helped prompt a collapse in business confidence in Japan, which is already in a recession. Japanese companies have begun to announce major layoffs and other cost cuts.
 Earlier this month, Honda withdrew from Formula One racing, saying it needed the resources to weather the downturn and to develop new vehicles.

HEADLINE: Chrysler to Shut All Factories for at Least a Month

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Chrysler said Wednesday that it would close all 30 of its factories for at least one month, starting at the end of this week, in response to plunging vehicle sales in the United States.
 The company said the plants, which employ 46,000 union workers, would resume production no sooner than Jan. 19. Some will remain closed for several more weeks. Normally, the Detroit automakers close their plants for about two weeks at the end of the year.
 In addition, Ford Motor said Wednesday evening that it would extend the holiday shutdown at most of its plants to a third week. 
 Meanwhile, worries that Chrysler could be forced to file for bankruptcy have spooked many auto dealers into borrowing so much money from the automaker's lending arm that the company said it might need to suspend the loans.
 Dealers have been requesting nearly $60 million a day from a fund used to finance vehicle inventories, and a total of $1.5 billion since July, Chrysler Financial's chief executive, Thomas F. Gilman, told dealers in a letter dated Dec. 12. Mr. Gilman called the requests ''troubling'' and urged dealers not to borrow more than ''what's absolutely necessary for the operation of your business.''
 The announcements come with vehicle sales in the United States at the lowest level in 26 years. Chrysler's sales were down 47 percent in November, compared with a 37 percent decline for the industry over all.
 Chrysler's chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, told Congress this month that the company needed an immediate loan of $7 billion to help it survive into the new year. Senate Republicans blocked aid to Chrysler and the other Detroit automakers last week, but the Bush administration is expected to step in with some form of aid.
 G.M., which has said it needs $4 billion this month to stay afloat and an additional $14 billion after that, said last week that it would shut 20 assembly plants in North America for at least part of the first quarter.
 ''People just don't want to buy cars,'' Anthony Viviano, the chairman of Sterling Heights Dodge and Meadowbrook Dodge near Detroit, said. ''Hopefully, by Friday the president O.K.'s this thing. We just have to calm everybody down.''
 Mr. Gilman's letter, first reported Wednesday by Bloomberg News, showed that dealers were feeling jittery along with their would-be customers.
 ''They don't know what to do. They're just running wild,'' Mr. Viviano said. 
 Without access to financing, few Chrysler dealers would be able to order new vehicles.
 ''Chrysler Financial finances 75 percent of all vehicles shipped to U.S. dealers, and we continue to support our dealer body with uninterrupted wholesale financing,'' a Chrysler Financial spokeswoman, Amber Gowen, said.
 Chrysler said its dealers, during a recent meeting at the company's headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., told executives that they had lost 20 percent to 25 percent of their volume because consumers were unable to obtain loans.
 ''They have many willing buyers for Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge vehicles but are unable to close the deals, due to lack of financing,'' Chrysler said in a statement.
 In addition to idling their plants, automakers have been trying to save money by shrinking the size of their work force.
 In November, Chrysler cut about 5,000 salaried jobs through a buyout and early retirement program. By the end of this month, it is expected to have eliminated more than 1,800 hourly positions.
 Workers at the plants will be laid off during the down time, but a supplemental unemployment program ensures that they will continue to receive most of their pay. The United Automobile Workers union agreed this month to suspend the company's jobs bank programs, which compensate workers for permanent closures, but it is unclear when that change will take place.
 Foreign automakers have been reacting to the slowdown, too. Toyota said this week that it would delay work on a factory in Mississippi that would build the Prius hybrid, and Honda said it was cutting first-quarter production by 119,000 vehicles.

HEADLINE: As the Fed Flattens Rates, The Dollar Gets Bruised

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and DAVID JOLLY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The dollar is sliding back into a rapid downward trajectory as the United States enters a new era of ultra-low interest rates and investors reassess the currency's worth in a drawn-out recession. 
 A day after the Federal Reserve adopted a near zero-interest rate policy to stimulate the economy, the euro jumped as much as 4 cents against the dollar, the largest single-day move since the euro's birth in 1999. Against the yen, the dollar tumbled to 87.14, the lowest level in 13 years. The dollar was also weaker against the pound and the Swiss franc.
 ''This is a market movement that has surprised me,'' said Stephen Jen, global head of currency strategy at Morgan Stanley. ''It is so rapid and so large, and something very real.'' 
 The dollar -- which on Wednesday rose as high as $1.44 against the euro from $1.39, before closing at $1.43 -- had enjoyed a surprising rally since September, after Lehman Brothers' collapse forced hedge funds and other big investors to liquidate assets and return money to the United States. 
 It continued to strengthen even after the government's initial plan to shore up the financial system foundered, reaching as high as $1.2453 on Nov. 20. That counterintuitive shift seemed to highlight the dollar's role as a safe store of value in times of crisis, despite the recession. 
 But the dollar's brief appeal in recent months mainly reflected a lack of better options. While much has been made recently of the euro as a new rival, the currency used by 15 European economies has weakened as recession struck the Continent. At the same time, Japan and other powerhouses in Asia quickly succumbed to a global deceleration. 
 Now, the landscape is shifting. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates near zero ''for some time'' is a tacit acknowledgment that the recession will worsen before it improves, investors said. ''There's a reason behind the fact that the Fed had to go this low,'' said Franz Wenzel, deputy director of investment strategy at Axa Investment Managers in Paris. ''The U.S. economy is in deep trouble.''
 With virtually no more room to manipulate its main lever for the economy, the Fed has also been running its dollar printing press to flood credit markets with liquidity. 
 In just a few short months, the central bank has effectively become a substitute for banks and other lenders, especially in the commercial paper market and others that remain frozen to certain economic transactions. The Fed also stands ready to buy mortgage-related bonds, longer-term Treasury bonds, corporate debt and even consumer loans. 
 And while some economists are predicting a mild recovery in the second half of 2009 as the Fed's actions and a $700 billion stimulus plan promised by President-elect Barack Obama raises demand, unemployment could yet hit double-digits.
 Taken together, the effect is one of greater downward pressure on the dollar -- a dynamic that economists expect will continue for the foreseeable future. 
 ''Aggressive quantitative easing by the Fed should add to the U.S. dollar supply globally and undermine the value of the dollar,'' Robert Sinche, the global head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York, said in a research note. 
 Currencies normally reflect the underlying fundamentals of an economy, and slow, controlled declines or gains allow businesses and investors to plan rationally for the future. But even by the standards of currency markets, the whipsaw nature of the dollar's recent movements has come as a shock to many investors who expected the dollar to stabilize at a stronger level. 
 Powerful interest rate differentials have played a large role, ensuring that investor appetites at this turbulent moment are directed toward other currencies.
 The benchmark rate of the European Central Bank is 2.5 percent, far lower than when the financial crisis began, but still more than in the United States.
 The Bank of England's rates are headed down, but are still higher than the Fed's for now.
 That reduces the return, or yield, on dollar-denominated assets.
 Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in London, called the policy ''the Fed's yield assault on the dollar.''
 On some level, investors are also pondering a calculus that has existed for years but never seemed as real as now. American consumers have long needed credit from the rest of the world to keep up spending. As they pull back, a painful recession is the result.
 The logical corollary for the currency trade, said Mr. Wenzel, is that the flow of dollars into the United States is bound to weaken, and the exchange rate along with it.
 ''The recession trade is still on,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Loss of a Job Dashes a Working Man's Simple Dreams

BYLINE: By ABBY AGUIRRE

 BODY:
On a Tuesday morning in late November, in the dark living room of a two-story brick home in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, an unwatched television momentarily blared out an advertisement for a news program. The news show's topic that day, to be tackled by a panel of experts, was how the debt of Detroit's big automakers might affect Wall Street.
 Seated at a dining table in an adjacent room, Richard Black, 31, was wondering aloud if he would ever find another job, after being laid off as a baggage handler at Kennedy Airport. 
 ''What would be my ideal job?'' he said, repeating a question he was asked. He paused a moment, seemingly stumped. ''To tell you the truth, I never really think about that.''
 Mr. Black does think about the time he found himself in a similar position, about seven years ago. He was getting dressed for work -- then, too, he was handling luggage at Kennedy -- when his cousin called him into the living room of his aunt's house, where he still lives.
 ''The World Trade Center is on fire,'' his cousin said.
 Mr. Black gazed at the smoking towers on the TV, he said, then called his employer, T.W.A., to see if he should go to work. He was told not to. Soon afterward, he received a call from his manager telling him to pick up what would be his last paycheck.
 This time, what exactly cost him his job seems to him a bit indistinct, and far less spectacular. His employer, Superior Aircraft Services, lost its contract with JetBlue Airways in September. The new company hired some of Mr. Black's co-workers, but Mr. Black was not offered a job.
 Along with his $262 weekly take-home pay, Mr. Black lost a perk he had intended to take advantage of: a free standby ticket to anywhere JetBlue flies. While loading duffels, suitcases, skis and surfboards into an X-ray machine, Mr. Black -- who has never traveled outside of Jamaica, where he grew up, and the New York area, where he moved at 19 -- had decided on Las Vegas.
 ''I wanted to see a place I've never seen before,'' he said.
 But that was the least of his problems. Instead of a seat on a westbound plane, Mr. Black is receiving $168 a week in unemployment. Fortunately, he said, his aunt does not require him to pay rent, so he is not facing eviction. But without work, his hope of moving to a place of his own is gone, and he worries that if a lung condition he suffers from were to flare up, he would not be able to pay his doctor bills.
 Mr. Black turned to the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, an agency that has provided him with periodic assistance since 1998. The organization, one of seven supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, helped Mr. Black apply to have Medicaid coverage, which had inexplicably lapsed, restored. It also drew on the fund to supply him with $204 in clothes for wearing to job interviews: pants, a blazer, several dress shirts and dress shoes.
 The bureau is now helping in Mr. Black's search for work, an effort that over the past few months has not yielded many promising prospects. The dismal employment market feels curiously like that of 2001, Mr. Black says. 
 ''There wasn't another 9/11,'' he said, ''but it seems like there's a lot of people that's out of a job right now.''

HEADLINE: Former Gov. Jeb Bush's Record in Florida

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Small Isn't Beautiful,'' by William Kristol (column, Dec. 8), misses the mark on the record of Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor. 
 Guided by the core principle of limited government, Governor Bush was a fiscal conservative whose bold policies were characterized by nongovernment, free-market solutions to Florida's challenges. 
 During his eight years, Governor Bush reduced the number of state employees by 13,726 employees, or 11 percent of the total taxpayer-financed work force. 
 His policies featured substantial fiscal reform, including eliminating nearly $20 billion in taxes; introducing transparent, performance-based budgets; limiting the size of government as a percentage of state gross domestic product; carrying out debt affordability measures; and privatizing services that are run more efficiently by private-sector providers.
 Governor Bush vetoed more than $2 billion in earmarks and increased reserves from $1 billion to $7.6 billion -- more than 25 percent of the general tax-financed budget. Under his leadership, Florida achieved an ''AAA'' bond rating from Standard & Poor's. 
 As states across the country face trying economic times, they should look to the example that Jeb Bush set -- applying big, innovative ideas to solve intractable problems, save taxpayers money and limit the size and scope of government.
 Donna Arduin Tallahassee, Fla., Dec. 16, 2008
 The writer was director of the Florida Office of Policy and Budget for five years under Governor Bush.

HEADLINE: Facing Budget Gap, California Halts Infrastructure Projects

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
In another sign of California's fiscal morass, a state board charged with backing infrastructure projects voted Wednesday to halt some $3.8 billion in financing until a yawning budget gap is addressed. 
 The vote, by the three-person Pooled Money Investment Board, came even as state legislators mulled over another budget proposal in the face of a $14.8 billion deficit for the current year. 
 Bill Lockyer, the state treasurer, said the board's vote to suspend infrastructure financing was necessary to safeguard the dwindling government coffers, which he said could run dry as soon as February. 
 ''We had to say we can't spend money we don't have,'' Mr. Lockyer said.
 Nearly 2,000 projects could be delayed or halted, from multimillion dollar highway improvements to a $5,300 allocation for a Fresno school district. 
 The list of projects that could be affected runs some 75 pages and includes veterans homes, prisons, roads, fire stations and environmental and housing projects. 
 School districts will feel the impact, with large counties like Los Angeles losing financing for hundreds of millions of dollars in improvements either planned or in progress. 
 Mr. Lockyer, a Democrat, said the list of projects did not discriminate and would touch on buildings and services used by almost every Californian. 
 ''These are things that affect real people,'' he said. 
 The state budget has been decimated by the economic downturn, and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been increasingly vocal about asking for both temporary tax increases and longer-term changes to the state tax and budget system, which he has called ''dysfunctional.'' 
 State budgets and tax increases currently must be passed by two-thirds majorities, making consensus difficult, and partisan bickering has been increasingly heated in Sacramento, where legislators have been called into an emergency session.
 On Monday, Republicans proposed a $22 billion fix, heavy on spending cuts. 
 Democrats answered with a proposal on Wednesday that included new fees -- which require only a majority vote -- to close the gap for this year and next, when the state is expected to fall even further behind. A vote on the Democratic proposal was scheduled for late Wednesday. 
 Aaron McLear, a spokesman for the governor, said the board's move had the potential to put tens of thousands of workers in unemployment lines just a week before Christmas. Mr. Lockyer agreed, saying the private construction business -- already dealing with double-digit unemployment -- would be hit hard. 
 ''There's a great need to stimulate that sector of the economy,'' Mr. Lockyer said. ''And we're going in the wrong direction.''

HEADLINE: A Contemporary Art Museum Considers Ways to Salvage Its Future

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
When the Museum of Contemporary Art's trustees meet here on Thursday to discuss financial rescue plans, the future of one of the nation's greatest collections of postwar art will hang in the balance.
 All agree that the museum's collection is worth preserving. But its board seems sharply divided on whether to accept assistance from Eli Broad, a powerful patron with a reputation for wanting to influence, if not exactly control, the institutions he finances, or whether to merge with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a larger institution with the one commodity, aside from money, that the contemporary museum sorely lacks: space.
 A rescue plan is necessary because the museum has used much of its endowment in recent years to pay for continuing operations and is short of cash. 
 ''The fact that there are two viable options is a miracle, particularly given the economic climate,'' said Zev Yaroslavsky, a Los Angeles County supervisor whose district includes the county museum but who said he did not favor either offer. 
 ''The concern in the art community is that the issue be resolved productively and sustainably,'' he said. ''Everybody needs to put their swords at the door and do what is in the best interest of Los Angeles and guarantee the accessibility of the art to the public of Los Angeles.'' 
 It is not clear whether the museum's trustees will make a decision on Thursday. Early in the week people close to the board said that they were relatively certain an announcement would come this week; by Wednesday, however, the same people expressed doubt that the board would reach a conclusion.
 The lack of a clear direction and uncertainty over who will end up running the museum have stymied additional outsiders from making a firm commitment to help the museum.
 ''There are a number of people who want to get engaged, if the museum is on a solid footing,'' said one person involved in the deliberations over the museum's future who spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations are in flux. ''But no one is going to get engaged if they feel that the people who allowed this to happen are still going to be there.''
 A change in leadership looks more and more probable. People close to the board said on Tuesday that Jeremy Strick, the museum's director, was negotiating the details of his resignation with trustees. Mr. Strick did not respond to requests for comment, and the museum would say only that he was still the director.
 Further leadership changes would undoubtedly come if the Museum of Contemporary Art, often called MOCA, merged with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, known as Lacma. In announcing its merger offer, the county museum's chairman, Andrew Gordon, said ''some of MOCA's founders and artists'' would be included on the board of the combined organizations. But they would be outnumbered by the larger museum's current board members. 
 And while Mr. Gordon said that some of the contemporary museum's programs would be preserved under its name, Michael Govan, the director of the county museum, would oversee the combined institutions.
 Mr. Govan said that his museum's intent was not to ''swallow'' its ailing crosstown rival. Rather, he likened the two museums' potential relationship to that of the museums that make up the Smithsonian Institution: they share a common ''backbone,'' but operate independently.
 ''It would be silly in any way to diminish MOCA's brand,'' Mr. Govan said. ''So we have tried to think about it in terms of a partnership. The issue is that they need access to our board and to our fund-raising potential.''
 The county museum's proposal includes the use of its own galleries for shows of the Museum of Contemporary Art's permanent collection, most of which is rarely displayed because of tight space.
 The county museum is already undertaking its own fund-raising effort to renovate its campus, and that, along with the national economic crisis, puts pressure on its budget. Still, Mr. Govan suggested that the prospect of rescuing the contemporary museum would generate additional fund-raising momentum and could help both institutions.
 Mr. Broad, a billionaire philanthropist who is one of this city's biggest arts patrons, has offered a fully financed $30 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art. He has proposed committing up to $15 million to rebuild its endowment, but each dollar he gives must be matched by a dollar in donations secured by the museum. That puts the onus on the museum to expand its fund-raising efforts, which it has been unable to do in recent years. 
 The endowment offer is dependent, however, on the Museum of Contemporary Art's remaining in place and independent. If the museum were to move from its downtown site or merge with another institution, Mr. Broad would have the right to take back his money.
 ''We don't want to give money so they merge the next day,'' Mr. Broad said. The museum would be required to keep the money in a sequestered account that could not be used to finance continuing operations, although the museum would be able to use some of the earnings from the endowment to pay for programs.
 Mr. Broad also offered the museum $3 million a year over five years to continue its exhibition program. That money could pay for curatorial services, the cost of borrowing artworks and insuring them and the like, but not for general operations, Mr. Broad said.
 A stopgap measure also presented itself on Tuesday: a partial bailout by the city. The Los Angeles City Council president, Eric Garcetti, a nonvoting member of the Museum of Contemporary Art's board, introduced a motion to allocate up to $2.8 million in city money to the museum to help cover operations. 
 But the city's offer requires that ''new leadership'' be installed ''at all critical levels'' of the museum; that the institution remain downtown; and that it accept additional outside financial assistance.

HEADLINE: Where Once There Were Many, There Are Just Two

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Calling Broadway the main street of the Upper West Side, Paul Goldberger wrote in ''The City Observed: New York'' (1978) that it was ''like a child's room that is permitted to remain in disorder by parents who feel that children should be permitted to have their own mess.'' 
 ''If you doubt the economic wisdom of letting a street be that way,'' he continued, ''count the empty storefronts: there are virtually none from Lincoln Center to Morningside Heights.''
 The best single block to illustrate this jumbled vitality for Mr. Goldberger's guidebook was between 74th and 75th Streets. In a 213-foot stretch were a celebrated fishmonger (Citarella), a well-known greengrocer (Fairway), a supermarket (D'Agostino), a clothing store (Pandemonium), a coffee shop and a popular bingo parlor called Broadway Hall.
 Revisiting the block 30 years later, one finds Fairway and Citarella. Period.
 The competing markets, which long ago expanded beyond their original specialties, now occupy all the street-level retail space.
 This is a tribute to the West Side's enduring character as a neighborhood where homegrown food businesses can thrive, cheek by jowl. But it also underscores the growing big-box monotony on Broadway, even when the boxes are, happily, one of a kind.
 Fairway was founded in the early 1930s by Nathan Glickberg as the 74th Street Market, a fruit and vegetable stand. In the early '50s, the Glickberg family turned it into a supermarket called Fairway, adding groceries, meat, dairy products and frozen food. After the business changed hands several times, Howard Glickberg, one of the founder's grandsons, recreated it as a high-end produce shop in 1974. 
 Fairway expanded into the coffee shop in 1997. Two years later, it took over D'Agostino's space and the former bingo hall upstairs, which had more recently been a Bally's Jack LaLanne Fitness Center. There, Fairway runs a cafe and steakhouse.
 And there, Fairway's irresistible force meets the immovable object of Citarella, which expanded into the Pandemonium space in 1993. The competitors are abutters, too.
 Imagine a passer-by from the 1978 photograph -- perhaps the man in the vest, flared trousers and mustard-colored shirt (just a guess) with four-inch collar points -- propelled forward 30 years.
 The time traveler recognizes Fairway and Citarella, of course, but the crowd looks younger, more prosperous and less diverse, and there are more children underfoot. The device in the woman's right hand could be described to him as being akin to a Dick Tracy two-way wrist radio with a full keyboard and a computer monitor. But it might take all day to explain the phrase ''www.fairwaymarket.com'' on the awning, where it used to say ''Farm Fresh.''

 There are only two stores on the block today: supersize versions of the earlier occupants. Fairway expanded to the north and south, and Citarella expanded into the Pandemonium space.(PHOTOGRAPH BY DAVID W. DUNLAP/THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: Big News in Washington, but Far Fewer Cover It

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA; Jacques Steinberg contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A new president arrived from a new party. The balance of power shifted in Congress. Legions of fresh new faces showed up in the nation's capital with new ideas, eager to upend the way the country does business.
 The year was 2000, and Cox Newspapers had about 30 people in Washington to cover the new Bush administration.
 Eight years later, a similar transformation is under way, the stakes heightened by two foreign wars and the worst economic collapse in decades, but Cox will not be there to cover it. Cox, the publisher of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Austin American-Statesman and 15 other papers, announced this month that its Washington bureau would simply close its doors on April 1.
 Cox is not alone. Another major chain, Advance Publications, owner of The Star-Ledger of Newark, The Plain Dealer of Cleveland and other papers, just closed a Washington bureau that had more than 20 people. 
 Like a number of smaller papers, The San Diego Union-Tribune recently shuttered its bureau, which had four people at the end. Three years ago, the parent company, Copley Press, had an 11-person bureau in Washington, but it has since sold most of its papers. 
 Those that remain have cut back drastically on Washington coverage, eliminating hundreds of journalists' jobs at a time when the federal government -- and journalistic oversight of it -- matters more than ever. Television and radio operations in Washington are shrinking, too, although not as sharply. 
 The times may be news-rich, but newspapers are cash-poor, facing their direst financial straits since the Depression. Racing to cut costs as they lose revenue, most have decided that their future lies in local news, not national or international events. That has put a bull's-eye on expensive Washington bureaus.
 Albert R. Hunt, Washington executive editor at Bloomberg News, said he was taken aback by the mood Saturday night at a dinner of the Washington press corps' Gridiron Club. ''It was like being at a wake,'' he said. ''Every time you turned around, someone was talking about their bureau being closed or downsized.''
 A few years ago, after much debate, the club began to admit magazine and television reporters. Now, without them, ''there couldn't be a Gridiron Club,'' Mr. Hunt said. ''You couldn't get enough newspaper people.''
 The Tribune Company, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week, recently merged the once-formidable bureaus of The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Baltimore Sun and other papers. The combined bureau has about 32 people, compared with the more than 70 the papers had there a year ago.
 ''I think the cop is leaving the beat here, and I think it's a terrible loss for citizens,'' said Andy Alexander, the Cox bureau chief, who is retiring. ''But I can't argue with the business decision that Cox has made, at a time when papers can't even find the resources to cover the local zoning board.''
 Cox's decision was tied to its plan to sell most of its papers, but even without that impetus, the bureau would have become much smaller, said Sandy Schwartz, president of Cox Newspapers. ''There are tremendous economic pressures,'' he said. ''We are in a crisis situation. All newspapers are.''
 As large chains leave, some of their papers -- including two of Cox's -- dip into their own budgets to keep a few reporters in Washington, but they are the exceptions.
 ''From an informed public standpoint, it's alarming,'' said Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from the Houston area, who has seen The Houston Chronicle's team in Washington drop to three people, from nine, in two years. ''They're letting go those with the most institutional knowledge, which helps reporters hold elected officials accountable.''
 A few organizations have bucked the trend, including The Wall Street Journal, which has put more reporters in Washington in the last year, and The New York Times, whose bureau has not changed much in size for years. Each paper has almost 50 people in Washington.
 To compensate somewhat for the retreat by its clients, The Associated Press bureau recently shuffled reporters to provide state-specific reports from Washington on all 50 states. The Bloomberg News bureau has expanded in recent years, and a few Internet sources, like Politico, are still expanding, but the number of journalists added is a fraction of the number lost.
 The real growth has been among narrowly focused news organizations, especially those that report on finance, said Joe Keenan, superintendent of the Senate press gallery. ''It seems like, for every newspaper that leaves, a niche publication comes in,'' he said.
 Newspaper executives say it makes no economic sense to have hundreds of reporters writing about the same set of events each day. Even the affected journalists concede that on breaking news, news agency articles are often fine for their papers.
 The much greater loss, the journalists say, is the decline of Washington reporting on local matters -- the foibles of a hometown congressman or a public works project in the paper's backyard. One after another, they cited the example of the San Diego paper's Washington bureau for exposing the corruption of Representative Randall Cunningham, who is known as Duke. 
 In accepting a Pulitzer Prize for that work in 2006, ''we were bold enough to hope that it would be the first of many, but it turned out to be the high point,'' said George E. Condon Jr., the last bureau chief. ''No matter how much great journalism is done by national organizations, they're simply not geared to monitor closely a member of Congress from, say, San Diego, who's not a national leader.''
 Several newspapers are locked into leases for more Washington office space than they now need, and have become landlords to others. This year, the Hearst newspapers bureau became a tenant of the McClatchy bureau, and The Union-Tribune had been leasing space to several small papers that now must find new offices.
 As bureaus shrink, they cut back on in-depth and investigative projects and from having reporters assigned to cover specific federal agencies.
 ''We used to cover the Pentagon, combing through defense contracts, and we're covering some of that out of Dallas now, but basically we don't do it anymore,'' said Carl Leubsdorf, chief of The Dallas Morning News bureau, which had 11 people four years ago, and now has four. ''We had someone at the Justice Department, but no longer. We can't free someone up for a long time to do a major project.''
 Few newspapers travel with the president now -- only three or four on some trips -- where a dozen would have been the bare minimum a few years ago. For those that still participate, the shared cost of travel and the rotating burden of providing pool reports has soared. The Senate press gallery was recently remodeled in a way that left room for fewer reporters' carrels, and no one complained.
 There are no definitive figures on the number of newspaper reporters covering Washington, but the decline has been clear, and it runs counter to history, said Donald A. Ritchie, associate Senate historian and author of the book ''Reporting From Washington: The History of the Washington Press Corps.'' 
 ''In times of great change and crisis, usually the press corps grows,'' he said. Despite the strain of the Depression, he said, ''When F.D.R. took office, newspapers sent far more people to Washington.''
 Newspapers in recent years have cut every kind of worker,from drivers to press operators. But the newsroom expense they have deemed particularly expendable is reporting far from home -- work that means office rents, heavy travel expenses and some of their biggest salaries. The few papers that had foreign bureaus have closed most of them, but in sheer numbers, the withdrawal from Washington has been much greater.
 Industry consolidation, like Tribune absorbing the Times Mirror Company in 2000, has fueled the trend, but it goes far beyond just eliminating duplication.
 Most papers, even those in big cities, have wagered their survival on local news, printing far fewer reports from Washington, Beijing or Baghdad, and relying more on news agencies for those articles. A survey of newspaper editors released in July by the Pew Research Center found that 57 percent said they published less national news than they did three years earlier, while 62 percent said they printed more community-level news.
 ''About four years ago, we became intensely local,'' said Mr. Alexander, the Cox bureau chief. ''We provide a very high percentage of copy out of Washington that our papers can't get from other sources, because it's on local people and local issues. And the 17 Cox papers have used an average of 4,500 of our stories a year.''
 ''Of course,'' he added, ''it turns out that didn't mean we were protected.''

HEADLINE: Say Whatever You Want, but No Throwing Shoes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
A transit rider protesting moves to slash service and raise fares was dragged out of a public meeting by police officers who feared he was about to imitate the Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at President Bush. 
 The rider, Stephen A. Millies, was one of about two dozen people who addressed the authority's board at the start of a meeting called to approve an austerity budget on Wednesday.
 ''We don't need any fare increases and we don't need our transit system ravaged either,'' said Mr. Millies, who said he was an Amtrak signal-tower operator and a member of the Bail Out the People Campaign, a group that has stood up for victims of the economic crisis. He called for the subway and bus fare to be reduced to $1, to help unemployed New Yorkers. 
 Then, referring to the authority's chief executive, who was sitting about 15 feet away, he said: ''Where is Elliot Sander?'' He stooped, slipped off one of his shoes and shouted, ''You made $300,000 last year.'' 
 Immediately, authority police officers swarmed him and pushed him out of the room. He was clutching his shoe, a black, thick-soled oxford, in his hand.
 ''This shoe is for you,'' he shouted as he was hustled out.
 He was rushed onto an elevator and moments later was seen being led out of the building in handcuffs -- his shoe back on his foot. 
 The authority said that Mr. Millies, 54, of Jackson Heights, Queens, was given a summons for disorderly conduct and released. 
 A spokesman for the authority, Jeremy Soffin, said that Mr. Millies was wearing a size 10 1/2 shoe made by Red Wing.
 Afterward, Mr. Sander laughed off the incident, saying, ''It's the M.T.A. and anything can happen.''
 Bill Morange, the authority's security director, was standing beside the speaker's podium and was one of the first to grab Mr. Millies. He said it appeared Mr. Millies was going to throw the shoe. ''You can say anything you want,'' Mr. Morange said. ''Just don't throw your shoes.'' 
 Reached later by telephone, Mr. Millies said he had no intention of doing that.
 ''I wanted to show the sole of the shoe as a sign of contempt for someone who makes so much money and yet wants to raise fares on the disabled,'' he said. He said that the authority's plans to more than double the $2 fare for disabled passengers who use the Access-a-Ride service particularly incensed him. 
 He said the gesture was planned with Muntader al-Zaidi, the Iraqi shoe-thrower, in mind. 
 ''I was very much inspired by that courageous Iraqi journalist who was protesting the occupation of his country by the American and British oil companies and their governments,'' Mr. Millies said. 
 Mr. Millies said the ticket he was given charged him with ''intent to cause a public annoyance.'' 
 ''What's the point of having a public hearing,'' he said, ''unless you allow people to annoy public officials?''

 THE TORTURE REPORT
 Many Americans have long known that the horrors of Abu Ghraib were not the work of a few low-ranking sociopaths. Now, a bipartisan report by the Senate Armed Services Committee has made what amounts to a strong case for bringing criminal charges against former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top aides. The report shows how actions by these men ''led directly'' to what happened at Abu Ghraib, in Afghanstan, in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in secret C.I.A. prisons. PAGE A42

 NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
 The new ''soda'' tax proposed by Gov. David Paterson of New York is a breakthrough. Not only could it raise $400 million a year to plug a hole in the state budget, it's also a landmark effort that, if other states follow, could help make us healthier. PAGE A43

 Laura Miller, the author of ''The Magician's Book: A Skeptic's Adventures in Narnia,'' explains how reading C. S. Lewis's fantasy series has informed her enjoyment of Christmas.

HEADLINE: The American Dream, Delivered Perhaps Too Much on the Cheap

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
If anyone seemed to embody the American dream, it was Simon Nget. 
 Reaching New York's shores in 1981 as an unlettered 18-year-old Chinese refugee from Cambodia, where he said relatives had starved to death under the Khmer Rouge, Mr. Nget learned his A B C's in high school in Chinatown and the Bronx, as he recounted, the homework sometimes taking him 10 hours a night. 
 But he graduated and went on to college, packing delivery orders of Chinese food, waiting tables and cleaning offices until he saved up enough to marry and buy a coffee shop in Queens. From there, it was a Vietnamese restaurant on Broadway, where, he recalled, he lived for two years, sleeping in a chair. Then there was a second Manhattan restaurant, and a third, all grossing, by 2006, a total of $7 million a year. 
 ''I come to this country, what I do is work, work hard, learn hard, and you learn something; you work hard, you save money,'' he testified in a federal court case. ''Save money, work hard making money, save money, that's very important.'' 
 Maybe too important, if the accusations against him are proved. On Dec. 3, Mr. Nget, 45, and his wife, Michelle, 51, mother of their two children, were arrested on 242 state criminal charges each of cheating the food deliverers for their Saigon Grill restaurants out of millions of dollars in minimum wages, falsifying business records, taking kickbacks and defrauding the state's unemployment insurance system. Each count carries a prison sentence of up to four years. 
 The Ngets, who pleaded not guilty, were released on bond and continue to operate their two remaining restaurants, at Amsterdam and 90th Street and on University Place between 12th and 13th Streets, although they no longer deliver from the downtown location. 
 In a separate federal lawsuit brought pro bono by lawyers from Davis, Polk & Wardwell, Magistrate Judge Michael H. Dolinger ruled against the Ngets in October, finding their testimony about their business practices ''incredible'' and ''manifestly false'' and ordering them to pay $4.6 million in back pay and damages to 36 delivery workers, mainstays of their operation.
 ''Because he was exploited in the past is not a reason to exploit others in the future,'' said Josephine Lee, the coordinator for Justice Will Be Served, a labor organizing campaign that championed Mr. Nget's aggrieved workers. If anything, she said, it made the actions of the Ngets ''all the more inexcusable.'' 
 The lawyer for the couple, S. Michael Weisberg, insisted that the Ngets were blameless. ''Their workers are liars,'' he said at their arraignment. 
 The Ngets, who live with other family members in a cluster of 12 apartments in College Point, Queens, did not respond to repeated telephone messages and workers at the restaurants said they were not there. 
 But the federal trial transcript and sworn depositions of the Ngets and fired workers encapsulate a stark narrative, a rags-to-rags tale of immigrants accused of victimizing people much like they had once been. 
 ''I got here owning nothing, you know,'' Mr. Nget told Judge Dolinger. 
 Arriving in New York on June 12, 1981 -- ''very important date, I know,'' Mr. Nget testified -- he was sponsored by a cousin whose parents died in the Khmer Rouge genocide. Other family members joined him, including his parents; his elder brother, Richard; and his elder sister, Leana, who would later help him in the restaurants. 
 ''I have a family who should be die in Cambodia, but we survive and we got a life in the United States, like in heaven,'' he testified. ''We love our life.'' 
 He supported himself by packing orders in a Chinese restaurant. He said that he never considered himself exploited and gave little heed to wage laws. ''I paid not much, but I make a very good living,'' he said. ''I have no complaint.''
 He spent a semester at City College and two semesters at Polytechnic Institute of New York University before dropping out because, he said, ''I find food is much easier.''
 By 1986, he had saved enough to marry and pay about $50,000 for a coffee shop in Astoria, Queens. 
 In 1996, he and a Chinese cook became partners in the first Saigon Grill, on Broadway at 87th Street. 
 ''I take risk, you know,'' he testified. ''He cook,'' he said, referring to his partner, ''but it doesn't taste good.'' After a year, Mr. Nget said, he and his sister took over the cooking and he bought out the partner. 
 ''I was the first two year busy like a dog,'' he recalled in his deposition. ''I sleep in there two year on the chair.''
 But in just another year, according to trial testimony, the family's fortunes had swelled enough for Mrs. Nget and partners to buy a building on Second Avenue and 88th Street for a second Saigon Grill. In 2002, they closed and moved the Broadway restaurant to Amsterdam Avenue. And in 2006, they closed on Second Avenue and opened on University Place.
 But the success, evidence suggested, came at a steep and illegal cost to delivery workers, mostly illegal immigrants from Fujian Province in China who testified they were paid $500 to $600 a month for working 70 to 80 hours a week, often less than $2 an hour. They usually made several thousand dollars a month in tips, but that did not relieve the Ngets of their wage obligations under the law. 
 Yu Guan Ke, 36, who began delivering for the Ngets in 1988 and became the lead plaintiff against them, said in an interview that ''in the beginning, the boss and boss lady treated workers pretty fairly.'' But as the restaurants started making money, Mr. Ke said, conditions became ''harsher and harsher.'' He said he once asked Mrs. Nget why. ''She just kind of laughed and walked away,'' he said.
 He said he was twice robbed during deliveries and had to repay the Ngets. 
 To create false payroll records, the workers testified, the Ngets paid them with checks for larger amounts that they had to cash and pay back to receive their real -- lower -- pay. They also had to provide and service their own bikes and were fined $200 by Mrs. Nget for forgetting items in a food order. 
 And when they sought to organize in protest, Mr. Nget ended up firing them all. In February the National Labor Relations Board ordered their rehiring, but whether the Ngets have complied is disputed. 
 In her testimony, Mrs. Nget denied that she had ever hired or instructed any workers or knew anything about their pay beyond handing out the envelopes. ''I have no idea what's inside,'' she said.
 Mr. Nget said he thought he had paid minimum wages. But he acknowledged, ''I don't keep any record.'' 
 ''I'm a simple man, a good man,'' he told the court.

HEADLINE: You Better Watch Out: This Year the Joke's on You

BYLINE: By ALLEN SALKIN

 BODY:
SOME Christmas presents are heartwarming, thoughtfully capturing the spirit of the season. A new crutch for Tiny Tim comes to mind, or a plane ticket to Paris for a spinster aunt who has always longed to visit Europe.
 Or a wreath covered in electric lights around a weird porcelain monkey head that has its mouth open in a scream.
 Ah, yes. The gag gift.
 The screaming-monkey wreath was the brainchild of Gabe Sebastian, whose family has a tradition of conducting a Christmas morning lottery in which one family member produces, and another wins, the ''door prize.'' 
 Other years had yielded a needlepoint outhouse, a photo of a less-than-fit male family member posing in nothing but a red boa, and a toilet-plunger lamp. 
 His wife's cousin's wife, Anne Morris, won the drawing, held in Montrose, Colo., in 2003 and unwrapped what Mr. Sebastian had been dreaming up.
 She cursed in fright and turned red. But eventually the group's laughter replaced shock.
 ''People were like, 'This is what you've been talking about for half a decade now?' '' said Christopher Morris, another relative. 
 Few recall the other gifts exchanged that day; everyone remembers the screaming-monkey wreath.
 And that's just the idea. When it comes to holiday gifts, sincerity can be wonderful. But sometimes stupid wins the day. The gag gift is a stubborn holiday tradition in many families and small circles of long-term friends. Often repeated, with variations, year in and year out, a gag gift can become so elaborate that few remember why or how it all started. Newcomers to family circles are often baffled. Or alarmed. Or disgusted. 
 And yet, in a season when the pressures of gift giving -- of spending hundreds of dollars in a dismal economy for someone who may or may not appreciate all the effort (and expense) -- a gag gift can be just the right way to let some air out.
 ''It's a way to show people you care,'' said Jeff Snoonian, a contractor in Haverhill, Mass., who bought himself and his brother matching electric-blue velour jumpsuits and pinkie rings, total cost $90, for Christmas in 2002. ''You can think about them and spend money, or you can think about them a little more and do something clever.''
 The year before he gave the velour outfits, Mr. Snoonian put together a grab bag of 99-cent-store gifts. 
 ''Everyone took a turn and blindly drew,'' he said. ''You know how people will yell out, 'Look, I got a sweater?' Well they were yelling out, 'Look at me, I got a Jesus air freshener.' ''
 Mr. Snoonian's parents had divorced, and the idea of a serious observance of the holiday seemed ridiculous, he said. ''The whole day turns into a fiasco because you're driving here and driving there. I just wanted to make fun of it a little bit.''
 The single-use gag gift is one variety. More common, it seems, is the recurring gag gift, which, like Sorrow the stuffed dog in the novel ''The Hotel New Hampshire,'' finds a way to pop up year after year.
 There is, for instance, ''Steve.''
 When Jenny Lawhorn and Weiman Seid moved into an apartment with three others at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville in 1990, they found a framed photo left behind by previous tenants. It showed a young man with a winged haircut. No one knew him. He was named Steve and put on display.
 ''After graduation one of the roommates took Steve home, and come Christmas he gave a nicely wrapped gift to Weiman,'' Ms. Lawhorn recalled. ''Weiman thought he was getting a real gift and was giggle-licious when he opened the gift to find Steve.''
 The next Christmas, Mr. Seid gave the photo to another ex-roommate, who was stunned to see Steve when she tore off the wrapping.
 It was never stated explicitly that the regifting of Steve would continue forever. It has just happened that nearly every year, one of the former roommates unwraps a present and finds Steve.
 ''My last brush with Steve was in 2004,'' Ms. Lawhorn said, recalling the year she was invited for the holidays to the home of another ex-roommate. ''She gave me a box that was the size of a department-store gift box. I assumed she had given me a baby gift, an outfit, because I had just had my daughter.''
 Instead of a onesie, it was Steve, still as he ever was, somewhere in his late teens, smiling.
 ''That's the thing about Steve: you don't remember he's around, and you don't expect him because he only comes around every seven or eight years,'' she said.
 ''The mummy'' was born in 1990 in Southern California. Diane Solomon's brother David was working at a store in Simi Valley that sold records and strange merchandise. She and her sister visited him and started ridiculing the place. They picked up a plastic mummy and guffawed.
 David took his revenge that Christmas when under the tree was a tidily wrapped gift with Ms. Solomon's name on it.
 ''He turned it into this whips and chains mummy thing with all this body hair glued on,'' she said.
 Through the years the family totem has turned up stuffed into a plush cow, visible only by lifting the bovine's tail; in the hand of a 10-foot-tall papier-mache mummy that, in 1997, Ms. Solomon drove an hour and a half to her sister's house, placed surreptitiously on the front porch and left behind without so much as a ring of the doorbell; and naked as the day it popped from its mold, as a wedding gift for a cousin's groom, Mark Eld. He is the current holder of the mummy.
 Payback is often the spark that starts such traditions. 
 Rebekah Tolin was staying with her parents, who were teachers at an international school, in Yangon, Myanmar, in 1996 when she bought her brother the cheapest plane ticket she could find from Los Angeles so he could visit for the holidays. With plane changes in Tel Aviv and Bangkok, the trip took 72 hours.
 He had taken the trouble to lug to the military dictatorship what he thought was a nice gift for his sister, a Chia Pet. 
 Ms. Tolin mocked him. ''You brought me a Chia Pet all the way here?'' she recalled asking sarcastically. 
 The next year Ms. Tolin carried wrapped presents with her, including some her brother gave her, when she visited her parents in Langkawi, Malaysia. She unwrapped his gift for her: another Chia Pet. She called him and asked ''What's this?'' He replied, ''I will now give you one every year for the rest of my life.''
 And so he has. For a dozen years, Ms. Tolin has received Chia Pets, one shaped as Elmer Fudd, one a head, and one a turtle. She used to be depressed about the continuing penalty for her moment of sarcastic weakness. But now, after all this, wouldn't she be sort of disappointed if the family tradition ended?
 ''No,'' she said. 
 Noel Aird, a systems analyst who lives in Hoboken, N.J., said his family has ''the slippers.'' Originally appearing under the tree at some point in the early 1990s, the faux chicken-feet monstrosities are now annually gift-wrapped and bequeathed to someone. 
 Mr. Aird's family gathers at a sister's house in Italy for the holidays. The slippers have made the crossing. ''You have to wear them for the entire day,'' he said. ''They are like four inches thick, these big puffy things that make your feet sweat.''
 Lauren Mullaney, a marketing executive in San Francisco, gave her father, who has a habit of eating off his offspring's plates, a telescoping fork as a stocking stuffer. To their dismay, he started using it regularly, said her brother, Thomas M. Mullaney.
 Some back story is usually important to understand a gag gift. But sometimes the back story does no good at all.
 Jordana Rothman, a food writer, and her boyfriend, Daniel Krieger, a photographer, drew his father's ire after they used the elder Mr. Krieger's Greenwich Village apartment for a while. They discovered that, for some reason, he'd been hoarding cans of Pepsi Jazz, the diet soda, and thought they were doing him a favor by throwing away just a few of the many cases. The cans, some of which were stored under the bed, were starting to explode.
 But Mr. Krieger was upset at the reduction in his stash and blamed his son and Ms. Rothman for the loss, she said. That holiday season his daughter bought him Pepsi Jazz as a gift. 
 ''In order to counteract that and be clever, we packaged up a bunch of folded pieces of blank paper,'' Ms. Rothman said. The paper was presented as gifts to the family in wine bags and jewelry boxes. She declined to elaborate on how any of it made sense.
 But a gag gift can also come with a certain sweetness.
 Tom Burke, who owns a technology company in New York, can depend on an aunt, Alexandra Davalos from San Jose, Calif., to ship a box to him at work, filled with bizarre stuff, for the holidays. 
 Last year, it contained a musical Santa Claus on a motorcycle, four bobbleheads for his employees and some mini squirt guns. 
 Mr. Burke just turned 40. He and his parents rarely exchange gifts anymore. ''We're all adults now,'' he said. ''We don't do things that are gift related. We're past that.''
 His aunt has not relented. 
 ''I like to feel that I am giving him a lift in a hard working day, just to make him laugh aloud, to someone who has everything,'' said Ms. Davalos, who does not have children of her own. ''It's a way for me to send him a hug, loving him from here.'' And Mr. Burke is still capable of having his adult-hardened heart melted. Although he has tossed almost all of the old gifts, he has kept one for years. On his desk sits an electric Christmas tree that sings and dances. 
 ''It has arms and legs,'' he said. ''And candy cane horns coming out of its head.''

HEADLINE: Pan Am Dies, America Lives

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
I used to live in Miami and fly Pan Am to South America to cover this and that: the fall of Pinochet, uprisings in Argentina, one gazillion percent inflation in Brazil. Lest we forget, things really have gotten better in the Americas.
 But it's Pan Am, rather than the state of the Western Hemisphere, that's been on my mind. The first time I went down to Rio in 1986, I flew business class. I was working for The Wall Street Journal. When I got back, I handed my expenses to Eric Morgenthaler, then the bureau chief in Miami. 
 He had a glass office. I watched him, before he called me in and asked why I'd flown business. Overnight flight, I said, interview with a minister the next morning, blah, blah, blah.
 ''The Wall Street Journal,'' Morgenthaler said with a certain class and solemnity, ''flies first class.''
 This was apparently a truism as evident as, ''You need eggs to make an omelet,'' or, ''Nobody likes wet socks.''
 So began a pleasant interlude involving large dollops of caviar and free-flowing iced vodka aboard Pan Am a mile above the Amazon. Nobody stinted in those days. Nobody, heeding Prufrock, measured out their life -- or the sturgeon eggs -- with coffee spoons.
 Times have changed in the newspaper business.
 In the light of the good times on Pan Am, I cannot claim to be objective about the airline or its fate. I liked its flights. I liked the big Pan Am sign above Park Avenue. I've never gotten used to Met Life's usurpation of that spot.
 Still, facts are facts. Pan Am, which had been a leading U.S. international airline since the 1930s, collapsed in 1991. Like other great U.S. companies, it died in the marketplace because it blundered. Churn -- of people and businesses -- has always defined America. Nobody subsidized U.S. Steel or the automaker Packard in the belief that the world without them was unthinkable.
 Coming to the United States from Europe, I found this constant reinvention bracing. Look at the top 40 companies by market capitalization in Europe and most have been there for decades. Not in the United States, land of Google and eBay. Churn requires death as well as birth. The artificial preservation of the inert dampens the quest for the new.
 America let Pan Am die. Italy keeps Alitalia going although the airline's been a dead man walking for years. There you have it: two continents, two business cultures. At least until recently, when the sheer extent of the U.S. financial collapse led the Treasury to discover forms of life-support that refuse to utter a taboo word -- socialism -- but resemble it nonetheless.
 Let's face it, the American International Group has no right to be around, if risk, markets, transparency, accountability and other foundations of American capitalism mean anything.
 Which brings us to Grand Theft Auto, not the video game, but the ongoing drama starring General Motors and Chrysler in a desperate quest for billions of dollars of taxpayers' money that they say is essential to their survival. (Ford has said it does not need federal money now to survive; it's in somewhat better shape.)
 I know, hundreds of thousands of jobs are directly at stake, hundreds of thousands more indirectly. This is not an economy that's creating new jobs for those lost. Why should autoworkers get worse treatment than bankers? 
 These are agonizing questions. But it's equally agonizing to contemplate the United States becoming the land of Alitalia-style life-support rather than Pan Am-style churn. If the Big Three, their heads in the sand, have made the wrong models with the wrong technologies for years, while their competitors adapted to a changing world, at least one must pay the price.
 Barack Obama, who favors a stringent bailout, has himself observed: ''We don't want government to run companies. Generally, government historically has not done that very well.''
 That's right. Bankruptcy is not the same as liquidation. In the airline business, United Airlines, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2002 and emerged in 2006, is an example. If it came to that after bankruptcy proceedings, the United States could live with two auto companies rather than three.
 The whole financial crisis is about the death of responsibility: the buck stopped nowhere. Everyone profited from toxic paper. Bernard Madoff, he of the alleged multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, is only the latest example.
 Irresponsibility has also characterized Detroit. I don't see how you restore responsibility with a bailout. Obama has a deeper task than changing the economy; he has to change the culture.
 Rather than adopting European subsidies, put billions toward more inspiring European examples: a high-speed railroad network or universal health care.
 Americans have always lived at the new frontier, at least in their imaginations. It's taken the death of the likes of the wonderful Pan Am to keep them contemplating the horizon rather than their navels. The risk of saving the moribund is the demise of the vital -- and the long-term cost of that is incalculable.

HEADLINE: Madoff Scandal Shaking Real Estate Industry

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Almost no segment of New York City's real estate industry was spared in the Madoff scandal, which may be history's largest Ponzi scheme: commercial brokers large and small, little-known developers and prominent families like the Wilpons and Rechlers all lost money to Bernard L. Madoff, industry executives say.
 The outsize impact on the industry may have resulted largely because Mr. Madoff (pronounced MAY-doff) managed his funds much the way that real estate leaders have operated successfully for decades: He provided little information and demanded a lot of trust. 
 ''You have a lot of wealthy people who made a lot of money on handshakes,'' said Mark S. Weiss, a commercial real estate broker at Newmark Knight Frank, where several brokers had invested heavily with Mr. Madoff. There was ''something about this person, pedigree and reputation that inspired trust,'' he said. 
 Across the city, industry executives said deals had been scuttled or jeopardized because of the scandal. Residential brokers are taking calls from Madoff investors who have had to put their apartments on the market. Many developers had pledged their investments with Mr. Madoff as collateral for projects, and are now worried that their banks will call in their loans. 
 ''The level of devastation, both financial and on a human level, is astounding,'' said Robert J. Ivanhoe, a lawyer who is representing 10 developers and investors who lost $5 million to $50 million each with Mr. Madoff. 
 Indeed, at an industry fund-raiser at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Manhattan last weekend, much of the chatter over sushi and crudites was about money feared lost with Mr. Madoff, according to people who attended. And a Manhattan psychotherapist who counsels real estate leaders and bankers said most of the patients he has seen this week have close friends and relatives who lost money with Mr. Madoff. 
 The victims include executives at the global commercial brokerage CB Richard Ellis, most prominently Stephen Siegel, a major Bronx landlord who is chairman of worldwide operations at the brokerage and whose wife, Wendy, helped organize Saturday's fund-raising dinner. 
 Brian S. Waterman, a principal at Newmark, also invested with Mr. Madoff. So did the Rechler family, which has been a major owner of office buildings in the region. Scott Rechler, the head of RexCorp, one of the family's largest firms, called the family's exposure ''limited.'' 
 Jerry Reisman, a lawyer based in Garden City, N.Y., said he was representing six commercial real estate investors and developers in the area who lost a total of $150 million to Mr. Madoff. They met Mr. Madoff through contacts at country clubs in the tristate area, he said.
 ''They knew him from golfing in the Hamptons. They knew him from the locker rooms,'' Mr. Reisman said. ''He was considered a wizard.''
 Mr. Reisman said his clients were especially concerned because they counted on Madoff investments to complete some of their real estate projects, pledging their investments as collateral for projects. Those developers fear that when their banks realize that their investments with Mr. Madoff have disappeared, they will demand new collateral from other sources, Mr. Reisman said.
 Finding those alternative lenders will be difficult given the financial crisis -- and given that many other real estate investors have been hurt by the Madoff case. 
 ''Many of these developers, their resources are all with Madoff,'' Mr. Reisman said. 
 There are widespread concerns that some developers will have trouble completing projects currently under construction. Edward Blumenfeld, who runs Blumenfeld Development Group, had invested heavily with Mr. Madoff and considered him a friend. Gary Lewi, a spokesman for Mr. Blumenfeld, said he still planned to complete a shopping complex in East Harlem that is to include a Target and a Costco, as well as several other projects where construction is ''in the ground.''
 Beyond that, though, Mr. Blumenfeld is uncertain of what his development plans hold. His friendship with Mr. Madoff is even more uncertain, Mr. Lewi said. 
 ''Any long-term plans are being reviewed as we conduct a far larger analysis of this scandal and the impact it could have on us and the development community as a whole,'' Mr. Lewi said. ''Mr. Blumenfeld was friend to a man who apparently didn't exist.''
 The Wilpon family, the major owners of the Mets, has acknowledged investing millions with Mr. Madoff. The family controls a real estate firm, Sterling Equities, whose Web site says it owns 3,000 residential units and 600,000 square feet of office space. It is unclear whether the firm's real estate holdings are affected by the Madoff investments. 
 ''We are shocked by recent events and, like all investors, will continue to monitor the situation,'' said Richard Auletta, a spokesman for Sterling.
 Other real estate developers are finding that their charitable giving has been wiped out by Mr. Madoff. Leonard Litwin, one of the city's largest apartment landlords and head of Glenwood Management, had nearly all of his charitable foundation's investments managed by Mr. Madoff. 
 Gary Jacob, executive vice president of Glenwood, said Mr. Litwin had never met Mr. Madoff but had invested with him on the advice of a friend. The Litwin Foundation had donated money to research for cancer and Alzheimer's disease and charities, many of them supported by the real estate industry. 
 ''It would have no impact to us as a real estate company,'' Mr. Jacob said. ''But it affects the charitable giving.''
 Some members of the real estate industry are receiving the news with a mix of schadenfreude and sadness for their peers. Jeffrey R. Gural, chairman of Newmark Knight Frank, the brokerage firm, said Mr. Madoff had turned his family down as investors about eight years ago because they would not invest at least $20 million. For years, he said, colleagues introduced to Mr. Madoff through relatives or country club friends had sung his praises. 
 ''People used to brag how they were getting these great returns when everybody else was struggling,'' he said. ''They thought Bernie Madoff was a genius, and anybody who didn't give them their money was a fool.''
 The impact is already spreading to the residential real estate business. Brad Friedman, a lawyer representing about 100 investors primarily in New York and Florida, said several clients have already said they plan to put their apartments on the market. They depended on their Madoff investments to pay their mortgages and co-op fees.
 ''With that source of money frozen, they've got no cash,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''They can't pay the electric bill. They can't pay the mortgage.''
 Other buyers have already backed out of deals because they had invested with Mr. Madoff and can no longer finance their purchases. Michele Kleier, a prominent Upper East Side broker, had buyers pull out of purchases on two $2 million apartments because they had lost money to Mr. Madoff. The first buyer put in an offer at 3 p.m. last Thursday, the day of Mr. Madoff's arrest, only to withdraw it by 5:30 p.m. 
 The second set of buyers had visited an apartment three times, requested the financial information about the co-op and had the broker notify Ms. Kleier that they would be making an offer on Monday morning. On Monday, she learned that the buyers had backed out because their money was tied up with Madoff funds.
 ''It's now two deals in the last four days,'' Ms. Kleier said. ''It's amazing.''
 Kenneth Mueller, a Manhattan psychotherapist who counsels many real estate and financial executives, said those who lost money to Mr. Madoff called his indictment ''the nail in the coffin for the commercial real estate industry,'' which had already been hurt by the recession. 
 Dr. Mueller said many patients were re-evaluating whether they can trust their business partners after Mr. Madoff's betrayal. 
 ''Madoff was considered a member of the family,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Putting Vanity On Hold

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
WITH hindsight, the first decade of this century may come to be viewed as the era of the mass medicalization of attractiveness.
The advent of cosmetic Botox in 2002 posited the eradication of wrinkles as an affordable luxury amid a booming economy.
On television, reality shows like ''Extreme Makeover'' and ''Dr. 90210'' normalized vanity medicine, making cosmetic operations seem cuddly and carefree. Meanwhile, lenders rushed in to offer specialized lines of credit for cosmetic procedures.
And, somewhere along the way, the body became the new attire, a mutable status symbol subject to trends in proportion, silhouette, technology and disposable income.
But now, as the country plunges into recession, will financial hardship demote the pursuit of physical perfection? 
Will the vogue for a smoothed face in which only the mouth moves, or a mix-and-match body of mature breasts atop boyish hips become outmoded? Will aesthetic values loosen up, allowing the occasional wrinkle to take on a certain measure of authenticity?
''There comes a point when you are putting too much time and money into your vanity,'' said Peri Basel, a practice consultant in Chappaqua, N.Y., who advises cosmetic doctors on marketing strategies. ''For me, the vanity issue is: Where does it stop? If you are going for buttock implants, do you really need that?''
Indeed, a few indicators suggest that financial constraints are beginning to interrupt the narrative of better living through surgery -- at least temporarily. Sixty-two percent of plastic surgeons who responded to a recent questionnaire from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons said they had performed fewer procedures in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, according to the latest anecdotal information from the group.
At the society's annual meeting last month in Chicago, some prominent surgeons said they had openings and for the first time agreed to negotiate fees with patients.
More recently, a quarterly earnings statement from Mentor Corporation, a breast implant manufacturer, reported that the number of breast implants sold in the United States decreased 5 percent during the three months ending Sept. 26 over the same period last year. In the last month, two manufacturers of cosmetic medical devices have closed.
''In Orange County, where plastic surgery is a part of their culture, doctors told me business is down 30 to 40 percent,'' said Thomas Seery, the president of realself.com, a site devoted to reviewing vanity-medicine procedures. ''That tells me something is fundamentally changing there.''
Even a few celebrities, those early adopters of appearance technology, have started to deride the plasticized look that sometimes accompanies cosmetic interventions, a harbinger perhaps of a new climate of restraint in which overt augmentation seems like bad taste.
Call it a Botox backlash. Last month in interviews with different magazines, the actresses Courteney Cox and Lisa Rinna said that they did not like the look of excessive facial injections.
''It's not that I haven't tried Botox -- but I hated it,'' Ms. Cox said in an interview in Marie Claire. ''You know you've messed up when people who are close to you say, 'Whoa, what are you doing?' ''
Meanwhile, Ms. Rinna, late of ''Dancing With the Stars,'' said that she had gone overboard with skin-plumping injections and planned to cut back.
ACADEMICS who study body image and body modification said it is too soon to know how financial constraints might alter attitudes toward beauty maintenance. But several researchers forecast how consumers might reappraise the idea of appearance upkeep in light of basic needs, family obligations, romantic aspirations, professional status and personal values. Although a recession may propel some people to seek more procedures, many consumers will reduce or forego cosmetic treatments, they said.
In uncertain times, people tend to re-evaluate their priorities, dismissing aspirational purchases as frivolous, said Victoria Pitts-Taylor, a professor of sociology at Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
''Cosmetic surgery is going to become the new S.U.V., something that you can do without, that is less justifiable for you and your family,'' said Dr. Pitts-Taylor. She is the author of ''Surgery Junkies: Wellness and Pathology in Cosmetic Culture.''
J. Kevin Thompson, a professor of psychology at the University of South Florida, theorized that people might reduce spending on their appearance after reassessing their immediate needs. ''It would be a rational decision to put the safety of your home first,'' said Dr. Thompson, who has studied body image disorders and obesity for 25 years. A psychological theory called Maslow's hierarchy of needs, in which physical necessities like food, health and security trump conceptual needs like self-esteem, may account for people who choose basics over beauty, he said.
Dr. Thompson, who emphasized that he was speculating in the absence of survey data, suggested that people may also make decisions about their appearance by scrutinizing the grooming practices of their friends, acquaintances, and even celebrities, a behavior called social comparison.
''In terms of body image, they look around at their friends,'' Dr. Thompson said. ''If everyone is cutting back, they may change the norm based on what others are doing.''
Meanwhile, fence-sitters who were contemplating but had never undergone a cosmetic procedure may now lose interest.
''Looking at the economy and their bank balances, they might now be saying 'No' and be glad to have a reason to resist the beauty imperatives of cosmetic surgery,'' Dr. Pitts-Taylor said.
And what about people who already consume cosmetic medicine on a regular basis?
Ms. Basel, the practice consultant, said she had amended her beauty routine, but had not relinquished her desire to manage her appearance.
''Let's face it, if you don't look great, you are not going to your reunion and you are not going on Facebook,'' said Ms. Basel, who blogs about beauty at itsthelatest.com. She described her cosmetic cutbacks: out went the personal trainer, in came the gym classes; antiwrinkle injections are a must, but major operations have gone by the wayside.
Amy Krakow, the president of Propaganda Marketing Communications, a public relations firm in Manhattan, who had been interviewed for an article in 2007 about high-maintenance beauty routines, has also made some concessions. She recently changed her hairstyle to include bangs -- a camouflage technique that allows for fewer Botox injections, she said.
''I'll change my hair colorist,'' Ms. Krakow said. ''I'll give up my crazy Japanese hair straightening. I'll stretch out my Botox. I'll even go for fewer plastic surgeries. But I do have to look good in my business. I look younger, therefore I can represent younger and hipper clients.''
Although economic constraints may cause some people to hit the pause button on beauty interventions, financial uncertainty may impel others to try it.
After all, body modification is more than a desire to increase attractiveness. It is an attempt to impose control over life by molding the flesh.
Deborah A. Sullivan, a sociology professor at the School of Social and Family Dynamics at Arizona State University, said that people who feel forced to forgo cosmetic medicine might experience a loss of control in their lives.
''I think it will intensify the sense of downward mobility: 'I can't even get my wrinkles treated,' '' Dr. Sullivan said. She is the author of ''Cosmetic Surgery: The Cutting Edge of Commercial Medicine in America.''
Against a tide of people eschewing cosmetic medicine in the new economy, she also predicted a counter current of consumers having procedures to feel proactive.
''People who would not have considered it, when they get laid off at 45, 50, 55 and are back on the job market, might consider it as they try to enhance their human capital,'' she said.
Cosmetic surgery has weathered other cataclysms. For example, consumers cut back on beauty operations after the terrorist attacks of 2001, a year in which procedures like liposuction, tummy tucks, nose jobs and eye-lid procedures declined, according to estimates from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Dr. Pitts-Taylor predicted that cosmetic procedures will experience a resurgence when the economy eventually recovers. ''It is absurd to suggest that cosmetic surgery is dead or will not be used by the middle class in the future,'' she said.
Doctors and manufacturers are counting on it.
On Dec. 1, Johnson & Johnson said it planned to buy Mentor Corporation, the breast implant manufacturer, for about $1.1 billion.
Correction: December 25, 2008, Thursday
A chart last Thursday with an article about the recession's effect on Americans' decisions to have cosmetic surgery misspelled the given name of the actress who said that she was dissatisfied with Botox. She is Courteney Cox, not Courtney.

HEADLINE: Eating Healthy, Even at Your Desk

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
GOOD news for budget-conscious companies forced to strip employees of every perk not nailed to the kitchenette floor: the online grocer FreshDirect will now send its chefs and nutritionists to your office for a lunchtime briefing on eating healthy at the office, free of charge.
 The catch is, you need to buy a lot of groceries first. 
 As part of a new outreach program called ''Smart Eating at the Office,'' which was announced at the digital media company IAC's headquarters in New York's Chelsea neighborhood earlier this month, FreshDirect will send its resident experts into office buildings to offer tips to employees who want to stay healthy while dining at the desk. 
 The program is free to regular FreshDirect corporate customers, but only those that order frequently enough to justify the cost. 
 The program is the first concerted effort by FreshDirect, which is based in Long Island City, Queens, to market FreshDirect at the Office, a three-year-old service that currently caters to businesses in Manhattan only. 
 FreshDirect is also introducing a line of vending machines for corporate offices that dispense ''4-Minute Meals'' developed in conjunction with popular New York restaurants, like chicken tikka masala from Tabla, and beef short rib enchiladas from Rosa Mexicano. 
 A partnership with the magazine Eating Well has also produced a line of co-branded vegetarian meals that are available in the vending machines.
 The machines give employees access to meals in the office at a reasonable cost to them -- prices hover at $7 to $10 -- and no cost to the company; Fresh Direct will install the machines free, though they must get enough use to justify their cost to the grocer. 
 ''The only cost to the companies is the cost of doing business with us,'' said Jim Moore, senior vice president of business affairs for FreshDirect. ''We want this to be the way we work with companies, to help them work smarter with us.''
 The effort to increase its corporate profile comes as FreshDirect faces uncertain times. About 95 percent of the company's revenue comes from home delivery to mostly affluent consumers, who may be less willing to pay a premium for ordering basic items like peanut butter and cat food online as the economy weakens. 
 FreshDirect made its first delivery in Manhattan in 2002, and now delivers to all five boroughs as well as parts of Nassau County, New Jersey and Westchester County. 
 The privately held company has also expanded beyond simple groceries to offering recipes, diet tips and its own branded line of meals on its Web site.
 The corporate business at FreshDirect is growing faster than the residential side, Mr. Moore said. 
 The company also says it believes there is an opportunity for it to take market share from expensive New York caterers as businesses look to save money.
 ''This year, a lot of holiday parties are being moved from the ballroom to the boardroom,'' Mr. Moore said. ''We're sending e-mails to our corporate customers letting them know we can cater their holiday parties for about $15 per person. It's a great message for a human resources person who's been told to cut back but doesn't want to throw a wet blanket on the holiday season.'' 
 At the IAC building, about a dozen employees -- all in their 20s or early 30s, all wearing jeans -- listened to an hourlong presentation from a nutritionist, Eileen Vider, and a research chef, Kimberlee Gaylord, who used examples from FreshDirect's inventory to illustrate healthy eating strategies. 
 The lecture took place in close proximity to a FreshDirect vending machine, which the grocer says it fills with fresh meals about twice a week. An Internet connection lets FreshDirect keep track of the machine's inventory from its headquarters. 
 Because IAC spends thousands of dollars on FreshDirect deliveries every year -- Mr. Moore said the company was among FreshDirect's top five corporate customers -- arranging the lunchtime briefing was ''a very organic process, and something they were happy to do for us.'' 
 IAC owns sites like College- Humor.com and Match.com.
 Other corporate customers scheduled for complimentary lectures include the ad agencies DraftFCB and R/GA, which are part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and BBDO, which is part of the Omnicom Group. 
 Larry Pearl, director of business development at FreshDirect, said that advertising and media companies were among the most active corporate customers because, like IAC, they tended to have young employees who worked long hours. 
 But corporate customers may not prove more reliable than residential ones in a down economy, said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research who follows the online grocery business.
 ''Unless you are providing something absolutely essential, it's a tough time to try and gain traction'' with corporate customers looking to cut overhead, she said. 
 And while the outlook for online grocers in general is still optimistic -- Forrester says the industry generated about $6.2 billion in 2007 and should hit $13.7 billion by 2012 -- Ms. Mulpuru said they faced challenges in the short term. 
 ''Because groceries are such a low-margin business, the only way FreshDirect is able to make it work is by going after the more premium customer, and that means charging higher prices'' than brick-and-mortar grocery stores, she said. ''In a down economy, that is a pretty tough proposition.'' 
 Mr. Moore respectfully disagrees.
 ''We have actually seen an uptick in business in the past few weeks in terms of people trending away from going out to restaurants and instead ordering meals from us,'' he said. 
 Whether that trend continues remains to be seen, but Mr. Moore makes a point: in New York, what is luxury to some is frugality to others.

HEADLINE: Settlement for Company Charged in Big-Dig Death

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The only company charged with manslaughter after a woman died in a Big Dig tunnel collapse in 2006 has agreed to pay the state and city $16 million in exchange for the charge being dropped. 
 The company, Powers Fasteners Inc., supplied the epoxy blamed in the collapse that killed the woman, Milena Del Valle, in July 2006 as she was going to the airport.
 Attorney General Martha Coakley said that with the settlement, the state was ''closing out most of the civil and criminal matters'' stemming from the tunnel collapse. So far, the state has negotiated about $600 million in settlements related to flaws in the project. 
 Powers Fasteners was criminally charged last year after the National Transportation Safety Board found it had provided ''inadequate and misleading'' information about the epoxy used to anchor the tunnel's concrete ceiling. It agreed a year ago to pay $6 million Ms. Del Valle's family, which has reached settlements totaling $28 million from various other companies involved in the Big Dig construction.
 In addition to paying the state and city $16 million, Powers Fasteners, a family-owned company in Brewster, N.Y., has agreed to stop production and sales of the epoxy used in the tunnel, recall it and put out warnings about it. That epoxy, a fast-set type, was inappropriately used on heavy concrete ceiling panels, investigators found, saying it should have been limited to wall panels.
 The company, which has 240 employees, has also agreed not to sell other adhesive anchors unless an ''accredited lab'' approves them. The indictment can be reinstated within three years if the company does not comply.
 Had it been convicted of manslaughter, the company would have faced a maximum fine of $1,000. Ms. Coakley said the quicker settlement was preferable, not least because Ms. Del Valle's family was intent on ensuring that no one else died for the same reason.
 ''I am very relieved and comfortable that we have resolved most of the issues as well as we could,'' Ms. Coakley said in a news conference.
 The Big Dig, one of the nation's most complex highway projects, has cost about $15 billion over nearly two decades. While the project is considered a feat of engineering, replacing an unsightly elevated highway through Boston with underground tunnels, it has been plagued with problems.
 In January, the two companies that managed the design and construction of the project and a number of smaller companies involved in it agreed to pay the state and federal governments more than $450 million. Most of that money is going to a special fund to pay for repairs on the Big Dig, while the money from Powers Fasteners will go to a general transportation fund.
 After Powers was indicted on one count of involuntary manslaughter in August 2007, its president, Jeff Powers, said the company had been singled out because it was small and could not ''buy our way out.''
 On Wednesday, though, Mr. Powers said the company ''accepts its share of responsibility as one of many businesses'' involved in the flawed tunnel construction. 
 ''The indictment alone has put enormous stress on our business and our people -- in an economic environment posing its own special challenges,'' Mr. Powers said in a statement. ''We are very happy to bring to a close this difficult chapter for all concerned.''
 Lawyers for Ms. Del Valle's husband and children said the family was happy to see the settlement, in particular because the Powers family recently suffered a loss of its own. Mr. Powers's brother died in a motorcycle accident this fall.
 ''It's time for this to be brought to a close,'' said Bradley Henry, one of the lawyers, ''and for peace to come to the Powers family.''

HEADLINE: Police Union Criticizes Effort to Reduce a Pension Benefit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON and AL BAKER

 BODY:
It is as ingrained a catchphrase for city police officers as ''New York's Finest.'' It is ''20 and out,'' and officers know it means if they have 20 years on the job, they can retire with a full pension.
 Gov. David A. Paterson's proposal to extend that length of service to 25 years for new hires was met with sharp criticism on Wednesday by the union representing police officers, where it was seen as a callous disregard for the tolls of police work. The city portion of the proposal was developed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and is estimated to save the city $5.4 billion over the next 20 years. 
 The proposal also includes creating a minimum retirement age of 50 before a full pension can be received. There currently is no minimum retirement age, and many officers who retire after 20 years are in their early 40s. The rule of ''20 and out'' would effectively become ''29 and out'' for a 21-year-old recruit. 
 The changes, which would also affect the pensions of firefighters, would require City Council approval as well as passage in Albany. 
 Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the union representing police officers, said changing the pension was breaking a longstanding promise to new recruits. 
 ''For decades, the city has managed to pay less than a market rate of pay for dangerous emergency service jobs because of the promise of stability and a fair pension,'' Mr. Lynch said in a statement on Wednesday. ''Remove those incentives and no one will want to take the risks or suffer the physical and mental toll those jobs inflict.''
 After 20 years on the force, the average New York City police officer earns roughly $90,000 annually, including overtime pay and other salary enhancements, said Charles M. Brecher, research director at the Citizens Budget Commission.
 With a pension worth half of the final year's annual salary, plus a $12,000 annual lump sum payment called a variable supplement, a retired officer can receive roughly $57,000 a year, which is not subject to state or city income taxes, he said.
 ''It's an expensive system, and generous, compared to other public employees,'' Mr. Brecher said. 
 Under the proposal, the $12,000 annual payment would also be eliminated, and the pension would be calculated using an average of salaries for the final three years of employment, not the last year. 
 E.J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, said the governor's proposals would fix an outdated system and help rein in the city's rising pension costs.
 '' 'Twenty and out' reflects an era where, after 20 years of police work, if you were in your early 40s, you did not necessarily have that much longer to live,'' Mr. McMahon said.
 He said the pension for city police officers was so known for being lucrative that, unlike other municipal employees, ''police officers are the only ones who have the pension in the back of their mind when they take the test in their early 20s.''
 Eugene J. O'Donnell, a professor of law and police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said it was hard to determine the effect that a less generous pension plan would have on recruiting. One problem, he said, is that the Police Department seemed to be downsizing somewhat and doing little recruiting, and moreover, the sharp increase in unemployment had made it easier to recruit future cadets.
 Robert W. Linn, a former director of labor relations for New York and the president of a labor relations consulting firm, said that the overall compensation package should be re-examined. ''If, in fact, New York City base salary is not competitive and the pensions are worse than in other jurisdictions, it will be hard to attract police. It should be no problem attracting people with 25-year pensions if base compensation is also competitive.''
 In August, the police unions and the city reached an agreement that would increase starting pay to $41,975, up from $35,881 under an old contract. It followed an arbitration panel's awarding police officers a retroactive raise while significantly raising starting pay to $35,881, from $25,100.
 At Columbus Circle, two officers emerging from the underground police command center said the proposed changes might give prospective officers some pause. 
 ''Being a police officer is a hard job,'' said a 23-year-old officer with two years in the department, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to violate Police Department rules. A pension in 20 years was a draw to this career, he said. ''An extra five years isn't bad, but if you work in the busy houses, it can burn you out.'' 
 Professor O'Donnell said many of his students who planned to join the Police Department were attracted to this year's increase in starting salaries for officers and paid little attention to pension issues. 
 But Steven Heimer, 21, who had just completed his police final minutes before, said the new proposals might deter him from joining the department. 
 ''Twenty is a big difference from 25,'' he said. ''If you want to do something afterward, have your own business, you'd have to wait five years.'' 
 Another John Jay student, Derek Bruno, 22, just shrugged when told of the proposed changes. ''I don't care,'' he said. ''I've wanted to be a cop since I was 13.''

HEADLINE: Other Voices on Caroline Kennedy's Bid for the Senate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Caroline Kennedy Is Seeking Seat Held by Clinton'' (front page, Dec. 16):
 It seems like yesterday that Caroline Kennedy was pictured as an adorable little girl clutching her mother's skirt. Today, she is seen as a beautiful, independent woman, bravely seeking to join the madding crowd of Congressional politicians. Wow. How time flies. You go, girl. 
 New Yorkers should welcome her as a breath of fresh air that is sorely needed to aerate the putrid atmosphere of politics today. Despite her apparent lack of qualifications, she certainly possesses intelligence, character, honesty and integrity, enviable qualities that are not learned in job training.
 Jack Bray Cullman, Ala., Dec. 16, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 ''Another Kennedy for New York?'' (editorial, Dec. 17) doesn't address an important question, that of how New York State fills vacancies in United States Senate seats.
 Under the 17th Amendment, the State Legislature has the authority either to allow the governor to appoint a new senator or to require a special election. New Yorkers deserve a special election. This way, all voters, not just the governor, will have the opportunity to assess the qualifications of candidates of both parties, and make a choice. 
 By so doing, New Yorkers can take the high road by demonstrating that they're more ''small d'' democratic than other states. Illinois comes to mind. 
 Mike Glass Farmingville, N.Y., Dec. 17, 2008
 To the Editor:
 In your editorial about Caroline Kennedy, you wrote: ''To get the job and keep it through elections in 2010 and again in 2012, Ms. Kennedy would have to do Utica. And Buffalo. And Schenectady.'' 
 Your sentence ended too soon for this Upstater. It should have continued to include Fort Edward, Middleburgh, Salamanca and the countless other neglected small towns throughout our Empire State that are severely depressed -- and have been for years -- whether the economic winds blow fair or foul. 
 But your editorial does successfully make the point that there are many New Yorks located far beyond the glitter and glamour of Manhattan. Certainly, there are many native New Yorkers who are aware of this highly relevant fact and who would make excellent senators. They are New Yorkers who have done their homework and learned their lessons about our diversity before becoming a United States senator. 
 These lessons cannot be learned overnight by making highly publicized listening tours; they can be learned only by interacting on a day-to-day basis with one's fellow New Yorkers -- in Wilson, Whitehall and Wampsville.

HEADLINE: Tossing a Rattle Into the Renovation

BYLINE: By MELISSA CLARK

 BODY:
WHEN I went into labor this fall, my daughter was three weeks early. But my kitchen renovation was running five weeks late. I had carefully planned that the two events would not overlap, but there I was listening to the screech of the drill in between contractions while my husband, Daniel, dashed around the bedroom packing the hospital bag.
 I moved into my century-old town house in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, 11 years ago with every intention of renovating the bare-bones kitchen with its scanty knotted-pine cabinets and 1980s Magic Chef stove. But in the meantime, I unpacked the 30 or so boxes of cooking equipment essential to my career as a food writer, and made do. 
 In the ensuing years, I hammered nails into the walls willy-nilly to hang newly acquired pans, and screwed in shelves to house my collection of mortars and pestles and the ever growing batterie de cuisine. The kitchen took shape haphazardly, and while I appreciated its cluttered beauty, it wasn't an easy place to cook.
 I probably would have put off renovating indefinitely, except I married and became pregnant. Suddenly, the sharp-edged mini tart pans stacked on open shelves and the tacks sticking up from the worn parquet floors seemed menacing instead of charming. Daniel had been advocating for a sleeker, more updated look since he moved in. ''Think of how satisfying it will be to find the sesame oil in the pantry instead of buying a new one every time you want to cook with it,'' he teased.
 We scraped together $25,000 and called Alexis Kraft, an architect who had designed our friends' ultramodern kitchen last year. He was gracious enough not to laugh when I mentioned the budget. ''I think that rules out custom cabinets,'' he said, sending us to Ikea.
 But the unsealed Carrara marble countertops so perfect for rolling out pie crusts were still in the running. (I know marble becomes stained, but blemishes add texture and flaunt the history of many happy meals.)
 Daniel's priorities were less visual clutter (clearing the counters), brighter and more-focused lighting, more open space around the island, and the use of environmentally friendly materials. 
 I wanted a stove with more B.T.U.'s, a new fridge, built-in bookcases, those pull-out pantry shelves, and much, much more storage. I also wanted a more organized working environment. It is one thing to have a kitchen that looks pretty. But as a professional who cooks thousands of recipes every year, I needed better flow. 
 Alexis's design kept the bones of the 1893 parlor room intact, leaving the ornate woodwork around the windows and pocket doors. Then he modernized the core, making sure the ash finish of the new Ikea cabinets, and the bittersweet-chocolate shade of the eco-friendly coconut-palm flooring, harmonized with the original oak. 
 As with my old kitchen, the cabinets and counters ran along the walls with an island in the center. But instead of the single row of cabinets, Alexis planned double rows on both sides. He also fitted the island with bookshelves, and drawers to absorb the multitude of small tools.
 True, I would need a stepladder to reach the cabinets' upper shelves, but I would reserve them for the various items I used once a year (the Seder plate, electric juicer, spaetzle maker).
 Perhaps most important, Alexis organized the space by moving the refrigerator to the same wall as the pantry, giving us more counter space on the sink-and-stove side, where it would be useful for prepping ingredients. And I would be able to unload my groceries by standing in one place. 
 With the design in hand, we hired a contractor, who, eyeing my bump, promised a new kitchen by early September. The baby was due in late October. ''It's an easy job,'' he said with a confident air. ''We'll finish in four or five weeks.''
 The work progressed apace, starting with the demolition. Then, the new light fixtures were installed. Alexis complemented the light over our island -- an early 20th-century pressed-glass factory shade -- with recessed ceiling lights to brighten the room, and halogen puck lights under the cabinets to illuminate the counters. We also installed dimmers for a more flattering glow during parties.
 Daniel wanted the island made smaller to create an easier flow of humans, and we also altered its look. The original plan called for a marble countertop with right angles. Daniel wanted a softer appearance, and asked for something rounded, perhaps with a gentle curve. Alexis ran with the idea, creating an arc worthy of Ellsworth Kelly, echoing it in the bluestone step leading to the deck, and in an ellipse-shaped cafe table top that we had cut out of the same hunk of Carrara marble.
 Other than the marble and bluestone, our kitchen splurges included a fancy new Wolf stove hood strong enough to suck out the stink of even schmaltz-fried latkes, a deep farmhouse sink and a tall swan-neck Grohe faucet that gave me enough room to clean my biggest stockpot.
 We economized with the fridge, a discounted floor-model Sub-Zero, the Ikea cabinets with their Home Depot pulls, and a GE Cafe series stove -- an improvement on the Magic Chef but not the Aga range of my dreams.
 We still came out $15,000 over budget. And several weeks late.
 By that time, about eight weeks into the renovation, we were desperate to be rid of the dust and chaos. Leaving the house in the throes of labor with Daniel holding one arm and our doula holding the other, we ran into the contractor. He did a double take, and a look of shock spread across his face. ''I promise we'll be finished tomorrow,'' he said.
 It took another week, but if that is what it takes to get a renovation finished, so be it.

HEADLINE: The Fight To Survive, Writ Small

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
Hoss Boyd, owner of an electrical contracting and solar energy installation company in Texas, was on the road at 3:30 a.m. the other day on business -- but not the usual kind. He was looking for the $48,000 that a contractor owed him so he could make payroll. 
 The check, it turned out, had been sent overnight. Even though his trip was for naught, he was relieved, he said. ''That gave us some breathing room.''
 It was another stomach-churning moment for another small business trying to stay afloat as lenders hoard cash and customers take longer to pay their bills. 
 Even companies like Mr. Boyd's, Premier CIRE Systems in New Braunfels, Tex., whose products and services are in demand, are being ensnared in the deepening recession. And while their troubles are not as apparent as those at the Big Three auto companies, for example, small businesses are in a daily fight for survival just the same. 
 In a way, said Ed Lette, chairman of the Business Bank of Texas in Austin, small businesses today are ''paying for the sins of bankers'' who had ''very loose underwriting'' and prices that were too low. Now bankers are returning to tried-and-true rules that they had abandoned: requiring 20 percent down, enforcing stricter underwriting.
 That is why small businesses are being turned away, Mr. Lette said; they cannot meet those basic requirements. ''Our banking sins are coming back to roost.''
 And that is why the Federal Reserve, for all its rapid interest rate cuts, and the Treasury Department have not been able to thaw the credit freeze. In a nod to those tight lending conditions, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will start a program early next year to ease credit for households and small businesses.
 Raymond J. Keating, chief economist with the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, a nonprofit advocacy group, argued that any recovery needed to bring along small businesses. ''This is where the real economic action is,'' he said.
 Some 60 to 80 percent of new jobs come from small businesses, Mr. Keating said, and more than 50 percent of private sector gross domestic product is created by small business. While big banks and automakers have the resources to demand attention to their woes, small businesses, he said, are ''lost in this equation.''
 Behind the scenes are entrepreneurs like Mr. Boyd, whose first name is James. He has survived other recessions and knows he has to be proactive about finding fresh financing. To that end, he has been pounding the pavement and working the phones with lenders for months, but almost every one has turned him down.
 Credit card companies approved lines of credit, he said, but now he is behind on those payments and faces repayment at 29.99 percent interest.
 He knows he is not alone in the daily quest for receivables -- money due his company. ''I got a call today from our print shop. We owe them $400 to $500 for blueprints.'' It was the company owner on the line making collection calls, Mr. Boyd said, adding, ''I would venture to say he's waiting on invoices, too.''
 In a one-time survey of 751 businesses with fewer than 10 employees in October, Intuit found that owners averaged $1,500 in overdue customer payments each month. With 22 million businesses of that size, the overdue payments add up to a strain of $33 billion in cash flow. 
 And while the government has been the lender of last resort to the big banks, small-business owners have no backstop. Even big asset-backed lenders are retreating, said Sam Thacker, a partner with Business Finance Solutions in Austin who has been working on behalf of Mr. Boyd. 
 There is one avenue of financing readily available -- lenders known as factors, which will extend financing based on money due the company, but they keep a piece of the money collected. And there is a catch. The small and medium-size businesses that are clients of factors must sell goods or services to other businesses, not to consumers. 
 Business at one such lender, Anchor Funding Services, has tripled in three months, according to Morry Rubin, its chairman and chief executive. 
 While traditional lenders began tightening credit six months ago, he said, the situation became urgent ''about 90 days ago, as credit deterioration and availability hit catastrophic levels.''
 Anchor's customers are saying that their clients who paid within 15 days are now extending to 30 days, he said. Those who paid in 30 days are well past 60. ''Many of our clients are facing receivables that have aged to more than 90 days,'' he said.
 Here is how it works: Anchor buys the receivable from a small business and immediately advances a portion of the total, normally 75 to 85 percent. Anchor collects the debt and returns the rest of the money owed to the small business, less a fee of 1 to 5 percent. 
 Recently, for example, Anchor advanced a truck company $1 million in six business days, Mr. Rubin said. 
 There are hundreds of factors like Anchor, according to the International Factoring Association. Mr. Rubin said he expected business to be robust for the foreseeable future, ''given that the crisis was not created in one day -- it will take time to heal.''
 Not everyone has access to lenders like Anchor, however, Mr. Thacker said.
 The Texas Store in Austin, which sells Texas and University of Texas-related items, for example, does not fit the criteria because its customers are consumers, so it has had to look elsewhere for cash. 
 Richard Horn, an owner, said he and his partner had been in ''lockdown mode'' these last few months as they reached the limit of their bank credit line.
 When the bank turned them down for an extension, Mr. Horn said, he was forced to pay bills on his own credit cards. He and his co-owner, Bill Mathews, are ordering just the items they are sure will sell in their two mall stores, like ''Don't Mess With Texas'' bumper stickers and ''Keep Austin Weird'' shirts and hats, while delaying payments as long as they can. 
 ''I do the cash flow statements,'' said Mr. Horn, who bought the business 21 years ago. ''It can wake me up at 3 o'clock in the morning because I've never quite been here before.''
 Mr. Thacker, a business adviser to the Texas Store and a finance and credit expert for Allbusiness.com, started a crisis management plan for the owners this fall with hopes of a turnaround in 2009 and a push to expand the online store (www.texasstore-austin.com).
 ''I have seen some tough cycles, but I've never seen owners of businesses as scared as they are now,'' Mr. Thacker said. ''Across the board, very few small-business owners I talk to are optimistic -- all they can see is the short-term lack of credit.''
 Mr. Boyd at Premier CIRE Systems has managed to hang on. He has cut his work force to just five, from 17 last year, and got a small line of credit last week that was enough to pay the rent and keep the lights on.
 But, he said, ''I was told today that a new supplier won't back our contracts.'' In addition to the company's recent history of slower payments, he said, the general contractor it uses, which has been in business for 23 years, has been flagged for paying slower.
 ''We're on the mend,'' Mr. Boyd said, ''but we have a long ways to go yet.''

In a bizarre spectacle of arrogance and denial, the Mets and the Yankees are hosting back-to-back introductions for their multimillion-dollar pitchers this week.
 Even as the nation continues to reel from the effect of economic body blows, the Yankees and the Mets lavish money on free-agent pitchers. On Wednesday, the Mets introduced Francisco Rodriguez, the redoubtable closer whom they signed to a three-year, $37 million contract last week. On Thursday, the Yankees will introduce starter C. C. Sabathia, this winter's free-agent gem. The Yankees signed Sabathia to one of the richest contracts in baseball history: seven years, $161 million.
 New York's two major league baseball teams continue to slug it out -- money be damned -- over everything from signage to signings. 
 This week, General Motors announced that it would not be the automotive sponsor for the Yankees when the new stadium opens next year. Almost simultaneously, G.M. announced that it would seek to renegotiate its sponsorship deal with the Mets. 
 Which team made the best deal for itself on the pitching front? My vote goes to the Yankees.
 While the Mets plugged an embarrassing hole in their bullpen, the Yankees plugged an even larger hole -- a hole in their soul. 
 Sabathia represents a potential breath of fresh air in a stale, cliche-ridden Yankees clubhouse, one with little personality and even less passion, and no recent championships to compensate for those deficiencies.
 Sabathia is a good-natured star who has strong feelings about issues and isn't afraid to share them. This is an anomaly in a clubhouse famous for antiseptic professionalism.
 In 2007, for example, Sabathia complained about the lack of African-American players in the majors. He even pointed a finger at Major League Baseball for not doing all that it could to increase the numbers.
 Sabathia, who was traded from Cleveland to Milwaukee last season, bemoaned the lack of black Americans in baseball. ''There aren't very many African-American players, and it's not just in here, it's everywhere,'' he told The Associated Press. ''It's not just a problem -- it's a crisis.''
 He said later: ''I think Major League Baseball should do something about it. I don't know exactly what they could be doing, but I know it's not enough.''
 Sabathia sponsors the North Vallejo Little League in Northern California, which among other things provides equipment for 175 young people from his hometown.
 Abe Hobbs, Sabathia's coach at Vallejo High, said Sabathia would be ''a great addition, not just to the team, but in the community.'' 
 Finally a Yankee with an opinion. 
 ''He's not the kind of person who will talk outside the clubhouse, but if something is troubling his heart, he'll say something,'' Hobbs said Wednesday in a telephone interview. ''In the clubhouse he'll let his voice be heard. He's very respectful, and he's a fierce, fierce competitor.'' 
 Gary Sheffield was the last great truth teller in the Yankees' clubhouse. Before that, the passion was generated by the Paul O'Neill Yankees, who played with a verve that has been missing. It's no coincidence that the championships have been missing as well.
 You can sign a mountain of A-Rods for a mountain of dollars and get a mountain of great-looking stats and have a molehill of titles to show for it. 
 During a radio interview Wednesday morning, Kevin Millar made a number of candid insights about baseball in general and the Yankees in particular. Millar spent three seasons with the Red Sox, and has a pretty thorough understanding of the Yankees. Millar played for Baltimore last season. 
 ''That team can play, but something's missing,'' he said. ''When you play against them and you look over there -- other than they didn't pitch very well -- something was missing.''
 The something was chemistry. The Yankees need more than a transfusion of talent -- they get one of those every season. Sabathia's greatest contribution to the Yankees may well be supplying that hard-to-define missing ''something.''
 He has been a hit with teammates everywhere he has gone, in Cleveland for seven-plus seasons and with Milwaukee for three months when he picked up the Brewers and carried them into the postseason.
 If his tenures in Cleveland and Milwaukee are any indication, Sabathia could help decorporatize the Yankees' clubhouse. He does things like calling up teammates on the road to go to lunch, inviting teammates out for dinner after a game. 
 This is as critical as taking the ball every fifth day and delivering a knockout blow. ''Those things matter when you have men on first and third in the eighth inning, and you have teammates pulling for each other,'' Millar said, ''and not hoping that a teammate makes an out so you can play.'' 
 The common wisdom is that a team can buy Gold Gloves, big bats and strong arms, but it can't buy chemistry.
 The Yankees may have finally figured out how to buy that, too.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Approves Cuts but Seeks Help

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
Facing its worst financial crisis in decades, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved an austerity budget for 2009 on Wednesday that calls for painful cuts in transit service and a steep increase in fares and tolls. 
 But the first service cuts and the fare increase were delayed until the spring, providing time for state lawmakers to enact a rescue package to shore up the authority's teetering finances. Even as they passed the $11 billion budget, many of the authority's board members said they would begin pressing elected officials to back a rescue plan. 
 ''What I'm going to do, and I know a lot of other people on this board are going to do, is go up to Albany, look our lawmakers in the eye, and say to them, 'Why can't you put transit first on the agenda for a change?' '' said Doreen M. Frasca, a board member. 
 She said that halting transit cuts was crucial to helping the city recover from the deepening recession. ''Investments in transit are the only thing that are going to get this economic ox out of the ditch,'' Ms. Frasca said. 
 The agency's budget includes a 23 percent increase in fare and toll revenues, to start in June, and cuts in subway, bus and commuter rail service in much of the region, some of which would start earlier. The measures are needed to help close a $1.2 billion deficit. 
 Jeremy Soffin, a spokesman for the authority, said that the first cuts would include the closing of some subway station booths, eliminating customer service agents in subway stations and cutting back off-peak bus service, all of which could begin as early as May. Some other major changes, like the elimination of the W and Z subway lines, would not take place until late in the year. 
 Authority officials have said that any bailout must be approved by March. Mr. Soffin said that hearings on the details of the fare increase and service cuts will begin in January and the board will probably vote on them in March. Planning for the service cuts, including new work assignments for employees and possibly preparing for layoffs, can take months, he said. 
 The focus now turns to Albany and the bailout plan proposed by Richard Ravitch, a former authority chairman, who led a state commission to address the authority's fiscal woes. His plan would impose a regional payroll tax generating $1.5 billion a year and tolls on the East River and Harlem River bridges, which would raise $600 million more. The plan, if enacted, would limit next year's fare and toll increases to 8 percent and would stave off most service cuts. 
 If the authority does not receive new sources of revenue, it seems likely that the base subway fare could rise to at least $2.50, from $2. A monthly unlimited-ride MetroCard could rise to more than $100, from $81.
 The Ravitch plan has the support of Gov. David A. Paterson, but it is far from clear how it will be received in the Legislature. 
 Efforts to help the authority are complicated by the state's own budget crisis. On Tuesday, Mr. Paterson unveiled a budget proposal for state government that included dozens of increased taxes and fees. Officials fear that the authority will have to compete with other powerful interests, including supporters of schools and health care services, for scarce government dollars.
 Tim Gilchrist, the governor's deputy secretary for economic development and infrastructure, said on Wednesday that he was preparing legislation to carry out the Ravitch plan that would be presented to the Legislature early next month. He said the hope was that action could be taken early in the year, well before the state budget deadline in April. 
 ''The earlier it's wrapped up, the earlier we can calm people's fears down,'' he said. 
 Mr. Ravitch said he was ''increasingly optimistic'' about his plan's prospects, noting that it had received support from business and environmental groups. 
 ''I'm spending most of every day talking to people,'' he said. ''I'm talking to individual elected officials all the time and I'm very encouraged.''
 But he said there was no coordinated lobbying strategy for the plan and that he had not heard from authority board members with offers of help in approaching lawmakers.
 The board voted 13 to 1 to approve the budget during a lengthy meeting at its Midtown headquarters. The meeting was disrupted by a man who took off his shoe and was hustled out by police who feared he was going to throw it at the authority's chief executive, Elliot G. Sander. The man, Stephen A. Millies, was charged with disorderly conduct. 
 The only board member who voted against the budget was Norman I.Seabrook, head of a municipal labor union. 
 ''We are being pawns in a game between the city and the state,'' he said, calling on state and city officials to provide more money for the authority. ''We're the ones who have to pull the trigger on something that makes no sense. We're the bad guys.''
 Several other board members called the service cuts and fare increases in the budget unacceptable but said they were voting for them in the hopes that the cuts would force the state to find more revenues for the authority. 
 Under the service cuts, the authority would run fewer trains and buses during off-peak periods and on weekends, meaning more crowding and longer waits. Among other changes, the W and Z subway lines would cease to exist; late-night service would be eliminated on 25 bus routes. 
 There were indications that the doom and gloom may not end with the passage of the budget, and that the authority's finances could become much worse very quickly. 
 The authority said this week that an important source of revenue -- taxes on real estate transactions -- was running well below recent forecasts, which had already been revised downward several times to account for the economic downturn. 
 Those real estate and mortgage taxes brought in $37 million this month (the proceeds are received by mid-month), compared with $103 million in the same period last year, Gary J. Dellaverson, the authority's chief financial officer, said at a meeting of the board's finance committee on Monday. 
 ''This is a really sobering number,'' Mr. Dellaverson said. ''This does show how frightening this economy can be in terms of our sensitive taxes.''
 He said the authority had tried to be very conservative in predicting real estate transaction tax receipts as the economy worsened, basing its forecasts on projections made by the city. 
 He said that projections of December's tax receipts had repeatedly been reduced as the year progressed, falling to $88 million from $99 million before finally being revised down again only a month ago, to $64 million. 
 But the reality was even worse, missing the mark by $27 million. 
 Mr. Dellaverson warned that the authority's budget relied on similar forecasts for other taxes, like a portion of the sales tax and a surcharge on corporate income taxes, that could decline sharply along with the economy.

HEADLINE: Shares Decline on a Day of Profit-Taking

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
As stock prices fell Wednesday after a 5 percent rally a day earlier, investors with an appetite for safety rushed to buy long-term government debt.
 Investors piled onto the far end of the yield curve as they faced the prospect of zero-percent interest rates for the foreseeable future, pushing already low yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries even lower. The price of government debt, considered the gold standard of safe investments, has boomed this year as the broader stock market has tumbled by more than a third.
 ''You've seen just a remarkable run-up in longer-dated Treasuries,'' said Chris Lafakis, an economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. 
 Stock markets, which soared Tuesday after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate target to record lows of zero to 0.25 percent, closed lower as traders cashed out profits. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 99.80 points, or 1.1 percent, at 8,824.34, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.76 points, 1 percent, to close at 904.42. The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.58 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,579.31.
 ''It's still a tug of war between the bulls and the bears,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's equity research. ''The bears are saying, 'I want to take profits when they come my way,' and yesterday they came in a big way.''
 The value of the dollar plunged against foreign currencies as investors bet that the Fed's debt purchases and interest-rate policy would weaken the dollar. It fell to a 13-year low against the Japanese yen on Wednesday.
 It was too soon to say whether the Fed's dramatic rate cut would free up credit or jump-start borrowing in America's consumer credit markets, but the effect on government debt was immediately clear on Wednesday.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.26 percent late Tuesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 20/32, to 113 26/32. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 2.65 percent from 2.74 percent.
 ''As far as the Fed's concerned, the lower the rates, the greater the possibility that when lending does occur, it'll be at reasonable rates that trigger a lot of borrowing,'' said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers. 
 The steep drop in Treasury bills has exerted pressure on money market funds that buy only those government securities. A handful of those funds are reporting a negative yield, because the return on their investments is, in some cases, less than their management fees. 
 Some fund managers have waived their fees temporarily to offset the low yields on Treasury bills, said Peter G. Crane, president of Crane Data, which publishes information about the money market fund business. ''If they stay down here, it will cause real pain,'' he said.
 Financial stocks, the leaders on Tuesday, tugged stock markets down on Wednesday morning after Morgan Stanley posted a $2.36 billion fourth-quarter loss. 
 But Wall Street looked past the loss. Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 37 cents to close at $16.50.
 Crude oil prices fell even as OPEC said it would cut production 2.2 million barrels a day on Jan. 1. Oil futures in New York dropped $3.54 to $40.06 a barrel.
 The plunge in oil prices slowed energy companies but lifted transportation companies. Shares of airlines, including Southwest, Continental and JetBlue, all rose.
 Even before the Fed cut rates, more people had begun applying for mortgages and refinancing their homes in response to falling loan rates, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. Mortgage applications increased 2.9 percent last week from a week earlier, while refinance applications rose 6.5 percent in a week.
 Despite the increase, housing remained weak. Housing starts plunged to their lowest levels in decades, to a seasonally adjusted 625,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, and analysts said construction would remain sluggish in the coming months.
 The Commerce Department also said that the current account deficit, a broad measure of United States trade, fell 3.7 percent to $174.1 billion in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: Broad Measure of U.S. Trade Fell in Third Quarter

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The mortgage market showed signs of life last week even before the Fed announced new steps to revive the economy, while a key trade measure improved in the third quarter. 
 The Mortgage Bankers Association said mortgage applications climbed last week as 30-year mortgage rates fell nearly to the lowest levels on their records.
 Other data released on Wednesday showed the current account deficit, the broadest measure of the nation's trade shortfall with the rest of the world, narrowed more than expected in the third quarter.
 ''Overall, the deficit is still huge, 4.8 percent of gross domestic product, but it should continue to decline as the crunch in import demand offsets the dramatic downshift in exports,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
 The mortgage data showed the market was already benefiting from previous promises of interventions by the Fed.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association said its application activity index rose 2.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted 841.4 in the week ended Dec. 12.
 Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates tumbled last week to 5.18 percent, the lowest since June 2003, the association said, and barely above the all-time low of 4.99 percent for the series, which dates back to 1990.
 The rate drop propelled the refinancing application index up 6.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted 4,156.0, overshadowing a 4.5 percent drop in demand for loans to purchase homes.
 The nation's current account deficit narrowed more than expected in the third quarter to $174.1 billion as exports of goods and services rose, the Commerce Department said.
 The third-quarter shortfall was down from a revised $180.9 billion in the second quarter. The deficit in the third quarter was 4.8 percent of gross domestic product, down from 5.1 percent in the second.

HEADLINE: One Loss Away From Unemployment

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
When Reggie Theus became the sixth coach fired in the National Basketball Association this season, it raised the question: is being an N.B.A. coach the least secure job in professional sports right now? 
 Leashes are not known for being terribly long for any coach, but the numbers show that the N.B.A. has seemingly jumped to a new level -- although the National Hockey League keeps it cozy company at the top (or bottom, depending on your point of view). The nature of the sports and the seasons contribute to coaches' longevity, with football's short season being one reason its coaches last the longest.
 The accompanying chart outlines every current coach in the four major professional leagues and how long he has held his current job. A coach in the N.B.A. has been cashing the paycheck from his current employer for an average of 2.64 seasons. But that number is so skewed by Jerry Sloan's industry-defying 20 seasons in Utah, the median number is probably more telling: 1.3 seasons. 
 In other words, N.B.A. coaches looking for new homes when they get a new job should consider renting, not buying. Advice coaches in the N.H.L. should heed too. The league is nearly as sack-happy, although riding a bit under the radar with only three firings so far this season. The average current coaching tenure is 2.58 seasons, with the median at 1.37.
 ''It's a great job, but you know sooner or later they're going to kick you out the door,'' said John Tortorella, who coached the Tampa Bay Lightning for seven seasons before being fired after last season. ''It's the owners' call. I'm not the one who has invested millions in the team. I respect that.''
 The longest tether goes to National Football League coaches, who have occupied their offices for an average of 4.34 seasons. There are two coaches Tennessee's Jeff Fisher and Denver's Mike Shanahan, in charge for almost 14 seasons (and counting) who skew the average, but the median is still higher than the other sports at 2.88. Major League Baseball waddles in the middle of this pack. Its managers having an average tenure of 3.78 seasons, a relatively cushy number also skewed by Bobby Cox's nearly 19-year run in Atlanta. The median checks in at exactly two seasons.
 Baseball went relatively quiet with in-season firings except for one bloody week in June when the Mets' Willie Randolph, the Mariners' John McLaren and the Blue Jays' John Gibbons were axed. Then in the middle of September, with his team clinging to a playoff position, the Brewers sent Ned Yost packing.
 The numbers are not a completely scientific look at the issue. They are more a snapshot of the current situation, in which the N.B.A. has earned its reputation with its rash of dismissals. Not only have Sacramento's Theus, Washington's Eddie Jordan, Minnesota's Randy Wittman, Philadelphia's Maurice Cheeks, Toronto's Sam Mitchell and Oklahoma City's P.J. Carlesimo taken a fall mid-season, there was turnover in eight jobs last off-season. Carlesimo was one of those coaches with new jobs. He lasted 13 games before becoming another casualty. The six coaches had a combined 558-739 record in the jobs from which they were sacked.
 In contrast, the N.F.L. had just four coaching changes between the 2007 and 2008 seasons, and three coaches were fired mid-season. The revolving door in Oakland continued to spin, where Lane Kiffin became the latest object of Al Davis' ire. Across the bay, Mike Nolan was fired as coach of the San Francisco 49ers and, in St. Louis, the Rams fired Scott Linehan after four consecutive losses to begin the season. That number is actually high for the N.F.L., where the fewer number of games relative to the other sports as well as the complexity of the coaching combines to make in-season moves rare.''
 ''Football is the most complicated of the sports, with the most complicated systems,'' said Charley Casserly, former general manager of two N.F.L. teams. ''In football, the system is dictated by the head coach. If you make a change, it takes a long time to develop a new system. So when it's not working, you ask, do we give it more time? The nature of the game dictates that coaches coach longer.''
 Former Cowboys' talent scout Gil Brandt said current coaches, though, might be in for a tougher road. The four teams that changed coaches in the off-season have boosted their total number of victories from 19 last season to 34 so far this season.
 ''Owners, when they see success, they want to emulate it,'' Brandt said. ''So new coaches may be facing higher expectations.''
 In the N.B.A. and N.H.L, the seasons are much longer and so many teams make the playoffs -- eight of 15 in each conference -- even small improvements can push a struggling team into playoff contention, so the temptation to change coaches is strong. The idea is that a new voice, a change in personality can be enough to solve some of a team's problems.
 ''There is going to be conflict,'' said Tortorella. ''I don't think it is a bad thing. You work through the bumps and become a tighter team. But some owners are not willing to go through that and the coach is out the door.'' 
 The N.H.L. has motored along with a steady clip of coaching casualties. Tampa Bay hired and fired Barry Melrose before most people realized he was no longer an ESPN analyst. Chicago gave Denis Savard all of four games this season before unceremoniously kicking him to the curb. Carolina raised some eyebrows with the dismissal of Peter Laviolette, who led them to a Stanley Cup in 2006.
 The lesson is, if you coach a professional hockey or basketball team, do not get too comfortable.
 Unless you are Jerry Sloan.

HEADLINE: Set to Go Forward, Schools May Instead Go 2 Steps Back

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
Just two years ago, the state's highest court ended a decades-long lawsuit over school funding by promising billions of dollars more for New York City schools, a ruling the governor at the time vowed would be only a starting point. School officials and education advocates took their long and aging wish lists to Albany, where legislators greeted them with open arms and passed a budget that sent a historic $710 million more to New York City schools in 2007. 
 Now, under a new governor and amid a widening financial crisis, those wish lists have quickly transformed into cut lists, and schools across the city are bracing for reductions that advocates say could total as much as $1.5 billion next year. And the hard-fought victories from the long-running lawsuit, known as the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, have evaporated even before they were realized. 
 ''This is a huge cut, to the point of devastating,'' said Geri D. Palast, the executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the educational advocacy group that filed the lawsuit. ''We believe it's the largest school aid cut in New York history.''
 In 2006, the Court of Appeals ruled that the city schools needed roughly $2 billion a year more to provide students with a ''sound basic education,'' but largely left the details up to the Legislature. On Tuesday, Gov. David A. Paterson said he was ''firmly committed'' to fulfilling the court mandate and his predecessor's promise to phase in an even larger increase, reaching $7 billion a year, but essentially proposed doing it over eight years instead of four.
 Ms. Palast said on Wednesday that her group would consider returning to court if state lawmakers approve Mr. Paterson's plan.
 ''We're certainly talking to our lawyers and consulting them on what needs to be done,'' she said.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had planned to use the sudden increase of money to expand the number of 4-year-olds enrolled in full-day pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds, add after-school programs and arts and gym classes for elementary schools, reduce class sizes in middle schools and improve college and career counseling in high schools. 
 Instead, the mayor -- who has repeatedly ordered steep cuts of his own to the Education Department's $20 billion budget -- predicted on Tuesday that Mr. Paterson's proposed cut of roughly $660 million in state aid ''would pretty much go straight to the classroom,'' warning of teacher layoffs, ''larger class sizes and fewer services.'' He said, ''If we don't have any money, we have to have fewer teachers in front of the same number of students.''
 While Ms. Palast and other advocates plan to lobby for an income tax increase for the wealthiest residents to reverse some cutbacks, many seem to view that effort as an increasingly hopeless battle. 
 ''Nobody can deny that we are in a terrible position financially,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the union that represents the city's 74,000 teachers. ''The question is, is it a slow stop or a screeching stop? Will we be moving backward or will be able to move forward, even if slowly?''
 Last spring, when the mayor proposed a 3.5 percent cut to the Education Department budget, the teachers' union and education advocates formed the ''Keep the Promises'' coalition, holding a rally with thousands of parents outside City Hall and the State Capitol to demand that the city and state fulfill their pledge for a multibillion-dollar increase. 
 Ms. Weingarten said she did not expect such protests this year. Still, if schools see major cuts -- losing entire arts programs or cutting back on extra tutoring -- public outrage will be inevitable. 
 Norm Fruchter, the director of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform, said that while some people had been unhappy with the most recent cuts, the city is now facing ''an unmitigated disaster.'' 
 ''I fear D.O.E. will not take the obvious steps in this fiscal crisis: first, make the deepest possible cuts to central administration, then reach out to the constituencies most affected to define how schools can best be protected,'' Mr. Fruchter said.
 But Dennis M. Wolcott, the deputy mayor for education, said that with the magnitude of the proposed cuts, ''you could close central down and there is still not enough money.''
 ''The idea had always been to pump as much money as we can into the schools to create options,'' Mr. Wolcott said. ''The options available to principals to choose from are going to be limited. Instead of hiring that extra teacher to help, they just may not be able to.''
 For former Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who was forced to make midyear cuts during the Giuliani administration, the education budget looks in many ways like a return to the era that led to the fiscal equity suit. He said he did not envy his successor, Joel I. Klein, and noted that the current administration had planned to use the influx of money to reduce class size, and ''there's nothing more expensive.''
 ''Trying to improve results in a down market is hellish,'' said Mr. Levy, who is now a managing director of an investment firm. ''When there's a budget hole of this size, it really is not realistic to say that commitments made to in totally different economic circumstances are going to be adhered to without any deviation.''

HEADLINE: California: Mercy and Taliban Fighter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The parents of John Walker Lindh, an American-born Taliban fighter, pleaded with President Bush to set their son free before he leaves office. Mr. Lindh was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty in 2002 to serving in the Taliban army, which violated American economic sanctions against Afghanistan. At a news conference in San Francisco, Mr. Lindh's mother, Marilyn Walker, asked Mr. Bush to show mercy during the Christmas season by commuting her son's sentence. ''John made a mistake in joining the Taliban,'' Ms. Walker said. Mr. Lindh, who was born and raised in Marin County, converted to Islam when he was 16 and traveled to Yemen, Pakistan and Afghanistan in furtherance of his religious studies, Jim Brosnahan, his lawyer, said at the news conference. Mr. Lindh was captured by Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan on Nov. 24, 2001, and was shot and wounded during a prison uprising. He was later turned over to American authorities. He is serving his sentence in a minimum-security prison in Terre Haute, Ind.

HEADLINE: In Auto Talks, Paulson Takes the Wheel

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN, BILL VLASIC and DAVID E. SANGER; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This article was reported byDavid M. Herszenhorn, Bill VlasicandDavid E. Sangerand written by Mr. Herszenhorn.
 The White House and the Treasury are deep into negotiations with General Motors and Chrysler over reorganization plans that could result in freeing up more than $14 billion in emergency loans to keep the companies afloat through the first quarter of 2009, according to industry executives and a senior administration official. 
 The Bush administration appears to want an agreement with the automakers before Dec. 25. It was unclear, however, when all of the particulars might be worked out, said the senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the negotiations. 
 But the official indicated that the administration was inclined to do more than just keep G.M. and Chrysler alive until President-elect Barack Obama takes office, saying, ''Giving them enough money to limp along doesn't solve anything.'' 
 In the negotiations, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., is effectively taking on the role of ''auto czar,'' which was envisioned in the carmakers rescue bill written by the White House and Congressional Democrats and approved by the House but blocked by Senate Republicans.
 In the days since the White House said it would step in to prevent the collapse of G.M. and Chrysler, Treasury officials have been poring over detailed financial data in a meticulous exercise that one G.M. executive likened to ''putting on the aqualung'' and diving deep into the companies' books. 
 G.M. officials said that the company's chief financial officer, Ray Young, and a team of aides had provided the Treasury with a vast sheaf of documents including supplier contracts and payment schedules, production plans, employee payrolls, debt obligations, interest payments and even utility bills.
 The negotiations continued on Wednesday even as Chrysler announced that it would idle all of its factories for a month or more, extending an annual holiday shutdown that normally lasts about two weeks. Chrysler's finance arm also warned dealers on Wednesday that a shortage of cash might force it to stop making loans temporarily that many dealers rely on to buy inventory for their lots.
 G.M. had already announced extensive idling of its plants in Canada and the United States during the first quarter. Other automakers, including Honda and Ford, have announced cutbacks in production as the entire industry copes with plummeting demand for vehicles in the deepening recession. 
 In an interview on Wednesday on CNBC, Mr. Paulson said the auto bailout talks were now his primary focus, but he declined to say if the money promised by the White House would be disbursed before Christmas. ''The autos will get the money as quickly as we can prudently do it,'' he said. 
 G.M. has said that it desperately needs $4 billion to survive through the end of this month and that $10 billion could carry the company through March 31, the end of the first quarter of 2009. Chrysler has said that $4 billion would allow it to avoid bankruptcy and stay in business through the quarter. 
 The auto companies have said they expect the terms of the emergency government assistance to match roughly the requirements in the legislation approved by the House, which would force them to submit to strict oversight and impose numerous taxpayer protections. 
 That bill also would have forced the companies to carry out drastic reorganization plans, slashing jobs, closing factories and consolidating product lines as they sought to restore profitability, and it would have required the companies to have a clear plan to achieve a positive cash flow in the future. 
 But officials said that providing aid to the automakers using the Treasury's $700 billion financial stabilization program was substantially more complicated without legislation tailored specifically to the automobile industry. White House officials blamed Congress for the delay in speeding funds to the companies. 
 ''Because of the failure by Congress, we're left with suboptimal options,'' said Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary. Cautioning that no decisions had been completed, Mr. Fratto added, ''We'll do what is in the best interests of taxpayers and the national economy.'' 
 In addition to the emergency loan package, officials are working with the finance arms of G.M. and Chrysler to convert them into government-regulated financial institutions, a designation that could make them eligible for separate loans from the Federal Reserve. 
 The Senate vote last week, in which Republicans blocked the auto bailout legislation, capped a month of public drama over fears that at least two of Detroit's Big Three were in imminent danger of collapse, including two rounds of contentious hearings with the auto chiefs on Capitol Hill. 
 In recent days, however, administration officials and company executives have sequestered themselves, offering only the slightest hints of what they are discussing, as market analysts speculate about how long G.M. and Chrysler can survive without a government lifeline. 
 Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to President Bush, told Fox News on Wednesday that an announcement on aid was not necessarily imminent. ''There will be a decision obviously by the end of the year,'' he said. President Bush in a separate interview said he would make a decision ''relatively soon.'' 
 And Mr. Bush reiterated that his greatest concern is the possibility of a ''disorganized bankruptcy or disorderly bankruptcy.'' The White House press secretary, Dana Perino, has made that point repeatedly, but it is unclear if the administration would consider some sort of prepackaged bankruptcy for one or both of the companies. 
 Legal experts said, however, that speculation was growing that the White House and the Treasury were exploring that idea, which would be unusual. It would require the advance cooperation of the autoworkers, bondholders, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders, who would all have to agree to concessions.
 The private-sector financing for such a package would total about $25 billion for both companies, legal experts said, with the Treasury providing a guarantee by adding about $5 billion from the financial rescue fund.

HEADLINE: Council Is Set to Approve Higher Hotel and Property Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
The City Council is prepared to approve on Thursday Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposal to raise property taxes by 7 percent, and to increase a tax on hotel rooms, to help plug an estimated $4 billion budget shortfall over the next 18 months, according to people briefed on the negotiations.
 ''The votes are there,'' said one council member who, like half a dozen other council members and aides interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to antagonize either end of City Hall. If approved, the property tax increase would take effect in January and add $600 million to the city's coffers through the end of the fiscal year in June, and $1.2 billion for an entire fiscal year. The move would put an early end to a property tax cut that had been set to expire in June. 
 The hotel tax, which could be temporary, would climb to 5.875 percent from 5 percent per room. That would mean an increase of $2.62 for the average hotel room rate of $300 a night, and raise $100 million from March 2009 to the end of the next fiscal year in June 2010.
 But in a concession to the Council, Mr. Bloomberg is ready to mail out $400 property tax rebate checks to homeowners within the next few weeks, the council members and aides said. Mr. Bloomberg had initially resisted continuing the popular rebate this year, saying that the city could not afford the $256 million expense. Then, after the City Council discovered that the city was legally obligated to send out the checks in the current fiscal year, Mr. Bloomberg suggested that the city hold on to the money until June.
 Mr. Bloomberg has also agreed, according to city officials, to refrain from cutting approximately $20 million from the budget, including programs for the City University of New York. As a result, he does not plan to cancel the next training class for more than 1,100 police cadets; instead, there will be two smaller classes of 250 cadets apiece in January and June.
 When asked about the deal, Stu Loeser, a spokesman for the mayor, said, ''We continue to have discussions with the Council.''
 But the council members -- while cautioning that there was still a chance that important details could change, or even that the deal could collapse -- said that a vote would occur on Thursday.
 Several members said the events of the last week or so had cemented their belief that it was better to act now, as Mr. Bloomberg has insisted. In particular, they cited Gov. David A. Paterson's budget proposal, released on Tuesday, which would reduce aid to New York City by $1 billion. And they spoke soberly about the prospect of subway fare increases and service cuts at the hands of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
 ''I think people understand it's a tough time, and it's coming from every angle,'' said one council member.
 The day after Election Day, Mr. Bloomberg unveiled a detailed budget update, warning of the need to cut spending at all city agencies and raise taxes. Since then, as the nation has plunged deeper into a recession and the city's tax revenue outlook has worsened, Mr. Bloomberg has ordered even deeper cuts to city agencies.
 He has been especially unstinting about the importance of raising property taxes -- something he says he would prefer not to do, but must.
 Asked on Wednesday during a news conference whether he was confident that the City Council would vote to increase property taxes, Mr. Bloomberg said, ''I don't want to prejudge what they'll do, but if they were to not do this, we'd have to cut another $600 million worth of services.''
 He added, ''But I think they understand.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Inner Circle: Members and Maybes: Ray Lahood

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
Chosen for: Secretary of transportation
 Would bring to the job: A Republican pedigree, a centrist reputation and a proven ability to work across party lines as a member of the House of Representatives from Illinois. As a veteran of the Appropriations Committee, he embraced federal spending as a way to spur economic growth. 
 Is linked to Obama by: Illinois roots as a native of Peoria along with his 14 years of representing central Illinois. More importantly, he developed a close relationship with Rahm Emanuel, the new White House chief of staff, who in October praised Mr. LaHood's ''leadership, his thoughtfulness and his character'' in a House floor speech.
 In his own words:''The reason I went on the Appropriations Committee, the reason other people go on the Appropriations Committee, is they know that it puts them in a position to know where the money is at, to know the people who are doling out the money and to be in the room when the money is being doled out.'' (Peoria Journal Star, Dec. 7, 2008)
 Used to work as: Member of Congress first elected in 1994 as part of the Republican takeover. Former chief of staff to the Republican leader Robert H. Michel, whom he replaced in Congress. Member of the Illinois House, teacher and youth counselor. 
 Carries as baggage: The outspokenness that made him a favorite of Capitol Hill news media rubbed some of his colleagues the wrong way and made some enemies. His willingness to work with Democrats also undermined him among fellow Republicans. Enthusiastic backer of earmarks, the pet spending projects that Mr. Obama has indicated he will curb.
 Biography: Born Dec. 6, 1945 ... graduated from Bradley University in 1971 with a degree in education and sociology ... taught social studies in junior high for six years ... one of only a few Republicans who did not sign the Contract With America in 1994 ... had already announced he would not seek re-election in 2010.

HEADLINE: Fed Cut Pressures Japan and China to Follow Suit

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Expectations increased Wednesday that central banks in Japan and China would cut interest rates again after the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by more than expected and declared that it would try to pull the American economy out of recession by pumping money into the system. 
 Economists said that the Fed's decision on Tuesday -- combined with a outlook for the Japanese economy and the persistent strength of the yen -- increased the pressure on the Japanese central bank to follow suit on Friday with a cut in its already ultralow rates. 
 The Bank of Japan cut its key rate to 0.3 percent in October, shaving 0.2 percentage points off the benchmark level, its first cut in seven years. The central bank has since signaled its reluctance to cut further. 
 But economists said the bank might have little choice but to follow the Fed, sooner rather than later. 
 ''The Fed funds target is now lower than the B.O.J.'s overnight rate target of 0.30 percent,'' said Tomoko Fujii, head of economics and strategy at Bank of America in Tokyo. ''As a result, the B.O.J. is now more likely than not to cut the policy rate to 0.10 percent this Friday, in addition to implementing liquidity provision measures.'' 
 Satoru Ogasawara, an economist with Credit Suisse in Tokyo, agreed, although he said he thought a rate cut would come early next year, rather than this week. 
 ''The B.O.J. probably doesn't want to lower rates to zero again, but will be placed in a position where it has no alternative,'' Mr. Ogasawara said. He expected the bank to lower the overnight rate target to 0.1 percent in the first quarter of 2009, and to zero in the fourth quarter. 
 China, too, is widely expected to deliver more cuts, with the next move looking increasingly likely to come before the end of the year. On Tuesday, the Chinese central bank's governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, signaled his willingness to lower rates. 
 The People's Bank of China has already cut rates four times since mid-September -- the latest in November, when it reduced its benchmark one-year lending rate to 5.58 percent from 6.66 percent -- and the government has announced a stimulus package intended to prop up flagging growth. 
 ''I think the chance of another rate cut, of 0.54 percentage points, before the year-end is quite high,'' said Tao Wang, an economist at UBS Securities in China, adding that she expected the central bank to have cut rates by a total of 1.08 percentage point by the end of 2009. 
 Jun Ma, chief economist for Greater China at Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong, said he believed that China's central bank would probably reduce rates by another 1.35 percentage points ''in 2009 in three or four cuts.'' The next rate cut, he said, ''is likely to be a relatively large'' 0.54 percentage points and could be in a month or two. 
 Qing Wang, chief economist for Greater China at Morgan Stanley, forecasts additional rate cuts of 1.62 percentage points by the middle of 2009. Such moves -- whatever their timing -- would add to the already considerable efforts to shield China's giant economy from the fallout of the global downturn that has already pulled the United States, Japan and much of Europe into recession. 
 China's stimulus package came last month as the impact on export-oriented economies in Asia began to be felt; since then, economic data for November, released in the last 10 days, has shown that the pace of growth is slowing more rapidly than had been expected only weeks ago. 
 China's once-sizzling growth rates of more than 10 percent are expected to slow to 8 percent or less in 2009. Many economists, including those at Morgan Stanley and UBS, project 7.5 percent growth next year. 
 ''It will take some time for the stimulus package to feed through,'' Ms. Wang of UBS said, adding that she expected more details on the measures in the next few weeks. ''I am also looking out for new announcements on measures to boost the property sector, such as land policies, to come through.'' 
 On Wednesday, the government introduced several such measures, including cuts in business and transaction taxes for real estate sales. 
 Hong Kong, which like Japan, the United States and much of Europe slipped into recession in the third quarter, was quick to follow the Fed with a rate cut, slashing its base rate to 0.5 percent, from 1.5 percent. 
 In Norway, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 1.75 percentage points, to 3 percent, and signaled it would make additional cuts.
 The Fed's move Tuesday leaves its target for the overnight federal funds rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, and has brought the United States to the zero-rate policies which Japan used for years in its own fight against deflation. 
 Though important as a historic milestone, the move to an interest rate of zero from 1 percent is largely symbolic. The funds rate, which affects what banks charge for lending their reserves to one another, had already fallen to nearly zero in recent days because banks have been so reluctant to do business. 
 More important, the Fed bluntly announced that it would print as much money as necessary to revive the frozen credit markets and fight what is shaping up as the worst American economic downturn since World War II. 
 In effect, the Fed is stepping in as a substitute for banks and other lenders and acting more like a bank itself. 
 ''The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth,'' it said. Those tools include buying ''large quantities'' of mortgage-related bonds, longer-term Treasury bonds, corporate debt and even consumer loans.

HEADLINE: What Will Change Look Like?

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
EVER since Mary Todd Lincoln overshot the White House decorating budget by $6,700 (a third of her $20,000 appropriation), infuriating her husband and delighting a press corps that had already turned against her, the redecoration of the president's house has been a public relations minefield. Some new administrations tiptoe through it unscathed; others are less nimble, and bombs explode. 
 ''It's an old maxim that you can build a billion-dollar highway that's the biggest pork barrel in the world and no one will say anything,'' said William Seale, a White House historian, ''but if you're in public office and you try and change your desk, you're going to end up on the front page. In presidential decor, one must remember the public eye is fixed on everything you do.'' 
 Barack Obama's transition team has not responded to inquiries about his interior design plans, so one can only speculate about how the Obamas will make their stylistic mark on the White House. Perhaps they will choose Nate Berkus, the engaging puppy dog of a decorator beloved by Oprah and other Chicagoans, to assist them. 
 Or perhaps, as the comedian Andy Borowitz suggested on the phone last week, they will follow the template the president-elect has laid out for his cabinet appointments. ''That whole team-of-rivals approach,'' Mr. Borowitz said, ''so instead of one decorator there will be eight: four Republicans and four Democrats, none of whom can stand each other, and he'll make them each do a room.''
 However the Obamas decide to proceed, they'll have to follow a few basic rules. For starters, they will have to pay for their own movers. And while Congress budgets $100,000 in household transition costs for every new administration, if the Obamas spend more than that -- and most first families do -- they will have to cover the expense of decorating their private quarters with private donations. In addition, they can't change the public rooms without the approval of a committee of preservationists.
 They would also be wise to remember that appearances do matter: Jimmy Carter's earth-toned Oval Office read as both homespun and dreary (never mind that his predecessor, Gerald Ford, had chosen the decor and Mr. Carter was saving money by not redecorating), and the cost of Nancy Reagan's china ($210,399) was seen as wildly extravagant (though the china was a private donation and considered a necessity -- before then, state dinners were served on a mishmash of patterns because there wasn't enough of any one set to go around). The Kennedy White House was too French; the Clintons', too Arkansas. In recent history, only the Waspy Bushes (both 41 and 43) have escaped decorating derision. 
 Some stories about decorating missteps are apocryphal, like that of Nancy Reagan's plan to tear down a wall in the Lincoln bedroom or that of the Clintons' decorating costs running over budget (mentioned by the former deputy White House counsel, Vincent W. Foster, in a note shortly before he died in an apparent suicide). The bad press in both cases accrued to the president's wife. 
 Attacking the first lady, said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the author of a dozen books on first wives and their families and the historian of the National First Ladies Library, ''is a way of not directly attacking a popular president.'' Mr. Anthony ticked off a few of Nancy Reagan's perceived sins, including that she asked the Carters to move out early so she could start redecorating and that she was decorating the private quarters in an inappropriately lavish way in a time of recession. 
 ''Conscious of that, she used private funds'' to shore up the house, Mr. Anthony said, ''fixing floors, redoing hardware. The place was falling apart. Much of the money went to this, rather than the red decorating everybody remembers, because that's what got reported. There's a saying that in Washington, no good deed goes unpunished.''
 The Clintons were savaged for packing up rugs, furniture and lamps given to them during their White House tenancy, and for soliciting donations of household objects for their post-White House residences (a house for her in Washington, and one for him in Chappaqua, N.Y.). They had always lived in public housing, Mr. Anthony said, and ''in an effort to get up to speed, they put the word out that people could make donations.''
 Money has historically been tight for White House families. Mr. Seale noted that James Monroe had a kind of pawn-shop arrangement, whereby he would finance diplomatic tours by selling pieces of the Directoire furniture he had collected in France to the United States government. ''When he'd finished touring, he'd buy it back,'' Mr. Seale said. ''Then, of course, there was Mrs. Lincoln, who bought that famous Lincoln bed.''
 When her husband was presented with the bill, Mr. Seale said, ''He blew up.
 ''Let me see if I can get his quote right: 'It would stink in the nostrils of the American people to have it said that the president of the United States had approved a bill over-running an appropriation of $20,000 for flub dubs for this damned old house, when the soldiers cannot have blankets.' '' 
 ''Flub dubs,'' Mr. Seale repeated, savoring the words. ''Isn't that a great phrase?'' (Mr. Seale included it in his two-volume history, ''The President's House,'' which was just published by the White House Historical Association.)
 DECORATING the White House is the first lady's job; she presides over the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, a board of appointees that includes her decorator and the White House curator, as well as art historians, furniture and decorative art experts and other advisers on historic preservation. (Laura Bush's decorator, Kenneth Blasingame, a Fort Worth designer, has been steadily reworking rooms like the Lincoln Bedroom, which were revealed, to not much comment, in Architectural Digest last March.)
 Renovations of the public rooms, additions to the formidable collections of art and furniture, and any restoration work is overseen by the committee and financed by the White House Endowment fund, which now has assets of about $27 million.
 When it comes to the private quarters, on the second and third floors, and the Oval Office, though, the decor is the ''personal decision of the first family,'' said Tom Savage, director of museum affairs at Winterthur in Delaware and a member of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House during the Clinton administration. ''But there are so many safeguards. The misconception of the public is that a first family can make very dramatic changes, and that's just not so.'' 
 There is drama on moving day, however. Gary Walters, who retired last year after 21 years of overseeing the 132-room mansion as chief White House usher, explained that on Inauguration Day it was his job to help the first families move, in the scant and hectic period between the time the exiting president departed for good (about 10:45 a.m., after greeting the president-elect under the North Portico and having a cup of coffee with him in the Blue Room) and the new president and his family left the inaugural parade in the late afternoon.
 That leaves about five hours for the usher and 93 assistants, including household staff, painters, carpenters, florists and even calligraphers, Mr. Walters said, along with the new decorator and his or her staff, to unpack the family's things and put everything away. ''The goal is no unopened boxes,'' said Mr. Walters, who used to move into the White House for a week before Inauguration Day, sleeping on a cot in the basement.
 ''It can be extremely difficult,'' he added. ''When Bush 41 was elected, for example, we expected to have the normal amount of time, until after the parade, but there were grandchildren and they got cold and came in about two hours early.'' 
 Moving day is highly choreographed, the culmination of exhaustive prep work. After the ceremonial, post-election tour given to the president-elect and his family by the outgoing president and his wife, the chief usher meets with the new family. He presents them with floor plans and a book detailing the furniture and art owned by the White House and stored at a facility in Maryland. 
 ''I asked questions like 'What rooms do you want to use, and what beds? What would you like and where would you like us to put it? Do you have favorite foods?' For the president, it's 'Which desk would you like?' The questions are to elicit dialogue about things they might not have thought of,'' Mr. Walters said. 
 Linens and mattresses are replaced, or ''put out of service,'' as he put it. ''The new president will not have the linens of the previous president.'' 
 This wasn't always the case. Mamie Eisenhower complained that the linens were all mended, said Claire Whitcomb, co-author of ''Real Life at the White House: Two Hundred Years of Daily Life at America's Most Famous Residence'' (Routledge, 2002). ''And Eisenhower hated Truman so much, he didn't bother to go on the tour. So when he woke up on his first day in office, he didn't know where his office was.'' Also, Ms. Whitcomb continued, the movers lost his suitcase. 
 Every family leaves something behind, intentionally or not. When the Fords moved in, Betty Ford found one of the Nixons' boxes. ''It was marked, 'Tapes, Do Not Touch,' '' Ms. Whitcomb said. Turns out, it was filled with the former president's Mantovani recordings. And Ronald Reagan left a note in his desk drawer for George H. W. Bush, she added, that said, ''Don't let the turkeys get you down.'' 
 Washington observers like Arianna Huffington predict no decorating pitfalls for the president-elect and his family, just another ''teachable moment'' for the rest of us. 
 ''There have been a lot of these with the Obamas,'' Ms. Huffington said, ''like learning to get along with your mother-in-law and not holding grudges.'' She imagines organic cotton curtains and nontoxic cleaning supplies. 
 For his part, Mr. Borowitz wondered if Michelle Obama might take ''that victory dress and upholster a couch with it.''
 ''By repurposing it,'' he said, ''she could show how thrifty she was.'' 
 ''Money is important,'' he continued. ''Whatever furniture the Clintons didn't take, the Obamas could auction off to pay down the costs of the auto industry bailout. Then they could get some modest things from Ikea or Craigslist. I'm sure there are some other people who have lost their presidents' jobs in other countries who are putting their things on Craigslist. If Hugo Chavez gets defeated, maybe they could have his stuff.''

HEADLINE: Picks Made for S.E.C. And Transportation Post

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and BEN WHITE

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama on Thursday will announce Mary L. Schapiro to be the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to Democrats familiar with the decision, elevating Ms. Schapiro from her current position as the head of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority.
 Mr. Obama has also settled on Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, as his choice for transportation secretary, officials familiar with the decision said, and on Friday is scheduled to announce that Mr. LaHood will be nominated to lead the department through a vast public works program intended to stimulate the economy. 
 Mr. Obama, who has only a handful of key appointments remaining, will name Ms. Schapiro to the post during a news conference Thursday morning in Chicago. She would be the first permanent female chairwoman of the S.E.C.
 The S.E.C. decision, which was first reported by Bloomberg News and confirmed by two officials familiar with the decision, comes as Wall Street faces a slew of regulatory questions in the wake of the economic downturn, chaotic shakeup in the financial industry and new revelations involving the possible $50 billion fraud by the investment adviser Bernard L. Madoff. 
 Ms. Schapiro, 53, is a former commissioner of the S.E.C. She met with Mr. Obama in recent days in Chicago, officials said, and her appointment was on the agenda during a meeting on Tuesday of Mr. Obama's top economic advisers.
 Although her appointment is not a cabinet-level position, she faces confirmation by the Senate, some of whose members have been critical of how the S.E.C. performed in overseeing the faltering investment banks this year.
 In addition to serving at the S.E.C., Ms. Schapiro was chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission during the Clinton administration. Her service at both agencies could suggest that Mr. Obama is considering combining the two regulators, a structure long supported by many experts to streamline market oversight. 
 Mr. LaHood, who is retiring after seven terms in Congress, has overseen major spending projects as a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Known for his bipartisan alliances and his moderate views, he will be the second Republican named to the cabinet, after Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary who has agreed to stay on.
 With transportation secretary off his list, Mr. Obama would have only one remaining cabinet seat to announce: labor secretary. He also has yet to name a director of national intelligence, which is not a cabinet position but aides said could be filled soon.
 The next transportation secretary will face several challenges. One is that the gasoline tax, regarded since the Eisenhower administration as a user fee to pay for building highways, is no longer reliable or sufficient. Gas at $4 a gallon stunted sales and tax revenue, and the Congress had to come to the rescue of the Highway Trust Fund with $8 billion.
 With a growing number of hybrid cars, use of tax-exempt ethanol and the possibility of plug-in hybrids, gasoline consumption is becoming disconnected from highway use. When the bill to re-authorize the Transportation Department is considered by Congress in 2009, there will be proposals for a variety of replacement financing methods, including tolls that vary by time of day, possibly using transponders like those now provided by E-ZPass and similar systems.
 Another open question is the status of rail transportation, both passenger and freight. Many freight lines are now operating at capacity. And Amtrak, strongly backed by Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and spoken of favorably by Mr. Obama, needs cash for new equipment.
 The Federal Aviation Administration, another agency within the Transportation Department, faces a monumental task in replacing its aging work force of air traffic controllers, and improving air traffic control. 
 Mr. LaHood, 63, was elected to Congress from downstate Illinois as part of the 1994 class that gave House Republicans the majority for the first time in nearly a half-century. A former state legislator and a senior Congressional aide, Mr. LaHood became a leading bipartisan voice in an increasingly polarized Congress.
 Mr. LaHood is close to Mr. Obama and Rahm Emanuel, the incoming White House chief of staff. Mr. LaHood was among the group of moderate Republicans who traveled to the White House last year to tell President Bush that he was in danger of losing support from many in his party over the Iraq war. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 30, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 18 about President-elect Barack Obama's choice of Mary L. Schapiro to be the next chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission misstated the name of Ms. Schapiro's current employer. She heads the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, not the Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The error was repeated in an article and editorial on Dec. 19 and in an article on Dec. 25.

HEADLINE: Paulson Takes Lead in Auto Rescue Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN, BILL VLASIC and DAVID E. SANGER; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This article was reported byDavid M. Herszenhorn, Bill VlasicandDavid E. Sangerand written by Mr. Herszenhorn.
 The White House and the Treasury are deep into negotiations with General Motors and Chrysler over reorganization plans that could result in freeing up more than $14 billion in emergency loans to keep the companies afloat through the first quarter of 2009, according to industry executives and a senior administration official.
The Bush administration appears to want an agreement with the automakers before Dec. 25. It was unclear, however, when all of the particulars might be worked out, said the senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the negotiations. 
 But the official indicated that the administration was inclined to do more than just keep G.M. and Chrysler alive until President-elect Barack Obama takes office, saying, ''Giving them enough money to limp along doesn't solve anything.'' 
 In the negotiations, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., is effectively taking on the role of ''auto czar,'' which was envisioned in the carmakers rescue bill written by the White House and Congressional Democrats and approved by the House but blocked by Senate Republicans.
 In the days since the White House said it would step in to prevent the collapse of G.M. and Chrysler, Treasury officials have been poring over detailed financial data in a meticulous exercise that one G.M. executive likened to ''putting on the aqualung'' and diving deep into the companies' books. 
 G.M. officials said that the company's chief financial officer, Ray Young, and a team of aides had provided the Treasury with a vast sheaf of documents including supplier contracts and payment schedules, production plans, employee payrolls, debt obligations, interest payments and even utility bills.
 The negotiations continued on Wednesday even as Chrysler announced that it would idle all of its factories for a month or more, extending an annual holiday shutdown that normally lasts about two weeks. Chrysler's finance arm also warned dealers on Wednesday that a shortage of cash might force it to stop making loans temporarily that many dealers rely on to buy inventory for their lots.
 G.M. had already announced extensive idling of its plants in Canada and the United States during the first quarter. Other automakers, including Honda and Ford, have announced cutbacks in production as the entire industry copes with plummeting demand for vehicles in the deepening recession. 
 In an interview on Wednesday on CNBC, Mr. Paulson said the auto bailout talks were now his primary focus, but he declined to say if the money promised by the White House would be disbursed before Christmas. ''The autos will get the money as quickly as we can prudently do it,'' he said. 
 G.M. has said that it desperately needs $4 billion to survive through the end of this month and that $10 billion could carry the company through March 31, the end of the first quarter of 2009. Chrysler has said that $4 billion would allow it to avoid bankruptcy and stay in business through the quarter. 
 The auto companies have said they expect the terms of the emergency government assistance to match roughly the requirements in the legislation approved by the House, which would force them to submit to strict oversight and impose numerous taxpayer protections. 
 That bill also would have forced the companies to carry out drastic reorganization plans, slashing jobs, closing factories and consolidating product lines as they sought to restore profitability, and it would have required the companies to have a clear plan to achieve a positive cash flow in the future. 
 But officials said that providing aid to the automakers using the Treasury's $700 billion financial stabilization program was substantially more complicated without legislation tailored specifically to the automobile industry. White House officials blamed Congress for the delay in speeding funds to the companies. 
 ''Because of the failure by Congress, we're left with suboptimal options,'' said Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary. Cautioning that no decisions had been completed, Mr. Fratto added, ''We'll do what is in the best interests of taxpayers and the national economy.'' 
 In addition to the emergency loan package, officials are working with the finance arms of G.M. and Chrysler to convert them into government-regulated financial institutions, a designation that could make them eligible for separate loans from the Federal Reserve. 
 The Senate vote last week, in which Republicans blocked the auto bailout legislation, capped a month of public drama over fears that at least two of Detroit's Big Three were in imminent danger of collapse, including two rounds of contentious hearings with the auto chiefs on Capitol Hill. 
 In recent days, however, administration officials and company executives have sequestered themselves, offering only the slightest hints of what they are discussing, as market analysts speculate about how long G.M. and Chrysler can survive without a government lifeline. 
 Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to President Bush, told Fox News on Wednesday that an announcement on aid was not necessarily imminent. ''There will be a decision obviously by the end of the year,'' he said. President Bush in a separate interview said he would make a decision ''relatively soon.'' 
 And Mr. Bush reiterated that his greatest concern is the possibility of a ''disorganized bankruptcy or disorderly bankruptcy.'' The White House press secretary, Dana Perino, has made that point repeatedly, but it is unclear if the administration would consider some sort of prepackaged bankruptcy for one or both of the companies. 
 Legal experts said, however, that speculation was growing that the White House and the Treasury were exploring that idea, which would be unusual. It would require the advance cooperation of the autoworkers, bondholders, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders, who would all have to agree to concessions.
 The private-sector financing for such a package would total about $25 billion for both companies, legal experts said, with the Treasury providing a guarantee by adding about $5 billion from the financial rescue fund.

HEADLINE: A Rainbow of Students Learning to Be French

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
''The Class'' was shown as the opening-night selection of this year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Manohla Dargis's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 26; the full text is online at nytimes.com/movies. The film, in French with English subtitles, opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles.
 The young bodies crowding ''The Class,'' an artful, intelligent movie about modern French identity and the attempt to transform those bodies into citizens through talk, talk, talk, come in all sizes, shapes and colors. With their cellphones and pouts, these bored, restless junior high students look pretty much like the fidgety progeny of Anytown, U.S.A. One difference being that these African, Arab and Asian Parisians live in a country that insists its citizens have only one cultural identity, even if it is an identity -- as France's smoldering suburbs vividly suggest -- that many of these same young people don't feel welcome to share. 
 ''The Class'' isn't directly about civil unrest and French identity as a republican ideal, though these issues run through it like a powerful current, keeping the children and adults (and the filmmaking) on edge. Rather, the director, Laurent Cantet -- using a small team and three high-definition video cameras -- keeps a steady eye on the children, these anxious, maddening little people flailing and sometimes stalling on the entryway to adulthood. He shows them giggling, arguing, boldly and shyly answering questions. He marks their victories and failures and, with brutal calm, shares some of the other lessons schoolchildren learn on their way to the office, factory, shop, unemployment line and perhaps even prison: sit down, raise your hand, stand up, get in line, keep quiet. 
 Just about as tightly focused as a documentary by Frederick Wiseman, the story unfolds almost entirely inside a school in the working-class, fast-gentrifying 20th arrondissement, a residential district on the city's farthermost eastern edge. You don't see much of the neighborhood (its most famous residents are taking the big sleep in the Pere-Lachaise Cemetery), though you do get to know several dozen of its younger inhabitants. A rainbow coalition of sullen boys and mouthy girls ages 13 and 14, the students are meant to be learning the finer points of the French language, parsing the differences between the passe compose and the imparfait, distinctions that seem nearly as foreign to them as does the reedy young teacher down in front.
 One of the most remarkable things about ''The Class'' -- which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May -- is that this quietly stubborn, prickly man is Francois Begaudeau, who wrote the autobiographical novel on which the movie is based. Like the students, the administrators and other teachers -- all culled from the same school in the 20th -- Mr. Begaudeau is playing a fictionalized version of himself developed through weekly workshops, improvisations and a shoot that lasted a full academic year. Like Mr. Cantet's shooting style in this movie, he initially comes across as free-flowing, even loose, a guy whose jocular teasing suggests that he wants to be seen more as a friend than as an authority figure, one of us rather than one of them. He isn't, which proves this classroom's most difficult, painful lesson.
 Mr. Cantet, who shares the screenwriting credit with Mr. Begaudeau and Robin Campillo, tends to keep his ideas more strategically nestled in the unassuming guise of a documentary-
 inflected realism that plays a lot like life because that's precisely where it comes from. Here Mr. Cantet -- whose earlier features include ''Human Resources'' and ''Time Out,'' two other dramas about systems of power -- has done that rarest of things in movies about children: he has allowed them to talk. There's no question that he's occasionally overeager to speak on their behalf, but he's listening too, engaged in a conversation that's as urgently necessary in this country as it is in France.

HEADLINE: Slackening Demand Lets Oil Fall to Four-Year Low

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled Thursday and oil prices closed below $40 a barrel, skidding to their lowest levels in more than four years amid signs that the global demand for oil was falling faster than oil-producing nations could slash output.
 A day after the OPEC cartel announced it would cut crude oil production by an additional 2.2 million barrels a day, oil prices continued their slide, falling $3.84 to settle at $36.22 a barrel in New York. Peak prices of $145 a barrel have crumbled as the financial crisis halted construction projects, shuttered auto plants and curbed oil consumption worldwide. 
 As demand slips and gasoline prices hit $1.67 a gallon, energy companies are stockpiling millions of barrels of crude oil and gasoline, far more than analysts have expected, the Energy Department reported this week.
 ''Nobody really knows how deep and long this recession is going to be,'' said Fadel Gheit, managing director of oil and gas at Oppenheimer Funds. ''Demand is vanishing.''
 The decline pushed energy stocks lower, accelerating a late-day sell-off that erased most of the gains from a 5 percent rally earlier in the week. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 219.35 points, or 2.49 percent, at 8,604.99; the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 19.14 points, or 2.1 percent, to 885.28 points. The Nasdaq fell 26.94 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,552.37.
 ''Within the context of the last few months, it's a very normal sell-off,'' said Richard Sparks of Schaeffer's Investment Research.
 Exxon Mobil and Chevron were among the biggest losers among blue-chip stocks, sliding 5 percent. 
 Uncertainty about the economy continued to drive investors to the safety of government debt. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note surged 1 2/32, to 114 28/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 2.08 percent, from 2.19 percent late Wednesday.
 ''You're having people say, 'The return of my capital is more important than the return on my capital,' '' said William Rhodes, chief investment strategist of Rhodes Analytics.
 If there is a silver lining, it is that fixed mortgage rates are declining as Treasury yields fall, even as the housing market remains plagued by slow sales and falling values. Average rates dropped to 5.18 percent this week, according to Freddie Mac, after interest rates were cut to nearly zero. The Federal Reserve vowed to lower rates by buying mortgage-backed debt.
 Continued uncertainty about the fate of Detroit's Big Three automakers weighed on auto shares. General Motors, which is pleading for government help to stave off financial collapse, dropped sharply after a White House spokeswoman said the government was considering an ''orderly'' bankruptcy for G.M. and Chrysler. Shares of the Ford Motor Company also fell. 
 Shares of General Electric fell 8.2 percent after the ratings company Standard & Poor's cut its outlook on G.E. and General Electric Capital to negative, saying there was a one in three chance that G.E. would lose its high AAA credit rating in the next three years because of troubles at its finance unit. 
 FedEx ended 2 percent lower after the company warned that it was cutting costs through a hiring freeze, spending cuts and layoffs, despite a better-than-expected profit for the quarter ending Nov. 30. The company plans to reduce executive and management salaries in 2009.
 ''Our financial performance is increasingly being challenged by some of the worst economic conditions in the company's 35-year operating history,'' said Frederick W. Smith, the chief executive of FedEx, in a statement.
 In another sign of continuing economic weakness, the Labor Department said Thursday that while first-time unemployment claims fell by 21,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 554,000, they remained close to their recent highs. 
 ''The next few weeks will see renewed increases,'' Ian Shepherdson, United States economist of High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. ''Claims now look very high, but when they are adjusted for population growth they remain far below the peaks seen in the deep recessions of the '70s and '80s.''
 And a closely watched index of leading economic indicators slipped further in November, as forward-looking measures like building permits, stock prices, consumer sentiment and unemployment claims showed more fissures in the economy. The Conference Board's leading index declined 0.4 percent last month, and the private research group reported that the economy would continue to sputter in 2009.

HEADLINE: In a Season of Economic Slump, Even 'The Nutcracker' Doesn't Beckon as Brightly

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
If ''The Nutcracker'' is in trouble, then things are really looking bad.
 At least two of the nation's ballet companies have reported poor sales for that Christmastime staple, a major source of income in the dance world, and are cutting back. The problems are a reflection of the difficulties the recession is causing for performing arts institutions. 
 The Cincinnati Ballet said it was offering half-price tickets for two performances this week and had canceled the show next Friday, for which only 140 tickets had been sold. 
 ''When we sell 1,400, we feel that's not enough,'' said Annie Wadman, the artistic administrator.
 In California the Sacramento Ballet estimated that its ''Nutcracker'' ticket sales would be off by a third, The Sacramento Bee reported this week. The poor projection and low turnout for other performances have raised questions about the company's future. The board said it would wait until after the new year ''to decide about the rest of this season or future seasons,'' the president, Jill Kaiser Newcom, was quoted as saying by The Bee. Ron Cunningham, a co-artistic director, did not immediately respond to a phone message on Thursday.
 Texas Ballet Theater of Dallas and Fort Worth, because of financial woes, is using taped music for its ''Nutcracker'' after 20 years of accompaniment by the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra. That has set off a scramble by the symphony to replace the fees. Nevertheless, ticket sales are strong, said Margo McCann, the interim managing director of the ballet company.
 New York City Ballet, producer of the gold standard of ''Nutcrackers,'' said ticket sales were about 5 percent off from last year. The production runs through Jan. 3 at Lincoln Center. ''Over all, it's really holding its own,'' said Rob Daniels, a spokesman.

HEADLINE: Omnicom Expected to Cut About 5% of Its Work Force

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
The cutbacks are mounting on Madison Avenue as agencies owned by the Omnicom Group are letting employees go in layoffs that are expected to total more than 3,000.
 Omnicom is a holding company that runs neck and neck with a rival, the WPP Group, as the world's largest owner of advertising and marketing agencies by revenue. Omnicom had about 70,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2007. 
 ''Given current economic conditions, our companies have reviewed their staffing levels as they relate to their current business requirements,'' a spokeswoman for Omnicom in New York, Pat Sloan, said in a statement Thursday morning.
 The cutbacks involve some, but not all, agencies owned by Omnicom, she added, and amount to less than 5 percent of the work force. For example, an Omnicom media agency, PHD, is laying off 30 employees, about 2.5 percent of its staff in North America, and closing an office in Atlanta.
 BBDO Worldwide, a large Omnicom advertising agency, told employees of layoffs Thursday afternoon. There were 189 dismissals at the agency's offices in North America, which would represent 5 to 6 percent of the total in those offices.
 BBDO laid off 145 employees last month at its office in Troy, Mich., 22 percent of the office's staff of 656.
 Among Omnicom clients hit hard by the recession and financial crisis are Best Buy, Chrysler and FedEx.
 Whatever the marketer, advertising spending has been falling throughout 2008 as consumers reduce their spending for goods and services. Forecasters are calling for more ad spending cuts into 2009.
 Ms. Sloan provided the statement from Omnicom in response to an inquiry about a report on adage.com -- the Web site of the trade publication Advertising Age -- that Omnicom agencies were preparing to cut up to 3,500 jobs, or nearly 5 percent of the total.
 Other agencies that have dismissed employees recently include some owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, like Campbell-Ewald, and some owned by the Publicis Groupe, like Digitas.

A Clever Move 
 By Credit Suisse
 Many retailers have a simple policy regarding merchandise: you break it, you buy it. Credit Suisse is adopting a similar idea by paying its top bankers with the equivalent of broken inventory -- those dodgy, illiquid assets that the Swiss bank accumulated on its balance sheet during the credit boom. That is a bonus for shareholders. 
 But why would the bank's senior staff be willing to accept this? After all, you can't make the Maserati payments next year with units in Credit Suisse's new Partner Asset Facility. Managing directors and directors will receive as much as 80 percent of their deferred compensation in this form. 
 The answer is simple: They stand to make a healthy return a few years down the road. How healthy? Do the arithmetic. The assets have already been written down to about 65 cents on the dollar. The bet is that these loans will be worth far more than that over the lifetime of the facility, expected to be about eight years. To juice up the returns, Credit Suisse will provide leverage of as much as seven times equity.
 For the first five years of the facility, the asset carries a nominal coupon of about 4 percent a year. Again, that won't pay the country club fees. But say a banker receives units worth $500,000 today. If the assets are eventually sold or are paid back to the tune of 80 cents on the dollar, the securities would be worth $1.4 million, according to calculations by breakingviews.com. If they are dollar good, meaning they pay back the full face value of the securities, then the units would be worth $2.7 million. 
 Shareholders, having already taken their lumps for writing down the securities in the facility, might be furious if they see employees profiting too handsomely. So the bank is seeking to offer them a chance to purchase the units as well. 
 Clever old Credit Suisse.
 Zero and Zirp
 Zero is a hard number to understand. In multiplication, it turns other values to nothing. In division, it turns them to infinity. In finance, it turns the world upside down. No wonder investors are dizzy.
 The United States is repeating a Japanese experiment with a zero in one of the most important variables in financial markets: the official overnight interest rate. The so-called zirp, an acronym for zero interest-rate policy, is combined with a nearly infinite quantity of government borrowing. The government is expected to try to stimulate the economy, which is well into what looks like a bad recession, with as much as $850 billion of new debt. 
 Meanwhile, the recession is inspiring a flight to safety. That means buying government bonds. The 2.2 percent yield on the 10-year Treasury could approach zero if the Federal Reserve's hints that it will start buying Treasuries itself become reality. So bond prices could move higher. But in the currency market, megadebts and miniyields are harmful, which is why the dollar has fallen to 88 yen, from 98 yen, in a month. 
 The combination of falling yields and falling currency is illogical for a country that depends heavily on foreign capital. But in the zirp world, many things don't quite stack up. The United States isn't the only country that offers this investment conundrum. Britain is indebted similarly and borrowing more. The country is heading quickly toward zirp, with the overnight rate of 2 percent likely to be cut in half in January. The 10-year gilt yields a low 3.2 percent. And given that interest rates in the euro zone haven't fallen as quickly as in Britain, the pound has tumbled rapidly, to 1.08 euros, from 1.18 euros, in a month. 
 The move toward zirp is widespread. Japan never really left, and the euro zone is gradually getting there. The thinking is that free money will keep the credit system from freezing, while higher government deficits should keep demand from collapsing. 
 But the best that can be said so far for the policies is that the world could be in even worse shape without them. With no plausible alternatives offered, investors should expect more zirp. And that points to many subzero returns. ROB COX and EDWARD HADAS

HEADLINE: The Madoff Economy

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

DATELINE: The revelation that Bernard Madoff 

 BODY:
brilliant investor (or so almost everyone thought), philanthropist, pillar of the community -- was a phony has shocked the world, and understandably so. The scale of his alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme is hard to comprehend.
 Yet surely I'm not the only person to ask the obvious question: How different, really, is Mr. Madoff's tale from the story of the investment industry as a whole?
 The financial services industry has claimed an ever-growing share of the nation's income over the past generation, making the people who run the industry incredibly rich. Yet, at this point, it looks as if much of the industry has been destroying value, not creating it. And it's not just a matter of money: the vast riches achieved by those who managed other people's money have had a corrupting effect on our society as a whole. 
 Let's start with those paychecks. Last year, the average salary of employees in ''securities, commodity contracts, and investments'' was more than four times the average salary in the rest of the economy. Earning a million dollars was nothing special, and even incomes of $20 million or more were fairly common. The incomes of the richest Americans have exploded over the past generation, even as wages of ordinary workers have stagnated; high pay on Wall Street was a major cause of that divergence.
 But surely those financial superstars must have been earning their millions, right? No, not necessarily. The pay system on Wall Street lavishly rewards the appearance of profit, even if that appearance later turns out to have been an illusion.
 Consider the hypothetical example of a money manager who leverages up his clients' money with lots of debt, then invests the bulked-up total in high-yielding but risky assets, such as dubious mortgage-backed securities. For a while -- say, as long as a housing bubble continues to inflate -- he (it's almost always a he) will make big profits and receive big bonuses. Then, when the bubble bursts and his investments turn into toxic waste, his investors will lose big -- but he'll keep those bonuses.
 O.K., maybe my example wasn't hypothetical after all.
 So, how different is what Wall Street in general did from the Madoff affair? Well, Mr. Madoff allegedly skipped a few steps, simply stealing his clients' money rather than collecting big fees while exposing investors to risks they didn't understand. And while Mr. Madoff was apparently a self-conscious fraud, many people on Wall Street believed their own hype. Still, the end result was the same (except for the house arrest): the money managers got rich; the investors saw their money disappear.
 We're talking about a lot of money here. In recent years the finance sector accounted for 8 percent of America's G.D.P., up from less than 5 percent a generation earlier. If that extra 3 percent was money for nothing -- and it probably was -- we're talking about $400 billion a year in waste, fraud and abuse.
 But the costs of America's Ponzi era surely went beyond the direct waste of dollars and cents.
 At the crudest level, Wall Street's ill-gotten gains corrupted and continue to corrupt politics, in a nicely bipartisan way. From Bush administration officials like Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who looked the other way as evidence of financial fraud mounted, to Democrats who still haven't closed the outrageous tax loophole that benefits executives at hedge funds and private equity firms (hello, Senator Schumer), politicians have walked when money talked.
 Meanwhile, how much has our nation's future been damaged by the magnetic pull of quick personal wealth, which for years has drawn many of our best and brightest young people into investment banking, at the expense of science, public service and just about everything else?
 Most of all, the vast riches being earned -- or maybe that should be ''earned'' -- in our bloated financial industry undermined our sense of reality and degraded our judgment. 
 Think of the way almost everyone important missed the warning signs of an impending crisis. How was that possible? How, for example, could Alan Greenspan have declared, just a few years ago, that ''the financial system as a whole has become more resilient'' -- thanks to derivatives, no less? The answer, I believe, is that there's an innate tendency on the part of even the elite to idolize men who are making a lot of money, and assume that they know what they're doing.
 After all, that's why so many people trusted Mr. Madoff.
 Now, as we survey the wreckage and try to understand how things can have gone so wrong, so fast, the answer is actually quite simple: What we're looking at now are the consequences of a world gone Madoff.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE SEDUCTION OF LIGHT,' through March 29. Comparisons may be invidious, but they can also be illuminating. Consider this small, tightly focused exhibition of portraits by the 19th-century American folk artist Ammi Phillips and paintings by the 20th-century Abstract Expressionist Mark Rothko. The presentation reveals parallel ways of dealing with surface, color and light. It also reveals two painters who were, each in his own pragmatic yet metaphysically resonant way, distinctly American artists. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
 ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'ART AND CHINA'S REVOLUTION,' through Jan. 11. The splashy party that was the 2008 Olympics is yesterday's news, but one-party rule in China remains. New China is still, in significant ways, Old China. The obvious question is: What comes next? To help answer it, Asia Society asks a different, equally timely post-Olympics question: What came before? This exhibition of paintings, drawings, posters and Maoist souvenirs produced in the years leading up to and during the Cultural Revolution gives complicated answers. It lays out the conflicted loyalties that have shaped contemporary China, and finds them in the work of artists who anticipated the current art boom and are part of it. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
 * ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'TRACES OF THE CALLIGRAPHER: ISLAMIC CALLIGRAPHY IN PRACTICE, CIRCA 1600-1900,' AND 'WRITING THE WORD OF GOD: CALLIGRAPHY AND THE QUR'AN,' through Feb. 8. These side-by-side exhibitions, perfect in size and carefully thought out, approach Islamic calligraphy from two perspectives. The first show is basically a manual in techniques of fine penmanship and luxury book-making, illustrated by superb examples of tools of the trade and finished products. The second is an array of hand-written Koran pages for total-immersion contemplation. Gorgeous. (See above.) (Cotter)
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,' through Jan. 25. If to you ''street life'' means noise-lights-action, you'll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it, from Robert Frank's unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today's streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GILBERT & GEORGE,' through Jan. 11. Dynamic duo, gruesome twosome or just plain geeks in ties and tweeds, the British artists Gilbert & George don't seem to care what you call them as long as you pay attention, which you couldn't avoid doing if you tried in their suffocating and disordered wraparound survey at the Brooklyn Museum. In no particular sequence, we see the shadowy early black-and-white photographic pieces they did while living in a falling-down section of London in the 1970s, and the huge Pop colored murals filled with flowers and crowds of dishy young men, which decrease in number during the most devastating years of the AIDS epidemic. The newest work in the show, from 2005 and 2006, is crazy, end-of-time stuff. Terrorism and religious fundamentalism are the themes, and Gilbert and George themselves, partners in art as in life, are in the picture, mugging, moralizing, unembarrassed and all but unendurable, in art that's right for right now. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'JESPER JUST: ROMANTIC DELUSIONS,' through Jan. 4. An enchanting show of four short films exhibits most of the qualities for which Mr. Just has become known since completing his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 2003. Melodramatic but never campy or over the top and made with Hollywood-quality production values, his brief musicals explore vulnerable, ordinarily well-armored zones of the masculine psyche, like grief, same-sex love, Oedipal conflict and spiritual desire. The singing is wonderful. (See above.) (Johnson)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HOUSE PROUD: 19TH-CENTURY WATERCOLOR INTERIORS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION,' through Jan. 25. The 70 or so jewel-like renderings of rooms and their furnishings here are delightful, mordantly signifying artifacts. They track the domestic effects of exoticism and nostalgia (chinoiserie, Gothic Revival); uncover glimmers of modernity (Biedermeier, smaller rooms); and witness the birth of the contemporary genre known as shelter porn. Accompanied by relevant examples of furniture, decorative objects and books, they also reveal that rooms seen whole, with light and space as well as decor carefully depicted, are among painting's most appealing subjects. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)
 * FRICK COLLECTION: 'ANDREA RICCIO: RENAISSANCE MASTER OF BRONZE,' through Jan. 18. Scholars say that Andrea Riccio was one of the greatest sculptors of the Italian Renaissance. Cast in dark bronze and resembling Roman antiquities, Riccio's small-scale statuettes, reliefs and oil lamps seem unremarkably modest at first. But let your eyes adjust to the formal subtlety, expressive urgency and almost supernatural aliveness of his art and you will fall in love. Sculpture does not get much better than this. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM:
 'THEANYSPACEWHATEVER,' through Jan. 7. The innately sculptural Guggenheim mounts the first major exhibition in this country about relational aesthetics -- probably the most radical art to emerge in the 1990s -- and comes up looking, well, remarkably empty, which is also extraordinarily beautiful in its own Wright. The more or less interactive works by 10 artists invite you to experience in a new way time, space, the art-viewing world and the museum itself. Even if you never want to see the museum going this far out again, the Guggenheim must be credited for bringing the latest art remarkably intact to a larger public. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CATHERINE OPIE: AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER,' through Jan. 7. Catherine Opie is many artists in one. Best known in the 1990s for her striking portraits of gay, lesbian and transgendered men and women drawn from a circle of friends and intimates, she is also a photographer of landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, still lifes and lifestyles. She is an insider and an outsider: a documentarian and a provocateur, a classicist and a maverick; a trekker and a stay-at-home; a lesbian feminist mother who resists the gay mainstream. It's all here in a fine retrospective. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AMERICA AND THE TINTYPE,' through Jan. 4. This show about the tintype, an early form of photograph made by exposing a lacquered iron plate to light, includes some 200 examples from the museum's collection. Most of the artists, and subjects, are unidentified. These works form a group portrait of Americans, mostly working- and middle-class, struggling to adapt to the rapidly shifting social and economic conditions during the four decades after the Civil War. The exhibition makes the most of the tintype's range of subject matter and emotion, from postmortem shots to vaudevillian caricatures, freedmen to minstrels. It does not dispute the daguerreotype's superior potentials for artistry but simply asserts that tintypes have been unfairly overlooked because of their ubiquity, affordability and anonymity. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'SUSAN MEISELAS: IN HISTORY,' through Jan. 4. A certain moral quandary runs throughout this fascinatingly problematic exhibition: how do you reconcile the demands of professionalism and those of human compassion? To her credit, Ms. Meiselas -- whose coverage of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in 1978-79 made her one of the world's most celebrated and criticized war correspondents -- does not duck the question. Tension between opportunism and conscience emerges as the show's main interest -- to the point that it trumps its ostensible subjects, which include strippers in traveling carnivals and forensic investigations of Saddam Hussein's campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'CHAGALL AND THE ARTISTS OF THE RUSSIAN JEWISH THEATER, 1919-1949,' through March 22. A fascinating tale of two vanguard theater companies that flourished in Moscow for a few years after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 is told by this big, walk-in scrapbook of a show presenting more than 200 pieces of art and ephemera. Exploring the histories of the Hebrew-speaking Habima theater and the Yiddish-speaking Moscow State Yiddish Theater, the exhibition includes drawings, paintings, photographs, posters, sheet music, costumes and clips from vintage films. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART AND LOVE IN RENAISSANCE ITALY,' through Feb. 16. With the most cherished of all human emotions as its central theme, this exhibition examines 14th- and 15th-century marriage rituals in Italy in terms of the many sumptuous objects and artworks they generated. The show includes ceramics, paintings, a cradle, wedding portraits and childbirth trays. Its many images mix happy endings and cautionary tales (some of the most gruesome intended for bridal chambers). Profane love is acknowledged with a choice display of erotica. The commodification and adoration of women run on parallel tracks, right up to and including two majestic paintings by Titian. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE MET: 'BEYOND BABYLON: ART, TRADE, AND DIPLOMACY IN THE SECOND MILLENNIUM B.C.,' through March 15. This big, prescient, concentration-taxing exhibition is the latest in the Met's line of investigative archaeological shows, and it is not geared to quick-take viewing. Many of the objects are small and intimate; made to be worn, handled and easily transported. A proliferation of wall texts gives the show the pace of a lavishly illustrated book. Patient viewing is rewarded by a fascinating story of a proto-global world in formation nearly 4,000 years ago. (See above. (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'CALDER JEWELRY,' through March 1. Concurrent with the Whitney Museum's ''Alexander Calder: The Paris Years,'' this exhibition is the first museum show to focus on that American sculptor's fanciful jewelry. The works in ''Calder Jewelry'' are made of the same materials as his wire sculptures -- mostly brass and steel, with bits of ceramic, wood and glass -- and are just as self-consciously clever. Among the highlights are oversize necklaces with flared and barbed shoulders, pendulous earrings worn by Peggy Guggenheim and the simple spiral of gold wire Calder gave his wife as an engagement ring. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 THE MET: 'THE ESSENTIAL ART OF AFRICAN TEXTILES,' through April 5. This show presents 19th-century African textiles, many lent by the British Museum, alongside relevant contemporary artworks from the Met's collection. One of the most spectacular pairings matches El Anatsui's ''Between Earth and Heaven,'' a recent acquisition, with a kente prestige cloth from Ghana. The Met's 2005 exhibition ''Matisse: The Fabric of Dreams'' hinted that textiles had been undervalued in the Western canon; while the current show may not have the same blockbuster appeal, it goes deeper into the techniques and traditions that make the fabrics so striking and seductive. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 THE MET: 'EARLY BUDDHIST MANUSCRIPT PAINTING: THE PALM-LEAF TRADITION,' through March 22. Practical features like resilience and portability help explain why books written on dried palm leaves were popular with Buddhists in eastern India between the 10th and 13th centuries. But another factor, surely, was the quality of the illustrations that accompanied the texts: exquisite figures of divinities or scenes from the Buddha's life. And few of these are as finely done and pristinely preserved as the examples in this small selection. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'LANDSCAPES CLEAR AND RADIANT: THE ART OF WANG HUI (1632-1717),' through Jan. 4. The Met's first solo show devoted to a Chinese master is gorgeous and revelatory; its focus is the landscape virtuoso Wang Hui, star of the 17th-century Chinese art scene. Wang could do anything and did, synthesizing and transforming disparate strands of almost a millennium of Chinese painting, but also making exact copies of earlier masterpieces. Distinguished by a Mozart-like ease and perfection, his work unsettles Western notions of copy, original and originality. It is aided in this by displays of works by 16 earlier artists dating to the 10th-century -- his mentors, his mentors' mentors and the artists they all revered -- which form a dazzling introduction to Chinese painting in general. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'THE PHILIPPE DE MONTEBELLO YEARS: CURATORS CELEBRATE THREE DECADES OF ACQUISITIONS,' through Feb. 1. As the title implies, the show is a tribute to Mr. de Montebello, who is leaving the Met after being director for more than 30 years. For the occasion, curators in 17 of the museum departments have chosen objects in their fields of expertise from the permanent collection. There are marvelous things here, from Chinese scrolls, Greek vessels and Oceanic effigies to Byzantine icons and an 18th-century American pickle-holder. In short, a wonder-cabinet situation. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DRAWING BABAR: EARLY DRAFTS AND WATERCOLORS,' through Jan. 4. The first and most brilliant Babar book (''The Story of Babar'') gets its own gallery in which Jean de Brunhoff's familiar story is illustrated by his sketches and drafts -- a room bound to fascinate children and the adults who read to them. Another is devoted to the first Babar book by Jean's son, Laurent (''Babar's Cousin''), who first heard about the elephant in the green suit in bedtime stories. In this compact, elegant exhibition, we don't learn a lot about the reasons for Babar's appeal. Speculation is restrained, and simple demonstration preferred, an approach in keeping with Jean's spare, precise narrative and laconic illustration, in which diverging lines of dots become tears; angled eyebrows signal anger; andthe varied curves of an elephant's trunk evoke an inner life. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Edward Rothstein)
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY,' through April 19. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design's jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a loveseat, a view of the ''Mona Lisa,'' a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim's beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'PARIS/NEW YORK: DESIGN FASHION CULTURE, 1925-1940,' through Feb. 22. This compact yet kaleidoscopic exhibition celebrates the romance that flourished between New York and Paris in the 1920s and '30s, when French Art Deco was the style, American jazz was the music, and skyscrapers and sumptuous ocean liners were among the symbols of the age. Selected and installed to extract maximum wattage from every juxtaposition, object and image (including many surprisingly effective digital reproductions), it tracks the exchange of goods as much as of ideas, and the roles played by both department stores and museums, knock-offs and originals, businessmen (especially developers) and designers and artists. Most memorably, it clarifies a golden age of design and building, when New York became the world capital of Art Deco architecture. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'I AM A MAN,' through Jan. 18. The words that make up the title of this strong, timely group show were emblazoned on placards carried by striking black workers in Birmingham, Ala., in 1968. But the show turns the original assertion into a question: what does it mean to be an African-American male today? A smart, Pop-style painting by Fahamu Pecou sends up stereotypes of sexual prowess; a video by Lorenzo Steele Jr. looks at prison life from the inside; Jefferson Pinder casts his sights back to the Civil Rights movement's espousal of passive resistance in a video piece that illustrates that ideal in action. The written statements by each artist are well worth reading. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'JOAN MIRO: PAINTING AND ANTI-PAINTING 1927-1937,' through Jan. 12. When, in 1927, Joan Miro said, ''I want to assassinate painting,'' he wasn't saying anything new. What was new was the way he carried out his self-assigned, cut-throat task. And that process is the subject of this invigorating, absorbing and -- Miro would be mortified -- beautiful show. It illustrates, step by step, how he stalked and attacked painting -- zapped its conventions, messed up its history, spoiled its market value -- through distinctive groups of experimental works produced over a decade. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'LOOKING AT MUSIC,' through Jan. 5. This exhibition of about 40 works from the museum's collection emphasizes the experimental nature of both art and music in the late 1960s and early '70s. The lines dividing art, music and film were blurry enough to allow Laurie Anderson, Bruce Nauman and Yoko Ono, among others, to shift from object making to performance and back again. The show, which includes audio recordings and small-press publications alongside more conventional mediums, is accompanied by an extensive film and video program. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARLENE DUMAS: MEASURING YOUR OWN GRAVE,' through Feb. 16. In this large midcareer survey, this South-African-born, Amsterdam-based artist comes across as a none-too-daring Neo-Expressionist with a feminist outlook. Throughout, shocking subject matter -- murdered women and children, cringing adolescents, bodies in morgues, grotesque newborns -- adds gravity that the works frequently lack. Ms. Dumas's early Conceptual-based work, isolated in a vitrine at the back of the show, indicates a restless young talent. What follows suggests a complacent premature settling on a style that hasn't developed. (See above.) (Smith)MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 2008: JOSEPHINE MECKSEPER AND MIKHAEL SUBOTZKY,' through Jan. 5. Josephine Meckseper, a German-born artist in her 40s who was trained at the California Institute of the Arts, makes sleek-looking installations that mix photography and film -- often scenes of political protest -- with consumer objects. The South African artist Mikhael Subotzky, who at 26 is the youngest photographer to have been invited to join the Magnum Group, explores his country's prison system in vivid color and unflinching detail. If Ms. Meckseper finds glossy, consumerist fantasy infiltrating our political consciousness, Mr. Subotzky reminds us that some people don't yet have the luxury of fretting about the commodification of dissent. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'POUR YOUR BODY OUT (7354 CUBIC METERS),' through Feb. 2. This site-specific installation by the Swiss artist Pipilotti Rist is arguably the first project to humanize -- and feminize -- the atrium. Incorporating high-definition video, music and specially designed furniture, it creates a womblike comfort zone in a building full of right angles. Throughout the installation viewers are confronted with Ms. Rist's signature hyper-femininity. Pink is everywhere, from the flowers in the projections to the curtains that wall off the atrium from the upper galleries. In the video, quick turns from sensuality to disgust, wide-eyed delight to snarling aggression, keep things interesting. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT,' through Jan. 5. This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh's special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs -- including masterpieces like ''The Potato Eaters,'' ''The Starry Night'' and ''Night Cafe'' -- in intimate galleries is thrilling. (See above.) (Smith)
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'GEORGE TOOKER: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through Jan. 4. George Tooker has painted some of the 20th century's most memorable images of angst. With its lost souls haunting the New York underground, ''Subway'' (1950) envisions modernity as a spiritual prison system. The Kafkaesque ''Government Bureau'' (1956) pictures an office of seemingly infinite dimensions, where people wait like penitents at the windows of terminally unresponsive bureaucrats. Both paintings are included in this richly affecting five-decade career retrospective. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Johnson)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'ALFRED KUBIN: DRAWINGS, 1897-1909,' through Jan. 26. You would never guess that the Viennese artist Alfred Kubin was a contemporary of Gustav Klimt; he is closer in spirit to the Belgian James Ensor and the Norwegian Edvard Munch, visionaries who expressed modernity's spiritual toll and anticipated some of the horrors of the 20th century. Executed in black-and-white pen, ink and spray on heavy paper used for cartography, Kubin's drawings map the shadowy corners of the unconscious. Playing to the art's dark themes, the Neue Galerie's third floor has been made over in the sensationally macabre style of a Tim Burton movie. The walls are painted black and brown; red crushed-velvet curtains hang in the doorways; and Kubin's death mask is displayed in a coffinlike glass case. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
 NEW MUSEUM: 'LIVE FOREVER: ELIZABETH PEYTON,' through Jan. 11. This lush midcareer survey pays tribute to an artist whose diminutive, irony-free, boldly colored portraits of friends, artists, rock stars and other historic figures, living and dead, have exerted considerable influence over the last 16 years. The reason is a complex, highly effective fusion of the painterly, the personal and the Conceptual, as well as a kind of reverse appropriation, wherein photographs and snapshots are given a new permanence, substance and most of all feeling by being re-engineered into unique art objects. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'MARY HEILMANN: TO BE SOMEONE,' through Jan. 26. Over the past four decades Ms. Heilmann has been painting with an infectious, unabashedly hedonistic joie de vivre. Working with big brushes and generous quantities of paint, she continues to produce wildly colorful abstractions that riff with irreverent verve on basic elements of Modernist painting: the grid, the monochromatic rectangle, stripes, organic forms, linear webs, spots, checks and drips. This exhilarating retrospective presents works dating from 1967 to the present. (See above.) (Johnson)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through April 13. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: BARKLEY L. HENDRICKS: 'BIRTH OF THE COOL,' through March 15. He did not birth the cool -- that was Miles Davis -- but Mr. Hendricks's suave portraits from the 1960s, '70s and early '80s give him the right to use this title for his five-decade retrospective. Mixing realism, abstraction and Pop, Mr. Hendricks's life-size paintings of beautiful black people in extravagantly fashionable outfits captured a period sensibility with uncanny acuity. Today, with portrait painters like Kehinde Wiley, Elizabeth Peyton and Chuck Close enjoying great popularity, Mr. Hendricks's work is back in style. 144 West 125 Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Johnson)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALEXANDER CALDER: THE PARIS YEARS, 1926-1933,' through Feb. 15. Is art glorified child's play, extending into adulthood, through a lifetime, picking up ideas and gaining finesse as it goes? That's one way to think of this exhibition, which focuses intently on one artist's child-within embodied in toys, cartoons and wire figures, with the Whitney's famous ''Calder's Circus'' as a centerpiece and a grown-up modernist surprise at the end. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WILLIAM EGGLESTON: DEMOCRATIC CAMERA,' through Jan. 25. When William Eggleston's color, snapshot-like photographs of his home territory in the American South were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in 1976, critics squawked that the work was vulgar and haphazard. But these pictures quickly became influential classics. And that's how they look in this 40-year retrospective at the Whitney, the artist's first New York museum solo since his seditious debut. The show includes a recently edited version of Mr. Eggleston's cruel, unusual and ultimately revolting video epic ''Stranded in Canton.'' (See above.) (Cotter)
 Galleries: Uptown
 'FRANKENTHALER AT EIGHTY: SIX DECADES'Helen Frankenthaler's longtime gallery is throwing her an 80th-birthday party. With nine large-scale works from the artist's personal collection, covering more than five decades, the show takes the form of a mini-retrospective. (A more substantial museum survey is long overdue.) The earliest work is ''Western Dream,'' a maelstrom of lavender-and-coral stains on unprimed canvas; the newest is ''Warming Trend,'' a near-monochrome field of indigo with fiery undertones. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Jan. 10. (Rosenberg)
 'NEIL JENNEY: NEW PAINTINGS' With the works in this beautiful show, his first exhibition of new paintings in New York since 1998, Neil Jenney continues to create idiosyncratic, magic realist landscapes with heavy black frames. Most surprising are two paintings of luminous blue skies with puffy, animal-shaped clouds in them and the word ''Atmosphere'' neatly lettered on each frame. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, bmathesgallery.com, through Jan. 24. (Johnson)
 Galleries: SoHo
 CHARLOTTE POSENENSKE: 'PROTOTYPES FOR MASS PRODUCTION (1965-1967)' The works in this exhibition -- simple geometric forms made of folded sheet metal and painted in black and primary-colored enamels -- were intended to be mass-produced, sold at cost and displayed in public. Ms. Posenenske quit making art in 1968 when she concluded that it could not make enough of a political difference in the world, but her sculptures still have a bright, Pop Art-like punch. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through Jan. 10. (Johnson)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 AL HELD An awesome blast of light, color, space and geometry awaits visitors to this exhibition of six paintings dating from 1979 to 1985 by Mr. Held (1928-2005). Rendered in richly saturated and incandescent colors, these expansive, hard-edged pictures of grids, boxes, wheels and serpentine loops, interpenetrating and receding into infinite, Euclidean distances, are like visions of a Neo-Platonist on acid. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com, through Jan. 10. (Johnson)
 Out of Town
 MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, BOSTON: 'RACHEL WHITEREAD: PLACE (VILLAGE),' through Jan. 25. This exhibition, the centerpiece of the museum's mini-survey devoted to the British sculptor Rachel Whiteread, may strike the artist's admirers as a bizarre and kitschy departure. Viewers who have never seen one of her room-size casts won't really get a sense of her work from this installation, which is making its United States debut. Still, the show, which includes drawings and a few smaller sculptures, reveals the more emotive side of an artist who can come off as somber and humorless. 465 Huntington Avenue, (617) 267-9300, mfa.org. (Rosenberg)
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'JAN LIEVENS: A DUTCH MASTER REDISCOVERED,' through Jan. 11. Although not a household name now, Jan Lievens once was famous throughout Northern Europe for his portraits and his religious and history paintings. A child prodigy, he was a friend and colleague of Rembrandt's. Early in their careers, the two painters worked closely together, and many of Lievens's paintings later were misattributed to Rembrandt. Lievens was not Rembrandt's equal, but he had his moments, especially in remarkably precocious paintings that he made as a teenager. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'POMPEII AND THE ROMAN VILLA: ART AND CULTURE AROUND THE BAY OF NAPLES,' through March 22. This show about the opulent lifestyle of the Roman elite before the A.D. 79 eruption of Vesuvius includes recent discoveries on view in the United States for the first time, as well as finds from excavations dating to the mid-18th century. The galleries unfold according to the floor plan of a typical villa, and the installation -- which includes decorative columns, wall borders, living plants and reproductions of mosaics -- works hard to maintain the illusion of classical architecture. The exhibition moves from artifacts reflecting ancient Romans' infatuationwith Greek culture to the rediscovery of Pompeii by 18th-century Europeans, suggesting that every culture finds affirmation of its taste and sophistication in a previous golden age. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Rosenberg)
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'SUN, WIND AND RAIN: THE ART OF DAVID COX,' through Jan. 4. Watercolor was all the rage in early-19th-century England, and one of its most admired practitioners is the subject of this expansive, engaging show. Cox had a particular knack for picturing windy days, and the liveliness of his scenes is reflected in his vigorously realist style. Many of his most affecting pictures show ordinary travelers making their ways toward distant, unseen goals within the picture. Life is a journey. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, (877) 274-8278, yale.edu/ycba. (Johnson)
 Last Chance
 JOSH AGLE: 'VOYEUR: NEW WORKS BY SHAG' Using wide panels in neon-candy colors and a style simulating semi-abstract cartoons of the early 1960s, Mr. Agle, who signs his works ''Shag,'' paints funny, curiously touching suburban pastorals. Modern, mostly glass houses are nestled in bucolic landscapes; suave men in tuxedos and beautiful women in evening dresses and bikinis pose indoors and out in states of perfect composure. These are canny meditations on visual, erotic and consumerist desire. Jonathan LeVine Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-3822, jonathanlevinegallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 ERNST CARAMELLE: 'DOUBLE VISION' Mr. Caramelle partly covers sheets of ordinary colored construction paper with straight-edged pieces of paper, bleaches them in the sun and then removes the masking elements. The resulting geometric compositions have a beguiling luminosity. Tracy Williams Ltd., 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212) 229-2757, tracywilliamsltd.com; closes on Tuesday. (Johnson)
 STAN DOUGLAS: 'HUMOR, IRONY AND THE LAW' This show's main attraction, an almost entirely silent film called ''Video,'' combines ponderous academicism and cinematic intrigue. It follows a young woman caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare in which she is harassed by men in trench coats, put on trial, abducted and forced into a final, desperate act. David Zwirner, 533 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com; closes on Tuesday. (Johnson)
 BARNABY FURNAS: 'CLOSED LOOP' With much philosophical, formal and technical panache, Mr. Furnas continues to explore the metaphorical potentials of semi-abstract painting. This exhibition includes Cubist Civil War battle scenes; all-black, post-apocalyptic Color Field paintings with holes representing the burnt-out sun; and psychedelic-rococo pictures of rock groups performing on densely patterned, Victorian-era stages. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9889, marianneboeskygallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 CHARLES GAINES: 'MANIFESTOS' The politically charged texts scrolling up flat-screen monitors in this poetically resonant and conceptually intriguing exhibition are manifestos from movements like the Black Panthers and the Zapatistas. The minor-key music that accompanies them -- composed using a John Cage-like system of chance and played by a piano quintet -- is beautiful and soothing. Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 627-3680, kentgallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 NASREEN MOHAMEDI: 'THE GRID, UNPLUGGED' This show of abstract drawings is the third New York solo of work by the Indian artist Nasreen Mohamedi (1937-1990), and the most beautiful yet, which means it's as about as beautiful as gallery shows get. Born to a Muslim family, Mohamedi studied art in London and Paris and was fully conversant with contemporary art in the West. Her major influences, though, were Islamic architecture, the modern urban landscape and fellow South Asian artists working in abstract, linear styles. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)
 IRVING NORMAN: 'A SELECTION OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS' The ambitious, mordantly satiric, social-surrealist paintings by this little-known San Francisco-area artist, who died in 1989, envision modernity as a labyrinthine nightmare. Painted with a neat, illustrative touch, they project cartoonish allegories of awesome complexity in which ordinary people are regimented in factories, warehoused in towering prisons and stored in endless phalanxes of hospital beds, while evil capitalists and fascist dictators pictured as overblown grotesques control the machinery of power. Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, michaelrosenfeldart.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 CINDY SHERMAN After years of vamping behind caricatures or actual masks, Ms. Sherman gets closer to her own skin and to actual photography than she has since the beginning of her career. The convention under scrutiny is the social portrait: women of some sort of stature. Aging, delusion and pretension are touched on, but they are usually superseded by an aura of determination, discipline and pride -- in other words, parts of the engine that has driven Ms. Sherman's own relentless career. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com; closes on Tuesday. (Smith)
 RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA: 'J G READS, A FILM BY RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA' This founder of relational aesthetics and one of the more influential artists of the last 15 years tops his best. The installation is ostensibly a spoken word retrospective: a 10-reel film of the venerable New York poet John Giorno standing in his Bowery loft reading his work. A kind of human version of Warhol's ''Empire.'' It is projected nonstop on the wall of a full-size mock-up of that loft. The mise-en-scene, along with the hard-living, autobiographical nature of the poems and the poet's heroic vulnerability, fit perfectly both the radical principle of Mr. Tiravanija's work and our own times: art does not just come from life, it is life. As usual, our participation is invited. Gavin Brown's Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, gavinbrown.biz; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 KEHINDE WILEY: 'DOWN' Mr. Wiley is known for paintings of young African-American men dressed in fashionable street wear posing against richly patterned backgrounds like heroic figures in Renaissance paintings. This exhibition presents eight enormous paintings of young men in reclining positions. The biggest, called ''Sleep,'' which measures 11 by 25 feet, depicts a muscular man lying back like the dead Jesus, naked but for a snowy white cloth swaddling his hips. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 JONAS WOOD The second New York gallery show of this Los Angeles painter provides further thoughts on how to paint from photographs without following the herd. Incisive color, a geometry-prone feel for shape and composition, a wry humor where art and sports are concerned contribute. Essentially Mr. Wood means everything he does, with the sincerity that is basic to originality. The resulting paintings are smartly and luxuriously visual. Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 367-9663, antonkerngallery.com; closes on Tuesday. (Smith)
 'ZERO IN NEW YORK' This gorgeous museumlike exhibition displays works by members of the Zero Group, a loose association of '60s-era European avant-gardists. It features works dating from 1957 to 1966 by about 20 artists, including Piero Manzoni, Arman, Yves Klein and Jean Tinguely. Founded in the late 1950s by two Germans, Heinz Mack and Otto Piene, the Zero Group rejected personal expressionism in favor of radically new forms of abstraction. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)

HEADLINE: The Community Reinvestment Act Is Not the Villain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Housing Goals We Can't Afford'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 11):
 Howard Husock attacks the Community Reinvestment Act in an attempt to deflect blame for the economic meltdown from the real culprits -- predatory lenders and the government that did not regulate them. 
 According to extensive documentation, including reports by government agencies, most of the high-cost, subprime loans were originated by independent mortgage and finance companies, lenders not covered by the C.R.A. 
 Banks that make below-market mortgage loans under C.R.A. agreements lend only to qualified homebuyers who have successfully completed homeownership and credit counseling classes and whose incomes have been verified. These are some of the safest loans for banks because of the C.R.A. requirements and because advocacy groups monitor their performance.
 The worst offenders, the independent mortgage companies, were never subject to C.R.A. or any federal regulator. 
 Paige Carlson Heim Managing Director Housing and Community Development Network of N.J. Trenton, Dec. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 In attempting to lay the blame for much of the subprime crisis on affordable housing and the Community Reinvestment Act, Howard Husock takes the novel position that the current crisis is a result not of too little regulation, but of too much.
 Does Mr. Husock remember what our city looked like before the Community Reinvestment Act was passed in 1977 to combat redlining, the practice by which banks would take deposits from low-income and minority communities but not make loans there? The successful rebirth of the South Bronx and other New York City neighborhoods would not have occurred without C.R.A.
 To suggest a connection between the act and our current emergency is to rewrite recent history. Most of the subprime loans now in foreclosure were made by mortgage brokerage firms, which are not subject to C.R.A. 
 How, after the law has been in successful operation for three decades, can it suddenly become the cause for today's crisis?
 Bernie Carr Executive Director, New York State Association for Affordable Housing Bronx, Dec. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 If the ''housing goals we can't afford'' have to do with providing housing for people with low incomes who are not creditworthy in the private market, Howard Husock really leaves us three choices: 
 First, do nothing for them, and leave them to the vicissitudes of an unregulated housing market. This will lead to vastly greater hardship because of the initial and long-term expense of housing as a good. 
 Second, vastly expand the supply of rental housing and simply do not make mortgages to the poor. This is a problem, because housing that is affordable to poor folks is generally not a good money-making proposition if it is maintained well. Banks shouldn't make mortgages to these landlords, either. 
 Finally, we could decommodify housing for the poor and for wider swaths of the population so that it is not bought and sold, but collectively owned and made a public trust. 
 This might work, but it would mean that antiregulatory, right-wing and market-fundamentalist groups would have to recognize that markets are the problem here, and not the solution.

HEADLINE: Rules Aim to Protect Credit Card Users

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal regulators on Thursday adopted sweeping new rules for the credit card industry that will shield consumers from increases in interest rates on existing account balances, among other changes.
 The rules, which take effect in July 2010, will allow credit card companies to raise interest rates only on new credit cards and future purchases or advances, rather than on current balances. 
 The rules were approved by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration. 
 The changes are the most sweeping clampdown on the credit card industry in decades and are aimed at protecting consumers from arbitrary increase in interest rates or inadequate time provided to pay the bills.
 Most of the rules were proposed in May and drew more than 65,000 public comments, the highest number ever received by the Fed. They also restrict such lender practices as allocating all payments to balances with lower interest rates when a borrower has balances with various rates.
 But the changes also could make it more difficult for millions of people with bad credit to get what is known as a subprime card carrying higher interest rates, some experts say.
 In addition, consumers will have to be given 45 days' notice before any changes are made to the terms of an account, including a higher penalty rate for missing payments or paying bills late. Under current rules, companies in most cases give 15 days' notice before making certain changes to the terms of an account.
 The changes could cost the banking industry more than $10 billion a year in interest payments, according to a study by the law firm Morrison & Foerster.
 ''While the new rules are designed to increase protections for consumers, the Fed itself has recognized that they may result in increased costs for most card users and reduced credit availability, particularly for consumers with lower credit scores or limited credit history,'' Edward L. Yingling, chief executive of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement. 
 ''With the uncertainty facing our financial system,'' he said, ''it's absolutely vital for policy makers to understand the full impact of these regulations on consumers and the economy before judging their success or further restricting the marketplace.''

HEADLINE: A Walk in the Park

BYLINE: By CINDY PRICE

 BODY:
ON a cold, damp Friday afternoon in early December, the crowd pouring into Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., was in complete agreement: it was unseasonably cold for this time of year. 
 It was not so cold that you couldn't bundle up the family and walk around the 150-acre park, which was spectacularly decked out for its annual Smoky Mountain Christmas event and filled with the comforting hum of Christmas music. But it was cold enough to temporarily shut down the park's three big roller coasters. And for a couple of itchy teenagers grumbling in the last car of Blazing Fury -- an antique indoor coaster with a couple of mild drops -- Dollywood was coming up short on Christmas miracles. 
 Call it the grade schooler's revenge. Because as evening fell and the park filled up with hundreds of children on the right side of 10, it became clear that the holiday festivals that have cropped up at theme parks like Dollywood across the country probably aren't meant to court thrill-seeking teenagers, who seemingly have the run of the parks in summer. Rather, they seem aimed at everyone else: packs of young parents quietly pushing strollers, babysitting grandparents huddled in cafes sipping coffee, nostalgic couples walking hand in hand, soaking in the flickering lights and charitable mood. 
 And lots -- lots -- of little boys and girls like Ellie Johnson, a blond, bespectacled 5-year-old. 
 ''I like the Polar Express!'' she shouted to her parents, Kevin and Jeny, extracting a wry, knowing smile out of her older sister, Cara. She was referring to the Polar Express 4-D Experience, a multisensory ride that shows a short version of the popular Christmas movie in 3-D, while moving seats rock riders back and forth and smells of hot cocoa fill the theater. 
 There are plenty of real warm drinks (including a wickedly sweet caramel cider) to wrap your hands around as you walk through the festival. Dollywood began the event 18 years ago, and it has since expanded to include four million lights, a 100-foot-tall Christmas tree light show, a lineup of musicals, a real coal-fired train that does a mile-plus loop through the park, and over 40 rides and attractions (including, when the weather holds out, Thunderhead, which is currently one of the top-rated wooden coasters in the world). 
 As the temperature dipped, people headed for Santa's Workshop, an arts-and-crafts area where packs of adults warmed their hands around space heaters and browsed funny T-shirts (''Don't blame me. I voted for Santa.''). 
 The children were free to tear around the enclosed 500-square-foot area and play with jumbo-sized toys. But one 8-year-old, Savannah Ledford, stood alone, quietly but fastidiously penning her letter to Santa. 
 ''I want a computer game called Spore, and a Lego Castle play set,'' she said, pursing her lips, then adding, ''and a computer.'' 
 ''We had horses and ponies when I was younger,'' her grandmother, Carolyn Ledford, added with a shrug. ''But I guess they're a lot of trouble.''
 For all the attractions directed at kids, the event also draws couples without young children. For one young couple from Nashville, Stephen and Susan Curtis, the attractions are the light displays and Christian-themed shows.
 For Jack and Debbie Williams, a couple in their 50s who regularly drive down from Maryland, the park holds a special place in their shared history. When they were young, Dollywood was a small tourist stop called Rebel Railroad. (It would change hands, and names, a few times before its current incarnation as Dollywood.)
 ''His parents brought him here when he was young because they knew the owners,'' Ms. Williams said, pointing to her husband, ''and my father brought us here because he was thinking about buying it from those same owners.'' 
 They didn't discover the Dollywood coincidence until years later, after they met in the Air Force and married. If everything goes as planned, the Williamses will move back to the Smoky Mountain area in the next few years.
 When Dollywood opened in 1986, it was originally billed as a show park, and those roots are still evident in the heavy holiday lineup of stage shows. One of the sharpest is ''Dollywood's Babes in Toyland,'' which showcases an impressive five-man acrobatic team, two talented young leads, and a spectacular grand finale.
 Gabriel Myers, who plays the father, sat with some of his fellow castmates after the show, and talked about how it felt to do this year's show as opposed to past ones. 
 ''With the economic situation the way it is,'' he said, taking a minute to choose his words, ''everybody's a little tense, a little worried and a little scared. So any kind of entertainment where you can help them get away from that for a second, and just feel the warmth of the holidays instead of all the coldness that's going on right now -- including the weather -- it's a good feeling for us.''
 The festival is open through Jan. 3, though it is closed on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve; admission is $51.30, and $40.15 for kids under 12. Tickets can be bought at www.dollywood.com, or (800) 365-5996.
 Dollywood is not the only park in the holiday spirit. A number of parks are putting on impressive festivals this year, each with different attractions. But be it frozen water parks, coasters or chocolate, it all involves family. Call or check Web sites for exact operating hours during Christmas week, since most are closed on Christmas itself.
 Hersheypark
 Hersheypark in Hershey, Pa., is celebrating its 25th anniversary of Hersheypark Christmas Candylane. This holiday village has over 30 rides, live entertainment and a two-million-bulb light display. Many of the rides are child-oriented, and with an admission fee of $9.95, it's easy to bring a whole brood.
 Richard Wright, who grew up in nearby Middletown, Pa., remembers treating Hersheypark like a second playground when he was a child (he even devoted his only free summer in college to working there), and now brings his two sons, Jackson, 5, and Conner, 3, every holiday. 
 ''My friends and I could be at the park in 10 minutes,'' he said. ''We just had to convince one parent to take us, and another to pick us up. It was a nice system.''
 ''It never occurred to me until now, now that I have children of my own, why my parents never blinked an eye when we asked to go,'' he added. ''It's great to have a place where you know your children will have fun without worrying about their safety.''
 Those looking to stay warm can head for Hershey Sweet Lights, the park's animated holiday drive-thru exhibit, which includes almost 600 shimmering displays and music that you can tune in on your car radio. 
 Nearby, Hershey Gardens is decorated with holly and viburnum berries, evergreens and a Christmas tree walk featuring ornaments from all 50 states.
 (Through Dec. 31; 717-534-3900; www.christmasinhershey.com; entry $9.95.)
 Universal Orlando
 Though Disney World is known for pulling out all the stops at Christmas, those looking for an edgier coaster scene might want to check out Universal Studios' sister park, Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Fla. The park has been cultivating an alternative audience in recent years with holiday ticket packages, relatively quick lines and the popular Grinchmas -- a stage show with a score arranged by Mannheim Steamroller.
 ''When they first opened Seuss Landing in 1999, I fell in love,'' said Chris Kraftchick, an Orlando native who represents the Florida Region of American Coaster Enthusiasts. ''The icing on the cake was Grinchmas -- to have these characters walking around talking to people and tellingthe stories. They hit a grand slam.''
 The year they opened the festival, he read the book to his children, Joshua, 8, and Madeline, 12, before they went. When they got to the park, Joshua gasped: ''There's the guy who stole Christmas.'' 
 (Guests-in-the-know can even have breakfast with the book's characters; $19.95 and $13.95 for ages 3 to 9; call 407-224-4012 for reservations.)
 Adrenaline freaks can also take advantage of the warm weather to hit the park's impressive coaster lineup. Next door at Universal Studios, floats from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade have been shipped in for a daily parade, which also includes marching bands and a high-kick line. Guests can volunteer to be balloon handlers by signing up between the Jimmy Neutron ride and the Universal Studios Store.
 (Through Jan. 1; 407-224-4233; www.universalorlando.com/holidays; a one-day, two-park ticket is $89.99 at the gate, $79.99 for ages 3 to 9.)
 Silver Dollar City
 When Pete Herschend and his brother Jack (whose family founded Silver Dollar City in Branson, Mo., in 1960) started their Old Time Christmas back in 1988, it was on a lark.
 ''We called it the 12 Days of Christmas, and honestly we weren't at all sure anyone would show up,'' Pete Herschend said. ''But we thought it sounded good, and we knew it could be good. And lo and behold, a lot of them showed up. There are some families who started coming in 1988 and they have been back every year.''
 One recent visitor was Noel Perkin, a Springfield, Mo., native who visited the park as a little girl, worked there in the '80s, and now takes her 6-year-old son, Drew, every Christmas. ''It was magical then and it's magical now,'' she said.
 This year's 20th-anniversary celebration includes more than four million lights spread across the park's 40 acres, a handful of Christian-themed shows, a Frosty the Snowman musical, a steam train, a five-story special effects-laden Christmas tree and -- when the weather holds out -- a few impressive roller coasters from which one can soak in all those lights. 
 This season also marks the premiere of the park's culinary school, where guests can make cookies, pies and holiday stews. 
 (Through Dec. 30; 800-831-4386; www.bransonsilverdollarcity.com; $49 and $39 for ages 4 to 11.)
 Schlitterbahn Waterpark Resort
 If Texas suffers a freak snowstorm this winter, let's hope the elements fall into place as neatly as they do at Schlitterbahn's new holiday celebration, Hill Country Christmas. The 65-acre water park in New Braunfels kicked off the event on Nov. 28, blanketing its North Pole area with 25 gallons of fake snow every four hours, and putting a gigantic ice skating rink in the Lagoon pool.
 ''Who better to go to for snow and ice than the water park experts?'' said Scott Connor, who, along with a friend, drove three hours from Grand Prairie, Tex., to meet 55 fellow American Coaster Enthusiasts on opening weekend. ''Now, normally I don't do water parks. But I always do Schlitterbahn.'' 
 Visitors can race a toboggan down a giant hill, run through an illuminated light tunnel called Candy Cane Lane, chat up Santa (until Dec. 23, after which one might assume he's booked elsewhere), or catch a smattering of live holiday shows, carolers, bands and street performers. 
 And for the adult in need of a little time out from the holiday rush, there's an outdoor hot tub called the Winter Wassail Hot Tub -- with beer and wine available.
 (Through Jan. 4; 830-625-2351; www.schlitterbahnchristmas.com; $14.99 and $12.99 for ages 3 to 11 and over 55.)

 BODY:
Determining accurate prices for art going on the auction block is particularly tricky these days as experts struggle to figure out the right numbers, making sure they are neither so artificially low they don't represent the best interest of the seller nor optimistically so high they scare off bidders. 
 George Wachter, a co-head of Sotheby's old-master paintings department worldwide, faced this challenge in September when he was asked to sell a pair of 1637 portraits by the Dutch artist Frans Hals at the Jan. 29 sale in New York. He held off agreeing on an estimate with the owner until he saw the results of the old-master auctions in London in November and could better gauge what the euro-dollar exchange rate would be. 
 The paintings, ''Portrait of a Man Holding a Pair of Gloves'' and ''Portrait of a Woman Holding a Handkerchief,'' depict a 37-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman, according to information Hals inscribed on the front of each painting. Although scholars do not know who the subjects are, their dress suggests they were a prosperous Dutch merchant and his wife. 
 ''Hals is a great artist to start with,'' Mr. Wachter said. ''Manet and Delacroix, along with other masters, were very influenced by him, and he was resurrected as an important master in the mid-19th century.'' What made him particularly important, Mr. Wachter said, was his ''ability to convey so much about the personalities of the sitters.'' 
 He placed firm estimates on the paintings only this month, just before sending the sale catalog to the printer: $8 million to $12 million for the male portrait, and $7 million to $9 million for the female. He based the numbers on recent Hals prices -- for example the $9.5 million paid at Sotheby's in London in 2007 for ''Portrait of Samuel Ampzing,'' from 1663 -- and on the knowledge that great works by important masters are becoming harder to find. 
 Anyone who viewed the Impressionist, Modern or contemporary art auctions last month would have seen the Hals portraits hanging in Sotheby's 10th-floor galleries. (They have also been on view at the auction house's galleries in London and Paris.) But until now their labels have read, ''estimate on request.'' 
 The paintings have a distinguished history. During most of the 19th century they belonged to the family of Count de Thiennes, Belgian aristocrats who lived in the Castle of Rumbeke, one of the oldest Renaissance castles in Belgium. In the 20th century they were owned by William van Horne, a Montreal collector, and his daughter, Adaline van Horne, and later J. William Middendorf II, a former American ambassador to the Organization of American States. Although Sotheby's officials declined to identify the current owner, old-master experts said he was Eric Albada, a collector who lives in Belgium. 
 GOOD NEWS AMID GLOOM
 While most museums are suffering from shrinking endowments and fewer donations because of the economic crisis, the Phillips Collection in Washington announced on Thursday that it had received gifts totaling $23.5 million to shore up its endowment. 
 ''Our endowment is about 10 percent of that of our peer institutions,'' said George Vradenburg, chairman of the Phillips, which focuses on modern art. Before the stock market plummeted in the fall, the Phillips endowment was around $18 million. It then sunk to about $14.5 million. The $23.5 million will bring the endowment to nearly $38 million, inching it closer to the museum's goal of $50 million by 2010. 
 The Sherman Fairchild Foundation, with headquarters in Chevy Chase, Md., has given the Phillips $10 million. And an additional $8 million has come from an anonymous board member. Four other trustees have each pledged $1 million and have challenged the rest of the board to match their donations. (So far one has contributed $1 million and another $500,000.)
 PARTNERSHIP FOR DAHESH
 More than a year ago the Dahesh Museum of Art moved out of its three floors at 580 Madison Avenue, at 57th Street, now occupied by Bonhams, the British auction house. 
 While the museum is homeless and seeking a new space in Manhattan, it has formed a partnership with Syracuse University to organize several exhibitions a year from its collection of 19th-century art and from the university's diverse collection of more than 45,000 artworks and objects dating from around the 15th through the 20th centuries. The institutions will present shows at the Syracuse University Art Galleries on campus and at the university's Palitz Gallery/Lubin House, at 11 East 61st Street in Manhattan. 
 ''It's mutually beneficial,'' said Domenic Iacono, director of the Syracuse University Art Galleries. ''It helps us expand our programming.''
 The arrangement, which is initially for two years, begins on March 24 when ''In Pursuit of the Exotic: Artists Abroad in 19th-Century Egypt and the Holy Land'' opens at Lubin House (remaining on view through April 30). In Syracuse the Dahesh will present ''Napoleon on the Nile: Soldiers, Artists and the Rediscovery of Egypt,'' from Jan. 29 through March 29. 
 ''It's a trial marriage,'' said Flora E. S. Kaplan, director of the Dahesh, who added that when she was looking for space before leaving Madison Avenue she happened on a $20 million garage where ''you would be nervous about leaving your car.'' But she is continuing to search for a new home, she said, hoping that now there will be more affordable options available. ''We need to take a breath,'' she said. ''Now we don't have to rush into anything.'' 
 NEW IN CITY HALL PARK
 For 30 years the Public Art Fund has organized sculpture exhibitions in City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan. Most have been easy on the eye, like Alexander Calder's monumental steel stabiles or Roy Lichtenstein's colorful Pop confections.
 But on Wednesday night when a team of riggers began installing the latest show there -- sculptures by the New York artist Robert Melee -- the art seemed to have a slightly darker edge than usual. Four amorphous, featureless figures ranging from nearly 10 feet to 12 1/2 feet tall are posed as though they are lurking among the trees. More curious still are the surfaces of these odd creatures: the result of a marbleizing technique that used dripping and splattered paint in vibrant shades, the surfaces almost resemble melted wax. 
 ''This is a younger artist playing off the monumental and the figurative,'' said Rochelle Steiner, director of the Public Art Fund. ''On the one hand they are quite human; on the other their enormous scale makes them also seem daunting.'' 
 Ms. Steiner said that she saw two of the sculptures in Regent's Park during the fall Frieze Art Fair in London. The other two were just completed. ''They were fabricated in Portugal,'' she said. 
 Mr. Melee, 41, is known for expressing often perverse views of the human psyche in his work, particularly in videos of his eccentric and inebriated mother.
 The sculptures will be on view in City Hall Park through the end of April.

HEADLINE: Economic Indicator Drops the Most Since '91

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A private research group's measure of the economy's health fell again in November and its six-month rate of decline hit the worst level since 1991. 
 The Conference Board, based in New York, said Thursday that its index of leading economic indicators fell for the second consecutive month, dropping 0.4 percent in November. That was slightly better than the 0.5 percent decline economists surveyed by ThomsonReuters had expected.
 The index is intended to forecast economic activity in the next three to six months based on 10 economic components, including stock prices, building permits and initial claims for unemployment benefits.
 Based on revised numbers, the index has decreased 2.8 percent in the six months through November, the worst drop since 1991, when the economy was in a recession.
 Drops in building permits and share prices, and increases in unemployment claims, led the index lower. 
 The Labor Department reported on Thursday that new applications for jobless benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 554,000 last week, from an upwardly revised figure of 575,000 the previous week. Still, the four-week moving average, which smooths out fluctuations, increased to 543,750 claims, the highest since December 1982. The labor force has grown by about half since then.
 Without increases to the money supply from federal bailouts, the leading indicators' reading would have been far worse. The recession that officially began in December 2007 continues to ravage businesses in almost every sector.

Rockets Over Gaza Signal An Expired Mideast Truce
 Rockets are flying over Gaza again. The six-month truce that Israel and Hamas, the militant Palestinian leaders of Gaza, agreed to on June 19 is over.

 Stop Rolling in Louisiana
 It wasn't just the Middle East swimming in profits from high oil prices, it was also Louisiana, a poor state with an uncommonly rich supply of natural resources. Legislative tax cuts have turned into budgetary shortfalls and hiring freezes as the bill comes due. PAGE A29
 HEALTH PROPOSAL COSTS FAULTED
 The Congressional Budget Office, after analyzing 115 proposals related to health care, said that many of the ones championed by President-elect Barack Obama and other Democrats would cost a lot and save little. But it did suggest that Congress should take some kind of action. PAGE A29
 A RARE DEATH SENTENCE
 A jury in Manchester, N.H., returned a death sentence for a man convicted last month of killing a police officer, the first capital sentence in the state in 49 years. There has not been an execution in the state since 1939. PAGE A29
 PLAN WOULD OPEN TRAILS TO BIKERS
 The Interior Department wants to open thousands of miles of trails in national parks to mountain bikers. The proposal pits two constituencies already scarcely on speaking terms: bikers and hikers. The Obama administration is likely to decide it. PAGE A30 
 SCRATCHING FOR A DEFENSE
 Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, barred by the state attorney general from using state money to pay for his impeachment defense, will ask a judge to allow him to use campaign funds to defend himself against federal corruption charges. PAGE A30 
 RACIST E-MAIL IN ALASKA
 About 10 Alaska state employees apparently forwarded or otherwise had dealings with racist e-mail messages about President-elect Barack Obama. A spokesman for Gov. Sarah Palin said the employees did not work in the governor's office, that she disapproved, and that she should not be held responsible for all 20,000 state employees. PAGE A31 
 INQUIRY INTO NEW MEXICO CONTRACTS
 A federal grand jury is looking into accusations that the administration of Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico played financial favorites with a California financier who had contributed heavily to the governor's political action committees. A spokesman for the financier says there are no dots to be connected, but questions about the contracts may be raised in confirmation hearings for Mr. Richardson as commerce secretary. PAGE A33

 MODEST CARDINAL RECEIVES
 A Farewell With Majesty
 The ''triumphant life story'' of the only American theologian ever appointed to the College of Cardinals was celebrated at a high Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. More than 150 church dignitaries, including six cardinals, were in attendance at the funeral of Cardinal Avery Dulles, the son of diplomats and Presbyterians. PAGE A35
 JOB LOSSES CUT ACROSS STRENGTHS
 In November, hotels, restaurants and theaters are usually hiring for the holiday season, helping make what is known as the leisure and hospitality industry one of the city's strongest economic sectors. But this November showed a loss of jobs in that category for the first time since the data has been collected. PAGE A37

 COLUMBIA U. EXPANSION APPROVED
 State officials voted to allow Columbia University to expand its campus into Manhattanville, which opens the door for the use of eminent domain to acquire land from holdout owners. A lawyer for one of the landowners said the vote, by the board of directors of the Empire State Development Corporation, would be challenged in court. PAGE A40
 SPORTS
 PATERNO MOVING SLOWLY, 
 But Surely, Into Future
 He turns 82 on Sunday, has had leg and hip problems, and there have been times when his players made more news off the field than on. But Coach Joe Paterno just signed a contract that could keep him coaching at Penn State until he's 85. That's what an 11-1 record and a shared Big Ten title can do for job security. Well, that and a long history of success. PAGE B13
 GIANTS' LINE LOOKS TO REBOUND
 There is blame to go around, Coach Tom Coughlin said, but when a team gives up eight quarterback sacks -- as the Giants did against the Cowboys in a 20-8 loss Sunday -- attention tends to focus on the play of the offensive line. Avoiding a repeat against Carolina this Sunday is the plan, offensive tackle David Diehl says. PAGE B15
 THE N.B.A.'S EMPTY SEATS
 The official version is that the N.B.A. is not worried about the fate of any of its teams. The official version is also that attendance this year is basically the same as last year, with some teams showing notable improvements. But attendance figures are based on tickets sold. And the blog-o-fear is that there aren't that many people passing through the turnstiles. PAGE B16 
 BUSINESS
 IN THE MIDDLE,
 In a Scandal
 Eric Swanson worked for the Securities and Exchange Commission before becoming romantically involved with -- and later marrying -- Shana D. Madoff. She is the niece of Bernard L. Madoff, the central figure in the current multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, giving Mr. Swanson new roots in one side of the matter and old ties to the other. And he is being attacked for both.

 REDSTONE FEUD LIVES
 It looked as if the feuding father-daughter Redstones were united in October when he -- Sumner M. -- was forced to sell more than $200 million of stock to satisfy the terms of a big bank loan. But she -- Shari E. -- was recently the sole vote against the plan backed by him that has been presented to lenders as an offering to renegotiate some $800 million in debt. PAGE B1

 TV SALES FLAT
 Sales of TVs, long considered recession-proof, are expected to drop in the United States next year. Flat-panel models are losing momentum, so production is being cranked back and prices are expected to remain stable for smaller models and not fall as fast for larger ones. PAGE B3 
 SEEING GOOD IN A DECLINE
 Oracle's net income declined 1 percent to $1.3 billion, or 25 cents a share, during its second quarter, ended Nov. 30. But company officials feel good about the results: discounting the impact of a strengthening dollar during the period, revenues grew 12 percent. PAGE B3
 OBAMA PITCHES MENTORING
 Barack Obama is making like the last Democratic president-elect in at least one respect: he will appear in a public service campaign before the inauguration. The message is to promote becoming a mentor to a child. In 1992, Bill Clinton filmed a commercial encouraging drinkers to have a designated driver. PAGE B5

 IN ANOTHER TRIUMPH OVER EVIL,
 The Soup Is the Catalyst
 If soup can be the answer, it stands to reason that it can also be the problem. In this the case the problems are big, but not insurmountable -- this is family entertainment after all, Manohla Dargis writes -- for a little mouse called Despereaux. In ''The Tale of Despereaux,'' the trouble starts when a rat falls into the queen's soup. It falls to the tiny Despereaux to save the Kingdom of Dor and he does so in charming, wistful, fairytale fashion. Page C1 
 Editorial
 YOU MEAN THAT BERNIE MADOFF?
 Bernard L. Madoff's suspected multibillion-dollar fraud provided a reminder of how greed impairs judgment, duping some of the world's supposedly savviest investors for decades. It raises once more a fundamental question : Where were the regulators when this was happening? PAGE A44 
 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR VETERANS
 Military veterans often find themselves desperately short of the information they need in their quest for benefits. But one promising form of help has arrived: a 599-page guide to veterans' issues, from educational help to vocational rehabilitation. Not surprisingly, it comes from outside the system. PAGE A44 
 FIXING AGRICULTURE
 Tom Vilsack, Barack Obama's choice to lead the Agriculture Department, has the merit of being unsatisfactory to both extremes of the farm-policy debates. That, we hope, leaves him the large center of support he'll need it to fix this country's broken agriculture policy. PAGE A44

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''U.S. Training in West Africa Aims to Stave Off Extremists'' (front page, Dec. 13) described a military training program in Mali, in the process illustrating the limited American strategy for combating extremists in Africa. 
 Mali will receive $9 million in counterterrorism aid; the bulk of the financing will be directed toward military training and equipment. 
 Good health, education, governance and economic opportunity are the foundations of stability, not M-4 assault rifles. To prevent the growth of extremism, Mali must develop; we can help that happen. We could start with a greater effort to improve health.
 The health profile of Mali is needlessly grim. Even when compared with other countries with equal or less national wealth, Mali is near the bottom in terms of newborn and maternal well-being. By helping Malian women and children, we are investing in a future where we need not be fearfully wondering where those assault rifles are pointed.

HEADLINE: Despite a Flat Quarter, Oracle Meets Expectations

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
The strengthening dollar did more to weaken Oracle's second-quarter earnings than did the slowdown in the world economy.
 The business software company reported that net income declined 1 percent, to $1.3 billion, or 25 cents a share, during its second quarter, which ended Nov. 30, while earnings remained flat at 25 cents a share. Oracle said that revenue rose 6 percent, to $5.6 billion, from the quarter a year ago. 
 Excluding the impact of the strengthening dollar, revenue grew 12 percent. Company executives also said the stronger dollar shaved 4 cents a share from its net income for the period. 
 ''We feel extremely good about our results,'' said Safra A. Catz, Oracle's president. She said the company was able to meet its growth targets on a constant currency basis. The dollar gained 15 percent against the euro during the second quarter, as the economic crisis expanded, the company said. Approximately half of Oracle's sales are from outside the United States.
 Although the strong dollar took a toll on Oracle's earnings during the second quarter, investors had braced for worse news that did not come. Many on Wall Street had been expecting far worse news, including the possibility that Oracle would announce a round of firings to cut costs. Instead, the company told investors that it saw healthy demand during the quarter and that customers continued to place new orders and renew old ones.
 ''Given the environment and given the currency fluctuations, these are pretty solid results,'' said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. ''Clearly they were able to control costs.'' Analysts were expecting net income equivalent to 25 cents a share, but had expected revenue would reach $5.86 billion. 
 Shares of Oracle fell 13 cents, to close at $16.61. 
 They rose to $17.15 in after-hours trading. 
 Sales of new software licenses, which are seen as a bellwether of corporate demand, declined 3 percent, to $1.6 billion. But without the impact of fluctuating current rates, new software license revenue would have grown 5 percent.
 Oracle had been hoping to increase its new software license sales by 2 to 12 percent during the second quarter. Oracle generated $7.6 billion in free cash flow in the last 12 months, up 15 percent over the same period the previous 12 months, the company said. 
 Oracle forecast an 8 to 11 percent increase from its revenue of $5.35 billion in the third quarter of last year.

'THE CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS'
 Linus's grungy blanket, Charlie Brown's hairs, Lucy's attitude: the whole Peanuts gang will become three-dimensional this weekend when the young theater company Pig Brooch stages a verbatim re-enactment of ''A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' the perennial, and perennially beloved, TV special. 
 ''Metaphorically, everyone has a giant head in this show,'' said Justin Tyler, a Pig Brooch founder who also plays the title role, above right, with Alden Ford as Linus. The production takes its metaphor literally: not only are the costumes and dialogue the same as those in the TV show, but the set is also mostly flat, and even the movements have been choreographed to look identical to those in the animated version. 
 ''When a lot of the characters are in a scene in the cartoon, they're not doing anything, they're just standing there and blinking,'' Mr. Tyler said. ''So we do a lot of that.'' 
 A jazz trio will also perform the original Vince Guaraldi score live. The show, directed by Mollie Vogt-Welch, was originally staged at Penn State, where Ms. Vogt-Welch, who happens to be Mr. Tyler's girlfriend (ahem, nepotism), was a student, and some alums have made the cast for its New York premiere. And it turns out that there was actually more competition to play Linus than Charlie. ''He's the one who has the speech about the whole meaning of Christmas, and he's kind of the cutest one,'' Mr. Tyler said. ''Charlie Brown's kind of a bummer. Major bummer.'' 
 But that may be part of the lasting appeal of the show, he added. ''When you're younger, you identify more with everyone being mean to Charlie Brown. And watching it now, you're like, oh, he's trying to figure out how to be happy. And he can't. As far as the message, maybe it's, 'Be who you are, and maybe people will come around.' '' (Maybe!) But some things are lost in translation from the half-hour TV special to the 35-minute stage show. ''No commercial breaks,'' Mr. Tyler said. ''That's not part of the true meaning of Christmas.''
 (Friday at 7 p.m., Saturday and Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., Brooklyn Lyceum, 227 Fourth Avenue, at Union Street, Park Slope, 718-857-4816, brooklynlyceum.com; $10.) MELENA RYZIK

HEADLINE: In Some N.B.A. Arenas, the Crowds Are Thin

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
A pleasant fog of noise and nostalgia descended on the Sacramento Kings for one memorable night last week. The Los Angeles Lakers were in town, fanning the embers of a dormant rivalry. For a few hours, Arco Arena rocked again.
 It was -- almost -- like old times.
 ''The only thing I miss is the cowbells behind the bench,'' Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said sarcastically that night.
 There was one other notable change: Several thousand fans were cheering the Lakers. That would have been unthinkable just a few years ago, when Chris Webber and Vlade Divac challenged Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal for Western Conference supremacy, and clanging cowbells echoed across the flood plain. 
 But these are signs of the times in Sacramento, where droves of fans have given up their season tickets, and the cowbells have gone silent. The Kings once sold out 354 consecutive games (a streak that ended last year). They have not sold out a game this season and are averaging just 12,185 fans a game, ranking 29th in the N.B.A. They drew just 16,068 for the Lakers game, about 1,200 below capacity.
 ''I've been doing the games 21 years, and I never thought I would see it the way it's been this year,'' said Grant Napear, the Kings' play-by-play announcer.
 Not long ago, Arco Arena was perhaps the most raucous building in the league. But on most nights this season, ''There has been no atmosphere,'' Napear said. ''I hate to say that, but it's been like a library.''
 The Kings are suffering from the twin perils of a poor economy and poor play, with a 7-19 record and no certified stars. The problems are mirrored in Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Charlotte, N.C., and Memphis, which comprise the bottom fifth of the N.B.A. attendance list.
 Over all, N.B.A. attendance is flat -- about a half-percent higher than at this point last season on a per-game basis. Cumulatively, arenas are at about 89 percent of capacity, on par with last season.
 Given the recession, league officials are actually encouraged. They do not expect a significant increase or a significant decrease in attendance this season.
 Still, it is hard to ignore the thousands of empty seats at Arco Arena and Conseco Fieldhouse, or anecdotal reports that things are worse than the official numbers indicate. (N.B.A. teams report attendance based on tickets distributed, not turnstile counts. The latter figure is not publicly available.)
 On basketball blogs, fans and reporters swap stories about the anemic crowds. A Nov. 12 game between the Grizzlies and the Knicks in Memphis drew, officially, 10,129 fans, but the crowd looked far thinner. A Nov. 3 game between the Bobcats and the Pistons in Charlotte drew a reported 11,023 fans. But two-thirds of the seats appeared empty.
 Fans are now wondering aloud if their teams will last until next season.
 ''We are a absolutely not alarmed right now about any of our markets,'' said Joel Litvin, the N.B.A.'s president for league and basketball operations. ''Needless to say, we're focused on the economic crisis over all, as every business in the world is. But the word alarm has not been uttered.''
 In fact, several teams are defying the recession. The Pistons, operating in one of the most depressed economies in the country, have sold out 246 consecutive games at the Palace of Auburn Hills and lead the league in home attendance, with 22,076 a game.
 The Oklahoma City Thunder, despite a 2-24 record, is averaging 18,457 a game in its inaugural season at the Ford Center (capacity 19,314). The franchise drew just 13,335 fans a game last season in Seattle.
 Three years after Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans Hornets are averaging 16,611 a game -- a 45 percent increase over the same period last season.
 Perhaps no team cheers N.B.A. accountants more than the Portland Trail Blazers, who are drawing 20,516 fans a game -- an increase of 5,000 over three seasons ago, when the economy was sound but the team was not. Poor play and player misdeeds so alienated the fan base that the owner, Paul Allen, filed for bankruptcy protection and handed the Rose Garden back to creditors.
 Now the Blazers are one of the most exciting young teams in the league and rank third in attendance. They could provide a blueprint, and hope, to the Pacers, who also drove off fans with player arrests and incompetent play.
 The Pacers are already showing modest improvement, averaging 14,181 fans a game, an 18 percent increase over the same period last season.
 Still, the sight of Sacramento and Indiana near the bottom of the attendance list is jarring. The Kings and the Pacers had two of the league's most loyal fan bases.
 ''Teams go through cycles,'' Litvin said. ''We like to think otherwise, but performance on the court can affect your business.''
 The 76ers are also slumping unexpectedly, despite a surprising playoff run last spring and the off-season signing of Elton Brand, an All-Star forward. Philadelphia is averaging 13,895 a game -- a 14.5 percent increase over this time last year and well shy of capacity at the Wachovia Center (20,310).
 A major leaguewide dip in attendance could have other consequences. Some team officials privately worry that the salary cap -- which is tied to revenue -- may decrease next season. That has happened only once in the cap's 25-year history.
 It is too soon to project revenues for the season, but league officials do not anticipate a drop in the salary cap. A great portion of revenue is already locked in, through television contracts and corporate sponsorships.
 For now, the league is working with teams to entice cash-strapped fans back to the arenas with value-added promotions like low-cost family packages and free food with ticket purchases.
 In Sacramento, the Kings doubled the number of $10 tickets available per game to 1,000. Among their new promotions is a Guys Night Out package, which includes a ticket, a meal and a meet-and-greet with the dance team, for $55.
 The Kings are actually showing an increase in group sales, partial-season plans and individual game tickets, according to Chris Granger, the N.B.A.'s vice president for business operations.
 Only full season-ticket sales are down, which, Granger said, ''probably isn't a surprise given the team is in transition and they face a brutal economy in Sacramento right now.'' On top of everything else, the Kings are in a political battle for a new arena, and fans are nervous that they will leave.
 ''It's kind of like the perfect storm here right now,'' said Phil Oates, a season-ticket holder since 1985, the year the franchise moved to Sacramento. ''People are just not sure. They don't know the players, the personality of the team.''
 Oates, who works for a real-estate development company, owns or controls six season tickets. He is giving up two of them next season, to save the company $14,520, because, he said, ''you can't justify a company spending on the frivolous things.'' Oates is also one of the original cowbell ringers, a group that came out in force for the Lakers-Kings playoff battles earlier this decade.
 ''The guys are still there,'' Oates said. ''There's just been no reason to ring them.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about sluggish N.B.A. attendance in some cities misstated the title of Chris Granger, a league executive with knowledge of ticket sales. He is the senior vice president for team marketing and business operations, not the vice president for business operations.

HEADLINE: Proposed Gas Drilling Upstate Raises Concerns About Water Supply

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
For most of the 30 years that they have lived in the West Village, Buck Moorhead and his family have driven north a few times a month to their other home in the Catskills to enjoy the forests, the wildlife, the peace. And for the last several months, they have attended meetings with scores of other upstate residents who fear that those attractions will be marred by pollution, new roads and plummeting property values if ambitious plans to expand drilling for natural gas proceed. 
 ''We effectively risk ruining our drinking water and turning a pristine area into an industrial landscape,'' Mr. Moorhead, 55, an architect, said of the effect both upstate and downstate. ''The whole thing is like a nightmare.''
 But when Mr. Moorhead, whose second home is in Sullivan County, spoke out against drilling this month at a hearing of the City Council's committee on environmental protection, he was among fewer than two dozen private citizens who showed up and the only one to testify, even though the city has a considerable stake in such drilling north of the city line. 
 Upstate, the push by energy companies to explore drilling under a broad swath of western and southern New York State have provoked alarm and protest among environmentalists and others.
 But in New York City, opponents say that city residents and leaders have been slow to react, despite New Yorkers' stake: not only do many have weekend homes, but the area under consideration for drilling includes the watershed that supplies most of the city's drinking water.
 ''In the absence of a real rallying cry coming from the city to vigorously protect the water supply, we're going to get rolled,'' said James F. Gennaro of Queens, chairman of the Council's environmental committee, which has been holding the hearings. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has made the environment a focus of his administration, has yet to weigh in publicly on the issue. ''The mayor appreciates the need for energy, but believes it must be obtained in a responsible way,'' said one of his spokesmen, Marc La Vorgna.
 ''The watershed's protection must be guaranteed before any drilling moves forward.''
 The City Department of Environmental Protection has held off taking a position until it hears from a consultant it hired to analyze any threats that drilling may pose to the water supply.
 But Mr. Gennaro, environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and others are calling for an outright ban on drilling in the million-acre watershed. They say that such operations represent an inherent risk to the water, which is so pure that it does not require filtration before arriving in the taps of more than 8 million people in the city and another million residents in Westchester and other counties. Any contamination, they note, would require the investment of billions of dollars in a filtration plant and would result in higher water rates. 
 New York State has a history of gas and oil drilling going back to the 1800s, with 13,000 active wells now in operation. Energy companies are now showing interest in the Marcellus Shale, part of a sequence of layered rocks stretching from New York to Tennessee, that runs as deep as 7,000 feet below ground and requires pumping huge volumes of water laced with chemicals -- one to five million gallons per well -- into the earth to break the rock and extract gas. 
 Because the process raises new issues about the use and disposal of wastewater, the State Department of Environmental Conservation is revising its regulations to address those matters before approving any new permits.
 The agency says that protecting all watersheds is a priority, but that talk of a ban is premature until every environmental effect of the expanded drilling is determined. A final plan on where and how drilling will be allowed is expected as early as spring.
 Exploration in the Marcellus Shale, a step that has became more attractive because of new technology and the nation's push to find its own sources of energy, comes with such high expectations that it has unleashed a gold rush for land.
 Companies are paying property owners millions of dollars for leases to drill thousands of wells if the shale in New York proves bountiful. 
 ''It's almost like placing bets,'' said Val Washington, deputy commissioner of remediation for the state environmental agency, which is getting pressure from some counties to act more quickly to allow the drilling, so as not to miss an economic bonanza. ''A lot of people are interested in it as a revenue source.''
 Robert Homovich, a member of the Delaware County Board of Supervisors, said the board opposes a ban on drilling in the New York City watershed. Not only does he trust that the state can ensure responsible drilling operations, he said, but a ban would also rob an economically depressed area of significant revenue.
 ''If we don't have this or something similar, New York City is going to bankrupt us,'' he said, noting that the city has been acquiring more and more land in the area to keep it off limits to farming or development to protect the watershed. 
 But environmental watchdogs say that concerns about contamination and public health should prevail in the decision. 
 Steven W. Lawitts, the acting commissioner of the city's environmental agency, said drilling on the scale now envisioned posed ''great risks'' and could hamper his department's ability to keep the water clean.
 One major concern is the use of benzene and other chemicals used in drilling that have contaminated groundwater in other states. The state environmental commissioner, Alexander B. Grannis, has said that applicants for permits would have to disclose all components in drilling fluids.
 But Mr. Lawitts said there were also questions about the dangers of leaks, spills, soil runoff and other contamination from the water used in drilling.
 The city's moves to keep its water supply pristine by buying up more land in the watershed could also be jeopardized by competition with natural gas companies that are offering landowners lucrative deals. Most land in the watershed is privately owned, although the city and state own about one-third. 
 Mr. Lawitts said the city had no plans to sell drilling rights. But the state has not ruled it out, Ms. Washington said, although most of the state-owned land is a protected ''forest preserve'' in the Catskill Park, and off limits to drilling, said Yancey Roy, a spokesman for the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
 Though state officials maintain that they have the ultimate say on drilling, Mr. Lawitts said city regulations ''can still govern what activity is permissible or not permissible'' on watershed lands. 
 He rejected criticism that the city was not being assertive enough. ''Our top priority is the watershed,'' he said. ''That's unequivocal.'' 
 Among those seeking a state ban on drilling in the watershed are environmental groups like Riverkeeper and Earthjustice. The city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., sent the state a letter this week warning that drilling could have ''crippling implications'' for customers if it reduces the quality of the unfiltered water. He said a filtration plant would cost $6 billion to $10 billion just to build, requiring at least a 30 percent increase in water and sewer rates.
 Meanwhile, in hopes of getting more New Yorkers involved, Councilman Gennaro is gathering signatures on petition in support of a drilling ban. And Mr. Moorhead, the West Village architect, said he planned to talk to his community board and send an e-mail message to his city friends to drum up interest among the unaware.
 ''This is a mammoth construction project,'' he said. ''It's stunning this is under consideration, when one looks at the risks.''

HEADLINE: The Glory That Was Greece From a Female Perspective

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
It's funny, given American political ideals, that our museums offer so few major exhibitions of ancient Greek art. The Met had one called ''The Greek Miracle: Classical Sculpture From the Dawn of Democracy,'' but that was in 1993. It was an expensive, blockbustery thing that told a story we already knew, and one that is only partly true: that Western culture, or whatever is good about it, was a Greek invention. 
 Some of us asked at the time why the curators, who had been handed loans of almost mythic status -- the ''Kritios Boy,'' the ''Grave Stele of Hegeso'' -- did so little with them. The show could have been an opportunity to break scholarly ground: to examine the role of class in ancient Greece, or to consider the lives of women and children, or to reconsider what classicism means as a value-laden historical concept. What we got was art-survey boilerplate. 
 Two years later the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore mounted a show on women in ancient Greece, impressively. And now New York has one too. Moderate in size, efficiently presented and somewhat stiffly titled ''Worshiping Women: Ritual and Reality in Classical Athens,'' it is not at the Met or any other museum but at the Onassis Cultural Center in Midtown, a kuntshalle-style space, now almost a decade old, devoted to Hellenic culture. 
 As conceived by its two curators -- Nikolaos Kaltsas, director of the National Archaeological Museum of Greece, and Alan Shapiro, professor of archaeology at Johns Hopkins University -- the show's intention is twofold: to present a nuanced view of a still-elusive subject, and to correct, or at least revise, existing misconceptions. 
 The main misconception is the notion that women had a universally mute and passive role in Athenian society. It is true that they lived with restrictions modern Westerners would find intolerable. Technically they were not citizens. In terms of civil rights, their status differed little from that of slaves. Marriages were arranged; girls were expected to have children in their midteens. Yet, the show argues, the assumption that women lived in a state of purdah, completely removed from public life, is contradicted by the depictions of them in art. 
 Much of that art is religious, which is no surprise considering the commanding female deities in the Greek pantheon. Like most gods in most cultures they are moody, contradictory personalities, above-it-all in knowledge but quick to play personal politics and intervene in human fate. Four of them make in-depth appearances here. 
 Athena comes on as a striding warrior goddess, armed and dangerous, avid as a wasp, in a tiny bronze statuette from the fifth century B.C. This is the goddess who, in ''The Iliad,'' egged the Greeks on and manipulated their victory against Troy, and the one who later became the spiritual chief executive of the Athenian military economy. 
 Yet seen painted in silhouette on a black vase, she conveys a different disposition. She's still in armor but stands at ease, a stylus poised in one hand, a writing tablet open like a laptop in the other. The goddess of wisdom is checking her mail, and patiently answering each plea and complaint. 
 Artemis is equally complex. A committed virgin, she took on the special assignment of protecting pregnant women and keeping an eye on children, whose carved portraits filled her shrines. She was a wild-game hunter, but one with a deep Franciscan streak. In one image she lets her hounds loose on deer; in another she cradles a fawn. 
 But no sooner have we pegged her as the outdoorsy type than she changes. On a gold-hued vase from the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg she appears as Princess Diana, to use her Roman name, crowned and bejeweled in a pleated floor-length gown. 
 Demeter was worshiped as an earth goddess long before she became an Olympian. Her mystery cult had female priests, women-only rites and a direct line to the underworld. And although you might not expect Aphrodite, paragon of physical beauty, to have a dark side, she does. 
 She was much adored; there were shrines to her everywhere. And she had the added advantage of being exotic: she seems to have drifted in from somewhere far east of Greece, bringing a swarm of nude winged urchins with her. But as goddess of love she was unreliable, sometimes perverse. Yes, she brings people amorously together, but when things go wrong, watch out: 
 ''Like a windstorm/Punishing the oak trees,/Love shakes my heart.'' 
 So wrote the poet and worshiper of women, Sappho, who knew. 
 Actual worship took various forms. Some were simple gestures. In several vase paintings we see women pouring wine, milk or honey from flat bowls onto the ground as an offering. In others they lead sacrificial animals to altars, a reminder that the white marble temples we now so admire for their purity were once splashed with blood. 
 One vase fragment, showing a group of women looking jumpy and frazzled, was long assumed to depict an orgiastic festival in honor of Aphrodite's boy-toy lover, Adonis, the James Dean of Greek myth, who died young and left a beautiful corpse and mobs of inconsolable female fans. Recently, though, scholars have concluded that this is a marriage scene, with an anxious bride being prepared by hovering attendants for her wedding night. 
 The management of weddings was female turf, as was childbirth and the raising of children. So were the rituals surrounding death. Men were in charge of war and killing; women were in charge of washing and dressing bodies for the all-important last rites, without which souls were left to wander the earth. Birth and death -- the only real democratic experiences, existentially speaking -- were in women's hands. 
 There is no more moving image in the show than that of two women, one seated and one standing, facing each other in carved relief on a marble grave stele dated to the fourth century B.C. Both may be priests, or worshipers, in an earth-goddess cult; neither looks young. An inscription identifies the woman commemorated by the stele as Nikomache. The exhibition catalog suggests that she is the seated figure, the one who has settled in and will keep her place when the other walks away. The parting is evidently in progress as the women clasp hands and meet each other's gaze. 
 Sappho again, and a poem called ''Long Departure'': 
 Then I said to the elegant ladies: 
 ''How you will remember when you are old 
 The glorious things we did in our youth! 
 We did many pure and beautiful things. 
 And now that you are leaving the city, 
 Love's sharp pain encircles my heart.''
 Despite this and other illustrations of female agency in ancient Athens, it would be a mistake to argue that the lot of women there was, after all, a fair deal. The record stands: no citizenship, no vote, little or no control over the use made of your time or your body. But the show is not making that argument. Instead it is using art to survey where, within a system of institutionalized restriction, areas of freedom for women lay. 
 By doing so it makes a valuable, if by now no longer entirely novel, contribution to classical studies. And it presents art with a thematic focus, a historical tact and a relevance to the present that our museums -- I am thinking particularly of the Met, with its beautiful but blandly generalizing Greek and Roman galleries -- can learn a lot from. As can we. In ancient Athens, as in contemporary America, true democracy was always an ideal, never a fact. 
 ''Worshiping Women: Ritual and Reality in Classical Athens'' continues through May 9 at the Onassis Cultural Center, 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street; (212) 486-4448, onassisusa.org.

HEADLINE: Sales Growth of Flat-Panel TVs Is Expected to Slow

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB

 BODY:
Sales of flat panel TVs are going flat. 
 In a reversal of fortune, television sales in the United States are predicted to drop in 2009, according to a new report from DisplaySearch, a market research firm. It would be the first sales decline in at least a decade, said DisplaySearch, and the first decline in revenue since 2000. 
 TV makers have long argued that TVs were recession-proof because Americans would continue to buy them as a cheap way to entertain their families. But consumers are now starting to shun the LCD and plasma sets, even as prices fall sharply.
 In 2009, sales of all types of TVs in North America are predicted to decline by 4 percent. LCD TV sales are expected to increase in North America by 2 percent over 2008, a fraction of the 22 percent gain in 2008 and the 77 percent rise in 2007. 
 ''There was an unnaturally high growth in sales due to the transition to digital TV and the replacement of picture tube TVs,'' said Paul Semenza, a senior vice president at DisplaySearch. ''You would expect a reversion to the mean, but this is beyond that.''
 Mr. Semenza began to notice a rapid drop in production from August to November. By the fall, flat-panel manufacturers in Taiwan that supply to various brands began to cut back production as name brand manufacturers needed panels only from their own facilities. 
 The flat-panel factories are now running at 80 percent capacity, down from the 90 percent rate of just a few months earlier. A similar shift is now happening in Korea, Mr. Semenza said.
 Worldwide, LCD shipments will continue to grow about 17 percent in 2009, the market researchers predict, but almost all of that growth will come from emerging markets, where few own flat-panel sets. 
 LCD revenue will drop by 16 percent, while revenue from all types of TVs will fall by 18 percent. In North America, revenue will decline by 24 percent.
 None of this is good news for consumers. Mr. Semenza expects that prices for LCD sets 32 inches and smaller will remain fairly stable. Retail prices on TVs 42 inches and larger will not decline as fast as they have in years past. 
 Some makers of the flat panels for big-screen TVs are delaying the construction of factories that produce panels more efficiently and that allow them to undercut competitors with lower prices.

HEADLINE: The Yankees Welcome $243.5 Million of Pitching

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
There was a Christmas tree on the mound at the old Yankee Stadium on Thursday, a fitting metaphor for what took place at the condemned baseball shrine. With the new stadium under construction -- and the old one still months from demolition -- the Yankees wrapped their new purchases in pinstripes and hoped for a happy new year.
 After missing the playoffs for the first time since 1993, the Yankees are giving themselves no excuses for their debut season at the new Yankee Stadium. They introduced C. C. Sabathia and A. J. Burnett to the news media and made clear the expectations that come with a combined $243.5 million in salary. 
 ''You're looking at a very strong rotation,'' Manager Joe Girardi said, ''and that's what you have to have to compete in late October.''
 The news conference was perhaps the last event to be held at the original Stadium, where the removal of seats will begin in March and demolition could start next summer. By then, the Yankees hope to be back atop the American League, with their revamped rotation leading the charge.
 Sabathia threw the most pitches in the majors last season, and Burnett threw the most in the American League. They combined for 35 victories, and neither is yet 32 years old. The Yankees rewarded Sabathia with a seven-year, $161 million deal -- a record for a pitcher. Burnett received $82.5 million for five years.
 ''I'm not going to say money wasn't an issue,'' Burnett said. ''I'm not going to lie; of course money had something to do with it. But I have a chance to win five years in a row. Whether you admit you love them or hate them, everybody wants to be a Yankee.''
 That includes Sabathia, the Vallejo, Calif., native who said he included the Yankees among his three preferred teams. He said the others were the Milwaukee Brewers, whom he lifted to the playoffs after a trade from Cleveland last July, and the Los Angeles Angels.
 The Brewers offered five years and $100 million, and the Angels never bid. General Manager Brian Cashman visited Sabathia's home in Vallejo last week, flying from Las Vegas to make a personal appeal before the Angels could get involved. It worked. 
 Cashman had met Sabathia twice in Las Vegas, once bringing the Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who told Sabathia about the glory of winning in New York. The home visit made an impression on Sabathia's wife, Amber, who gave birth to the couple's third child two months ago.
 Cashman talked about the family room at the new stadium and raved about living in New York, even mentioning a holiday tradition Amber Sabathia had recently watched on TV.
 ''He said, 'You could have seats right in front at the Thanksgiving Day Parade,' '' she said. ''I was like, 'I'm sold.' ''
 The Sabathias are moving to the New York area year-round, and they have looked at homes in Alpine, N.J. Johnny Damon's wife, Michelle, recommended the town to Amber.
 ''I look at it as I'm going to be here for the duration of the contract,'' Sabathia said, adding that he called Cashman 10 minutes after his visit to accept the deal. ''To know how much they wanted me here, that the whole plan for me to come here started two years ago, that definitely made me feel good.''
 Cashman had been plotting to add Sabathia since last winter, when he turned down a chance to trade for Johan Santana of the Twins. Cashman did not want to part with starter Phil Hughes and give Santana a lucrative contract, especially when Sabathia was a year from free agency. 
 Hughes struggled last season, but at 22, he is still a long-term asset for the Yankees.
 ''That's the direction that I took -- with great pain,'' Cashman said. ''I'm happy, at least, that we're able to complete that discussion from last winter. Now we're here, at the end of the process, knowing that we were going to have to place him just above Johan, and that's what we've done.''
 The Yankees' opening offer to Sabathia -- six years, $140 million -- surpassed Santana's $137.5 million guarantee from the Mets, the previous record for a pitcher. Signing Burnett came cheaper, and Burnett said Alex Rodriguez mentioned to him in a phone conversation that others in the clubhouse would command more of the spotlight.
 Still, Burnett said, the chance to blend in was not a factor in his decision. He also considered an offer from the Atlanta Braves, where he would have been the ace. In the end, the Yankees offered more money and geographic appeal to Burnett, who lives outside Towson, Md., with his wife and two young sons, who brought pinstriped teddy bears to the news conference.
 Burnett also got a positive report on New York from an unlikely source: Carl Pavano, his former teammate with the Florida Marlins. During a conversation in September on the field in the Bronx, Pavano raved about the Yankees.
 ''He recommended I come here,'' Burnett said. ''He believed that I had to come here to really blossom and really start something special, that I really would belong here.''
 Four years ago, the Yankees signed Pavano after a career year, despite his long history of injuries. They are taking the same gamble on Burnett, who has made 10 trips to the disabled list in 10 years, but Cashman said he was not deterred by Pavano's example.
 In 1997, Cashman pointed out, the Yankees traded for Hideki Irabu, an expensive flop. The next spring, when they had a chance to sign another international pitching star, Orlando Hernandez, Cashman was unsure until he spoke with Gordon Blakeley, a top Yankees scout.
 ''You can't stop swinging for the fences,'' Blakeley told Cashman, and the lesson applied a decade later. Burnett is a Yankee, and so is Sabathia. The prices were steep, but for the Yankees, the risk is worth it.
 ''The decision was made to go with the reward side of this thing,'' Cashman said. ''I know we'll be judged on that.''

HEADLINE: Data Show City Job Losses Going Far Beyond Finance

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The number of jobs in the city's economic sector that includes hotels, restaurants and theaters declined last month, new government statistics show, the first time that payrolls in that area have shrunk from October to November in the nearly two decades that the data has been collected. 
 The data released by the state Labor Department indicates that the recession has reached one of the city's strongest economic sectors, known in labor statistics as the leisure and hospitality industry. November historically is a time when hotels, restaurants and theaters are hiring for the holiday season. 
 Instead, the Labor Department statistics show, the number of jobs in the industry, which also covers museums, sports arenas and fitness centers, declined by 1,000, to 306,000.
 The new data also shows that New York City's unemployment rate jumped to 6.3 percent in November as employers continued whittling payrolls and retailers hired far fewer sales people for the holiday shopping season.
 The city's unemployment rate, which was 5.7 percent in October, is now at its highest level since February 2005 and appears headed higher. The federal Labor Department said on Thursday that the number of first-time claims for unemployment benefits in New York State rose by 11,601 in the week that ended Dec. 13.
 ''The recession and its very adverse effect on consumer spending is clearly translating into fewer retail jobs, and that situation is not going to improve any time soon,'' said James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group.
 Professional and business services, which also normally add jobs in November, also shrank last month, said James P. Brown, who analyzes the city's job market for the state Labor Department. That economic sector, which includes law, accounting and consulting firms, shed 1,800 jobs, the first November decline since 1992, Mr. Brown said. 
 The sector has been losing jobs for a few months as a result of the implosion of Wall Street.
 Statewide, the unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent from 5.7 percent in October, as New York lost more private jobs than in any month in more than seven years. 
 The city and state unemployment rates are still below the national rate, which rose to 6.7 percent last month, but the gap is closing. Many of the thousands of laid-off workers from the city's financial-services industry have begun showing up in the official statistics as they exhaust their severance payments.
 The city's retailers hired only 4,400 workers in November, fewer than half as many as in each of the previous two Novembers, the state Labor Department said. 
 Retailing has been one of the fastest-growing sources of jobs in the city in several years and is its ''largest low-wage employer,'' said Mr. Parrott. Citing a study the Fiscal Policy Institute published this month, he said that three-fifths of retail workers earn less than $13 an hour. 
 The financial sector eliminated 2,400 jobs in the city last month.

HEADLINE: The Welcome Is Warm; the House Is Frigid

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
HOLIDAY traditions fit for photo albums and Flickr uploads typically follow a familiar script: decorating a tree, baking cookies, opening presents, eating too much.
 But the traditions that make every family unique -- and perhaps create deeper bonds -- are not necessarily the ones posed for the camera. They're the quirks, jokes and idiosyncrasies shaped by years of togetherness, rekindled during a trip to a home where the lines between host, guest and family member blur.
 In my family, some of those types of traditions involve the effort to stay warm. 
 I was reminded of this when a friend mentioned traveling to visit a relative whose house was so cold he had to wear every item of clothing in his suitcase to bed in order to ward off the chill.
 My sister and I have a whole wardrobe we leave at our parents' house in northern Michigan specifically for this purpose: oversized sweatshirts from high school sports teams, flannel pajamas, thick wool sweaters and fleece pullovers, all layered night and day in bulky, outdated ensembles we wouldn't be seen in anywhere else.
 Our brother, a die-hard skier who is immune to cold temperatures, can lounge around in a T-shirt while the rest of us are huddled under blankets, which we all tend to claim in a preferential order.
 When we were little and the current house on the lake was a drafty pine-paneled cottage -- beloved, but about 40 degrees inside when we arrived in the winter -- the most coveted blanket in the family was an ugly red-and-black plaid throw.
 Called the ''Gayle blanket'' because it was given to our dad by a college girlfriend named Gayle, it was soft and worn and so fought over that our mom didn't have the heart to surreptitiously send it off to Goodwill. (Although apparently she had a change of heart, because the Gayle blanket hasn't been spotted in years.)
 These days, the most prized blanket is the ''Andrew blanket,'' a beige-and-white-striped afghan given to our parents by my sister's husband, Andrew. He may have had ulterior motives when he chose that gift because he rarely emerges from its cozy embrace when they visit in December.
 There are and have been lots of other blankets -- a red fleece, an off-white throw with fringe, a couple of navy options that disappeared after a redecorating frenzy -- but those are the only two that have risen to No. 1 namesake status.
 When we used to travel from our home in suburban Detroit to the old cottage in the winter, we would arrive after a four-hour drive and keep our down coats on for hours until the house warmed up. The first order of business was lighting a rickety propane heater, a process that involved long matches, a flashlight and our dad lying prone on the floor swearing at the pilot light until it caught.
 Once that task was accomplished, he'd build a fire in the stone fireplace, and my sister and I would spend the rest of the weekend or vacation jockeying for prime position in front of the flames. Note: To my knowledge, it has not yet been proven that a 10-year-old's body can absorb all the heat emanating from a fire, thereby depriving the other inhabitants of the room of any warmth. But it has been proven that you can scorch your back out of stubborn determination not to relinquish your seat on the hearth.
 The new house, built in 2000, has an equally beautiful stone fireplace, double-glazed windows and central heating, but it is no warmer than the old cottage because the thermostat is set at a maximum of 65 degrees. We can beg, plead, offer to chip in for the gas bill, or try to re-set the inexplicably complex digital gadget ourselves (zone 4 = 69, max, enter, beep!). But the thermostat must have been programmed to follow just one master's command; after a pause, the number 65 blinks back on the screen.
 One year, my mom bought a space heater for my bedroom, which is the farthest from the furnace and more exposed to the winds blowing off the lake. (''You chose that room,'' I'm reminded, seemingly every year.) The space heater has become a new bargaining chip in our continuing negotiations. Andrew once offered $20 to borrow it for half an hour before bedtime; in the spirit of the holidays, I relinquished it without payment -- but only for 30 minutes.
 We've all been instructed to sleep with our bedroom doors open upstairs, a zone that seems to be the equivalent of the Arctic Circle in the thermostat's opinion (no one really lives there, no point heating it). But that means remembering to stop the pendulum of the grandfather clock that sits on the stairway, opposite our doors, so it doesn't chime every 15 minutes.
 It also means minimal privacy, although the alternative is grim. There's a thermometer in my bedroom, which I check obsessively, and I once woke up to the mercury hovering around 54 degrees. Yes, I closed the door, I had to admit under cross-examination, the thermometer still clutched in my icy hand as evidence. Case dismissed.
 When I called the other day, our dad informed me that the thermostat has been adjusted downward since last year, a decline directly related to the Dow, the lousy economy in Michigan and the price of propane (lower than last year, but still high).
 ''It's set at 63,'' he said. ''But it actually says it's 65 in here because the oven is on.''
 Looks like we will be doing a lot of cookie-baking this year. Wearing big sweatshirts that aren't suitable for holiday photos. Pleading for a fire in the fireplace, which our dad claims actually cools down the temperature of the house (again, awaiting scientific confirmation).
 Even so, there's nowhere else I'd rather be for the holidays. I call dibs on the Andrew blanket.

HEADLINE: 'Headed Out of Town,' Bush Turns Reflective

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush shared some bittersweet reflections on Thursday as he looked back fondly on his White House days but regretted his inability to win passage of immigration legislation and to change the tone of debate in the capital.
 ''Reflections by a guy who's headed out of town,'' Mr. Bush called his musings in a question-and-answer session at the American Enterprise Institute. ''An old sage at 62 ... headed to retirement.''
 The president, who has described himself as uncomfortable with introspection, loosened up considerably before a friendly audience of conservatives. Better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all was a theme he embraced several times. 
 ''One such problem was immigration reform,'' the president said. ''And in this case, I chose to put the spotlight directly on the issue by giving an Oval Office address. Obviously, we weren't successful about getting comprehensive immigration reform. Nevertheless, I feel good about having tried.''
 And while he will miss many things about Washington, he won't miss ''the petty name-calling,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 ''I came with the idea of changing the tone in Washington, and frankly didn't do a very good job of it,'' he said. ''You know, war brings out a lot of heated rhetoric and a lot of emotion. I fully understand that.''
 The president reiterated his faith in freedom and in free markets, the current financial crisis notwithstanding. And while he voiced his continued optimism about the American people, he said one of his ''great fears'' was that troubles overseas might tempt the country to revert to isolationism.
 ''The world needs America's involvement,'' he said. ''We're a compassionate, decent, strong nation.''
 The president spoke about big issues (Iraq and tax policy, for instance) and not so big ones, like his relationship with the White House press corps. ''I don't like some of the things they say,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Of course, they don't like some of the things I say. But we've had a good relationship.''
 A lot of spirited intramural debate preceded the 2007 increase of American troops in Iraq, Mr. Bush said in observing that ''creating tension is good for decision-making, so long as it doesn't become destructive.''
 When asked about President-elect Barack Obama's assertions that ''Bush deregulation'' had led to a culture of recklessness and greed on Wall Street, Mr. Bush said he was looking forward ''to the true history of this financial crisis being written.'' 
 ''Just some thoughts on this,'' he said. ''The markets sometimes create excesses. We're living through the consequences of the excess. I quipped in Texas that Wall Street got drunk, and we got a hangover.''
 But this, too, shall pass, he said of the current storm. And when it does, he said, elected officials should remember that ''markets and free enterprise is what made the country great,'' and that government's proper role is promoting entrepreneurship and prosperity, not getting deeply involved in the mortgage business or managing car companies. And, yes, he retains his faith in low taxes as the best economic stimulus of all. 
 The president said the country ''needs to overcome its fear about nuclear power'' if Americans want to have all the electricity they will need and still protect the environment. 
 ''In terms of safety, the engineering has changed dramatically from the past,'' he said. (Coincidentally, Mr. Bush spoke 51 years to the day after the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, near Pittsburgh, became the first civilian nuclear plant to generate electricity in the United States.)
 Mr. Bush implied that the harsh words of the presidential campaign were all but forgotten when he and Mr. Obama met in the Oval Office recently. The retiring president refused to say what advice he had given his successor but said they had chatted about something in common: ''He's a dad who will have two daughters in the White House.''
 Mr. Bush, one of the least popular presidents in recent history, if public opinion polls are accurate, said the individual in the Oval Office is not that important: ''Presidents will come and go with their strengths and weaknesses, but the ship of state sails on because of the institution being greater than the person.'' 
 And political conservatives who fear that the November elections banished them to the wilderness should take heart, Mr. Bush said. Remember the Democratic landslide led by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, he said, and recall that just two years later Republican conservatives triumphed across the country. 
 ''My point is that things go in cycles in politics,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Names Insider To Commodities Post

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Nine years ago, Gary Gensler played a central role in fending off tough regulation for exotic financial instruments for hedging against risk. On Thursday, President-elect Barack Obama picked him for a central role in cleaning up the wreckage that some of those instruments caused.
 Mr. Obama named Mr. Gensler, a former Treasury official under President Clinton, to take over a seemingly obscure backwater of regulation, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
 But the commission, which regulates the exchanges that trade futures contracts for products as varied as oil, wheat and instruments for betting on interest rates, will be a major battleground over reining in the trillion-dollar markets for credit-default swaps and other ''derivative'' financial instruments that greatly aggravated the damage caused by the subprime mortgage meltdown.
 In 1999, Mr. Gensler worked alongside Robert E. Rubin, then the Treasury secretary under President Clinton, and Alan Greenspan, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to block proposals by the commission to regulate the new instruments.
 In the past year, as the mortgage crisis metastasized into a collapse of the broader financial system, instruments like credit-default swaps and so-called synthetic collateralized debt obligations produced hundreds of billions of dollars of losses that have forced the federal government to bail out the financial industry at a possible cost to taxpayers that could reach trillions of dollars. 
 Mr. Obama has vowed to reverse the deregulatory stance of the Bush administration and overhaul the entire system of financial supervision. Though Mr. Obama's team has not mapped a specific plan, advisers on his transition team said reining in derivatives would be one of the biggest and most complicated parts of that effort.
 Advisers to Mr. Obama said Mr. Gensler, 51, would bring immense expertise to the challenge and said it would be a mistake to think that he would oppose tough regulation just because he did so in the 1990s.
 Mr. Gensler, who became a partner at Goldman Sachs at the age of 30, is a staunch Democrat who was a top adviser to Paul S. Sarbanes, then a senator, in drafting the Sarbanes-Oxley law in 2002. That law, which provoked howls of protest from business groups at the time and in the years since, imposed strict rules and oversight of corporate accounting after the bookkeeping scandals at companies like Enron and Worldcom. 
 ''They were absolutely intent on writing a tough bill,'' said Michael Paese, who was a senior counsel to Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee at the time and is now a lobbyist for the securities industry.
 Other Democratic staff members on the Senate Banking Committee said Mr. Sarbanes and Mr. Gensler had been so worried about diluting the proposed regulations that they excluded Harvey L. Pitt, Mr. Bush's chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, during most of their work to draft the legislation.
 At the heart of the coming political battle are credit-default swaps, which are essentially insurance contracts to protect investors if a particular bond defaults. They were used to insure hundreds of billions of dollars worth of securities backed by subprime mortgages, but they also became a huge speculative tool in their own right.
 As the subprime mortgage market reached a frenzied peak from 2005 through the summer of 2007, Wall Street firms used the swaps to create vast numbers of synthetic collateralized debt obligations, which were securities that modeled the performance of pools that contained real mortgage-backed securities.
 When default rates on subprime mortgages soared in 2007, companies that had written credit-default swaps were potentially on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars. 
 Mr. Gensler could not be reached for comment about how his views about financial regulation have evolved.

HEADLINE: Obama Names Three to Top Economic Posts

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN; Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Pledging to create ''a 21st century regulatory framework'' to protect against future financial crises, President-elect Barack Obama on Thursday nominated three veteran financial regulators to top economic positions in his administration.
 ''We will crack down on this culture of greed and scheming that has led us to this day of reckoning,'' Mr. Obama said in announcing the appointments at a news conference in Chicago. ''We have been asleep at the switch.''
 Later in the day, transition aides said that Mr. Obama had settled on a labor secretary and trade representative and was likely to make those announcements on Friday at his final news conference before heading to Hawaii for a vacation. 
 In the morning news conference, Mr. Obama named Mary L. Schapiro, 53, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency has come under sharp criticism for its failure to detect signs that major Wall Street banks were in trouble before the financial crisis, and more recently, for gaps in its oversight of the New York financier Bernard Madoff, who the authorities say has confessed to running a $50 billion Ponzi scheme.
 The Madoff scandal, Mr. Obama said, ''reminds us yet again how badly reform is needed when it comes to regulations that govern our markets.'' 
 Ms. Schapiro has headed the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulator, since 1996. She has also served as a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission in Republican and Democratic administrations alike.
 Mr. Obama also announced the selection of two former Clinton administration economic officials, Gary Gensler and Daniel K. Tarullo, to leading economic posts.
 Mr. Gensler, who will head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was a Treasury official in the Clinton administration. He also worked as a senior adviser to former Sen. Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, who wrote legislation to increase oversight of the accounting industry and reform corporate governance.
 Mr. Tarullo, a law professor at Georgetown University who was also an economic advisor to President Clinton, will fill an open seat on the Federal Reserve board in Washington. He is currently leading Mr. Obama's transition team at the Treasury Department, and is considered an expert in international economic regulation.
 In announcing the appointments, Mr. Obama was harshly critical of the ''disdain for regulation'' shown by regulatory agencies in recent years and said the country needed ''regulatory agencies ready and willing to enforce the law.'' 
 He pledged to remake the financial regulatory system to adapt to the challenges of a new century. ''We will be releasing a very detailed plan on how that regulatory upgrade will take place,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama also called for a shift in ethics on Wall Street. ''We can have the best regulators in the world, but everyone is going to have to ask themselves, not only is this profitable, not only will it lead to a big bonus, but is it right?'' he said. ''Does it conform to higher standards in terms of how we operate?'' 
 In addition to serving at the S.E.C., Ms. Schapiro was chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission during the Clinton administration, an independent agency created by Congress to regulate trading in commodity futures and the option markets. Her service at both agencies could suggest that Mr. Obama is considering combining the two regulators, a structure long supported by many experts to streamline market oversight. 
 Ms. Shapiro, who would be the first woman to head the S.E.C. for a full term, said that the current crisis on Wall Street ''requires an aggressive, systemic response'' to restore trust and protect investors. She pledged forceful enforcement of current law and said ''thoughtful reform of our regulatory structures'' would be her top priority.
 The selection of Mr. Tarullo to fill one of two vacant seats on the Fed's board, which is also subject to approval by the Senate, will allow Mr. Obama to begin making his mark on the nation's bank. All of the current board members, including the chairman Ben S. Bernanke, were hand-picked by President Bush. 
 On Friday, Mr. Obama is expected to announce that Representative Ray LaHood, a Republican from Illinois, will be his transportation secretary. 
 Mr. LaHood, who is retiring after seven terms in the House, has overseen major spending projects as a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Known for his bipartisan alliances and his moderate views, he will be the second Republican named to the cabinet, after Robert M. Gates, the current defense secretary who has agreed to stay on.
 Mr. Obama is also expected to nominate Representative Hilda Solis, Democrat of California, as his labor secretary and Ron Kirk, a former mayor of Dallas, as his trade representative, transition aides said Thursday. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 30, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 18 about President-elect Barack Obama's choice of Mary L. Schapiro to be the next chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission misstated the name of Ms. Schapiro's current employer. She heads the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, not the Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The error was repeated in an article and editorial on Dec. 19 and in an article on Dec. 25.

HEADLINE: California: Budget Fight Continues

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
California lawmakers approved an $18 billion Democratic plan to address the state deficit that trims out $7 billion from schools, health programs and prisons, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would veto the plan. Mr. Schwarzenegger says it does not do enough to revive California's spiraling economy and close a projected $42 billion budget shortfall. He says he wanted a stimulus package that includes partnerships with the private sector and help to keep struggling Californians in their homes. He also says Democrats watered down the spending cuts and increased the taxes from the package he was negotiating with them.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Gets His 7% Property Tax Increase Through the Council

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's $1.2 billion property tax increase won approval from the City Council on Thursday, raising homeowners' bills by 7 percent as the city grapples with a worsening economy and disappearing revenue.
 As a result of the 33-to-18 vote, annual tax bills will increase by hundreds or in some cases thousands of dollars, effective Jan 1. 
 ''Even though it won't be popular, New Yorkers will understand,'' Councilman Miguel Martinez of Manhattan said in explaining his support for the tax hike. ''Times are hard, and we're asking everyone to pitch in.'' 
 Opponents warned that residents were already overtaxed. Since Mr. Bloomberg took office, property taxes have increased by 18.5 percent.
 ''Today, the Council votes to take the bucket to the same old well and ask homeowners to bear the brunt of a swelling budget among dwindling revenues,'' Councilman Simcha Felder of Brooklyn said. He added, ''I believe that is unacceptable and that will hurt all New Yorkers in this difficult time.''
 The property tax increase comes as Gov. David A. Paterson is pushing more than 100 new taxes and fees on items from downloaded music to nondiet sodas, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is moving to impose fare and toll increases.
 Manhattan homeowners who live in the most expensive co-ops will see their taxes go up by anywhere from $854 to $1,307, according to the city's Independent Budget Office. People who own single-family homes valued between $1 million and $1.5 million, outside of Manhattan, can expect to pay an extra $464 per year. Taxes on more modest homes, such as a condominium in Queens in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, would rise by $111.
 To help ease the pain, Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn announced that Mr. Bloomberg had agreed to send homeowners the much-prized $400 rebate checks by the end of the calendar year.
 The mayor had tried to eliminate the checks this year, then delay their distribution, but council members animatedly objected.
 In addition, the Council approved an increase in the hotel tax from 5 percent to 5.875 percent per room, or about $3 a night. That change is expected to generate perhaps $80 million between March and the end of the next fiscal year, in June 2010.
 Still, no one was under any illusions that the increased taxes would be the last financially difficult decision in the foreseeable future.
 Mr. Bloomberg, who in September ordered all city agencies to cut spending by 5 percent, asked that they come up with an additional 7 percent in cuts by Dec. 22. And even with those cuts, and the extra revenue from higher taxes, the city is still facing a budget deficit of more than $1 billion in the next fiscal year.
 The vote on Thursday -- a close one by City Hall standards -- was the latest political victory for Mr. Bloomberg.
 He had unveiled his budget proposals just two weeks after the most bruising political battle in recent memory: the Council's approval of his bid to rewrite the city's term limits law, allowing him to seek a third term. 
 And his attempt to withhold the property tax rebate checks met with fierce condemnation from council members who portrayed Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire many times over, as out of touch with the voters' financial situation.
 In recent days, though, with the help of Ms. Quinn, the Bloomberg administration began changing the minds of council members. It certainly did not hurt that the thrust of Mr. Bloomberg's arguments was echoed when Governor Paterson presented his own bleak budget, filled with projected budget cuts in city funds. Nor did it hurt that the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., a Democrat who is running for mayor, issued his own economic forecast this week. 
 Technically, Thursday's vote repeals a tax cut of 7 percent that had been set to expire in June. 
 In a statement after Thursday's vote, Mr. Bloomberg said: ''It's never popular to phase out a tax cut or reduce agency spending, but they are the right choices to avoid far greater and longer-lasting pain. We will not repeat the mistakes of the 1970s, which crippled city finances and nearly destroyed our quality of life.''
 Councilman David I. Weprin of Queens said there were no plans, for now, to raise property taxes again in the next fiscal year.
 ''There is an unofficial agreement with the administration that they will not be coming back to us in June for an additional property tax increase,'' he said. ''Obviously, things could always change, but that was the general agreement as of now, by taking this tough vote midyear that we will not be asked to take another larger increase.''
 The familiar dance between Mr. Bloomberg and the Council over the budget requires him to support some spending sought by the Council to win members' backing. In this case, Ms. Quinn said that the Council was able to persuade Mr. Bloomberg to refrain from cutting approximately $20 million from a variety of programs, in exchange for adopting the Council's recommendations for $20 million worth of other cuts.
 As a result, Mr. Bloomberg does not plan to cancel the next training class for more than 1,100 police cadets; instead, there will be two smaller classes of 250 cadets apiece in January and June.
 In addition, the deal means that the mayor will not cut $2.5 million from City University of New York and community colleges for student services and research. Nor will he slice $3.7 million from the Administration for Children's Services, which would have eliminated 127 caseworkers. Instead, Ms. Quinn said, the city will save $13 million by relying on in-house staff members and not consultants to do work on capital projects, as well as $3 million through a drop in fuel expenses.
 There were also a few examples of city officials trying to make the additional taxes a little less onerous. Under a Bloomberg proposal, people who own properties valued at $250,000 or less can pay quarterly rather than semi-annually. Those people will also be given a 15-day grace period for payments due in January.

HEADLINE: In Clinton List, A Veil Is Lifted On Foundation

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and CHARLIE SAVAGE; Kitty Bennett, Don Van Natta Jr. and Margot Williams contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Former President Bill Clinton has collected tens of millions of dollars for his foundation over the last 10 years from governments in the Middle East, tycoons from Canada, India, Nigeria and Ukraine, and other international figures with interests in American foreign policy.
 Lifting a longstanding cloak of secrecy, Mr. Clinton on Thursday released a complete list of more than 200,000 donors to his foundation as part of an agreement to douse concerns about potential conflicts if Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is confirmed as secretary of state in the Obama administration.
 The donor list offers a glimpse into the high-powered, big-dollar world in which Mr. Clinton has traveled since leaving the White House as he jetted around the globe making money for himself and raising vast sums for his ambitious philanthropic programs fighting disease, poverty and climate change. Some of the world's richest people and most famous celebrities handed over large checks to finance his presidential library and charitable activities. 
 With his wife now poised to take over as America's top diplomat, Mr. Clinton's fund-raising is coming under new scrutiny for relationships that could pose potential conflict-of-interest issues for Mrs. Clinton in her job. Some of her husband's biggest backers have much at stake in the policies that President-elect Barack Obama's incoming administration adopts toward their regions or business ventures.
 Saudi Arabia alone gave to the foundation $10 million to $25 million, as did government aid agencies in Australia and the Dominican Republic. Brunei, Kuwait, Norway, Oman, Qatar and Taiwan each gave more than $1 million. So did the ruling family of Abu Dhabi and the Dubai Foundation, both based in the United Arab Emirates, and the Friends of Saudi Arabia, founded by a Saudi prince. 
 Also among the largest donors were a businessman who was close to the onetime military ruler of Nigeria, a Ukrainian tycoon who was son-in-law of that former Soviet republic's authoritarian president and a Canadian mining executive who took Mr. Clinton to Kazakhstan while trying to win lucrative uranium contracts.
 In addition, the foundation accepted sizable contributions from several prominent figures from India, like a billionaire steel magnate and a politician who lobbied Mrs. Clinton this year on behalf of a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement between India and the United States, a deal that has rankled Pakistan, a key foreign policy focus of the incoming administration. 
 Such contributions could provoke suspicion at home and abroad among those wondering about any effect on administration policy. 
 Matthew Levitt, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said donations from ''countries where we have particularly sensitive issues and relations'' would invariably raise concerns about whether Mrs. Clinton had conflicts of interest. 
 ''The real question,'' Mr. Levitt said, ''is to what extent you can really separate the activities and influence of any husband and wife, and certainly a husband and wife team that is such a powerhouse.''
 Mr. Clinton's office said in a statement that the disclosure itself should ensure that there would be ''not even the appearance of a conflict of interest.''
 Stephanie Cutter, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said the president-elect had chosen Mrs. Clinton for his cabinet because ''no one could better represent the United States.'' 
 ''Past donations to the Clinton foundation,'' Ms. Cutter said, ''have no connection to Senator Clinton's prospective tenure as secretary of state.''
 Republicans have addressed the issue cautiously, suggesting that they would examine it but not necessarily hold up Mrs. Clinton's confirmation as a result. Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, which will consider her nomination, was in Russia on Thursday and unavailable for comment, according to Mr. Lugar's office.
 But in an interview on Nov. 30 on ''This Week'' on ABC, Mr. Lugar said Mr. Clinton's activities would raise legitimate questions, adding, ''I don't know how, given all of our ethics standards now, anyone quite measures up to this who has such cosmic ties.'' 
 Still, he indicated that he would vote for Mrs. Clinton and praised Mr. Obama's team for doing ''a good job in trying to pin down the most important elements'' in its agreement with Mr. Clinton.
 To avoid potential conflicts, the Obama team, represented by its transition co-chairwoman, Valerie Jarrett, signed a memorandum of understanding on Dec. 12 with the William J. Clinton Foundation, represented by its chief executive, Bruce R. Lindsey. The five-page memorandum, provided to reporters on Thursday, required Mr. Clinton to disclose his past donors by the end of the year and any future contributors once a year.
 The memorandum also requires that if Mrs. Clinton is confirmed, the Clinton Global Initiative, an offshoot of the foundation, will be incorporated separately, will no longer hold events outside the United States and will refuse any further contributions from foreign governments. Other initiatives operating under the auspices of the foundation would follow new rules and consult with State Department ethics officials in certain circumstances.
 Federal law does not require former presidents to reveal foundation donors, and Mr. Clinton had until now declined to do so, arguing that many who gave expected confidentiality. Other former presidents have taken money from overseas sources, including President George Bush, whose son has sat in the Oval Office for the last eight years. The elder Mr. Bush has accepted millions of dollars from Saudi, Kuwaiti and other foreign sources for his own library.
 Mr. Clinton's foundation has raised $500 million since 1997, growing into a global operation with 1,100 paid staff members and volunteers in 40 countries. It said it had provided medicine to 1.4 million people living with H.I.V./AIDS, helped dozens of cities reduce heat-trapping gases and worked to spread economic opportunity. 
 Mr. Clinton's advocates said that the disclosure on Thursday showed he had nothing to hide and that most of his largest contributors were already known.
 Yet while unprecedented, the disclosure was also limited. 
 The list posted on the foundation's Web site -- www.clintonfoundation.org -- did not provide the nationality or occupation of the donors, the dates they contributed or the precise amounts of their gifts, instead breaking down contributors by dollar ranges. Nor did the list include pledges for future donations. As a result, it is impossible to know from the list which donations were made while Mr. Clinton was still president or while Mrs. Clinton was running for president.
 Many benefactors are well-known Americans, like Stephen L. Bing; Alfonso Fanjul; Bill Gates; Tom Golisano, a billionaire who ran for New York governor; Rupert Murdoch; and Barbra Streisand. Bloomberg L.P., the financial media empire founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, contributed, as did Freddie Mac, the mortgage company now partly blamed for the housing market collapse.
 Another potentially sensitive donation came from Blackwater Training Center, part of the private security firm hired to protect American diplomats in Iraq. Five of its guards have been indicted for their roles in a 2007 shooting that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead.
 The potential for appearances of conflict was illustrated by Amar Singh, a politician in India who gave $1 million to $5 million. Mr. Singh visited the United States in September to lobby for a deal allowing India to obtain civilian nuclear technology even though it never signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. He met with Mrs. Clinton, who he said assured him that Democrats would not block the deal. Congress approved it weeks later.
 Other donors have connections with India, a potential flashpoint because of tensions with Pakistan. Among them was Lakshmi Mittal, a steel magnate and, according to Forbes magazine, the fourth-richest person in the world. Mr. Mittal, who donated $1 million to $5 million, was involved in a scandal in 2002 in London, where he lives. After Mr. Mittal made a large donation to the Labor Party, Prime Minister Tony Blair helped him persuade Romania to sell him its state steel company.
 Another donor was Gilbert Chagoury, a businessman close to Gen. Sani Abacha of Nigeria, widely criticized for a brutal and corrupt rule. 
 Mr. Chagoury tried during the 1990s to win favor for Mr. Abacha from the Clinton administration, contributing $460,000 to a voter registration group to which Democratic officials steered him, according to news accounts. He won meetings with National Security Council officials, including Susan E. Rice, who is now Mr. Obama's choice to be ambassador to the United Nations.

HEADLINE: 1997 Tax Break on Home Sales May Have Helped Inflate Bubble

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
''Tonight, I propose a new tax cut for homeownership that says to every middle-income working family in this country, if you sell your home, you will not have to pay a capital gains tax on it ever -- not ever.'' 
 -- President Bill Clinton, at the 1996 Democratic National Convention
 Ryan J. Wampler had never made much money selling his own homes. 
 Starting in 1999, however, he began to do very well. Three times in eight years, Mr. Wampler -- himself a home builder and developer -- sold his home in the Phoenix area, always for a nice profit. With prices in Phoenix soaring, he made almost $700,000 on the three sales. 
 And thanks to a tax break proposed by President Bill Clinton and approved by Congress in 1997, he did not have to pay tax on most of that profit. It was a break that had not been available to generations of Americans before him. The benefits also did not apply to other investments, be they stocks, bonds or stakes in a small business. Those gains were all taxed at rates of up to 20 percent.
 The different tax treatments gave people a new incentive to plow ever more money into real estate, and they did so. ''When you give that big an incentive for people to buy and sell homes,'' said Mr. Wampler, 44, a mild-mannered native of Phoenix who has two children, ''they are going to buy and sell homes.''
 By itself, the change in the tax law did not cause the housing bubble, economists say. Several other factors -- a relaxation of lending standards, a failure by regulators to intervene, a sharp decline in interest rates and a collective belief that house prices could never fall -- probably played larger roles.
 But many economists say that the law had a noticeable impact, allowing home sales to become tax-free windfalls. A recent study of the provision by an economist at the Federal Reserve suggests that the number of homes sold was almost 17 percent higher over the last decade than it would have been without the law.
 Vernon L. Smith, a Nobel laureate and economics professor at George Mason University, has said the tax law change was responsible for ''fueling the mother of all housing bubbles.''
 By favoring real estate, the tax code pushed many Americans to begin thinking of their houses more as an investment than as a place to live. It helped change the national conversation about housing. Not only did real estate look like a can't-miss investment for much of the last decade, it was also a tax-free one.
 Together with the other housing subsidies that had already been in the tax code -- the mortgage-interest deduction chief among them -- the law gave people a motive to buy more and more real estate. Lax lending standards and low interest rates then gave people the means to do so. 
 Referring to the special treatment for capital gains on homes, Charles O. Rossotti, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner from 1997 to 2002, said: ''Why insist in effect that they put it in housing to get that benefit? Why not let them invest in other things that might be more productive, like stocks and bonds?''
 The provision -- part of a sprawling bill called the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 -- exempted most home sales from capital-gains taxes. The first $500,000 in gains from any home sale was exempt from taxes for a married couple, as long as they had lived in the home for at least two of the previous five years. (For singles, the first $250,000 was exempt.) 
 Mr. Wampler said he never sold a home simply because of the law's existence, but it played a role in his decisions and also became part of his stock pitch to potential customers who were considering buying the homes he was building in the desert. He would point out that the tax benefits would increase their returns on a house, relative to stocks.
 ''Why not put your money on the highest-yielding investment with the highest tax benefit?'' he said recently. 
 During the boom years, he prospered. But today he owns 80 acres of land on the outskirts of Phoenix that he cannot sell. He owes $8 million to his banks, which may soon foreclose on his land.
 ''I am literally dying on the vine,'' he said.
 The change in the tax law had its roots in a Chicago speech that Senator Bob Dole, Mr. Clinton's Republican opponent in the 1996 presidential election, gave on Aug. 5 of that year. Trailing Mr. Clinton in the polls, Mr. Dole came out for an enormous tax cut, including an across-the-board reduction in the capital-gains tax.
 The proposal made Mr. Clinton's political advisers more nervous than almost anything else during the campaign. The campaign's chief spokesman, Joe Lockhart, traveled to Chicago to stand outside the ballroom where Mr. Dole was speaking and make the case that the Dole tax cut would cause the deficit to soar.
 At the same time, Mr. Clinton's aides began scrambling to come up with their own tax proposal. Dick Morris, the president's chief outside political adviser, argued that Mr. Clinton could assure his re-election by matching Mr. Dole's call for a big cut in the capital-gains tax.
 But members of Mr. Clinton's economic team, led by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, disliked that idea. They thought it would undo the tough work the administration had done to reduce the budget deficit. So they instead went looking for smaller tax cuts that would allow their boss to campaign as both a fiscal conservative and a tax cutter.
 Getting rid of capital gains on most home sales seemed like the perfect idea.
 Treasury officials had become interested in that provision earlier in Mr. Clinton's term after Jane G. Gravelle, an economist at the Congressional Research Service, had called it to their attention, according to Eric J. Toder, an official in the tax policy office at the time. He and his colleagues were looking for ways to simplify the tax code, and Ms. Gravelle told them that eliminating capital-gains taxes on houses was an excellent candidate.
 The tax forced homeowners to keep track of all their renovations over many years, because the cost of those renovations could be subtracted from their taxable gain. Even renovations on previous homes often qualified, as long as people had deferred the tax in the past by buying a new house at least as valuable as their old one.
 ''It was very hard for people to keep track of that information,'' said Leslie B. Samuels, the assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy from 1993 to 1996.
 People could also avoid the tax under a one-time exemption, for profits of up to $125,000, if they were older than 55. Thus, the tax raised relatively little revenue -- perhaps just a few hundred million dollars in today's terms. ''It was the worst kind of tax system,'' Ms. Gravelle said recently. ''It raised very little revenue, but it caused all these distortions and compliance problems.'' 
 Three weeks after Mr. Dole's speech, with support from top Treasury officials, the proposal made it into Mr. Clinton's speech at the Democratic convention. During the presidential debates that followed, he used it to parry Mr. Dole's calls for a big tax cut. The following summer, Mr. Clinton signed the provision into law. 
 At the time, Realtors and home builders lobbied for the provision and there was only scant opposition. Grover Norquist -- a conservative activist and adviser to Newt Gingrich -- said home sales did not deserve special treatment. But Republicans ended up voting for the bill by even wider margins than Democrats.
 Today, it is the subject for considerably more debate. Ms. Gravelle and Mr. Samuels said they thought the law had done more good thanill. And William G. Gale, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said he did not think that the change in the law was central to the bubble. Low interest rates, he said, were far more important. 
 The law's defenders say that it also removed at least one tax incentive that had pushed homeowners to trade up. Before 1997, people had to buy a house that was at least as valuable as their previous one to avoid the tax, or else take the one-time exemption. Now they could buy a smaller property or move into a rental.
 But many economists say the net effect of the law was clearly to inflate the real estate market. Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal policy group in Washington, criticized the exemption as ''a backward policy'' that ''helped push more money into housing.''
 A spokesman for Mr. Clinton declined to comment for this article.
 Perhaps the most detailed analysis of the provision has been the study by a Federal Reserve economist, Hui Shan, who did the analysis while at M.I.T. Ms. Shan looked at homeowners with significant equity gains, before and after 1997, and compared the likelihood of their selling their house. Her study covered 16 towns around Boston and took into account a host of other factors, like the general rise in home prices at the time.
 Among homes that had appreciated less than $500,000, she concluded that the change caused a 17 percent increase in sales in the decade after 1997. Before the law changed, many people apparently avoided paying the tax by simply staying in their homes.
 Ms. Shan also found that sales actually declined among homes with more than $500,000 of gains after the law passed. (Under the new law, couples have to pay taxes on gains above $500,000, even if they roll all those gains into a new house.) Nationwide, however, less than 5 percent of home sales over the last decade had gains of more than $500,000, according to Moody'sEconomy.com.
 Despite the criticism, there has been little political support for trimming the tax breaks for housing. In 2005, a bipartisan panel of tax experts, which was appointed by President Bush and included Mr. Rossotti, concluded, ''The tax preferences that favor housing exceed what is necessary to encourage homeownership.'' Among other things, it recommended increasing to three years the amount of time people had to stay in homes to claim the tax break on a sale. But Mr. Bush and other policy makers largely ignored the panel's report.
 Geo Hartley, a lawyer who has lived in Los Angeles and Washington over the last two decades, captures the divergent effects that the law appears to have. Mr. Hartley, who is 59 and single, said he found the old law ''weird,'' because it led him to buy bigger houses than he wanted.
 Since the law changed, Mr. Hartley has bought smaller homes. But he has also moved more frequently, knowing that most of the gains on his houses would not be taxed. He lived in one house in Los Angeles for a full decade before 2000. Since then, he has moved three times, making a handsome -- and mostly tax-free -- profit each time.
 ''It's part of the thinking that gets you more motivated to buy and sell property,'' said Mr. Hartley, who now lives in a town house in Washington that he is trying to sell, ''and have the American dream of owning a home.''

HEADLINE: A Year Of Chaos In Finance

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates are at their lowest level in half a century.
 Long-term interest rates are at their highest level in nearly 20 years.
 This is shaping up as the worst year in seven decades for the stock market. Of the 10 best days the stock market experienced during those 70 years, six came in 2008.
 A Wall Street legend who became a hero for forcing Wall Street to treat investors better now admits to defrauding a later generation of investors of $50 billion. A prominent lawyer is said to have embezzled hundreds of millions by selling fake securities to hedge funds.
 The economists are worried about deflation. They are also fearful of inflation. 
 The government is lending money to businesses that could never before have borrowed from it. People fear a wave of corporate bankruptcies as companies find they cannot borrow money to repay loans that are due.
 This was the year the financial system stopped working. Nearly all the contradictory, but accurate, statements above can be traced to that fact. 
 In 2007, the people who ran Wall Street, and the ones who regulated it, did not understand how serious the financial crisis was becoming. They saw the primary problem as one of a housing slowdown caused by a subprime mortgage crisis, and assumed the securitization machine -- which had come to finance everything from corporate loans to credit cards to student loans -- would keep on ticking even if its mortgage factory could keep operating only with the government guaranteeing almost everything.
 In 2008, the government effectively nationalized Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the American International Group, and it bailed out those who had lent to Bear Stearns. It let Lehman Brothers fail, briefly reassuring market ideologues but terrifying many market participants, and the rout was on. 
 The securitization machine ground to a halt, and the banking industry was in no position to assume its historical role as a lender that patiently waited for loans to be repaid. To the contrary, banks trusted neither their own balance sheets nor those of other banks. For a significant part of the economy, the government became the lender of first and only resort.
 For most of 2008, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury failed to realize that the banking system faced a solvency crisis rather than a liquidity crisis. Liquidity-providing moves proved ineffectual because no one had confidence in the values of enormous amounts of derivatives and securitizations that the banks owned.
 ''No financial market can function normally when basic information about the solvency of market participants is lacking,'' wrote Michael D. Bordo, a Rutgers economist.
 A year ago, China and India were supposed to be the engines that kept the world economy moving forward even if the United States was applying the brakes. Now people worry that rising unemployment could lead to political instability in the Asian giants.
 A year ago, most economists -- including the people setting Fed policy -- thought the American economy could avoid a recession. Now they have concluded that one was already starting as 2007 ended, and the optimists think it will last for six more months.
 With commodity prices collapsing, and consumers feeling poor and expecting jobs to vanish, the inflation rate went from alarming to negative and the Fed cut the short-term rate it controls almost to zero.
 The rate on 10-year Treasuries fell to a little over 2 percent, something not seen since Eisenhower was in the White House. But an index of junk-bond yields soared to more than 17 percent, just a little below the record level set during 1990, the last time the banking system appeared to be ready to collapse. Money is cheap for the government and unavailable to those who need it most.
 The multiple ways being used by the Fed and the Treasury to push out cash mean the government will end up with a lot of assets of questionable value. That amounts to printing money, and economists worry that if the Fed is unwilling or unable to tighten when things turn up, that could lead to rampant inflation.
 There could be a significant political constituency for inflation by then. If the problem is that your house is not worth what you owe on it, a good dose of inflation could produce a solution by raising the nominal value while not changing the amount you owe.
 In normal times, after a recession ends and inflationary pressures build, the Fed tightens by selling Treasury bills for cash, a move that sucks cash out of the economy.
 After this recession, its balance sheet may be heavy with mortgage securities and perhaps even corporate debt, and the Fed may have to sell them, rather than nice safe T-bills, to tighten credit. That could work out nicely if economic recovery has by then made those mortgage securities appear to be safe and reliable. That is one bet the Fed is making by taking on assets it never would have considered in the past.
 It is in booms that the seeds of busts are created, and the heroes of one era can be the villains of the next. The securitization machine that is so vilified today played a major role in greasing the boom that preceded it.
 That can even be true of people. One reason for the development of the great bull markets of the 1980s and 1990s was the freeing of investors from high fixed trading costs. To many -- including some regulators -- much of the credit for that went to a feisty trader who found ways to maneuver around the system and let investors and speculators trade for less. His name was Bernard L. Madoff.
 Four decades after he started that fight, which made him rich as his firm became the largest player in the Nasdaq stock market, Mr. Madoff admitted that his later success as a money manager was all a fraud. He estimated the losses in his Ponzi scheme at $50 billion.
 The disclosure of that fraud came on the heels of the arrest of Marc S. Dreier, a well-known New York corporate lawyer who had gotten hedge funds to lend many millions to real companies they believed to be Mr. Dreier's clients. The cash actually went to him.
 The falls of both men may be due in part to the sudden need for hedge funds to come up with cash to pay nervous investors. It is during bear markets that the follies of the previous bull markets become starkly apparent.
 This is my last column of 2008, as I head off to vacation. Given how badly the forecasts for 2008 worked out, it would seem foolhardy to offer any for 2009. But one seems clear to me: One of the most important tasks for the new administration's economic team is to put together a financial system that will be able to grant credit and pay for investments when the recession nears an end. 
 If they fail to accomplish that, and are unable to couple it with a regulatory system that will neither smother innovation nor let it run wild, then the commentaries a year from now will be even more downcast than those appearing as this year draws to its sad conclusion.

PERSON: Paul Weyrich 

HEADLINE: Paul Weyrich, 66, Influential Conservative Strategist

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Paul M. Weyrich, the conservative thinker and strategist whose iron principles, articulate fervor and organization-building skills were instrumental in propelling the right wing of the Republican Party to power and prominence in the 1980s and '90s, died Thursday. He was 66 and lived in Fairfax, Va.
 Lee Edwards, a friend of Mr. Weyrich's for four decades and a distinguished fellow at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative research group that Mr. Weyrich helped found, confirmed the death, at a hospital in Northern Virginia. The family did not release a cause, Mr. Edwards said, but Mr. Weyrich had many health problems, including diabetes. His legs were amputated at the knee in 2005, and he had broken his back in a fall some years earlier.
 A writer, a lobbyist and an organizer on behalf of conservative causes and especially social conservatism, Mr. Weyrich (pronounced WY-rick) was one of the far right's most unbending ideologues. He was widely credited with coining the phrase ''moral majority'' as a rallying label for social conservatives. It became the name of the religion-based political organization that was led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. 
 A deacon in the ultra-conservative Melkite Greek Catholic Church, Mr. Weyrich openly fused his faith and his politics. 
 ''Defense is a moral issue,'' he told The Washington Post in 1983, before the fall of the Soviet Union, adding that he considered the Communists to be godless oppressors. ''There are some things worse than war. One is surrender -- the moral consequences are such that the nation would be destroyed. Since I believe in eternal life, if it became necessary to sacrifice my life for my country or my beliefs, well, then I'm willing to do so. The people who have come up with the better-red-than-dead idea are not believers.''
 For more than a quarter of a century, Mr. Weyrich was one of the Republican Party's leading antagonists from the right. President Ronald Reagan, he said, had overemphasized economic issues and kept social issues ''on the back burner,'' as he wrote on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times in 1984.
 In 1989, he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the first President Bush's nominee for secretary of defense, John G. Tower, was unqualified for the post because he was a drinker and a womanizer, issues that eventually doomed the nomination. More recently, he accused the current President Bush of profligate domestic spending, and he was a critic of the Iraq war, asserting that a war conducted to spread democracy rather than to protect vital national interests deviated from conservative principles.
 Perhaps more than anything, Mr. Weyrich was a nondeviator in his unswerving faith in small government, free-market economics, the right to life and the sanctity of the family. One possible exception: as a lifelong train enthusiast, he was an ardent advocate of government support for Amtrak. 
 Mr. Weyrich started the Heritage Foundation, a Washington research organization whose express aim is to influence Congress, in 1973 with Ed Feulner, helped by $250,000 from the Colorado beer magnate Joseph Coors. Both he and Mr. Feulner were Congressional aides at the time.
 Mr. Weyrich also started the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, which raised money for conservative political candidates and focuses on vulnerable liberal incumbents; it later became the Free Congress Foundation, a separate group that specializes in cultural conservatism. Its statement of principles, issued in 1987 and written largely by Mr. Weyrich, defines ''the belief that there is a necessary, unbreakable and causal relationship between traditional Western, Judeo-Christian values, definitions of right and wrong, ways of thinking and ways of living -- the parameters of Western culture -- and the secular success of Western societies.''
 It was Mr. Weyrich's conviction in making such sweeping statements -- and the prickly, impatient, let's-get-it-done manner with which he did business -- that made him an architect of the conservative movement of the last part of the 20th century.
 ''Paul Weyrich fought tirelessly for three decades to protect the preborn, preserve traditional marriage and ensure that people of faith had a voice in shaping the public policy that affected their lives,'' James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on Families, said in a statement on Thursday. ''Had there been no Paul Weyrich, there would be no conservative movement as we know it.''
 Richard A. Viguerie, the conservative direct-mail pioneer, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Weyrich was the least known of the four pillars of modern conservatism, the others being Barry Goldwater, William F. Buckley Jr. and Ronald Reagan. 
 ''It was a very, very brave soul who would get up and disagree after Paul had spoken,'' Mr. Viguerie said. ''He had great conviction, one face, public and private, and with his energy and drive, he just propelled us forward. He was fearless and tireless. We'd always be looking for someone to bell the cat, and Paul was always available to call this congressman, to call that senator and tell him, 'You're doing this wrong!' or 'You got to help us on this!' ''
 Paul Michael Weyrich was born in Racine, Wis., on Oct. 7, 1942. His father, Ignatius, was a German immigrant who worked for 50 years stoking the furnace in a Catholic hospital and who raised his son to treat religious and political matters alike with deep seriousness. 
 Mr. Weyrich attended the University of Wisconsin but did not graduate, supporting himself at first as a reporter for television and radio and at The Milwaukee Sentinel. He eventually became the news director for KQXI in Denver, and from there he went to Washington as an aide to Senator Gordon Allott, a conservative from Colorado.
 A year or so later, Mr. Weyrich attended a meeting of aides to Congressional liberals that was also attended by lawyers, lobbyists and Brookings Institute fellows. What he witnessed was a revelation, he said. The subject of the meeting was President Richard M. Nixon's failure to move forward on fair housing legislation.
 ''All I did was sit there with my mouth open, watching the system being orchestrated,'' he recalled years later in an interview with The Washington Post, ''including getting outside demonstrators, when to get the op-ed piece in the newspaper so it would coincide with the demonstrations, when to have personal lobbying, who was going to speed up the timetable at Brookings to get their study out. It was magnificent. I said, 'Thank you, Lord, I have needed this insight.''' 
 From that moment on, he said, he devoted himself to creating the same system for the right.
 Mr. Weyrich's survivors include his wife of 45 years, Joyce; two daughters, Dawn and Diana, and three sons, Peter, Stephen and Andrew.
 ''He was a throwback to an earlier age of people in politics, people who prized free-market economics, old-fashioned, traditional values,'' Mr. Viguerie said. ''The world has changed, but Paul didn't change.''

HEADLINE: Obama Team Is Seeking Stimulus Bill by New Year

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama's advisers hope to finish an economic recovery blueprint by Dec. 25 so that Democratic Congressional staff members can draft legislation by the new year, as the two branches of government try to converge on a two-year plan by late January that could total just under $1 trillion.
 ''The goal for completing action on this important legislation should be as close to Jan. 20 as possible,'' said an e-mail message from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's office to senior Senate Democratic staff members. 
 Some Obama advisers have sought to tamp down expectations that Mr. Obama could sign a package immediately after he is inaugurated. The opposition of some Senate Republicans and House and Senate negotiations on a final compromise could force delays into February.
 Democrats familiar with the early deliberations say the preliminary price tag has grown to about $800 billion from the roughly $600 billion that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had estimated in recent days. 
 Mark Zandi, a Republican economist who is advising the Democrats, said in an interview that the worsening economy could push his updated recommendation in January up to $1 trillion for a two-year government stimulus.
 About a fifth of the Obama package could go toward health care, Democrats say. The biggest piece would be up to $100 billion to subsidize the states' growing Medicaid caseloads of the poor. Mr. Obama also will call for a down payment on the $50 billion he proposed during his campaign to help medical providers buy information technology and save costs on health records.
 Mr. Obama is considering roughly $200 billion in tax relief for low-wage and middle-class workers, including a payroll tax holiday to fatten paychecks and encourage Americans to spend more and spur economic activity, according to several people with knowledge of the options he is weighing.
 The Obama plan has five main parts, according to Democrats in Congress and the Obama transition office. Besides the health care financing, it would propose billions of dollars for energy-saving programs, public works projects, school construction and renovation, and expanded jobless aid and food stamps for ''the most vulnerable,'' as well as tax cuts. 
 The scale and speed of the emerging package could exceed anything in recent memory, according to White House and Congressional veterans, in keeping with Mr. Obama's admonition that the size of the stimulus must be proportionate to the economy's ills. 
 The president-elect, in a four-hour meeting on Tuesday, made a number of decisions to guide his senior advisers while he is on a two-week vacation starting on Saturday; more than once he goaded them to think bigger and ''bolder,'' participants said.
 The Obama plan could end up at about 15 pages, an adviser said, leaving precise legislative language and some details to Congress. The House and Senate will be working simultaneously to draft separate but similar measures. 
 Ms. Pelosi hopes to have the House finish in the second week of January. The Senate Finance Committee has scheduled votes to begin on Jan. 8; subsequent debate on the Senate floor could take more than a week.
 The Senate leadership e-mail message on Thursday, which outlined the Obama team's plans and set a Jan. 20 goal for completion, also sought to limit senators' add-ons that could inflate the package and violate Mr. Obama's vow against pork-barrel spending. 
 ''Only those items that spend out quickly, create jobs and constitute sound national policy should be considered for inclusion in the package,'' the message said.

HEADLINE: Car Bankruptcy Cited as Option By White House

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, BILL VLASIC and MICHELINE MAYNARD; David E. Sanger reported from Washington and Bill Vlasic and Micheline Maynard from Detroit.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This article is byDavid E. Sanger, Bill VlasicandMicheline Maynard.
 The White House raised for the first time on Thursday the prospect of forcing General Motors and Chrysler into a managed bankruptcy as a solution to save the companies from financial collapse. 
 President Bush's spokeswoman, Dana Perino, confirmed growing speculation within legal circles that the president and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. were considering the step.
 ''There's an orderly way to do bankruptcies that provides for more of a soft landing,'' Ms. Perino said. ''I think that's what we would be talking about. That would be one of the options.''
 A senior administration official, however, later described that option as a last resort, to be used only if an agreement for a voluntary overhaul of the industry could not be reached. 
 These officials said the preferred solution would be to force a restructuring of the industry outside of bankruptcy court, extracting concessions that would make the companies more cost-competitive with foreign automakers.
 In return, the Treasury would tap the financial rescue fund, called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to make loans to the companies.
 After a week of talks between the automakers and the Treasury Department over the terms of a possible bailout, Ms. Perino on Thursday said, ''we're very close.'' 
 President Bush, speaking at the American Enterprise Institute, an organization dedicated to free market principles, said that he had determined that the economy was too fragile to allow G.M. and Chrysler to fail. The companies have warned that will happen if they do not receive financial aid soon.
 In his speech Thursday, Mr. Bush made clear that he wanted to avoid a ''disorderly bankruptcy'' because of ''what it would do to the psychology of the markets.'' But he also said he was ''worried about putting good money after bad,'' and suggested he would only approve a plan that allowed the auto companies to ''become viable in the future.''
 Mr. Bush's comments, a month before he leaves office, made clear that he was worried by the idea of returning to Texas amid more economic chaos and the surge in unemployment that a collapse of the companies could cause. 
 ''The autos obviously are very fragile,'' he said. He added that he was concerned about what President-elect Barack Obama would face on Jan. 20. ''I believe that good policy is not to dump him a major catastrophe in his first day of office,'' he said. 
 What the White House appears to be envisaging is a package deal of concessions -- and an injection of money from the TARP, the $700 billion financial bailout fund -- to keep credit flowing for G.M. and Chrysler. 
 Taxpayer loans, the White House has said, would have first priority over all other debt. Ms. Perino said the goal was to ''try to come up with something that would protect the taxpayers but not allow a collapse that would hurt everybody in America.'' 
 But for Mr. Bush, that could be difficult to negotiate. If the autoworkers' unions conclude they are likely to get a better deal from Mr. Obama, they are likely to stall negotiations and settle for a shorter-term loan. 
 After the White House raised the possibility of a bankruptcy, G.M.'s shares fell to $3.66. 
 Investors may have also been reacting to a report in The Wall Street Journal that said G.M. had restarted merger discussions with Chrysler. But a G.M. spokesman, Tony Cervone, said the automaker had not held any talks with Chrysler since late October, when G.M. suspended discussions because of its bleak financial condition. ''Nothing has changed,'' he said. 
 G.M. declined to comment on the Bush administration's suggestion that an ''orderly bankruptcy'' was under consideration. But the company was surprised by the White House statements, according to G.M. officials who asked not to be identified because the discussions with the administration were not yet final. 
 The automaker's senior executives have said repeatedly that bankruptcy was not a viable solution because consumers would be reluctant to buy a vehicle from a bankrupt automaker.
 In July, CNW Marketing Research said a survey it conducted showed that 80 percent of prospective car buyers would not consider purchasing a vehicle from a bankrupt company. A more recent survey found that 51 percent of the people it interviewed said they would not buy a car from G.M. even if it received a government bailout. 
 ''G.M. cannot afford to lose half of its prospective customers,'' said Art Spinella, CNW's president.
 Spokesmen for Chrysler and Ford also declined to comment specifically on the inclusion of bankruptcy as an alternative. 
 Chrysler's chairman, Robert L. Nardelli, has said that getting financing to reorganize in bankruptcy would be difficult given tight credit conditions. Ford is not seeking immediate government help. 
 There was no immediate comment from the United Automobile Workers union.
 In a traditional bankruptcy proceeding, the U.A.W.'s contracts could be voided and the union forced to renegotiate benefits like health care.
 The union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, has said the U.A.W. is willing to make concessions if G.M. or Chrysler gets government loans that help them survive.
 But Mr. Gettelfinger has said he believes that bankruptcy would cripple either company's ability to sell cars. ''There's no question in my mind that people would not buy their vehicles,'' he said in an interview.
 Both companies are cutting production to stretch their available cash. On Friday, Chrysler will begin an unusual monthlong shutdown of all of its North American manufacturing plants in a bid to save money. 
 Legal experts said Thursday that despite discussion of an out-of-court solution, a revamping of G.M. and Chrysler might be difficult to accomplish outside of bankruptcy court, given the significant steps an overhaul would require. 
 ''It's not going to be easy, it's not going to be pleasant, or palatable, but it's the only solution that makes the least bit of sense,'' said Hugh M. Ray, head of the bankruptcy practice at the Houston law firm Andrews Kurth, who has participated in major bankruptcy cases.
 If the companies were to file for bankruptcy, major banks would provide financing, with federal funds as security for the bank loans for the companies to operate. 
 Some lawyers have suggested that the two companies could receive $25 billion, using $5 billion in federal funds to guarantee the banks' loans, although auto industry analysts said the companies might need more. 
 G.M. has retained Harvey R. Miller, a longtime bankruptcy lawyer, as its adviser. It is also being advised by William Repko, an expert in restructuring with Evercore Partners who has worked with companies like United Airlines. G.M. is also working with Arthur B. Newman of the Blackstone Group.
 Chrysler has retained the law firm of Jones Day to provide revamping expertise.
 Mr. Ray said that a number of airlines went through bankruptcy protection earlier this decade, using federally backed loans awarded by the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which was set up to aid the industry after the September 2001 attacks. 
 The board turned down United's request, however, and the airline subsequently restructured under bankruptcy protection without federal money.
 ''United is still flying, and G.M. is not doing very well,'' Mr. Ray said. ''Their chickens have come home to roost, and now it's inevitable'' that G.M. seek bankruptcy protection, he added.

HEADLINE: For Louisiana, Those Bons Temps Proved All Too Brief

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Six months ago, it was springtime in Louisiana, dollars were raining in from high oil prices, and the tax cuts and highway spending couldn't come fast enough in the euphoric Legislature.
 But now oil has plummeted and the joy is gone in a poor state that for a time seemed insulated by natural resources from the national downturn. The budget cuts -- big ones -- are about to begin. 
 In Louisiana, the oil-drunk always ends badly. This time, though, the political stakes are bigger than in the past, as the Republican Party's national pinup, Gov. Bobby Jindal, has to absorb the brunt of the state's abrupt shift in fortunes. After glorying in the largess earlier this year, Mr. Jindal has gone to issuing sober news releases about hiring freezes and the new austerity. 
 His fate is tied as much as anybody's to Louisiana's overdependence on oil. Severance taxes, mostly from oil and gas, made up just over 8 percent of state tax revenue in 2007, according to Census Bureau data, much less than Alaska's 64 percent, but higher than Texas' 6.9 percent. The total take, including royalties and leases from oil, gas and other resources, accounts for just under 17 percent of the Louisiana budget. 
 But while the leading good-government group here, citing that addiction, warned last May against the Legislature's plan for a $360 million income tax cut, Mr. Jindal called the tax break ''terrific news'' and happily signed it into law as legislators cheered. 
 Admonitions on fiscal prudence went unheeded, as they have so often here, and the bill is now due. Earlier this year there was an $865 million surplus; now Louisiana has a $341 million shortfall in its current-year budget, and next year the projected deficit is $2 billion. It joins 43 states with current and forecast budget gaps in the reckoning of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group. 
 Health care and higher education will probably suffer cuts, the latter perilous in a state that regularly bemoans chronic white-collar outmigration, a trend that touched the governor's own family when his brother moved out of Louisiana. Mr. Jindal recently pointed out that his state was the only one in the South to regularly lose more people than it gained. Now, in the universities that are supposed to be magnets and incubators, faculty positions will go unfilled; academic programs will probably be cut. 
 There could be some $109 million in education spending cuts alone, and an additional $160 million in health care cuts, much from Medicaid -- unfavorable circumstances for the rollout of Mr. Jindal's ambitious new plan to partly privatize Medicaid in the state. 
 ''Anybody paying attention knew we were laying the groundwork for fiscal problems, as we cut taxes and raised spending,'' said James C. Brandt, president of the Public Affairs Research Council in Baton Rouge, an independent group in Baton Rouge. ''We hate to say, 'we told you so.' But unfortunately, we seem to be going right down that boom-and-bust cycle again.'' 
 Although the Louisiana numbers are small compared with say, those in California, which is looking at an $14.8 billion gap, they have come as a shock in a state that was until recently patting itself on the back, not only over $127-a-barrel oil last spring (it is now below $40) but also big jumps in sales and income tax collections as a result of the post-Hurricane Katrina boom. In the year after the hurricane alone, there was a 19 percent increase in sales tax revenue, much of it from home reconstruction and replacements for lost household items. 
 Mr. Jindal entered office this year with the happy duty of spending a $1 billion surplus -- and he and the legislators promptly did so, appropriating millions of dollars for highways, ports and a medical research facility, and widely dispensing tax breaks, including one to parents of private school students. The cheery mood in the state Capitol continued all spring, as the legislators then decided to roll back a much-hated income tax increase passed earlier in the decade, costing the state hundreds of millions in revenue in coming years. 
 ''We had so many new members, and they were overwhelmed by the new dollars,'' recalled State Senator Eric LaFleur, a Democrat. ''They felt they ought to give some of it back. I think there was a euphoria on the House side: 'Man, we ought to be giving this money back.' Lot of those guys hadn't been around long enough.''
 Mr. LaFleur said he had had misgivings about the tax cut but had voted for it, as did every other member of both chambers.
 James A. Richardson, an economist at Louisiana State University and a member of the state's official revenue-estimating board, said legislators had been lulled by the post-Katrina revenue. ''They felt they had the ability, because you had all this money coming in,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''We were chasing the dollars up the slope.''
 Indeed, there was teeth-gnashing when Gregory Albrecht, the legislature's chief economist, used what most felt to be a low-ball forecast for the price of oil, $84 a barrel, when forecasting the revenue the state could spend. ''You can tell by the subtext of the questioning -- 'why are you so low?' '' Mr. Albrecht recalled. ''Money was coming in like crazy. Why worry about delaying a tax cut?''
 The seasons have turned, and the mood here now is much darker. Now, it is the president of L.S.U. who is gnashing his teeth. 
 ''If we have an open position, we have to stop that looking,'' said John V. Lombardi, the university system president. Next year, he said, ''we may have to confront the possibility of eliminating academic programs.''
 The consequences are real in a state long ago overtaken by regional neighbors more tightly focused on educational institutions. ''It reduces the state's competitiveness in attracting new business,'' Mr. Lombardi said. ''This is a real economic development issue for the state.''
 Mr. Brandt, of the public affairs council, said cutting education would only increase migration from the state. Louisiana, he said. has ''gotten by with these resources others don't have.''
 ''We've not made the decisions we need to,'' he said, ''to get us out of the high-poverty, low-education cycle.''

HEADLINE: Budget Office Sees Hurdles In Financing Health Plans

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said Thursday that many of the health care proposals championed by President-elect Barack Obama and other Democrats would carry a high price tag and would generate only modest savings.
 The budget office, an influential voice in the work of Congress, analyzed 115 options, including proposals to expand coverage and slow the growth of health spending. 
 Some of the options, including proposals to increase taxes on cigarettes and nondiet soft drinks, are sure to meet stiff political opposition. 
 One bright spot in a generally bleak picture was the estimate of potential savings from a requirement for doctors and hospitals to use health information technology, including electronic medical records, as a condition of participating in Medicare. 
 Such a requirement could save the federal government $7 billion in the first five years and a total of $34 billion over 10 years, by reducing medical errors and avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures, the budget office said. It ''would also lower health insurance premiums in the private sector,'' the report said.
 Without action by Congress, the report said, health costs will continue to soar, the number of people without insurance will rise by nearly one million a year, to a total of 54 million in 2019, and spending on health care will increase to 25 percent of the gross domestic product in 2025, up from 16 percent in 2007.
 In keeping with its duty to provide objective, impartial analysis, the budget office did not endorse any options, but it fleshed out many ideas circulating on Capitol Hill.
 Democrats and many Republicans say they will make a serious effort to overhaul the health care system in 2009. Those changes are essential for economic recovery, they say. 
 But Mr. Obama and other Democrats have not been precise about the cost of their proposals, nor have they said in detail how they would pay for them. One of the Democrats' favorite proposals, rolling back tax cuts for high-income people, is already scheduled to occur in 2011, so, under the bookkeeping rules used by Congress, it would not produce a windfall of new revenue.
 Lawmakers from both parties said they would pay close attention to the cost of new federal subsidies for health coverage because these subsidies -- unlike the one-time bailouts for banks and other financial institutions -- would be recurring federal obligations for years to come.
 Requiring employers to provide health insurance to their employees or pay a fee to the federal government would bring in $47 billion of new federal revenue in the next 10 years, the report said. 
 A proposal to establish a national insurance pool for people who cannot obtain coverage on their own in the individual market would cost $16 billion in the next decade, it said.
 Mr. Obama and many other Democrats want the government to negotiate with drug manufacturers to get lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries. 
 The Congressional Budget Office said such negotiations ''would produce small if any savings'' because the government would not have enough leverage to secure significant discounts beyond those already obtained by private insurance companies that manage the Medicare drug benefit.
 But the budget office said Medicare could save $110 billion in the next 10 years if Congress simply imposed a form of price controls, requiring drug makers to provide the government with a 15 percent rebate, or discount, on brand-name drugs covered by the new Part D of Medicare.
 Eliminating a notorious gap in Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, known as a doughnut hole, would cost more than $130 billion over 10 years, the report said. 
 Research to compare the effectiveness of different drugs and treatments might help doctors and patients make better decisions. 
 But it would not save the government much -- $1.3 billion in the next decade -- and it would reduce total spending on health care in those years by less than one-tenth of 1 percent, the budget office said.
 The federal government could save $12 billion in the next decade if it established a procedure for approval of generic versions of expensive biotechnology drugs, the report said. It did not estimate the additional savings for consumers and employers, which could be substantial.
 The report sets forth an elaborate proposal that would allow doctors and hospitals to share in the savings if they improve the quality and reduce the cost of care for people on Medicare. 
 Under the proposal, Medicare would pay bonuses to groups of doctors who met certain performance measures. 
 In response to such financial incentives, the report said, doctors would become more efficient and would reduce ''the volume and intensity of services provided to their patients,'' saving $5 billion for Medicare in the next decade.
 In one particularly sobering chapter, the report notes that, under existing law, Medicare will cut fees paid to doctors by 21 percent in 2010 and by about 5 percent in each of the next few years. 
 To avoid such cuts and freeze payment rates at their 2009 levels would cost the government $318 billion over the next decade, the report said.

HEADLINE: President of Brazil Unveils Plan to Upgrade Military in Effort to Be Global Power

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: BRASILIA 

 BODY:
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil unveiled a new national defense strategy on Thursday, calling for upgrading the military forces and remaking the defense industry. The plan also called for a debate in Brazil on whether mandatory military service should be enforced and how the armed forces should be professionalized.
 With the commanders of Brazil's army, navy and air force in attendance, Mr. da Silva said in a speech here that Brazil, despite its pacifist history, needed a stronger defense against potential aggression if it was to continue on the road to becoming a global power. 
 The new strategic vision, more than a year in the making, calls for Brazil to invest more in military technology, including satellites, and to build a nuclear-powered submarine fleet that would be used to protect territorial waters and Brazil's deepwater oil platforms. The proposal also calls for an expansion of the armed forces to protect the country's Amazon borders and for retraining troops so they are capable of rapid-strike, guerrilla-style warfare.
 ''Brazil's vision of its military's role fits well with the country's growing international seriousness and economic and institutional capacity,'' said Michael Shifter, a vice president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy research group in Washington. ''It is seeking to be a more cohesive national power, and that requires exercising full control over its vast territory and borders.'' 
 Despite the country's recent economic boom and the strong role the military has traditionally played in Brazilian society, military spending has been stagnant and troop levels have remained steady around 312,000, the government said. Brazil spent a lower proportion of its gross domestic product on defense in 2006 than four of its South American neighbors -- Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Colombia -- according to the Security and Defense Network of Latin America, a research group based in Buenos Aires.
 The president's new military strategy, outlined in a 101-page document, has been introduced as drug trafficking increases along Brazil's Amazon borders and as some of the country's neighbors -- including Venezuela, Colombia and Chile -- have been upgrading their militaries. Venezuela has been particularly active, buying $4 billion in arms from Russia. Brazilian officials denied that Venezuela's bolstering of its armed forces or plans by the United States Navy to revive a Fourth Fleet to patrol the South Atlantic had directly influenced the creation of the new military strategy. 
 ''We are not concerned by the strength of our neighbors, but we are concerned by our own weakness,'' said Roberto Mangabeira Unger, the minister of strategic affairs and a co-author of the plan. ''The national defense strategy is not a circumstantial response to circumstantial problems. It is a far-reaching inflection, a change of course and a change of direction.''
 Relations between Brazil and Venezuela remain essentially friendly, and Latin American leaders are promoting regional unity as a way to weather the global recession. Mr. da Silva and President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela are pushing for the creation of a South American defense council, an idea that was discussed this week at a meeting in Brazil of leaders from Latin America and the Caribbean.
 The new defense strategy does call for Brazil to become more independent of other countries' military technology. It emphasizes a reorganization of the nation's defense industry to focus on forming partnerships with other countries so that Brazil is involved in creating the new technologies. ''We are no longer interested in buying weapons off the shelf,'' Mr. Mangabeira Unger said.
 Brazilian officials have approached a number of countries about potential partnerships, including the United States, India, France, Russia and Britain.
 The Brazilian Army would be reshaped to be a more mobile, quick-strike force. Only about 10 percent of its soldiers are now trained for rapid deployment. The entire army would be reconstituted at the brigade level to be able to strike quickly, ''so that a warrior would also be a guerrilla,'' Mr. Mangabeira Unger said. 
 The plan also involved enforcing existing laws on mandatory conscription to draw people from all classes, not just the poorer ones, to make for a more highly skilled fighting force. 
 ''This will be a novel debate for Brazil about national sacrifice,'' Mr. Mangabeira Unger said. ''There has been no moment in our national history when we have squarely had the kind of debate that I hope we will have now.''

HEADLINE: Picks for Labor and Trade Positions Disagree on Policy

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama has completed selections for his cabinet, and will nominate Representative Hilda L. Solis, Democrat of California, as his labor secretary and Ron Kirk, a former mayor of Dallas, as his trade representative, transition aides said.
 The appointments are expected to be announced Friday at Mr. Obama's final news conference before he heads to Hawaii for a Christmas break. Mr. Obama is also expected to formally announce his nomination of Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, for transportation secretary. 
 The nominations will cap a flurry of appointments in the past week as Mr. Obama raced to fill his 15-person cabinet before the holiday week. Among remaining vacancies on Mr. Obama's team, all are non-cabinet posts, most prominently top intelligence jobs, with Mr. Obama still not settled on a new director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and apparently not ready to announce the expected appointment of Dennis C. Blair, a retired admiral, as director of national intelligence.
 With his choices of a labor secretary and a trade representative, Mr. Obama appears to have sought to appeal to each side in the battle over free trade. Ms. Solis, a longtime labor advocate who is of Central American heritage, has been skeptical about free-trade agreements, while Mr. Kirk, a lawyer with a political bent, comes from the Texas establishment and has spoken out in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 As mayor of Dallas in 2000, Mr. Kirk was among a group of political leaders who called for permanently normalizing trade relations with China, saying that ''you're either a part of the global economic community or you're going to be left out of it.''
 Although Mr. Obama said in his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton that Nafta should be re-negotiated, he did not emphasize that approach during the general election campaign. Free-trade proponents remain hopeful that Mr. Obama will moderate his stance, as his predecessors did, now that he has been elected president.
 ''We are very pleased at Kirk's selection, and we look forward to working with him,'' said Julia K. Hughes, senior vice president for the United States Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel. ''He has been an outspoken free trade advocate, and as mayor of Dallas, recognizes the positive economic impact from trade agreements.''
 Labor activists who would speak only on condition of anonymity expressed wariness about Mr. Kirk, but made clear their strong support for Ms. Solis, a close ally of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Ms. Solis was first elected to Congress in 2000 and represents a largely Hispanic and Asian district of working-class suburbs east of Los Angeles as well as part of East Los Angeles. 
 A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials said they pushed her name for labor secretary soon after Mr. Obama was elected, although her name did not rise to the fore until several other leading candidates -- including David Bonior, a former House whip, and Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas -- withdrew their names or were ruled out. 
 Ms. Solis has championed a bill, called the Employee Free Choice Act, that is the No. 1 priority of organized labor because it would make it far easier to unionize workers. The business community bitterly opposes the bill. She is the only member of Congress on the board of American Rights at Work, a pro-union group pushing for the bill.
 ''We're thrilled at the prospect of having Representative Hilda Solis as our nation's next labor secretary,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''We're confident that she will return to the Labor Department one of its core missions: to defend workers' basic rights in our nation's workplaces. She's proven to be a passionate leader and advocate for all working families.''
 Labor leaders say they are very pleased that Ms. Solis joined them in opposing the Central American Free Trade Agreement as well as the pending trade agreement with Colombia. 
 By contrast, the reaction of business groups to the choice of Ms. Solis ranged from tactful displeasure to sharp dismay. 
 ''We're disappointed that she supports the Employee Free Choice Act,'' said Randel K. Johnson, the vice president of labor policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''We expected Obama to pick someone supported by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. She's not a pick whose philosophy we didn't expect. We will disagree with her on some issues and work with her on some.''
 Ms. Solis is a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the House Committee on Natural Resource and the new House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. 
 Mr. Obama has also settled on John P. Holdren, a Harvard physicist best known as a proponent of cutting emissions of heat-trapping gasses, intensifying energy research and limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, as his science adviser, said two people close to Dr. Holdren. Mr. Obama is expected to make that announcement in his radio address on Saturday. 
 Dr. Holdren advised the Obama campaign on climate and energy issues this year. The nomination was first described Thursday on the ScienceInsider blog of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
 Another scientist, Jane Lubchenco, an Oregon State University marine biologist and an advocate for ocean conservation and action on global warming, has been tapped to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees much of the country's research on climate.

HEADLINE: Despite Rise in Profit, FedEx Imposes Some Cuts in Pay and Pensions

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The package delivery company FedEx reported a higher quarterly profit, meeting expectations, but announced pay cuts for its salaried staff and said it was suspending retirement plan contributions. 
 FedEx said it had a hiring freeze in place and had cut staff levels at its FedEx Freight and FedEx Office units.
 FedEx said new measures included a 20 percent base salary decrease for the chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, and pay cuts of 7.5 to 10 percent for other senior executives as of Jan. 1. All other salaried personnel in the United States will have a 5 percent pay cut.
 According to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July, Mr. Smith's base salary for the company's fiscal 2009 year was set at about $1.48 million.
 The company also announced the suspension of matching contributions to FedEx's 401(k) retirement plan for a minimum of one year as of Feb. 1.
 FedEx said the cost-cutting measures would reduce expenses by $800 million by the end of its fiscal 2010 year.
 ''Our financial performance is increasingly being challenged by some of the worst economic conditions in the company's 35-year operating history,'' Mr. Smith said in a statement.
 The company said its quarterly earnings rose to $493 million, or $1.58 a share, from $479 million, or $1.54 a share, a year earlier. 
 Revenue in the period, which ended Nov. 30 and was the second quarter of FedEx's fiscal year, rose to $9.54 billion, from $9.45 billion.
 Shares of FedEx, which is based in Memphis, fell 1.37, or about 2 percent, to $62.60.

HEADLINE: The Direct Approach

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
--President-elect Barack Obama says that he wants to make his administration more responsive to the American people. To that end, his aides are introducing a host of YouTube and other efforts aimed at bypassing the media and communicating directly with voters.
 It remains to be seen whether this effort will yield satisfaction on either end of the spectrum--John Q. Public may have as difficult a time getting answers out of government officials as representatives of the mainstream media do. But to get a glimpse of how bypass-the-press might work, look no further than the Bush administration. 
 As it turns out, Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, is ahead of the game on the whole skip-the-press maneuver. Mr. McCormack started filing posts from far-flung regions more than a year ago during trips with his boss, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
 That was bad enough, as far as reporters covering the State Department were concerned. But reporters got even more ticked off when, Mr. McCormack gave readers of the State Department blog, Dipnote, a firsthand account in September of the historic meeting between Ms. Rice and the Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi in Tripoli even before he filled in reporters traveling with him on what had happened. 
 And finally, on Oct. 31, came the icing on the cake, when Mr. McCormack unveiled ''Briefing 2.0'' in the press briefing room of the State Department. --Standing before flat screen television monitors and high-tech looking computer screens Mr. McCormack didn't take questions from the press, but -- gasp! -- from the public. And then he put it on YouTube.
 It's not clear yet if Mr. Obama will ever take to YouTube to take questions on his timetable for withdrawal from Iraq. But that issue, interestingly, did come up on Tuesday when Mr. Obama met and held a sort-of press conference with a bunch of grade-school students at Dodge Renaissance Academy in Chicago. (Mr. Obama took more questions from the pint-sized group than he had done from reporters in a press conference just a few minutes earlier.)
 One student asked Mr. Obama about Iraq, and Mr. Obama replied that he plans to have troops home in a year and a half. (Mr. Obama also was asked whether he was moving to the White House in 2009, to which he replied yes, and then volunteered that he's getting a dog for his daughters, and that they better clean up after it. ''I want to make sure my daughters take care of this dog, and if they do their business, and you've got some poop, you don't just leave it there.'')
 Mr. Obama's aides do say that they intend to make full use of the millions of email address that they have collected over the course of the campaign. The Obama-Biden Web site, has an ''open for questions'' spot that was supposed to be a ''two-way dialogue between the transition team and the change.gov community,'' according to the Web site. 
 Some of the questions on the ''open for questions'' site on Wednesday:
 Q: ''Will you lift the ban on Stem Cell research in your first 100 days in office?''--James M., Nashville, TN:
 A: ''President-elect Obama is a strong supporter of Federal funding for responsible stem cell research and he has pledged to reverse President Bush's restrictions.
 Q: ''What will you do to establish transparency and safeguards against waste with the rest of the Wall Street bailout money?'' Diane, New Jersey.
 Abbreviated answer: ''President-elect Barack Obama does not believe an economic crisis is an excuse for wasteful and unnecessary spending. We will put in place reforms to ensure that your money is invested well. All appointees who lead the executive branch departments and rulemaking agencies will be required to conduct the significant business of the agency in public so that every citizen can see in person or watch on the Internet these debates.''
 YouTube, watch out. Your government is headed your way.

HEADLINE: Blessed Are (Some of) the Cheesemakers

BYLINE: ROBERT MACKEY


HIGHLIGHT: Italy bails out Parmesan producers. But what about buffalo mozzarella? 

 BODY:
While most Americans have been more concerned with the fate of the on-again, off-again -- on-again -- bailout of U.S. automakers, food industry observers have been writing, and joking, about another recent government bailout that got done a whole lot faster, of Italy's Parmesan producers.
As Corriere della Sera reported in October, and The Wall Street Journal explained last week, 
The world is bailing out banks and car companies. Italy is coming to the rescue of parmigiano cheese.
In an effort to help producers of the cheese commonly grated over spaghetti, fettuccine and other pastas, the Italian government is buying 100,000 wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano and donating them to charity.
Though demand for parmigiano is strong in Italy and abroad, producers have been struggling for years to make money, putting the future of Italy's favorite cheese at risk. ...
Italian consumers seem to support the cheese bailout, which also includes a purchase of 100,000 wheels of another grating variety, Grana Padano. The operation will cost (EURO)50 million.
To pay for the parmigiano wheels, the Italian government is dipping into a special European Union fund meant to help feed needy people.
According to Reuters' Deepa Babington, the core problem is that 
The large round blocks of cheese now command a wholesale price of only 7 euros to 7.5 euros per kilogram ($9.61-$10.29 per 2.2 lb), while adhering to the strict guidelines to make Parmesan mean a minimum of 8 to 8.5 euros per kilogram is needed just to cover costs.
As The Journal's Davide Berretta wrote, authentic Parmesan -- known more correctly as Parmigiano-Reggiano -- is made only by "about 430 small, family-owned businesses that dot the plains outside the northern city of Parma." 
A European court ruled earlier this year that only cheese made in this region can be called Parmesan, but the region's cheesemakers have to adhere to these strict production guidelines if they want to keep their corner on the market. So, as the Journal reported: 
There's little parmigiano makers can do -- partly because producers have to follow strict legal requirements for their cheese to obtain the official "Parmigiano Reggiano" seal of approval.
The milk that goes into parmigiano has to come exclusively from hay-fed cows that are milked twice a day. Then each wheel needs to ripen for at least a year. While they ripen, parmigiano wheels usually sit in stacks in a large shed. A big machine moves between the stacks, brushing and turning each wheel once a week. The room is heated in the winter and cooled in the summer.
In an interview with the BBC -- streamed this week on the World Service podcastNewsPod -- Leo Bertozzi, director of the Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano-Reggiano, tried hard to avoid the implication that the Italian government's decision to purchase 100,000 wheels of the cheese was, in fact, a bai-out. Mr. Bertozzi stressed that the cheese would be used to feed the poor and said he was glad his industry could be involved in that noble effort.
The Journal notes that producers of another type of Italian cheese that was not purchased in mass quantities by the government certainly see it as a bailout, and they are not happy to have been left out.
"We've never received a single dime in state aid," complains Vincenzo Oliviero, who heads the association of buffalo mozzarella producers.
To be more precise, the Journal wrote that mozzarella makers are "making a stink." One interesting side note to the coverage of the cheese bailout in the English-language press is that it seems to have inspired a sort of arms race of punning. The Journal's article came with the headline "Hard Times for Parmigiano Makers Have Italy Ponying Up the Cheddar." Not to be outdone, the Telegraph's recounting of the story came with a photo caption advising a man pictured with a wheel of Parmesan to "Say cheese." The Age, in Australia, went with "Mozzarella makers cheesed off at parmesan bail-out." The Times of London claimed to see a regional divide in Italy as a result of the policy: "North says hard cheese as parmesan subsidy grates with struggling southern mozzarella makers."
But no one took things quite so far as the author of a Financial Times editorial who left no pun unturned:
Producers of parmigiano in the Emilia-Romagna region smell the pungent whiff of trouble. With many selling their cheese at below cost, parmigiano makers are facing the prospect of going out of business - some are even using their cheese as collateral against bank loans they are using to pay for workers' salaries. Now Luca Zaia, the big cheese for agriculture in the Italian government, has intervened, announcing a (EURO)50m bail-out for the celebrated . 
The move has already grated producers of other cheese varieties. Makers of buffalo mozzarella, for instance, fear that without dipping into a fondue of government cash they too may fall by the whey-side. The blood of some economic observers has curdled at the thought of the Italian government rescuing any and every industry facing difficulty. Unlike the cheese itself, the case for protecting parmigiano has not been easy for some to digest.

HEADLINE: In a Hotbed of Sin and Vice, Studying to Spread God's Word

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Out of the myriad and random tenants that fill the Empire State Building, there is one that seems both perfectly situated, yet jarringly out of place.
 It is the King's College, an evangelical Christian school that is all but hidden in plain sight, occupying three of the building's floors -- two of them subterranean -- since 1999. On the one hand, it seems apt that a school claiming close adherence to God's word would occupy New York's tallest skyscraper. 
 On the other hand, most of the college's 258 students are politically and economically conservative, opposed to abortion and generally against gay marriage, drunkenness and premarital sex. The polar opposites, in other words, of the kind of boozing, godless, kick-up-your-heels, bed-hopping liberals that Manhattan supposedly draws. 
 Which raises a question: What is an evangelical Christian college doing in the middle of New York?
 The answer, those at the school say, is simple. They are in New York to learn and, possibly, reshape the world a little.
 ''We see ourselves as a value-adding school, where we are bilingual; we can speak 'Christianese' and also express our ideas in ways that change people's views,'' said Andrew Mills, the chairman of the college's trustees. ''We wanted a school that engages in debates, and it's hard to have those debates from the middle of a cornfield in Iowa.''
 Or as Marvin Olasky, the school's provost, put it, ''We want to take the hick out of the word 'evangelical.' ''
 The King's College was founded in the seaside town of Belmar, N.J., 70 years ago, before moving to Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., in 1955. The college closed after going bankrupt in 1994, and reopened five years later with 17 students after its backers raised enough funds. 
 Its setting, college leaders say, was a deliberate move. They wanted students to be exposed to new ideas and hone their intellectual chops far from the ''holy huddle,'' places that are religiously and ideologically sealed off from the rest of the world. 
 ''There are pockets of Christians in America that don't combine rigorous thinking with Christianity,'' said David Lapp, 22, a senior from Lancaster, Pa. ''But you can be a rigorous thinker and a very serious Christian as well.''
 The school's core curriculum is modeled on Oxford University's politics, philosophy and economics degree, sidestepping subjects like creationism while embracing the conservative tenets of lower taxes and small government. Visitors whose views are at odds with the school's principles have appeared at the college, including Christopher Hitchens, whose latest book is ''God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.'' 
 The college's mandate, Mr. Mills said, is to encourage students to engage people with differing viewpoints, and ideally to shape public discourse ''in a way that is winsome, and not screechy from the Christian right.''
 The college's main offices are on the Empire State Building's 15th floor, flooded with light and home to a grandfather clock that gongs every 15 minutes. The two basement levels are windowless and cozily lighted, and house classrooms, a student lounge and the library. 
 Clues about the college's philosophical underpinnings reveal themselves here and there. One bulletin board recently listed the activities of the various houses, the King's College version of sororities and fraternities. The houses are named after Christian and conservative heroes (Ronald Reagan, C. S. Lewis and Margaret Thatcher) and historical activists (Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton and Sojourner Truth). 
 The college is creating more offices and a classroom in a building at 33rd Street and Fifth Avenue, with plans to increase the number of students to 850. 
 Unlike many other Christian schools, the King's College does not ban dancing, drinking, gambling, smoking or premarital sex. Still, with the exceptions of smoking and dancing, its students say they are far less likely to indulge in such pastimes than most other college students in town. 
 ''One of the reasons we're not interested in getting drunk like 'typical' college students is because our faith teaches us that being responsible, and in some cases abstaining from those things, offers the most fulfilling life,'' Jonathan Seidl, 21, a senior from Manitowoc, Wis., wrote in an e-mail message. The same applied, several students said, to premarital sex. 
 For the most part, the college imposes few strictures on its students. Beyond abiding by a basic honor code -- to not lie, cheat or steal -- ''you're basically on your own,'' said Hope Hodge, 21, who is from Waltham, Mass., and is the editor of the school paper. ''If you want to see the seedy underbelly,'' she said, ''it's right there.''
 There is no on-campus housing; instead, most freshmen live, unsupervised, in nearby college apartments. Nor is there any religious service on campus, though many students attend ''Tent,'' a student-run service dedicated to Bible readings and Christian songs. 
 ''The school and city naturally draws people who want to take chances,'' said Mr. Seidl, who shares an apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn, with a classmate, Bryan Nance. 
 Students come from 13 countries and 40-plus states, with many getting financial aid and scholarships and just 1 percent paying the full cost of tuition and housing, which runs around $31,500 a year. 
 Recently, Kathy Leedy, the college's assistant vice president for development, brought together a group of six students to chat about their experiences at the college. Two were home-schooled, one was brought up Roman Catholic, and Mr. Nance, from Stokesdale, N.C., who is 23 and a graduating senior, transferred from the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., after finding some of its teachings too narrow and the approach too didactic. 
 Being a Christian, Mr. Nance decided, was not about imposing ideas, but instead about being inquisitive and wrestling with new ones.
 ''As Christians, we love people, and where are there more people than New York?'' asked Stephanie Stallo, 22, a graduating senior from Brentwood, Tenn. ''We don't want to be tucked away on the far right.''

HEADLINE: How India Avoided A Crisis

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
MUMBAI
''What has taken a number of us by surprise is the lack of adequate supervision and regulation,'' Rana Kapoor was saying the other day. ''This was despite the fact that Enron had happened and you passed Sarbanes-Oxley. We don't understand it. Maybe it's because we sit in a more controlled economy but ....'' He smiled sweetly as his voice trailed off, as if to take the sting off his comments. But they stung nonetheless. 
Mr. Kapoor is an Indian banker, a former longtime Bank of America executive with a Rutgers M.B.A. who, along with his business partner and brother-in-law, Ashok Kapur, was granted government permission four years ago to start a private bank, which they called Yes Bank. In the United States, Yes Bank is the kind of name a go-go banker might give to, say, a high-flying mortgage lender in the middle of a bubble. (You can even imagine the slogan: ''Yes is part of our name!'') But Yes Bank is not exactly the Washington Mutual of India. One news release it hands out to reporters who come calling is an excerpt from a 2007 survey by The Financial Express: ''#1 on Credit Quality amongst 56 Banks in India,'' reads the headline.
I arrived in Mumbai three weeks after the terrorist attacks that killed 200 people -- including, tragically, Yes Bank's co-founder Mr. Kapur, who had served as the company's nonexecutive chairman and was gunned down while having dinner at the Oberoi Hotel. (His wife and two dinner companions miraculously escaped.)
My hope in traveling to Mumbai was to learn about the current state of Indian business in the wake of both the credit crisis and the attacks. But in my first few days in this grand, sprawling, chaotic city, what I mainly heard, especially talking to bankers, was about America, not India. How could we have brought so much trouble on ourselves, and the rest of the world, by acting in such an obviously foolhardy manner? Didn't we understand that you can't lend money to people who lack the means to pay it back? The questions were asked with a sense of bewilderment -- and an occasional hint of scorn. Like most Americans, I didn't have any good answers. It was a bubble, I would respond with a sheepish shrug, as if that were an adequate explanation. It isn't, of course.
''In India, we never had anything close to the subprime loan,'' said Chandra Kochhar, the chief financial officer of India's largest private bank, Icici. (A few days after I spoke to her, Ms. Kochhar was named the bank's new chief executive, in a move that had long been anticipated.) ''All lending to individuals is based on their income. That is a big difference between your banking system and ours.'' She continued: ''Indian banks are not levered like American banks. Capital ratios are 12 and 13 percent, instead of 7 or 8 percent. All those exotic structures like C.D.O. and securitizations are a very tiny part of our banking system. So a lot of the temptations didn't exist.''
And when I went to see Deepak Parekh, the chief executive of HDFC, which was founded in 1977 as the country's first specialized mortgage bank, practically the first words out of his mouth were these: ''We don't do interest-only or subprime loans. When the bubble was going on, we did not change any of our policies. We did not change any of our systems. We did not change our thought process. We never gave more money to a borrower because the value of the house had gone up. Citibank has a few home equity loans, but most banks in India don't make those kinds of loans. Our nonperforming loans are less than 1 percent.''
Yet two years ago, the Indian real estate market -- commercial and residential alike -- was every bit as frothy as the American market. High-rises were being slapped up on spec. Housing developments were sprouting up everywhere. And there was plenty of money flowing into India, mainly from private equity and hedge funds, to fuel the commercial real estate bubble in particular. Goldman Sachs, Carlyle, Blackstone, Citibank -- they were all here, throwing money at developers. So why did the Indian banks stay on the sidelines and avoid most of the pain that has been suffered by the big American banks?
Part of the reason is cultural. Indians are simply not as comfortable with credit as Americans. ''A lot of Indians, when you push them, will say that if you spend more than you earn you will get in trouble,'' an Indian consultant told me. ''Americans spent more than they earned.''
Mr. Parekh said, ''Savings are important. Joint families exist. When one son moves out, the family helps them. So you don't borrow so much from the bank.'' Even mortgage loans tend to have down payments in India that are a third of the purchase price, a far cry from the United States, where 20 percent is the new norm. (Let's not even think about what they used to be.)
But there was also another factor, perhaps the most important of all. India had a bank regulator who was the anti-Greenspan. His name was Dr. Y. V. Reddy, and he was the governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Seventy percent of the banking system in India is nationalized, so a strong regulator is critical, since any banking scandal amounts to a national political scandal as well. And in the irascible Mr. Reddy, who took office in 2003 and stepped down this past September, it had exactly the right man in the right job at the right time.
''He basically believed that if bankers were given the opportunity to sin, they would sin,'' said one banker who asked not to be named because, well, there's not much percentage in getting on the wrong side of the Reserve Bank of India. For all the bankers' talk about their higher lending standards, the truth is that Mr. Reddy made them even more stringent during the bubble.
Unlike Alan Greenspan, who didn't believe it was his job to even point out bubbles, much less try to deflate them, Mr. Reddy saw his job as making sure Indian banks did not get too caught up in the bubble mentality. About two years ago, he started sensing that real estate, in particular, had entered bubble territory. One of the first moves he made was to ban the use of bank loans for the purchase of raw land, which was skyrocketing. Only when the developer was about to commence building could the bank get involved -- and then only to make construction loans. (Guess who wound up financing the land purchases? United States private equity and hedge funds, of course!)
Then, as securitizations and derivatives gained increasing prominence in the world's financial system, the Reserve Bank of India sharply curtailed their use in the country. When Mr. Reddy saw American banks setting up off-balance-sheet vehicles to hide debt, he essentially banned them in India. As a result, banks in India wound up holding onto the loans they made to customers. On the one hand, this meant they made fewer loans than their American counterparts because they couldn't sell off the loans to Wall Street in securitizations. On the other hand, it meant they still had the incentive -- as American banks did not -- to see those loans paid back.
Seeing inflation on the horizon, Mr. Reddy pushed interest rates up to more than 20 percent, which of course dampened the housing frenzy. He increased risk weightings on commercial buildings and shopping mall construction, doubling the amount of capital banks were required to hold in reserve in case things went awry. He made banks put aside extra capital for every loan they made. In effect, Mr. Reddy was creating liquidity even before there was a global liquidity crisis.
Did India's bankers stand up to applaud Mr. Reddy as he was making these moves? Of course not. They were naturally furious, just as American bankers would have been if Mr. Greenspan had been more active. Their regulator was holding them back, constraining their growth! Mr. Parekh told me that while he had been saying for some time that Indian real estate was in bubble territory, he was still unhappy with the rules imposed by Mr. Reddy. ''We were critical of the central bank,'' he said. ''We thought these were harsh measures.''
''For a while we were wondering if we were missing out on something,'' said Ms. Kochhar of Icici. Banks in the United States seemed to have come up with some magical new formula for making money: make loans that required no down payment and little in the way of verification -- and post instant, short-term, profits.
As Luis Miranda, who runs a private equity firm devoted to developing India's infrastructure, put it: ''We kept wondering if they had figured out something that we were too dense to figure out. It looked like they were smart and we were stupid.'' Instead, India was the smart one, and we were the stupid ones.
Ms. Kochhar said that the underlying risks of having ''a majority of loans not owned by the people who originated them'' was not apparent during the bubble. Now that those risks have been made painfully clear, every banker in India realizes that Mr. Reddy did the right thing by limiting securitizations. ''At times like this, you tend to appreciate what he did more than we did at the time,'' said Mr. Kapoor. ''He saved us,'' added Mr. Parekh.
As the credit crisis has spread these past months, no Indian bank has come close to failing the way so many United States and European financial institutions have. None have required the kind of emergency injections of capital that Western banks have needed. None have had the huge write-downs that were par for the course in the West. As the bubble has burst, which lenders have taken the hit? Why, the private equity and hedge fund lenders who had been so eager to finance land development. Us, in others words, rather than them. Why is that not a surprise?
When I asked Mr. Kapoor for his take on what had happened in the United States, he replied: ''We recognize it as a problem of plenty. It was perpetuated by greedy bankers, whether investment bankers or commercial bankers. The greed to make money is the impression it has made here. Anytime they wanted a loan, people just dipped into their home A.T.M. It was like money was on call.''
So it was. And our regulators, unlike theirs, just stood by and let it happen. The next time we're moving into bubble territory, perhaps we can take a page from Mr. Reddy's book -- sometimes it's better to apply the brakes too early than too late. Or, as was the case with Mr. Greenspan, not at all.
None of this is to say that the global credit crisis hasn't affected India. It certainly has. I'll be back after the holidays with more columns from India, including how Sept. 15 -- the day Lehman Brothers defaulted -- changed everything, even here, on the other side of the world.
Correction: December 23, 2008, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Talking Business column on Saturday, about India's avoiding the subprime lending crisis, reversed the initials of a former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, whose policies helped hold bankers to high lending standards. He is Y. V. Reddy. The error also appeared in an accompanying caption.

HEADLINE: Lose Confidence in Your Bank? Try the Web for Financial Help

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- When the financial sector took a dive this fall, the entrepreneurs behind a new batch of personal finance sites worried that they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
After all, if people no longer trusted their banks, why would they trust some start-up with their most private financial information?
As it turns out, interest in these sites is up, not down. Burned by their banks and the stock market, people seeking help with budgeting, saving and investing are turning to sites with names like Mint, SmartyPig, Cake Financial, Wesabe and Credit Karma.
''There is a significant loss of confidence with banks right now,'' said David Furlonger, a vice president at the research firm Gartner, who studies the financial services industry. ''People are turning to whatever communities they think are best able to serve them.'' 
Visits to online personal finance sites are up threefold over last year, said Jim Bruene, founder of the trade publisher Online Financial Innovations, and many of the sites say they have grown quickly since the crisis worsened in September.
Mint, which tracks users' financial accounts and creates budgets, has 630,000 registered users, a quarter of whom have joined since the fall.
''The worse the news was, the more people started using Mint,'' said Aaron Patzer, founder and chief executive of the company, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. ''People realize they need to get a better handle on their money.''
The economic crisis is hitting Web start-ups particularly hard, causing cash shortages, layoffs and, in some cases, bankruptcy. Finance sites are, of course, vulnerable to these threats, and not all will survive. But they are hoping that once the crisis recedes, the customer base they are building now will linger.
Money-tracking sites like Mint, Wesabe and Quicken Online pull financial information from the accounts of users and analyze it with graphs showing, say, how much money they spend in restaurants compared with how much they are saving for retirement. On social investing sites, including Cake Financial, Inner8 and Covestor, people rely on other members for investment tips.
Other sites solve narrower pieces of the financial puzzle. PearBudget walks users through creating a budget with an online spreadsheet application. Credit Karma lets people check their credit scores free as often as they want, and track and discuss their progress in improving them. On SmartyPig, users share savings goals with friends, and the site withdraws money from their checking account each month.
The biggest challenge for these sites has been earning the trust of wary Internet users.
The sites use security measures like encryption and are certified by Web security firms. But Mint users who want the site to consolidate information from their online banking and investment accounts must entrust it with their passwords. Other sites involve frank discussions of one's net worth and debts (although anonymity is allowed).
The risks did not discourage Holli Buck, 38, an administrative assistant in Canton, Mich., who turned to SmartyPig in November after she was laid off from her third job in 11 months. She is using the site to save money for an online copywriting class so she can freelance.
''Because of the crisis, I actually felt more comfortable than if this were some big bank,'' Ms. Buck said. ''With everything that's going on with banks, I'm not ready to give them my money. This Web site makes me feel safer.''
Xavier Shellman, 27, a student in Asbury Park, N.J., said she trusted SmartyPig because it sends her Twitter updates and has a Facebook page. ''There's someone there; it's not just some banker somewhere making millions of dollars with your money,'' she said.
Personal finance Web sites are almost as old as the Web. Banks began offering their customers online banking a decade ago, and the dot-com bubble brought successes like Financial Engines and failures like MyCFO and Mortgage.com.
The older sites offer articles, financial planning advice and interest rate comparisons. The new ones use Web 2.0 tools to help people analyze their financial situation and swap investment ideas.
''It's the wisdom of the masses,'' said Michael Healy, 33, a recruiter in San Francisco who discusses investments on Cake Financial. Marc Hedlund, co-founder and chief executive of Wesabe, said: ''Oftentimes you don't want to talk about stressful financial issues with your friends. Online, you can come in an anonymous way, talk about the things you're struggling with and get feedback.''
There are holdouts who still depend on tools like Excel and the PC version of Quicken to manage their finances. ''I tend to be pretty protective of my personal finance information,'' said Trent Hamm, 30, who writes The Simple Dollar, a personal finance blog, from Des Moines. ''To me, it's not worth that risk.''
If these sites are to go mainstream, they will have to persuade people like Mr. Hamm to sign on. Some have affiliated themselves with banks to demonstrate that they are backed by an established institution. The money saved on SmartyPig in the United States, for example, is held by West Bank of West Des Moines, Iowa.
Persuading people to keep coming back can be difficult, too. ''My biggest fear is that if it's always bad news, month after month, that at one point people just don't want to know how much money they don't have,'' Mr. Patzer said.
To encourage return visits, Mint is unveiling a new feature in March that grades the financial fitness of users in 12 categories, like late payment fees on credit cards and retirement savings.
Though the financial crisis has bolstered visitor numbers, it has strained revenue. Cake Financial was forced to do two rounds of layoffs this fall and is just starting to generate revenue. SmartyPig, Mint and Wesabe have revenue but are not yet profitable.
Venture capitalists are betting millions on the notion that financial help on the Web can be profitable. Mint has raised $17 million from Benchmark Capital and the angel investor Ron Conway, among others. Mr. Conway also invested in Cake Financial. Wesabe has raised $4.7 million from a group including Union Square Ventures and Tim O'Reilly, the technology publisher.
Many of these sites earn some money through advertisements from financial firms. An October report from the research firm Forrester predicted that despite the recession, spending on Web marketing by financial institutions would double by 2012.
Yet revenue for many of the start-ups comes mostly from referral fees earned when customers successfully sign up for new credit cards or checking accounts. Though more people are clicking on such offers, fewer are getting approved.
The start-ups hope that when the economic climate improves, the hunger for financial guidance will persist.
''Human nature didn't change in September,'' said Mr. Hedlund of Wesabe. ''They're still going to have trouble managing their money.''

HEADLINE: Foreign Investors Trade Safe for Safest

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
AS foreign investors pour cash into United States securities, particularly short-term Treasury bills, they are pulling it out of the higher-yielding bonds issued by the government supported-entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 The moves appear to indicate that even after the government bailout of the two agencies, there is some lingering doubt that the government would actually stand behind their debts if their situation grew much worse.
 The Treasury Department reported this week that in October, overseas investors and governments were net sellers of $50 billion of agency securities, even though they yield significantly more than comparable Treasuries, which the investors bought at a record rate.
 Over the summer, prices of agency securities fell as the financial crisis grew worse and some investors began to doubt whether the ''implicit'' government guarantee behind the agencies could be trusted. In July and August, foreigners were net sellers of $64 billion of such securities, an outflow unlike any previously seen.
 That flight was one reason the government stepped in on Sept. 7 to effectively nationalize the agencies, although shares remain publicly traded. At first investors seemed reassured, but the confidence has now waned.
 Despite the nationalization, the government has stopped short of putting its full faith and credit behind the bonds. The new data is the first indication that may have mattered to many overseas investors.
 The accompanying chart at the top shows the monthly flows this year of foreign cash into Treasury securities and agency securities. More foreign money came into Treasuries in October -- almost $91 billion -- than in any previous month.
 Most of the money -- $56 billion in October -- has gone into Treasury bills rather than into longer-dated bonds and notes. That flow helped to push down interest rates on bills to historically low levels, sometimes even a bit below zero, as investors sought complete safety.
 Until the housing market began to show significant weakness in 2007, foreign flows into agency securities were running at almost $300 billion a year, and the flow stayed strong until the summer scare.
 The other chart shows that over the 12 months through October, foreigners put just $65 billion into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the lowest for any such period since 1998. Unless there was a revival of overseas interest in those securities in November and December, 2008 could become the first year to see net sales, at least since the data became available in the early 1990s.
 Until the late 1990s there was relatively little overseas investment in agency securities. But as the Clinton-era budget surpluses reduced the supply of available Treasuries, foreign investors discovered these investments, which seemed to be close substitutes. Even after large budget deficits resumed early this decade, the overseas demand for agencies continued to grow until questions about their solvency began to be heard.
 Now, virtually all the foreign money is going into Treasuries -- at a rate of more than half a trillion dollars a year.

By the end, the world itself was too small to support the vast Ponzi scheme constructed by Bernard L. Madoff.
Initially, he tapped local money pulled in from country clubs and charity dinners, where investors sought him out to casually plead with him to manage their savings so they could start reaping the steady, solid returns their envied friends were getting.
Then, he and his promoters set sights on Europe, again framing the investments as memberships in a select club. A Swiss hedge fund manager, Michel Dominice, still remembers the pitch he got a few years ago from a salesman in Geneva. ''He told me the fund was closed, that it was something I couldn't buy,'' Mr. Dominice said. ''But he told me he might have a way to get me in. It was weird.''
Mr. Madoff's agents next cut a cash-gathering swath through the Persian Gulf, then Southeast Asia. Finally, they were hurtling with undignified speed toward China, with invitations to invest that were more desperate, less exclusive. One Beijing businessman who was approached said it seemed the Madoff funds were being pitched ''to anyone who would listen.'' 
The juggernaut began to sputter this fall as investors, rattled by the financial crisis and reaching for cash, started taking money out faster than Mr. Madoff could bring fresh cash in the door. He was arrested on Dec. 11 at his Manhattan apartment and charged with securities fraud, turned in the night before by his sons after he told them his entire business was ''a giant Ponzi scheme.''
The case is still viewed more with mystery than clarity, and Mr. Madoff's version of events can only be drawn from statements attributed to him by federal prosecutors and regulators as he has not commented publicly on the case.
But whatever else Mr. Madoff's game was, it was certainly this: The first worldwide Ponzi scheme -- a fraud that lasted longer, reached wider and cut deeper than any similar scheme in history, entirely eclipsing the puny regional ambitions of Charles Ponzi, the Boston swindler who gave his name to the scheme nearly a century ago.
''Absolutely -- there has been nothing like this, nothing that we could call truly global,'' said Mitchell Zuckoff, the author of ''Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend'' and a professor at Boston University. These classic schemes typically prey on local trust, he added. ''So this says what we increasingly know to be true about the world: The barriers have come down; money knows no borders, no limits.''
While many of the known victims of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities are prominent Jewish executives and organizations -- Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Spitzers, Yeshiva University, the Elie Wiesel Foundation and charities set up by the publisher Mortimer B. Zuckerman and the Hollywood director Steven Spielberg -- it now appears that anyone with money was a potential target. Indeed, at one point, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, a large sovereign wealth fund in the Middle East, had entrusted some $400 million to Mr. Madoff's firm.
Regulators say Mr. Madoff himself estimated that $50 billion in personal and institutional wealth from around the world was gone. It vanished from the estates of the North Shore of Long Island, from the beachfront suites of Palm Beach, from the exclusive enclaves of Europe. Before it evaporated, it helped finance Mr. Madoff's coddled lifestyle, with a Manhattan apartment, a beachfront mansion in the Hamptons, a small villa overlooking Cap d'Antibes on the French Riviera, a Mayfair office in London and yachts in New York, Florida and the Mediterranean.
Just as the scheme transcended national borders, it left local regulators far behind. Its lies were translated into a half-dozen languages. Its larceny was denominated in a half-dozen currencies. Its warning signals were missed by enforcement agencies around the globe. And its victims are now scattered from Hollywood to Zurich to Abu Dhabi.
Indeed, while the most visible pain may be local -- an important charity forced to close, an esteemed university embarrassed, a fabric of community trust shredded -- the clearest lesson is universal: When money goes global, fraud does too.
Bernie Who?
In 1960, as Wall Street was just shaking off its postwar lethargy and starting to buzz again, Bernie Madoff (pronounced MAY-doff) set up his small trading firm. His plan was to make a business out of trading lesser-known over-the-counter stocks on the fringes of the traditional stock market. He was just 22, a graduate of Hofstra University on Long Island.
By 1989, Mr. Madoff 's firm was handling more than 5 percent of the trading volume on the august New York Stock Exchange, and Financial World magazine ranked him among the highest-paid people on Wall Street -- along with two far more famous financiers, the junk bond king Michael Milken and George Soros, the international investor.
And in 1990, he became the nonexecutive chairman of the Nasdaq market, which at the time was operated as a committee of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
His rise on Wall Street was built on his belief in a visionary notion that seemed bizarre to many at the time: That stocks could be traded by people who never saw each other but were connected only by electronics.
In the mid-1970s, he had spent over $250,000 to upgrade the computer equipment at the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, where he began offering to buy and sell stocks that were listed on the Big Board. The exchange, in effect, was transformed into the first all-electronic computerized stock exchange.
''He was one of the early innovators,'' said Michael Ocrant, a journalist who has been a longtime skeptic about Mr. Madoff's investing success. ''He was known to promote the idea that trading would be going electronic -- and that turned out to be true.''
He also invested in new electronic trading technology for his firm, making it cheaper for brokerage firms to fill their stock orders. He eventually gained a large amount of business from big firms like A. G. Edwards & Sons, Charles Schwab & Company, Quick & Reilly and Fidelity Brokerage Services. ''He was really a low-key guy. No one knew him outside of the sphere of market makers and people in the trading and brokerage business,'' said Richard B. Niehoff, who was president of the Cincinnati exchange in the mid-1980s.
Mr. Madoff's push to modernize trading did not make him popular with the traditional traders on the floor of the New York Exchange, as more of its orders were sent to his firm -- partly because he was faster and cheaper, but also because he paid for those orders.
Mr. Madoff pioneered a controversial practice called ''payment for order flow.'' He would pay big players like Fidelity and Schwab to send their customer orders to his firm instead of to the New York Exchange or other regional exchanges.
The floor traders at those traditional exchanges claimed he was, in essence, paying bribes and that brokers steering business to him were not really getting the best prices for their customers.
Those complaints led to Congressional hearings, but Mr. Madoff made no apologies. He insisted the order-flow payments were necessary to inject greater competition into the marketplace and reduce the near monopoly of the Big Board.
As the debate received more attention, Mr. Madoff became increasingly better known in the financial world. By the end of the technology bubble in 2000, his firm was the largest market maker on the Nasdaq electronic market, and he was a member of the Securities Industry Association, now known as the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's principal lobbying arm.
Still, one Wall Street heavyweight who knew him in those days said he remained ''a self-effacing kind of guy,'' more likely to spend time on the Riviera than at parties with other traders.
Local Hero
Unlike some prominent Wall Street figures who built their fortunes during the heady 1980s and '90s, Mr. Madoff never became a household name among American investors. But in the clubby world of Jewish philanthropy in the New York area, his increasing wealth and growing reputation among market insiders added polish to his personal prestige.
He became a generous donor, then a courted board member and, finally, the money manager of choice for many prominent regional charities.
A spokeswoman for the New York Community Trust, Ani Hurwitz, recalled a Long Island couple who asked the trust in 1994 to invest their proposed $20 million fund with Mr. Madoff. ''We have an investment committee that oversees all investments, and they couldn't get anything out of him, no information, nothing,'' Ms. Hurwitz said. ''So we told the donors we wouldn't do it.''
But many charities did entrust their money to Mr. Madoff, to their eventual grief. The North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, for instance, reported that it had lost $5.7 million on an investment with Mr. Madoff that was made at the donor's behest. (That donor has pledged to cover the loss for the hospital system, its spokesman said.)
Other groups saw the handsome returns on those initial investments and put more of their money into Mr. Madoff's firm, their leaders said. ''Look, for years we made money,'' one said.
Most successful business executives intertwine their personal and professional lives. But those two strands of Mr. Madoff's life were practically inseparable. He sometimes used his 55-foot fishing boat, Bull, as a floating entertainment center for clients. He used his support of organizations like the Public Theater in Manhattan and the Special Olympics to build a network of trust that began to stretch wider and deeper into the Jewish community.
Through friends, the Madoff network reached well beyond New York. At Oak Ridge Country Club, in suburban Hopkins, Minn., known for a prosperous Jewish membership, many who belonged were introduced to the Madoff firm by one of his friends, Mike Engler.
The quiet message became familiar in similar pockets of Jewish wealth and trust: ''I know Bernie. I can get you in.'' Mr. Engler died in 1994, but many Oak Ridge members remained clients of Mr. Madoff. One elderly member, who said he was too embarrassed to be named, said he had lost tens of millions of dollars, and had friends who had been ''completely wiped out.''
Dozens of now-outraged Madoff investors recall that special lure -- the sense that they were being allowed into an inner circle, one that was not available to just anyone. A lawyer would call a client, saying: ''I'm setting up a fund for Bernie Madoff. Do you want in?'' Or an accountant at a golf club might tell his partner for the day: ''I can make an introduction. Let me know.'' Deals were struck in steakhouses and at charity events, sometimes by Mr. Madoff himself, but with increasing frequency by friends acting on his behalf.
''In a social setting -- that's where it always happened,'' said Jerry Reisman, a lawyer from Garden City, N.Y., who knew Mr. Madoff socially. ''Country clubs, golf courses, locker rooms. Recommendations, word of mouth. That's how it was done.''
At exclusive retreats like the Palm steakhouse in East Hampton, Mr. Madoff would work the tables or receive friends at his own, building a following that came to include lawyers, doctors, real estate developers and accountants. Tomas Romano, a manager at the Palm, recalled that ''people always came to talk with him'' at the restaurant. ''He was very well known.''
At his golf clubs -- the Atlantic in Bridgehampton and the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida, for example -- he frequently shot in the 80s, but often seemed far more interested in his fellow members, many of whom became investors, than in the game itself.
With his wife, Ruth, a nutritionist and cookbook editor, they were considered affable and charming people. ''They stood out,'' Mr. Reisman said. ''Success, philanthropy, esteem -- and, if you were lucky enough to be with him as an investor, money.''
He added: ''That was the most important thing; he was looked on as someone who could make you money. Really make you money.''
The Go-Betweens
By the mid-1990s, as Mr. Madoff's wealth and social standing grew, he had moved far beyond the days when golf-club buddies were setting up side deals to invest with him through their lawyers and accountants. Some of the most prominent Jewish figures in high finance and industry began to court Bernie Madoff -- and, through them, he reached a new orbit of wealth.
He could not have had a more effective recruiter than Jacob Ezra Merkin, a lion of Wall Street who would be president of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue. Mr. Merkin's father, Hermann, was the founding president of the synagogue and Herman Wouk, the author, wrote its constitution.
As a direct descendant of the founder of modern Orthodox Judaism and a graduate of Columbia's English department and Harvard's law school, Mr. Merkin easily held his own in a congregation that included such luminaries as the author Elie Wiesel, the deal maker Ronald O. Perelman and Ira Rennert, a wealthy financier perhaps best known for building one of the biggest houses and compounds in the Hamptons.
Mr. Merkin was fluent in Jewish and secular studies, as comfortatle quoting Psalms as William James. In 1985, after a few years of practicing law at a top-tier firm, now known as Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, he started the investment firm that would become Gabriel Capital Group. He contributed to a popular textbook on investing, lived in an art-filled Park Avenue apartment and continued his family's legacy of generosity.
Philanthropies embraced him. He headed the investment committee for the UJA-Federation of New York for 10 years and was on the boards of Yeshiva University, Carnegie Hall and other nonprofit organizations. He became the chairman of GMAC.
Installed in these lofty positions of trust, Ezra Merkin seemed to be a Wall Street wise man who could be trusted completely to manage other people's money. One vehicle through which he did that was a fund called Ascot Partners.
It was one of an unknown number of deals that prominent financial figures set up in recent years and marketed to investors, who thought they were tapping into the acumen of some Wall Street titan, like Mr. Merkin.
As it turned out, their money wound up in the same place -- in Bernie Madoff's hands.
These conduits began to steer billions of dollars into the Madoff operation. They operated below the financial radar until Mr. Madoff's scheme collapsed, when investors suddenly got letters from the sponsoring titan disclosing that all or most of their money was probably gone.
Ascot itself attracted $1.8 billion in investments, almost all of which was entrusted to Mr. Madoff. New York Law School put $3 million into Ascot two years ago, and has now initiated a lawsuit in federal court that accuses Mr. Merkin of abdicating his duties to the partnership.
Mortimer Zuckerman, the billionaire owner of The Daily News, rebuked Ascot in a televised interview, saying he had been misled about what Mr. Merkin had done with some $30 million from Mr. Zuckerman's charitable foundation.
Behind a wall of lawyers, Mr. Merkin did not take calls this week. In the ''Dear Limited Partner'' letter he sent on Dec. 11, he noted that he, too, was one of Mr. Madoff's victims and suffered big losses alongside his investors. He has taken steps to wind down his Ascot, Gabriel, and Ariel funds.
Still, some of his clients are stunned, and angry, to learn what Mr. Merkin did with their millions, while collecting an annual management fee of 1.5 percent of the assets for his services.
But before the losses and the outraged cries of betrayal, this was a heady way to steer money into an operation that has now been branded, by its own architect, as a Ponzi scheme. And nothing illustrates what a quantum leap it was for Mr. Madoff than the connections that led Tufts University to entrust him with $20 million in 2005.
Tufts did not actually send a check to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. Rather, it invested in Ascot Partners, Mr. Merkin's partnership. Mr. Merkin had been a major investor in a company whose board included James A. Stern, a member of the Tufts investment committee and a principal in a major private investment firm in New York called the Cypress Group.
Behind these veils of paperwork and partnerships, Mr. Madoff's reach now extended into the top tiers of Jewish finance and philanthropy, where he rubbed shoulders with corporate directors and prominent hedge fund managers. But there were wider worlds to conquer.
The Circle Grows
Walter M. Noel was the courtly public face of the Fairfield Greenwich Group, the investment firm he started in 1983. A native of Tennessee, Mr. Noel had spent time at larger firms, notably at Chemical Bank, where he headed its international private banking practice, before setting out on his own.
From the beginning, the Noel family was built on access to prestigious social circles. Mr. Noel's wife, Monica, was part of the prominent Haegler family of Rio de Janeiro and Zurich, and their daughters would marry into international families that provided additional connections for the firm.
In 1989, Mr. Noel merged his business with a small brokerage firm whose general partner was Jeffrey Tucker, a longtime New Yorker who had a law degree from Brooklyn Law School and a resume that included eight years with the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Again and again, this pedigreed experience was emphasized by Fairfield as it built itself into a fund of funds, investing in other hedge funds. It boasted to its prospects that its investigation of investment options was ''deeper and broader'' than those of most firms because of Mr. Tucker's experience in the regulatory ranks.
Though he is not nearly as prominent as the Noels, who move in the forefront of Connecticut society, Mr. Tucker benefited just as much from Fairfield's success. Indeed, last year he led a coalition of thoroughbred racing interests that sought to bid for New York State's horse-racing franchise.
But it was Mr. Tucker who introduced Fairfield to Mr. Madoff. In the early 1990s, Fairfield began placing money with him, according to George L. Ball, the former president of E. F. Hutton and Prudential-Bache chief executive who knows Mr. Noel socially.
That began a long partnership that helped the Fairfield firm earn enviably steady returns, even in down markets -- and that lifted Mr. Madoff into a global orbit, one that soon extended his reach into some of the most fabled banking centers of Europe.
If the wealthy Jewish world he occupied was his launch pad, the wealthy promoters he cultivated at Fairfield Greenwich were his booster rocket.
The Fairfield Sentry fund was one of several so-called feeder funds that became portals through which money from wealthy foreign investors would could capitalize on Mr. Madoff's investment prowess -- collecting those exclusive, steady returns that had made him the toast of Palm Beach and the North Shore so many years ago.
The Sentry fund quickly became Fairfield's signature product, and it boasted of stellar returns. In marketing materials, Fairfield trumpeted Sentry's 11 percent annual return over the last 15 years, with only 13 losing months. It was a track record that grew increasingly attractive as markets grew more volatile in recent years.
Though Fairfield Greenwich has its headquarters in New York City and its founder, Mr. Noel, operated from his hometown, Greenwich, Conn., a recent report showed that foreign investors provided 95 percent of its managed assets -- with 68 percent in Europe, 6 percent in Asia, and 4 percent in the Middle East.
Friends and associates say that Mr. Noel's sons-in-law spent much of their time marketing the firm's funds in either their home countries or regions where they had their own family connections.
One of his most visible representatives was Andres Piedrahita, a Colombian who had married Mr. Noel's eldest daughter, Corina, and was eventually named a Fairfield founding partner. Based in Madrid and London, Mr. Piedrahita became one of the firm's most visible representatives in the world of European banking and investment. But his brothers-in-law also had international roots. Yanko Della Schiava, who married Lisina Noel, was the son of the editor of Cosmopolitan in Italy and of the editor of Harper's Bazaar in Italy and France. Philip J. Toub, who married Alix Noel, is the son of a director of the Saronic Shipping Company, in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Matthew Brown, who married Marisa Noel, is the son of a former mayor of San Marino, Calif. All three joined Fairfield, eventually becoming partners in marketing.
Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Piedrahita, Mr. Della Schiava and others, Fairfield reaped many millions of dollars in investor capital from Europe. The firm set up feeder programs with institutions like Banco Santander, Swedish Bank Nordea and Banque Benedict Hentsch. All became conduits that carried fresh money to Mr. Madoff.
Among his new investors were the Mugrabis, extremely wealthy art collectors from Colombia who have lived in New York for more 20 years. It was their longtime friendship with Mr. Piedrahita that led them to invest in the Sentry fund.
''We had very little money with the fund -- just under a million dollars -- so I am not that upset personally,'' said Alberto Mugrabi, a son of the family patriarch. ''It was a very informal thing. We know Andres since forever, from Bogota, he's a great guy, and he says to us, 'This is the Madoff thing, he's the master.'''
He added: ''I trusted Andres. I still trust him.''
The World
Mr. Madoff's higher profile in the highly competitive world of hedge fund management intensified the skepticism about his remarkably consistent returns. Rival money managers complained that when they sought to replicate his trading strategy based on the statements the Madoff firm sent its clients, they found it wasn't possible.
There was a scattering of inconclusive regulatory investigations -- efforts so unavailing that the chairman of the S.E.C. in Washington has ordered an internal investigation to determine how the agency could have missed so many red flags and ignored so many credible complaints over the years.
But foreign regulators were not any quicker to notice Mr. Madoff's oddities -- or the rapidly expanding pool of money entrusted to the various feeder funds he serviced.
There was the small Austrian merchant bank, Bank Medici, which had $2.1 billion invested in funds that ultimately wound up under Mr. Madoff's control. It collected those investments through two main funds, the Herald USA Fund and the smaller Herald Luxemburg Fund, sold to banks, insurance companies and pension funds since 2004.
The funds, which were closed for private investors, were incredibly popular among investors and no questions were ever asked about its constant returns of about 7 percent, said a former employee at the bank who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the news media.
Bank Medici sold the funds to investors around the world from its offices in New York, Vienna, Gibraltar, Zurich and Milan. About 93 percent of the funds' investors are outside Austria. Just last month, the Herald USA fund won Germany's annual Hedge Fund Awards for ''proving consistency in turbulent times.''
Peter Scheithauer, chief executive of Bank Medici since September, accepted the award, saying Bank Medici's products ''should represent mainly one thing: security and returns in good as well as bad times.''
But as he prepared to brief his management board on potential losses connected to the Madoff investments on Friday, he sounded downbeat. ''It's a real tragedy,'' Mr. Scheithauer said. ''It's not just us, it's so many other people as well. If only we knew, but he was paying out fine until just recently.''
Bank Austria, which is now owned by UniCredit of Italy, owns a stake in Bank Medici and also wound up investing with Mr. Madoff through a range of different funds offered under the name Primeo by its hedge fund unit, Pioneer Alternative Investments.
Mr. Madoff was not a well-known presence on the social circuit in Switzerland. Instead, Swiss money managers would go to him, visiting his offices in the Lipstick Building in Midtown Manhattan. Seeing Mr. Madoff there was a bit like visiting the Wizard of Oz: despite his unerring success in generating smooth returns, he seemed quite ordinary, lacking the flamboyance of other well-heeled money managers.
''He did not look like a huge spender; seemed like a family man,'' said one veteran Geneva banker, whose firm had money with Mr. Madoff but insisted on anonymity because of the likelihood of lawsuits from angry clients. ''He talked about the markets.''
The only thing that struck the Swiss banker as odd was the bull memorabilia strewn about his office. ''It seemed strange for a guy to have all these bulls, little sculptures, paintings of bulls,'' he recalled. ''I've seen offices with bears. This was bulls.''
But the aura of exclusivity was the constant, he said. ''This was the usual spiel: 'It's impossible to get in, but we can get you some if you're nice.' He made it look difficult to get into.''
New Frontiers
What began as a quietly coveted investment opportunity for the lucky few in the Jewish country clubs on Long Island became, in its final burst of growth, a thoroughly global financial product whose roots were obscured behind legions of well-dressed, multilingual sales representatives in the financial capitals of Europe.
Indeed, often with the assistance of feeder funds, Mr. Madoff was now in a position to seek and procure money from Arab investors, too. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the largest of the world's sovereign wealth funds, with assets estimated earlier this year to be approaching $700 billion, wound up in the same boat as Jewish charities in New York: caught in the collapse of Bernie Madoff.
In early 2005, the investment authority had invested approximately $400 million with Mr. Madoff, by way of the Fairfield Sentry Fund, according to a profile of the firm that it prepared for a prospective buyer in 2007. Fairfield Sentry had more than $7 billion invested with Mr. Madoff and was his largest investor; now, it says, it is his largest victim.
The investment authority, in turn, was one of Fairfield Sentry's largest investors. Even after the investment authority took two significant redemptions from the fund, in April 2005 and 2006, its stake the following year of $132 million made up 2 percent of the fund's assets under management.
The 2007 report lists Philip Jamchid Toub, one of Mr. Noel's sons-in-law, as the firm's ''agent'' with the Abu Dhabi investors, presumably meaning the person who manages the relationship with the particular clients. Mr. Toub, a Fairfield Greenwich partner, is married to Alix Noel and is the son of Said Toub, a wealthy shipping executive from Switzerland.
Other investors for whom Mr. Toub is listed as the agent include the Safra National Bank of New York and the National Bank of Kuwait.
And Fairfield was finding new fields for Mr. Madoff to cultivate. In 2004, the firm turned its eyes to Asia, forming a partnership with Lion Capital of Singapore, now Lion Global Investors, to create Lion Fairfield Capital Management, a joint venture meant to introduce Asian investors to the firm.
''Many investors believe that Asia holds the best global opportunities for hedge funds over the next two to five years, as compared to the U.S. and Europe,'' Richard Landsberger, a Fairfield partner and director of Lion Fairfield, told HedgeWorld in 2006.
Yet it appears that Sentry remained Fairfield's chief focus in this new vineyard. Among the institutions that had invested in the fund are Korea Life Insurance, which has about $30 million to $50 million in the fund; a Taiwanese insurer, Cathay Life, with about $12 million; and Samsung Investment and Securities, with about $6.3 million.
As Fairfield moved into Asia, another feeder fund, Stellar US Absolute Return, was incorporated in Singapore in 2006 to funnel investors' capital into Sentry. According to data from Bloomberg News, Stellar borrowed $3 for every dollar of investor money it received, in an effort to extract higher returns.
Last year, Jeffrey Tucker went to Asia to educate potential investors in Beijing and Thailand about hedge funds, seeking to allay their concerns about previous blow-ups in the industry like Long-Term Capital Management, a Connecticut hedge fund that had been rescued under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when its exotic derivative investments brought it to the brink of a costly collapse.
''China is moving slowly as the reformers become familiar with what we do,'' Mr. Tucker told HedgeWorld in November 2007. ''It's the same thing in Thailand. There are misunderstandings about hedge funds.''
The Scheme Collapses
But even with all the money pouring in, it was not enough, not in a year in which financial markets were plunging.
Suddenly, people wanted cash -- even the people who had trusted their cash for so long to Mr. Madoff. Time was running out for history's first worldwide Ponzi scheme.
But he maintained a brave face at the family firm that he had founded before his sons Mark and Andrew were born, and where they now worked, the firm where his brother Peter had labored at his side for decades, the firm that remained a stock-trading powerhouse on Wall Street.
But that trading business lived on the 18th and 19th floors of the Third Avenue tower, called the Lipstick Building, that was home to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. Mr. Madoff operated his vast but largely unseen ''asset management'' business from the 17th floor, aided by a small staff that had been with him for years and a computer system separate from the trading business.
His family knew Mr. Madoff had an investment management business, but Mr. Madoff had always kept it separate. Moreover, he explained that he placed his trades through ''European counterparties'' rather than use the trading desks his sons oversaw.
But Mark and Andrew felt their father had been under increasing tension as the markets grew increasingly difficult this fall.
In early December he remarked to one of them that he was struggling to raise $7 billion to cover redemptions. He seemed tired and drawn, but so was just about everyone else during the turbulent weeks of late November and early December.
Then, early on Dec. 10, he shocked his sons by suggesting that the firm pay out several million dollars in bonuses two months ahead of schedule. When pressed by his sons for a reason, he grew agitated and insisted that they all leave the office and continue the conversation at his apartment on East 64th Street.
It was there, at midmorning, that he told his sons that his business was ''a big lie'' and, ''basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.'' There was nothing left, he told them -- and he fully expected to go to jail.
The questions have piled up since then: Could Mr. Madoff have sustained this worldwide fraud for so long by himself? Why didn't regulators, in Washington and abroad, catch him sooner? And will anything be recovered for investors, some of whom have lost every penny?
But when the news of his arrest began to spread on Dec. 11, the first thought that struck an old friend who had known him as a pioneer on Wall Street, was, ''There must be an error. It must be another Bernie Madoff.'' Then he added, ''But then, there is no other Bernie Madoff.''
Correction: December 29, 2008, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Dec. 20 about Bernard L. Madoff, charged with running a global Ponzi scheme, misidentified the position held by James A. Stern at Tufts University at the time it invested indirectly in Mr. Madoff's fund. Mr. Stern was chairman of the university's board and was a member of its investment committee; he was not chairman of the investment committee.

HEADLINE: After Lifeline, Still in Deep

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
With a lifeline from the White House, General Motors and Chrysler will survive for the next few months while they revamp. 
 But will they thrive again?
 The plans from the car companies offer little in terms of fresh ideas. Instead, they are focused more on slow-selling models, persuading G.M.'s debt holders to accept stock and getting union wages more in line with those paid by foreign brands in the United States.
 Such moves are certainly necessary in the short term, but no company can keep cutting its way to prosperity. Even President-elect Barack Obama said Friday that Detroit automakers should not ''squander the chance'' to change their management practices. 
 To be sure, it takes years and enormous investments to develop new vehicles, and much of Detroit's focus throughout this decade has been on shedding workers and closing plants in response to its shrinking market share. 
 But the Detroit carmakers also have to find some new hits, just as they did in the 1990s with the S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickups that helped them -- along with a national policy that encouraged the cheap gas that fueled the big and profitable vehicles -- earn billions.
 After the spike in gas prices this year, and continuing volatility in oil prices, the car companies' next great hope will be in fuel-efficient vehicles that they can sell in the hundreds of thousands, not just as niche models, and earn a profit from them. 
 Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital, said the auto companies' challenges came down to four C's: cash, cost reduction, cars and culture. 
 The cash and cost reduction will come through the federal aid and the revamping plans they submitted in return for the help. ''But they quite obviously need to get a different management culture that's capable of getting consumers to pay close to the same price of a Honda or a Toyota,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''That's been the challenge for a decade.''
 In fact, Detroit still depends heavily on pickups, and S.U.V.'s, as well as crossover vehicles, which are sport utilities built on car underpinnings.
 Through November, light trucks made up 58 percent of G.M.'s sales; they account for 63.5 percent of Ford's sales and 72.2 percent for Chrysler. 
 In fact, Toyota has sold more Camry models alone this year than Chrysler has sold of all its cars, according to Motorintelligence.com, a firm that follows industry statistics.
 The Detroit companies say their sales mix will change soon. G.M. has pinned its future on the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in electric car due two years from now, and another small Chevrolet, the Cruze, aimed at many of the same customers who have bought Toyota Corollas the last 40 years. 
 Though it has continued work on the Volt, it suspended work on the Cruze, and delayed building a new engine plant in Flint, Mich., needed for both cars, while it waited to see the outcome of the bailout bid.
 Ford, which did not seek federal assistance because its cash reserves are stronger, is adapting two European models, the Focus and the Fiesta, for the American market, and is about to introduce a hybrid-electric version of its Fusion, a family sedan.
 Chrysler discontinued its only hybrid model earlier this fall. It is relying on Nissan of Japan to develop its small cars.
 And, at a briefing for journalists this week, Chrysler showed future models that included more new Jeeps, including an electric one, new pickups and muscle cars, according to Jalopnik.com, a Web site that follows the industry (and whose term for the crisis in Detroit -- ''carpocalypse'' -- is catching on in the industry). 
 ''G.M. and Ford both have game plans,'' said Ray Wert III, the Web site's editor in chief. ''Chrysler's is mired in the last decade, and not ready for the next one.''
 Chrysler's dependence on light trucks is a holdover from years when Americans could rely on cheap gas, which has returned because of a weakening global economy. 
 But the mix of vehicles will become a more critical issue as the industry approaches 2020, the year when its fleet of vehicles will have to be able to achieve an average fuel economy of 35 miles per gallon. 
 It is a level that European and Japanese carmakers already have to achieve at home, for the most part, to provide cars to consumers who have long paid high gas prices. G.M and Ford also build popular fuel-efficient cars abroad, but they are more expensive than what American consumers are used to paying for small cars.
 Falling gas prices are good news for Detroit in the short-term, as consumers may warm again to the idea of buying S.U.V.'s and pickups, which would provide much-needed revenue to the Detroit companies. 
 But G.M. and Chrysler can no longer rely so heavily on those vehicles for their future -- particularly the future that Mr. Obama appears to have in mind for them while he keeps an eye on their progress to become viable business. 
 That may mean pushing the market in a direction that not all car buyers want.
 ''For the American consumer, the drive to fuel economy revolves around the price of gasoline,'' said Ron Pinelli, president of Motorintelligence.com. ''When gas is cheap, they don't want to spend the money to get a car that's fuel-efficient.''

HEADLINE: A Risk for Ford in Shunning Bailout, and Possibly a Reward

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The Big Three automakers are now two troubled companies getting government help to survive and one -- the Ford Motor Company -- trying to make it on its own.
But Ford faces a new challenge of its own -- improving its competitive position without the assistance that $17.4 billion in federal loans will provide General Motors and Chrysler.
The loan package given to G.M. and Chrysler came with strict conditions that it cut its labor costs and reorganize its debt obligations, or possibly be forced into bankruptcy. 
Ford, however, needs to reduce its own costs to stay on a level playing field with its crosstown rivals.
A Ford spokesman said Friday that the company expected to work with the United Automobile Workers union to achieve any savings that G.M. and Chrysler might negotiate.
''We have a strong relationship with the U.A.W.,'' said Mark Truby, the Ford spokesman. ''We're going to continue to work to completely close the competitive gap with foreign transplants.''
By eschewing any federal assistance, Ford runs the risk of falling behind G.M. and Chrysler if those two companies can wrest concessions from the union and Ford cannot.
But it's a risk that Ford and its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, are willing and able to take.
Ford has its share of problems. It lost more than $8 billion this year, and its United States sales have fallen by 19 percent through November. The total industry, by comparison, is down 16 percent.
Even so, Ford has more cash on hand than its larger rival G.M. -- $18.9 billion at the end of the third quarter, compared with $16.2 billion for G.M. And Ford has a backstop of a $10.8 billion line of credit with banks that it negotiated in 2006.
At the time, industry analysts saw Ford's mortgaging of its assets to get the line of credit as a sign of desperation.
Now it appears to be a smart move that separates Ford from its Detroit rivals, which have been shut out of the tight credit market and forced to borrow from the government.
''Whether it was lucky or planned, the decision to borrow the money has turned out to be a huge positive for Ford,'' said John Casesa, principal in the auto consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group.
Although it did not ask for emergency aid from Washington, Ford's executives breathed a sigh of relief Friday that G.M. and Chrysler were given loans to survive into next year.
A bankruptcy by either G.M. or Chrysler could have started a domino effect of financial failures at parts manufacturers that supply Ford as well.
''All of us at Ford appreciate the prudent step the administration has taken to address the near-term liquidity issues of G.M. and Chrysler,'' Mr. Mulally said in a statement.
Ford has said it hopes that if another round of industry loans is approved next year by the Obama administration, it could get a $9 billion line of credit as a safeguard against a further deterioration of the economy.
By not taking government loans now, Ford can legitimately portray itself as the healthiest of Detroit's automakers, and could possibly capitalize on that status in the marketplace.
One study showed that Ford benefited during October and November from G.M.'s financial plight.
''Ford definitely gained some sales during that time because of its financial situation,'' said Art Spinella, president of the firm CNW Research.
The automaker's chairman, William C. Ford Jr., has said that Ford is now in a position to lead the industry in its transition to more fuel-efficient cars.
Mr. Ford said in an interview last month that Ford hoped to be the model for Detroit's recovery and to work closely on strategic initiatives favored by President-elect Barack Obama.
''I do feel we have a great plan that is completely in sync with where the country and the new administration would like us to go,'' Mr. Ford said.
The company has several important vehicle introductions planned next year, including a redesigned version of the Taurus sedan.
Once a strong competitor to the top-selling Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, the Taurus became an also-ran in the midsize car segment when Ford devoted most of its energies to pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
Ford has also accelerated plans to bring many of its small passenger cars from Europe for sale in the United States market.

HEADLINE: N.Y.U.'s Institute Receives $4 Million

BYLINE: Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
The collapsing economy hasn't completely discouraged acts of philanthropy: on Friday, New York University announced that its Institute of Fine Arts had received a gift of $4 million from the real estate developer Sheldon H. Solow. The donation will be used for fellowships and financial aid for students, the university said. Mr. Solow, the founder of Solow Realty, is a life trustee at both N.Y.U. and the institute; the university said students supported by the donation funds would be named Sheldon Solow scholars. ''The gift could not have come at a better moment,'' Judy Steinhardt, the chairwoman of the institute's board, said in a news release. Solow Realty is among the organizations that notified federal authorities of suspected wrongdoing at Dreier L.L.P, a law firm accused of cheating investors of $380 million. On Tuesday Citibank filed suit against Mr. Solow, saying that he had not paid $67 million in loans and $18.5 million in letters of credit, according to documents filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and first reported on the Web site cityfile.com.

PERSON: David I. Margolis 

HEADLINE: David Margolis, 78, Head Of Colt and an Aide to Koch

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
David I. Margolis, an industrialist who revived Colt Industries, became a close adviser to former Mayor Edward I. Koch and was a member of the financial board that helped steer New York City out of its fiscal crisis in the 1970s, died Dec. 13 in Manhattan. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan. 
 The cause was cardiac arrest, his wife, Barbara, said.
 Mr. Margolis was president of Colt Industries (now Coltec) from 1962 to 1995 and its chairman from 1984 to 1995. Colt, the firearms company founded in 1836 by Samuel Colt after he patented the revolver, was in financial difficulty when Mr. Margolis took over. Under his leadership, it expanded into the production of machinery for the aerospace, automobile, chemical and petroleum industries. By 1988, it had annual revenue of $1.6 billion. 
 Mr. Margolis was a close friend of Mr. Koch and a member of the mayor's so-called kitchen cabinet -- confidants who usually met twice a month on the porch of Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence. They discussed issues like property taxes, the city budget, redevelopment and even security for Michael Jackson concerts, Mr. Koch said.
 ''David was particularly helpful with labor negotiations,'' Mr. Koch said. ''In my first year, the Transport Workers Union was demanding $34 million in wage increases. Repugnant. Much more than I thought was reasonable. David said, 'Ed, if you reject the $34 million it will cost you much more to bring them back if there's a strike.' He was right.''
 From 1974 to 1977, when the city was in fiscal distress during the administration of Mayor Abraham D. Beame, Mr. Margolis served on the state Emergency Financial Control Board, which had a legislative mandate to impose strict budgetary control over the city.
 Mr. Margolis tangled with officials, once saying that the city was presenting an ''Alice in Wonderland'' picture of its finances. But when he announced his resignation in 1977, he said: ''As far as I'm concerned, the toughest chores the control board has had are, to a great extent, behind it.''
 David Israel Margolis was born in the Bronx on Jan. 24, 1930, the son of Benjamin and Celia Margolis. His father was a butcher. Besides his wife, he is survived by three sons, Brian, Robert and Peter; a daughter, Nancy King; a sister, Phyllis Zucker; and five grandchildren.
 Mr. Margolis received his bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from the City College of New York. Before being named president of Colt, he was assistant treasurer at the Raytheon Company and treasurer of International Telephone & Telegraph, now ITT.
 Mr. and Mrs. Margolis first met Mr. Koch in 1967. When Mr. Koch became mayor at midnight on New Year's Eve in 1977, the swearing-in took place at the couple's East Side apartment. Mrs. Margolis was named to a $1-a-year post as the city's official greeter.
 Mr. Koch owed a lot more to Mr. and Mrs. Margolis than free advice and service.
 In October 1983, they were eating together at a Manhattan restaurant when the mayor became ill and started to collapse. Mr. Margolis caught him before he hit the ground. Three years earlier, at a Chinese restaurant, Mr. Margolis performed the Heimlich maneuver on Mr. Koch when the mayor choked on a piece of food.

HEADLINE: Zero Interest? Japan Discovered That Wasn't Enough

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
When the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate to virtually zero earlier this week, what was a historic move in Washington seemed old hat here in Tokyo. 
 The Bank of Japan kept rates near zero for most of the last decade in an effort to end a long economic stagnation, and raised them only two years ago. Many economists say they believe that the zero interest-rate policy finally worked in Japan after regulators took aggressive steps that succeeded in restoring faith in Japan's financial system and Tokyo's ability to oversee it.
 Now, with the Fed and President-elect Barack Obama turning to the same sorts of unconventional policy tools to battle the worst global economic crisis since the Depression, economists and bankers say they hope that Japan's lessons are not lost on Washington. They say the United States needs to take the same kinds of confidence-building steps, and much more quickly than Japan did. 
 ''Japan had years of trial and error to gets its response right, but the United States doesn't have that kind of time because markets are changing so fast,'' said Akio Makabe, an economics professor at Shinshu University. ''The Fed has to move, and has to move fast, to restore confidence.''
 On Friday, the Bank of Japan cut its benchmark rate to 0.1 percent, from 0.3 percent, saying in a statement that it was following the Fed's ''dramatic rate cut'' to lower borrowing costs and jolt global demand. On Tuesday, the Fed lowered short-term rates to a range of zero to 0.25 percent, and vowed to pump money directly into the credit markets by buying mortgage-related debt and corporate bonds.
 The Bank of Japan also announced that it would try to shore up Japan's credit markets by buying commercial paper, a type of short-term corporate debt. Central banks in Europe have also reduced rates amid concerns the global economy could contract next year for the first time in decades.
 Tuesday's rate cut by the Fed also made short-term borrowing costs lower in the United States than in Japan for the first time in 15 years. This helped drive up the yen to 13-year highs, as investors tend to favor currencies that offer higher rates of return. The Bank of Japan said its rate cut on Friday was partly aimed at capping the yen's gains.
 The Bank of Japan first lowered interest rates to zero in 1999 for a year and then again in 2001 for five years. The Japanese central bank was trying to contain a domestic financial crisis not unlike the one now crippling global markets, in which collapsing real estate and share prices caused the bankruptcy of large financial companies, like Yamaichi Securities in 1997.
 The central bank's hope was that by lowering borrowing costs to virtually nil, it could encourage commercial banks to lend more money to businesses and consumers, rekindling demand. 
 Economists and former Bank of Japan officials say the biggest lesson they learned was that cutting rates alone has almost no effect when the financial system has fallen into a crisis as deep as the one Japan faced in the 1990s. 
 Japanese banks simply refused to lend in an environment where borrowers could suddenly go bankrupt, saddling lenders with huge, unforeseen losses. The Bank of Japan tried even more extreme measures, like using its powers to create money to essentially stuff cash into the nation's commercial banks in hopes they would start lending again. 
 Exasperated central bankers found that commercial banks just let the money pile up instead of lending it out. 
 Economists say the United States faces a similar situation, after the sudden collapse in September of Lehman Brothers created fears of additional failures. Economists also fault Washington for its inconsistency in dealing with the financial crisis, leaving the impression that it does not have a clear strategy for dealing with ailing lenders.
 In Japan's case, economists and former bankers say, credit began to flow freely again only after 2003, when regulators adopted a tough new policy of auditing banks and forcing weaker ones to raise new capital or accept a government takeover. Economists said the audits finally removed paralysis in credit markets by convincing bankers and investors that sudden failures were no longer a risk, and that the true extent of problems at banks and other companies was finally being revealed. 
 Economists say Washington needs to do something similar to make banks and financial companies more transparent, and reassure investors that there were no more collapses like that of Lehman Brothers on the horizon.
 ''The United States needs to do it like Takenaka did,'' said Anil Kashyap, a professor of business at the University of Chicago, referring to Heizo Takenaka, the former banking minister who started the 2003 audits. ''We need someone to come in and give a good housekeeping seal to banks.''
 Economists and former central bankers said another lesson from Japan's experience was the importance of consistency. This became apparent in 2000, they said, during one of the bank's more embarrassing episodes, when it raised interest rates, and lowered them back to zero a year later when the economy faltered.
 Former Bank of Japan officials said they learned that bankers and investors would lend in difficult times only if they believed that rates would stay low for a long period, ensuring them adequate profits. By raising the possibility of future interest rate increases, the Bank of Japan dampened enthusiasm for lending, say bankers and economists.
 ''We learned that zero rates work by building expectations,'' said Rei Masunaga, an economist and former director general at the Bank of Japan. ''Zero interest rates take time to be effective.''

HEADLINE: One Loss Away From a Dismissal

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
When Reggie Theus became the sixth coach fired in the N.B.A. this season, it raised a question: Is being an N.B.A. coach now the least secure job in professional sports? 
 Leashes are not known for being terribly long for any coach, but the numbers show that the N.B.A. has seemingly jumped to a new level -- although the N.H.L. keeps it cozy company at the top (or bottom, depending on the point of view). The nature of the sports and the seasons may contribute to coaches' longevity, with football's relatively short season being one reason its coaches last the longest. 
 A coach in the N.B.A. has been cashing paychecks from his current employer for an average of 2.64 seasons. But that number is so skewed by Jerry Sloan's industry-defying 20 seasons in Utah that the median number is probably more telling: 1.3 seasons. 
 In other words, N.B.A. coaches looking for new homes when they get a new job should consider renting, not buying. Coaches in the N.H.L. should heed that advice, too. The league is nearly as sack-happy, although it is riding a bit under the radar with only three firings this season. The average coaching tenure is 2.58 seasons, with the median at 1.37.
 ''It's a great job, but you know sooner or later they're going to kick you out the door,'' said John Tortorella, who coached the Tampa Bay Lightning for seven seasons before being fired after last season. ''It's the owners' call. I'm not the one who has invested millions in the team. I respect that.''
 The longest tether goes to N.F.L. coaches, who have occupied their offices for an average of 4.34 seasons. Two coaches -- Jeff Fisher of Tennessee (since 1994) and Mike Shanahan of Denver (since 1995) -- skew the average, but the median (2.88) is still higher than in the other sports.
 Major League Baseball waddles in the middle of this pack. Its managers have an average tenure of 3.78 seasons, a relatively cushy number skewed by Bobby Cox's nearly 19-year run in Atlanta. The median checks in at exactly two seasons.
 Baseball was relatively quiet with in-season firings, except for one bloody week in June when the Mets' Willie Randolph, the Mariners' John McLaren and the Blue Jays' John Gibbons were fired. Then in the middle of September, with his team clinging to a playoff position, Ned Yost was dismissed by the Brewers.
 The numbers are not a completely scientific look at the issue. They are more a snapshot of the current situation, in which the N.B.A. has earned its reputation with a rash of dismissals. Not only have Sacramento's Theus, Washington's Eddie Jordan, Minnesota's Randy Wittman, Philadelphia's Maurice Cheeks, Toronto's Sam Mitchell and Oklahoma City's P. J. Carlesimo already taken a fall, but there was also turnover in eight jobs last off-season. The six coaches had a combined 578-801 record in the jobs from which they were fired.
 In contrast, the N.F.L. had just four coaching changes between the 2007 and 2008 seasons, and three coaches were fired midseason. 
 The revolving door in Oakland continued to spin: Lane Kiffin became the latest object of Al Davis's ire. Across the bay, Mike Nolan was fired as coach of the San Francisco 49ers, and in St. Louis, the Rams fired Scott Linehan after four consecutive losses to begin the season. That number is actually high for the N.F.L., where the fewer number of games relative to the other sports as well as the complexity of the coaching make in-season moves rare.
 ''Football is the most complicated of the sports, with the most complicated systems,'' said Charley Casserly, the former general manager of two N.F.L. teams. ''In football the system is dictated by the head coach. If you make a change, it takes a long time to develop a new system. So when it's not working, you ask, do we give it more time? The nature of the game dictates that coaches coach longer.''
 Gil Brandt, a former Cowboys talent scout, said current coaches, though, might be in for a tougher road. The four teams that changed coaches in the off-season have boosted their total number of victories to 34 this season from 19 last season.
 ''Owners, when they see success, they want to emulate it,'' Brandt said. ''So new coaches may be facing higher expectations.''
 In the N.B.A. and the N.H.L, the seasons are much longer and so many teams make the playoffs -- 8 of 15 in each conference -- even small improvements can push a struggling team into playoff contention, so the temptation to change coaches is strong. The idea is that a new voice, a change in personality, can be enough to solve some of a team's problems.
 ''There is going to be conflict,'' Tortorella said. ''I don't think it is a bad thing. You work through the bumps and become a tighter team. But some owners are not willing to go through that, and the coach is out the door.'' 
 The N.H.L. has motored along with a steady clip of coaching casualties. Tampa Bay hired and fired Barry Melrose before most people realized he was no longer an ESPN analyst. Chicago gave Denis Savard all of four games this season before sending him to the curb. Carolina raised some eyebrows with the dismissal of Peter Laviolette, who led them to a Stanley Cup in 2006.
 The lesson is, if you coach a professional hockey or basketball team, do not get too comfortable.
 Unless you are Jerry Sloan.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: From left, Jerry Sloan of the Utah Jazz, Mike Shanahan of the Denver Broncos, Jeff Fisher of the Tennessee Titans and Bobby Cox of the Atlanta Braves are bucking the trend with long tenures. CHART: Unemployment Lurks: Leashes are not known for being terribly long for any coach or manager, but the numbers show that the N.B.A. has seemingly jumped to a new level of fickleness. Coaches in the N.F.L. enjoy the longest tenure. But the nature of the sports and the seasons contribute to coaches' longevity, with football's short season being one reason its coaches last the longest.

HEADLINE: No Change in Churchgoing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''An Evangelical Article of Faith: Bad Times Draw Bigger Crowds'' (front page, Dec. 14): 
 Despite the anecdotal and ''spot check'' evidence cited by the reporter, Gallup's continuing, daily measure of self-reported church attendance shows no such increase in recent weeks and months. 
 Gallup has asked 1,000 adults a day since mid-February of this year to assess how often they go to church. The results show that about 42 percent of the adult population has reported attending at least once a week or almost every week each month since February, with no increase in September, October, November or the first half of December. 
 Similarly, there has been no increase in the percentage who report attending monthly, seldom or never. 
 It is possible that there has been an increase in attendance at selected evangelical churches, one too limited to register on a national scope. But readers of the article may well conclude from the headline and references to Roman Catholic and mainline Protestant churches that there has been a broad, nationwide shift in churchgoing behavior as a result of the economic downturn. 
 If so, it is reasonable to expect that such a change would register in our national tracking survey. And so far, it has not.

HEADLINE: Staying Alive in Retailing

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
In one of the darkest holiday shopping seasons in decades, perhaps it is fitting that a retailer has been given new life by vampires.
While sales at most stores plummeted last month, the teenage retailer Hot Topic enjoyed a 6.5 percent gain, thanks mostly to brisk sales of gear inspired by ''Twilight,'' the teenage vampire movie.
As the nation's retailing landscape has deteriorated, Hot Topic is one of a handful of chains that seem to be coming out ahead. The most obvious winners are discounters like Wal-Mart Stores and BJ's Wholesale Club, which are helping American families trade down to cheaper merchandise. But another, more surprising group of beneficiaries has emerged: niche chains that cater to teenagers and young adults.
For these chains, never has the quality of a management team, and its ability to see around corners, mattered as much as it does now. 
''The management team needs to be able to keep finding the next one-hit wonder,'' said John D. Morris, a retailing analyst with Wachovia.
The margin for error has probably never been narrower. While teenage retailers like Hot Topic, American Apparel and Buckle have landed on the right product at the right time (and the right price), and the discounters are catering to consumers' desire for bargains, analysts are scrutinizing many more critical factors as they struggle to make sense of a changed retail landscape and predict which chains will survive a brutal shakeout expected to unfold early next year.
In the good old days, a year or two ago, little more was required than comparing a chain's sales from one period to the next, a metric known as same-store sales that was long considered a vital measure of a retailer's health. But in the new climate, that comparison can be deceptive.
Frederick A. Crawford, chief executive of AlixPartners, a global restructuring firm, said it was now more essential than ever to assess the soundness of a retailer's real estate portfolio, the rate of management turnover, sales per square foot and proportion of a company's cash that is going to overhead. Above all, a retailer's debt load, and the timing of its principal and interest payments, is of utmost importance because obtaining fresh credit has become difficult or impossible for many companies.
''There will be good businesses that will liquidate in the next 24 months,'' Mr. Crawford said. ''When credit was free-flowing and there was no problem, I don't think the absolute amount of debt was as important as it is today.''
Analysts who have been looking closely at all of these factors are optimistic about the prospects of some retailers, like Kohl's and Costco, in spite of recent sales declines.
''These are real companies that are going out the other side of the economic slowdown as winners, gaining market share and gaining select locations,'' said Bill Dreher, senior retailing analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Sales at Kohl's stores open at least a year sank 17.5 percent in November, in contrast to a 10.2 percent increase last year. Yet analysts have praised its management team.
Deborah Weinswig, an analyst with Citigroup, described Kohl's as the best-positioned department store in this economy, calling it ''one of the leading retailers with respect to inventory management, technological innovation, and merchandising and marketing execution.''
Mr. Dreher noted that Kohl's generated on average $60 a square foot more than J. C. Penney and Macy's. And the company is in a position to pick up market share as other retailers falter. Last week, Kohl's and Forever 21 jointly acquired 46 store locations from the bankrupt Mervyns for $6.25 million.
Mr. Dreher said Kohl's -- which plans to take over 31 Mervyns locations for about $1.74 a square foot -- is grabbing store locations in areas it has yet to saturate in ''deals once considered unimaginable.'' It is one of the few retailers poised to benefit from the industry shakeout, he said, and will probably be among the first to see signs of a consumer spending recovery. Kohl's declined to comment.
Another chain that suffered a same-store sales decline in recent months, but still looks strong over all, is Aeropostale, the low-priced casual clothing retailer. The company's same-store sales dropped 5 percent in November, but it had record-breaking sales and profits in its most recent three-month reporting period. Julian R. Geiger, the company's chairman and chief executive, underscored during an earnings call this month that Aeropostale had a ''strong balance sheet with absolutely no debt,'' though analysts have warned that the company's profits will probably erode as it offers ever deeper discounts to lure shoppers. Still, Mr. Geiger was bullish: ''This should be our 11th consecutive year of positive same-store sales, a feat never before accomplished in the teen specialty business,'' he said.
Marsha Brady, creative director for American Apparel -- which in November had a 6 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year -- said the key to its continued success in this economy is its demographic: young, single, urban creative-types accustomed to living on a shoestring.
''They hear about the stock market but stocks are something their parents worry about,'' Ms. Brady said. ''They don't own anything. They rent. They're not really facing foreclosure or falling property values. If anything they'll just get another roommate or move into a cheaper rental. It's not utter devastation to their cores.''
A lesser known teenage apparel retailer, Buckle, flouted sales trends with a double-digit sales increase. Like Hot Topic, Buckle has Goth-inspired merchandise, including brands like Affliction, which embellishes clothes with skulls and crosses. Sales at stores open at least a year jumped 15 percent last month, compared with an 18.2 percent increase last year.
Finding the right mix of merchandise to capture teenage and young adult consumers is essential. However, even the best management team, with the sharpest instincts, cannot save a company saddled with too much debt.
It is a feat, frankly, for any apparel retailer to do well in this economy because consumers have by and large cracked open their wallets only to buy food and fuel. That, of course, has helped discount and warehouse stores like Wal-Mart and BJ's Wholesale Club to thrive.
Cathy Maloney, vice president of investor relations for BJ's Wholesale Club, said ''food and consumables have really been the drivers'' of the company's sales increases. Food sales soared 14 percent last month, though general merchandise sales were down by 4 percent. Over all, sales at stores open at least a year increased 6.2 percent in November.
BJ's is also taking market share from supermarkets and casual dining restaurants as consumers short of cash gravitate to its low prices and prepared meals, like Panera Bread soups and Boston Market side dishes.
''They still want that time with family,'' Ms. Maloney said, ''but they don't want to spend it in a restaurant.''
For the three months that ended Nov. 1, profit at BJ's Wholesale Club increased to $28.2 million, up from $22.7 million in the period a year earlier.
Management teams at both BJ's and Wal-Mart began getting back to basics years ago and are reaping the rewards.
Wal-Mart is plucking market share not only from supermarkets -- last month it had the biggest grocery sales jump in its history -- but also from electronics retailers. The company offered name-brand televisions for less than $400 for the first time this holiday season.
Wal-Mart's profit for the most recent quarter was $3.14 billion, up from $2.86 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 3.4 percent in November, not including fuel, compared with a 1.5 percent increase in the month a year earlier.
A few other retailers have received honorable mentions from analysts, though the most frequently cited is Urban Outfitters. The company does not report monthly sales, but it had record profits in its latest quarter. Analysts have described it as the lone mass market retailer offering new, compelling styles.
''They pushed the envelope on fashion and product beyond what anyone was willing to risk in a very tough economy,'' said Kimberly Greenberger, a retailing analyst with Citigroup. ''And it paid off for them.''
Long-ailing retailer Gap appears to be pulling itself out of the grave by relentlessly cutting costs and moving inventory. Its same-store sales fell 10 percent in November, but that was an improvement over the company's September and October figures, which were down 11 and 16 percent respectively. In the most recent reporting period, Gap made a profit of $246 million, compared with $238 million in the period a year earlier.
Retailers like Gap and Hot Topic, which have been experiencing their own internal economic crises for many months, are in some ways prepared to weather the recession because they had an early start cutting inventory and learning to manage during hard times. Hot Topic's management team was able to anticipate the ''Twilight'' trend, acquiring licensed merchandise, creating a vampire-theme blog and holding in-store events with cast members from the film.
Still, a wave of retail bankruptcies in 2009 is all but assured as companies limp through one of the weakest holiday shopping seasons in years.
Analysts, for instance, wonder whether Hot Topic -- which had same-store sales declines every month this year until October -- will be able to get exclusive licenses and continue to consistently identify hot trends -- or if ''Twilight'' was simply a lucky bite.
''We're certainly seeing a darker mood that very few retailers can tap into as authentically as Hot Topic,'' Ms. Greenberger of Citigroup said. ''There is a huge opportunity in front of Hot Topic right now.''

HEADLINE: Readers Weigh In With Tips on Jobs and Money

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I THINK I can now officially call it a (minor) holiday tradition. For the last four years, I have used my last column of the year to share some of the e-mail messages that I have received from readers.
Although many of you seem to believe your messages drop into a black cyberhole, I do read every one, and often find it surprising to see which columns stir up emotion and which seem to sink with barely a murmur.
This year, my columns on reusing plastic bottles (the most common response: try aluminum ones instead), sorting through the morass of options for bundled telecommunications services and hiring a financial adviser hit home. Later in the year, as columns reflected the deteriorating economy, many of you responded to my thoughts on job hunting. All ShortCuts columns can be found at nytimes.com.
JAN. 19 You can haggle for more than you think. 
Several years ago I called the Hyatt at the Embarcadero, and asked for a single for the night. The pleasant woman on the phone said I could have a standard room for $240 or a deluxe room for $280.
I asked what I got for $280 and was told, ''an oversized room with separate sitting area, a king bed, a high floor with nice view of the bay and free breakfast.'' I said that sounded good, but that I would be alone, arriving late and checking out early, and I only needed a small room with a bed and shower, and I asked if she had anything cheaper than these quotes.
She said yes, since this is a quiet holiday period, she would give me the businessman's holiday rate of $115. I said great, what do I get for that price? She said, ''an oversized room with separate sitting area, a king bed, a high floor with nice view of the bay and free breakfast.'' I said that is the same as the deluxe $280 deal. She said yes, it's the same package, just with the businessman's holiday rate. I asked why she didn't tell me about the businessman's holiday rate in the first place, to which she replied, ''You have to ask.''

FEB. 16 Complexities of all-in-one telecommunications packages.
Whenever I read news reports concerning these combined offerings, I'm always struck that there's never any mention of one of biggest drawbacks of having one wire feeding all three essential services into a household. In the lingo of contingency/disaster planning, it's known as having a ''single point of failure.'' A family should consider the problems that could arise if they lost their telephone, television signal and Internet/e-mail access all at the same time. At the very least, a household should have a contingency plan for contacting the provider if their all-in-one service turns into a none-in-one service.

MARCH 29 The cost of owning a pet.
You might be amused that the last time I boarded the two dogs, I took along an extra bag of food, so that the kennel would not have to use their supply. When I picked up the dogs (and paid the hefty tab), they returned the extra bag of food and it bore an enormous label, which read, ''You have been charged $1.00 per day to store this bag of food as we are short on storage space.'' I was at a loss for words.

APRIL 12 Sometimes simpler high-tech gadgets are better, especially for those of us over a certain age.
These are some of my ''new rules'' for technological elegance:
1. Ban ''words-on-a-box'' marketing. Many products are needlessly complicated just to make consumers think they are getting more for their money.
2. Mandate logic. If my kitchen worked like office networking technology, I would have to flush the toilet to make toast.
3. Snow blower mentality -- the more complicated the steps, the more ''manly'' the machine must be.
4. I want a knob for volume.

APRIL 26 Picking a financial planner.
Supposedly, I am financially sophisticated (M.B.A., business owner, management consultant, ex-McKinsey), but feel very inadequate when it comes to personal investment strategies.
I have asked a number of colleagues for advice concerning what financial planner they use. So far, the answer is no one. Obviously, there is a huge gap as well as a huge opportunity for planners who can become (to use an overused phrase) a ''trusted adviser.'' Most of us do not believe that such a person exists.

MAY 24 The plague of getting a machine when trying to find customer service. These machines are often referred to as interactive voice response systems, or I.V.R.'s, as this writer does.
I confess. I'm one of those ''telecom'' people who started installing I.V.R.'s in the 1980s.
I also feel a bit like Dr. Frankenstein. Despite our best intentions, those devices have turned into monsters that now terrorize the population.
We honestly, truly believed I.V.R.'s would improve customer service. We knew people were tired of being transferred all over a company, only to repeat their problem multiple times to multiple people. We reasoned that if we could do some upfront screening, we could get that caller to the right person and save them time and aggravation.
But like another technological invention (voice mail), the true purpose of I.V.R.'s was perverted until today I'm too ashamed to admit at parties that I set them up for companies. It's like telling people you're an I.R.S. auditor, maybe worse.

JUNE 21 Choosing the right graduation gift.
Your advice to give noncash gifts is middle-class nonsense. Poll graduates and you'll learn that most -- particularly those from working-class families -- prefer money. Any other kind of gift carries the message that the giver knows better what the recipient wants or needs, and young people find this offensive as well as presumptuous.

AUG. 16 Knowing when to quit a job, a relationship -- anything.
Your article reminded me of the awe I generate among my friends because I do not hesitate to quit a movie, play or book if I am not enjoying it. My friends very often agree that the particular movie, play or book was boring or annoying, but they confess that they feel obligated to see it through.
For me, there are just too many wonderful opportunities out there for pleasure and education for me to waste my very limited time being bored. I definitely know when to quit: movies and plays get 30 minutes, books get 100 pages.

SEPT. 27 AND OCT. 11 How to move beyond the Web in job hunting.
I work as a recruiter, and in the rare instances where I actually post a position online, I get resumes from all over the world. Many of them bear no relationship to the job I am trying to fill. It's as though people just ''point and shoot.''
The last professional position I posted -- with extremely explicit qualifications laid out in the posting -- received almost 1,000 responses, of whom only 25 or so even met the technical and educational qualifications for the position. My time is much better spent networking personally with people to find good candidates than reviewing and responding to these resumes.

Your last piece of advice was to be polite to everyone. Amen. I would add that this includes not only the people who might be doing the hiring, but also the secretaries, receptionists and other support staff you find yourself talking to. Whenever we've had an opening to fill in my office, we've been amazed at the people who were flat-out rude to our secretary (but perfectly polite to everyone else). After dealing with such a person, she would tell my boss, ''Don't hire this guy, he was rude,'' and you know what? That person did not get hired.

HEADLINE: Japan Admits World War II Prisoners Worked at a Mine Owned by the Premier's Family

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The Japanese government has acknowledged for the first time that Allied prisoners during World War II were made to work at a coal mine owned by the family of Prime Minister Taro Aso, contradicting his longstanding denials. 
 The admission came after the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, under prodding from an opposition lawmaker, released documents showing that 300 Australian, British and Dutch prisoners of war worked at a mine owned by Aso Mining during the last four months of the war.
 At a parliamentary session on Thursday, Foreign Ministry and health officials acknowledged the validity of the documents, about 43 pages retrieved from the basement of the Health Ministry building. 
 The acknowledgment was another embarrassment for Mr. Aso, whose popularity has plummeted since he took office three months ago. His erratic stewardship over an increasingly shaky economy and insulting remarks about groups including the elderly have lowered his approval ratings to about 20 percent and drawn public attacks from his own Liberal Democratic Party. 
 One of Japan's wealthiest politicians, Mr. Aso, 67, has long denied what historians and survivors of his family's coal mine have consistently said: that the mine, like many others, had used prisoners of war and forced laborers from Asia. In the 1970s, Mr. Aso was president of the family company, which is now called the Aso Group and is still run by his family.
 Last month, when questioned in Parliament about the use of prisoners of war at his family's mine, Mr. Aso said that ''no facts have been confirmed'' and that he was only ''4 or 5 years old at the time.'' Mr. Aso has yet to comment on the documents released by the Health Ministry.
 Yukihisa Fujita, a legislator of the opposition Democratic Party who questioned Mr. Aso on the subject, said there had always been overwhelming evidence, including American government documents, of the mine's use of prisoners of war. 
 ''But Mr. Aso has consistently tried to escape responsibility,'' Mr. Fujita said Friday in a telephone interview. ''But there's nowhere he can escape now with these official documents.'' 
 Japan has long used the absence of official Japanese government documents to deny wartime crimes, rejecting documents from other countries or accounts of survivors. According to scholars, Japanese officials, to avoid prosecution, burned documents in Japan and across Asia in the days and weeks after the surrender to the United States. But many scholars believe that significant documents survive, as in the case of the 43 pages related to the Aso family mine. 
 The Japanese government, led for more than half a century by the Liberal Democratic Party, has long resisted pressure to release war-related papers. But the opposition's capture of the upper house of Parliament last year has given it more power to seek information and documents from Japan's powerful bureaucrats.
 ''There's still a massive amount of documents on Aso Mining left in the basement of the Health Ministry,'' Mr. Fujita said.

HEADLINE: Survivor: Detroit

 BODY:
It came as a relief that President Bush was willing to break free of ideology long enough to keep General Motors and Chrysler from collapsing into a pile of rubble on his watch. 
 The $17.4 billion in loans that the administration has offered the two carmakers -- which the Senate did not have the good sense to do -- represent a necessary bridge over the road to liquidation, protecting the economy from a potential wave of additional job losses. But they do not guarantee Detroit's long-term survival. 
 President-elect Barack Obama's administration will still have to make hard choices about how to help Michigan's auto industry shrink and become more energy efficient. It must do so if there is any hope of Detroit becoming viable again and making cars that drivers would want to buy and that would make sense in an increasingly oil-hungry world.
 Ford declined to take government money this time, believing it can survive on its own. 
 There is some political candy in the conditions that Mr. Bush placed on the loans to Detroit's other two carmakers; the companies are required to get rid of their jets and their executive bonuses. It would have been far better to have demanded that the top executives step down -- a necessary step to push substantive change through Detroit's entrenched mind-set.
 Moreover, oversight of the program has been left to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. That is an odd choice considering his visceral aversion to the government's involvement in private-sector business and his erratic and indecisive handling of the banking system rescue.
 It is highly uncertain that the automakers can clear even the near-term hurdles of the loans: by Feb. 17 they must convince their bondholders to convert at least two-thirds of their debts into equity and they must renegotiate union contracts to bring down wages and benefits into line with those at the factories of Japanese carmakers in the South by the end of next year.
 The United Auto Workers, which must also swallow the end of the jobs bank and allow car companies to use their devalued equity for half of their contributions into the fund for retiree health care, welcomed the White House's loans but complained about ''unfair conditions, singling out workers.''
 Despite its weaknesses, this plan is a credible attempt to get Detroit's two most fragile companies through the end of the year without running out of money. Bondholders and the U.A.W. should support it. 
 The incoming Obama administration still must morph this into a plan for long-term survival. Cutting debts and reducing compensation costs would help Detroit's automakers in the immediate future. 
 We expect that after Jan. 20, the next government will craft a plan that trades its support for a credible commitment by the car companies to make the needed investments in energy efficiency. Until then, the businesses need to survive.

HEADLINE: Treasury Has Spent $350 Billion of Bailout Fund

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department said on Friday that it had used up the first $350 billion that Congress approved for its financial bailout program. But it made no move to ask Congress for the next round of money.
 Instead, administration officials signaled that they were unlikely to ask for the money until at least January, when Congress returns with stronger Democratic majorities in both chambers. They may well punt on the issue and leave it for President-elect Barack Obama, who will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20.
 House and Senate Democrats said they did not expect the administration to ask for additional money until early January, and administration officials reinforced that impression by saying they were not in any rush. 
 ''We have no time frame,'' said Michele A. Davis, a spokeswoman for the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr. ''Because some of the allocated funds from the first $350 billion won't go out the door for a few weeks, we feel that right now we have the resources we need.''
 For at least the last month, Mr. Paulson has been dancing around the issue of asking Congress for the rest of the money for the bailout program, which is officially known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Among other ideas that he has been studying is a plan to buy up billions of dollars in federally guaranteed mortgages to bring mortgage rates down to 4.5 percent.
 Under the rococo requirements of the bailout legislation that Congress passed on Oct. 2, the Treasury automatically receives the second $350 billion if it asks for it -- unless both houses of Congress vote to disapprove the request within 15 days. 
 But Mr. Paulson has resisted being saddled with new requirements by Democrats, and has repeatedly refused to spend money on proposals to help struggling homeowners modify their loans or get entirely new mortgages.
 Mr. Paulson is also under heavy attack from both hard-line conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, and he faced a substantial risk that Congress would reject his request for more money -- an event that could set off another free fall in the financial markets, as when the House originally rejected the bailout proposal in September.
 Conservatives are still furious that Mr. Paulson is rewarding banks and other financial institutions that made reckless arrangements for mortgages over the last five years. Liberal Democrats are angry that Mr. Paulson has used all of the money for financial institutions and none to help reduce the avalanche of home foreclosures.
 ''Congress will need to release the remainder of the TARP to support financial market stability,'' Mr. Paulson said on Friday.
 But Mr. Paulson did not actually ask Congress for the money and did not say when he would. Instead, he vaguely vowed to ''discuss that process with the Congressional leadership and the president-elect's transition team in the near future.'' 
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he was confident that Democrats would be able to get what they wanted whether or not Congress imposes specific new legislative requirements.
 Mr. Frank said he was drafting a bill that would require the Treasury to spend money on reducing foreclosures, as well as on reducing mortgage rates by buying up large volumes of mortgage-backed securities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Democrats also want to impose tougher restrictions on executive pay and to pressure financial institutions that receive bailout money to increase their lending.
 But Mr. Frank said he was confident that Mr. Obama would insist on the same things, and that it would not matter much whether Congress imposed the requirements or the Treasury did them on its own.

HEADLINE: BUSH AIDS DETROIT, BUT HARD CHOICES WAIT FOR OBAMA

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and BILL VLASIC; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Washington and Andrew Ross Sorkin from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This article is by David E. Sanger, David M. HerszenhornandBill Vlasic.
 The emergency bailout of General Motors and Chrysler announced by President Bush on Friday gives the companies a few months to get their businesses in order, but hands off to President-elect Barack Obama the difficult political task of ruling on their future.
 The plan pumps $13.4 billion by mid-January into the companies from the fund that Congress authorized to rescue the financial industry. But the two companies have until March 31 to produce a plan for long-term profitability, including concessions from unions, creditors, suppliers and dealers.
 In February, another $4 billion will be available for G.M. if the rest of the $700 billion bailout package has been released. 
 Even before the March 31 deadline, it might fall to the Obama administration to persuade Congress to release the second $350 billion of the Treasury Department's huge financial system stabilization program -- a request that the Bush administration is reluctant to make. 
 The auto bailout plan sets ''targets'' rather than concrete requirements about what those concessions may be, meaning that Mr. Obama and his advisers have enormous latitude to decide how to define long-term viability. 
 While Mr. Obama has broadly insisted that the automakers radically increase the fuel efficiency of their fleets, reduce carbon emissions and save the maximum number of jobs possible, he will have just nine weeks after taking office to press for a detailed transformation of an industry whose problems have been building for three decades. 
 In Chicago, Mr. Obama embraced the plan but said he had not had enough time to study the details. He never addressed the question of how he would turn a program designed as a short-term bridge loan into a long-term reorganization.
 ''I do want to emphasize to the Big Three automakers and their executives that the American people's patience is running out, and that they should seize on this opportunity over the next several weeks and months to come up with a plan that is sustainable. And that means that they're going to have to make some hard choices,'' he said. 
 Mr. Obama said it was his intention to preserve jobs ''for years to come'' and that he wanted to make sure ''that it's not just workers who are bearing the brunt of that restructure, that they're not the ones who are taking all the hits.'' 
 Yet as the economy falters and joblessness balloons, Mr. Obama will be under extreme political pressure not to be too tough on the industry. 
 Already, Ron Gettelfinger, the president of the United Automobile Workers union, said he was pleased that the administration acted on the loan requests, but said the president added ''unfair conditions'' that singled out blue-collar workers.
 Mr. Gettelfinger said the union expected to appeal to Mr. Obama to alter the expectations for wage and benefit cuts. According to Treasury Department officials who drafted the wording, Mr. Obama would be free to change the requirements and loosen the standards, especially on how much workers would have to give up.
 Mr. Bush announced the plan early Friday, before the markets opened, and took no questions about its details. The day before, he conceded that he had been forced by the severity of the economic downturn to ignore many of the free-market principles he came to office embracing. 
 G.M. said it expected to draw on the first installment of its loans by Dec. 29. Soon after it pays suppliers and workers, the troubled automaker will begin putting drastic downsizing plans into effect, outlined to Congress this month, which include eliminating more than 30,000 jobs, shutting factories, shedding dealerships and determining the future of its Saab, Saturn and Pontiac brands. 
 In Detroit, a visibly relieved Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman, told reporters that the loans would allow the automakers to pay their bills and prevent a financial crisis from spreading through the industry's suppliers and dealers.
 Mr. Wagoner, who has been G.M.'s chief executive for eight years, added that he had no plans to step aside during the difficult months ahead. ''Do you think I would have gone through what I've gone through in the past two months if I didn't want to stay?''
 His reaction was echoed at Chrysler. ''We intend to be accountable for this loan, including meeting the specific requirements set forth by the government, and will continue to implement our plan for long-term viability,'' Chrysler's chairman, Robert L. Nardelli, said in an e-mail message to employees.
 Beyond the initial hurdles to provide all of the money, it will be left to Mr. Obama to make the tough judgments needed about the future of the industry. Are enough jobs being cut and factories being closed? Have the right product lines been consolidated? Are all of the stakeholders on the same page enough to make the long-term viability plans workable? And how should financial viability be defined?
 On paper, Mr. Obama will inherit a club to wield against the automakers and the unions: he can threaten to ''call'' the loans and require repayment in 30 days. 
 Yet as a practical matter, demanding immediate repayment would be enormously difficult to do, unless Mr. Obama chose to drive the two icons of American industrial strength into bankruptcy court during the first 70 days of his administration. 
 His aides know that he will come under tremendous pressure, including from the U.A.W., which supported his candidacy and helped finance his campaign. ''What we've seen from the U.A.W. already forces Obama to make a decision over whether to throw the U.A.W. under the bus,'' said Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital. 
 The bailout Mr. Bush announced is missing one major element: a ''car czar'' to administer the program, a key feature of the legislation that was defeated in the Senate last week. Until the end of Mr. Bush's presidency, in just over a month, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., will play that role. But it is unclear what will happen after Mr. Obama is sworn in.
 For now, his auto brain trust is mainly composed of Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who was on the board for the Chrysler bailout in 1979; Austan Goolsbee, whose expertise at the University of Chicago has been the economics of industrial organizations; and Joshua Steiner, who is experienced in financial restructuring. 
 While many elements of the loan requirements are drawn from legislation that failed in Congress, there is one crucial difference between Mr. Bush's plan and the one the House approved: it strips away a requirement that Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm that owns 80 percent of Chrysler, be held liable for any losses experienced by the taxpayers.
 Instead, Cerberus on Friday said it would give the first $2 billion to the government if it ever sold Chrysler Financial, the company's financing arm. While it has not asked for immediate help, the Ford Motor Company said it welcomed the assistance to G.M. and Chrysler because of the fragile, interdependent nature of the industry and its vast network of suppliers.
 Both G.M. and Chrysler outlined a turnaround program calling for deep cuts in operations and expenses in their original requests to Congress for government loans.
 But the White House appears to be expecting more than conventional restructuring strategies. Mr. Bush called for the companies to extract major concessions from their bondholders, creditors, dealers, suppliers and the U.A.W.
 Under the Bush administration plan, G.M. and Chrysler would each have immediate access to $4 billion upon the signing of the emergency loan agreements with the Treasury. G.M. would then have access to an addition $5.4 billion on Jan. 16 and another $4 billion on Feb. 17 provided that Congress has released the remaining $350 billion for the Treasury's rescue program. 
 The companies would be required to limit executive pay, eliminate ''golden parachute'' severance packages and sell their corporate jets. While the loans are outstanding, the companies would be barred from paying shareholder dividends. 
 The loan deal also requires the companies to quickly reduce their huge debt obligations by two-thirds, mostly through debt-for-equity swaps, and to reach agreements on wage and benefit cuts with the unions by Dec. 31.

HEADLINE: Filling the Gaps in the World's Work Force

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
MANPOWER is a global staffing agency with about 4,500 offices in 80 countries and territories that place workers into permanent, temporary and contract jobs. In 2007, the company had $21 billion in revenue worldwide. Although Manpower is based in Milwaukee, where it was established 60 years ago, it derives 67 percent of its revenue from Europe. Jeffrey A. Joerres became the company's chief executive in 1999 and chairman in 2001. In a recent interview, he spoke about the global employment outlook for a wide range of industries.
 Q.What are your tips for job seekers in what is shaping up to be a bleak employment market? 
 A. It will be harder to find a job now than it was a year ago. So you should have a sense of urgency, but not desperation. There are jobs available, but they may not be the same kinds of jobs. And earnings and wages are being reset. You may have to make tough decisions, like ''Do I compromise on my salary, or do I try to build my skills to go into another area of work?'' It's easy to say that you should invest in your skills, but many people need to pay the rent. That's where I'm hoping we can help. We can get them contract work to bring in some income while they are looking for a full-time job.
 Q. President-elect Barack Obama recently announced his intention to create a large-scale public works program. What impact could a program like this have on employment next year?
 A. When you invest in infrastructure, you're employing the skilled trades, electricians and masons. Those jobs are hard to fill. We don't have enough people in the skilled trades. Also, any time a president goes down the path of job creation through the government, there is a logical lag because you have to create the parameters for the contracts and hire the people. I would not expect an economic impact from the public works program in the first half, probably in the third or fourth quarter.
 Q. Manpower has a large outplacement services business in 34 countries, where companies pay you to provide career training and assessments for workers that they have laid off. Are you seeing an increase in this line of work, or in this tough economy, are some companies opting not to pay for outplacement services?
 A. We have seen a big increase in the volume of people using these services in the United States in November and early December. If we have a very protracted time when companies are strapped for cash, they may decide not to use outplacement services. But we have not seen any of that so far, because companies want to protect their brand. And they know that the employees who are left look at how the other employees are treated.
 Q. Which types of jobs have the best outlook next year, and which jobs are at the most risk?
 A. Health care tends to have the most stable employment, and that's global. But that is a hard industry to jump into if you don't have the training. Most other industries are under pressure. The outlook for manufacturing is still very difficult globally, and I think manufacturing could deliver some bad news in the first half of 2009. The home building industry in the United States won't get back on its feet until we work through some issues in the pricing of housing and the credit issues. I think financial services is going to lag other industries in terms of hiring. Media will be under a tremendous amount of stress, as advertising moves to the Internet. No one has figured out how to monetize the content on the Internet, and that's not going to happen in 2009.
 Q. What about your own industry? Given the steep decline in hiring, has Manpower made any staff cuts recently?
 A. We've done some. It's been very small and in different locations. We have some 750 offices in the United States. Depending on what happens in 2009, we might be forced to close some offices. But that would not be our intention. We'd like to keep our footprint, because you cannot open offices back up fast enough when you're coming out of a recession. Generally, our people are the first to go when companies are reducing their labor force, and the first to come back in the 18 to 24 months coming out of a recession. During that time, companies tend to hire more temporary workers, because they're not sure if the recovery is real, or if it's a head fake.
 Q. Last year, you received a cash bonus of $2.8 million, as well as stock and options. Do you plan to take a bonus again this year?
 A. My bonus is based on results for the year. It is a quantitative formula based primarily on earnings-per-share growth. Last year was the most profitable year in the company's history. Given what's going on this year, my bonus would fall to close to zero, which is the way it should go. And it's not just me. The whole management team will take a hit this year. We're in a cyclical industry, and that's the way it goes.

 INTERIOR MINISTER'S OFFICERS
 To Be Released in Iraq
 Iraq's interior minister said that all 24 of his officers who had been arrested on charges of aiding terrorism and having inappropriate ties with illegal political parties would be released. ''It's because of the competition of the provincial elections,'' the minister, Jawad al-Bolani, said of the arrests. ''It's just electoral propaganda and that's playing with fire.'' PAGE A6 
 NATO RESUMES TALKS WITH RUSSIA
 The secretary general of NATO had lunch with the Russian ambassador to the organization, beginning a ''conditional and graduated re-engagement'' with Moscow after cutting off formal ties in the aftermath of the Georgian-Russian war in August. ''The most difficult thing is to make the first step,'' Dmitry O. Rogozin, the ambassador, said. ''We are at the beginning of the difficult route to restore trust. PAGE A8

 WORKER KILLED AND 18 INJURED
 In Atlanta Walkway Collapse
 An elevated pedestrian walkway under construction at the Atlanta Botanical Garden collapsed, killing one worker and injuring 18 others. The workers apparently had begun pouring concrete for the walk when the accident occurred, but the cause of the collapse was still unknown. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration immediately undertook an investigation. PAGE A10
 EFFORT TO INVALIDATE GAY MARRIAGES
 The people behind the ballot measure that barred same-sex marriage in California want the Supreme Court to, in effect, make the measure retroactive by invalidating the 18,000 or so same-sex weddings performed before the ban's passage. The motion is the latest legal effort in the seesaw battle surrounding the ban, which is currently being reviewed by the California Supreme Court, which, by legalizing same-sex marriage in May, prompting the whole issue. PAGE A10
 BOOM AIDED CLINTON FOUNDATION
 The lure of having a former president at the head certainly played a role in the financial successes of the William J. Clinton Foundation. But it was helpful to have a global boom in commodities and hedge funds, too, a boom that now seems to be over. And so the financial collapse is bound to trickle down, or up, or sideways, and diminish the cash value of many of Mr. Clinton's connections. PAGE A11
 ANOTHER PASTOR CONTROVERSY
 His selection of the Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration has given President-elect Barack Obama his second pastor-related controversy, on the heels of his campaign over the incendiary Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. A difference is that this time Mr. Obama is being attacked from the left; meanwhile, he says the inauguration festivities should include a range of viewpoints. PAGE A16

 The 137 new or increased taxes and fees proposed on Tuesday by Gov. David A. Paterson to help balance the budget touch on all manner of vices, diversions and services -- including beer, wine, cigars, sugared drinks, music downloads, fishing licenses and haircuts -- making it hard to find anybody who would be unaffected by the proposals.

 Putting the foot in the ball for the Giants are a couple of relative geezers in the world of contact sports: the punter Jeff Feagles, a 21-year veteran at age 43; and the place-kicker John Carney, 44, and in his 20th season. Both have been selected to the Pro Bowl, and both make a living on accuracy: Feagles by punting the ball out of bounds; Carney by kicking it between the uprights. PAGE B10
 BELICHICK AT HIS MOST MASTERLY
 Coach Bill Belichick of the Patriots, never a person to use two words when one (or none) would do, noted after the loss of Tom Brady in the first game that his job was not to worry about what might have been, but to play the hand he was dealt. The hand has not gotten better as the season has gone on, but the Patriots are still tied for first place in the American Football Conference East. It may be the best coaching job Belichick has ever done -- which is saying something. PAGE B9
 N.B.A. COACH A TEMP JOB
 The saying has long been that every coach is hired to be fired, but the N.B.A. seems intent on driving the point home. Just past the quarter-mark of the season six coaches have been let go. And Jerry Sloan's industry-defying 20 seasons in Utah notwithstanding, the median tenure for coaches is 1.3 seasons. It is a strong incentive for coaches to rent instead of buying. PAGE B11

 TAX UPSIDES OF A DOWNTURN
 With so much financial uncertainty about 2009 it is difficult -- and certainly not joy inducing -- to start thinking ahead to things like taxes. But this may be a good time to take that painful look into the portfolio and sell some dogs at losses, among other steps. PAGE B1

 THIS CRISIS LOOKS FAMILIAR
 The election of a new Democratic president at a time of grave financial peril for the country has inevitably evoked comparisons to the last time that happened, with Franklin D. Roosevelt.

 Editorial
 SURVIVOR: DETROIT
 It came as a relief that President Bush was willing to break free of ideology long enough to keep General Motors and Chrysler from collapsing on his watch. The $17.4 billion in loans represents a necessary bridge over the road to liquidation, protecting the economy from a wave of additional job losses. But they do not guarantee Detroit's long-term survival. PAGE A20

HEADLINE: Principles of Capitalism and the Automaker Bailout

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Pan Am Dies, America Lives'' (column, The New York Times on the Web, Dec. 18):
 I agree with Roger Cohen about the demise of Pan Am and the churn versus European model of company survival through government intervention.
 I would like to extend the thought relative to General Motors. Indeed, without a change in the corporate culture, the bailout will be big waste of money. I propose the natural demise of the General Motors corporation as a wholly obsolete business model. Clearly, there is no one with the vision, experience or talent to run such a ragamuffin behemoth. 
 Cut the car divisions loose as reorganized, independent corporations. Each will sink or swim based on the vision and leadership gifts of its new chief executive and executive teams. These smaller companies could be nimble, forward-thinking entities capable of meeting the needs of consumers. 
 David Ohman Durango, Colo., Dec. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The current spate of bailouts because an entity is considered ''too big to fail'' means that we no longer trust our system of capitalism. 
 The greed of those who are willing to do anything to make a buck has just about destroyed our once great economy, and perhaps our nation. 
 Our system of commerce and government is flawed, perhaps fatally. Chief executives have been hiring their friends to be on their boards of directors. And, as we know, friends take care of friends. 
 What has happened over many decades is that the rich and powerful have become richer and more powerful by peddling their influence to our lawmakers. 
 How do we fix it? I haven't got a clue, but neither does anyone else. The difference is, those in charge won't admit it!
 H. M. Goldberg Brookfield, Conn., Dec. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I didn't think it was possible for anyone, with the current state of the economy, to still extol the ostensible virtues of laissez-faire economics. But Roger Cohen has proved me wrong. 
 Don't rescue the auto companies, says Mr. Cohen, lest we drain the vitality out of American capitalism.
 Excuse me? What vitality? Has he not noticed that we are entering a deflationary spiral? The loss of hundreds of thousands more jobs would drive aggregate demand down even further, creating yet more job losses, feeding the vicious circle yet further until we land right in the middle of another Great Depression. 
 It's ironic in current debates about the economic crisis that those most wedded to the utopian view of laissez-faire capitalism are those who would nearly ensure -- however unwittingly -- its destruction. 
 Mark S. Silverman Amherst, Mass., Dec. 19, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Roger Cohen, in questioning the wisdom of saving our car companies, is still thinking in the old laissez-faire paradigm. That dog don't hunt anymore! 
 ''What I predict is the imminent disintegration of the global capitalist system,'' George Soros warned 10 years ago in ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism.'' Even though Mr. Soros took back his forecast later on, what he predicted is happening now: the market system has failed, and the dominoes are falling.
 Germany, following the old thinking, is blocking the fire engines trying to save Europe's economy. Paul Krugman has explained the worldwide consequences of that folly, along with the similar stakes if we let our automakers fail.

HEADLINE: Reshaping White House With a Domestic Focus

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama finished building a cabinet of prominent and strong-willed players on Friday, but he is putting together a governing structure that will concentrate more decision making over his top domestic priorities in the White House.
With new offices in the White House to coordinate health care, urban policy and energy initiatives, Mr. Obama has signaled that he intends to keep real power over domestic issues close at hand. The collective moves shift the political center of gravity farther away from the cabinet, a trend that has accelerated under presidents of both parties in recent years.
At the same time, Mr. Obama's reorganization suggests a willingness to tolerate, and even encourage, competing power centers within his administration, but it is unclear how that will work in practice. Not only is he creating new positions with authority over key areas, he is filling his West Wing with people of stature equal to or even greater than the members of his cabinet, including two former cabinet officers and a former Senate majority leader. 
David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, said issues like health care and energy ''are so fundamental to our ability to right the economy in the long term that he knows he's going to have to drive a lot of that. And he wants a high-powered staff in the White House to help him do that.''
While there may be some push-and-pull between the White House and cabinet departments, Mr. Axelrod said the president-elect had emphasized during job interviews his insistence on cohesion. ''He encourages debate,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''He doesn't tolerate factionalism.''
The revamped arrangement indicates a shift in priorities away from those of President Bush, who spent much of his tenure fashioning a new national security apparatus in a time of war and terrorist threats. Mr. Obama's transition team is even considering undoing some of what Mr. Bush built in terms of security structures in the White House.
Transition officials, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said they were thinking about folding the White House Homeland Security Council, which Mr. Bush established, into the National Security Council, seeing that as potentially more efficient. And they may reassign responsibility for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan back to the national security adviser instead of keeping the separate ''war czar'' position created 19 months ago.
Mr. Obama and his advisers have not made decisions on those ideas and are wary of sending a message that they are somehow letting their guard down seven years after the Sept. 11 attacks or taking the fighting overseas for granted. Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, has privately urged the Obama team to keep the Homeland Security Council.
Transition officials said Mr. Obama would still make national security a central priority regardless of how he reshapes the White House. But they said the incoming president could not afford to keep the same organization as his predecessor with the economy in crisis and climate change on the rise.
''After eight years of a White House that had only a sporadic interest in the domestic front, Obama has made clear that he's going to be attacking domestic problems on all cylinders,'' said Bruce Reed, head of President Bill Clinton's Domestic Policy Council and now president of the Democratic Leadership Council.
''He's setting up a very strong White House staff structure, and most of the major policy decisions are going to be made in the White House,'' said Frank J. Donatelli, who worked in Ronald Reagan's White House. ''If you're going to be as active as he's apparently planning to be on the domestic side, there's no other way you can do it.''
Mr. Obama completed his cabinet choices on Friday, confirming that he would nominate Representative Hilda L. Solis of California as labor secretary, Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois as transportation secretary and former Mayor Ron Kirk of Dallas as United States trade representative. He also announced that he would make Karen Mills, a venture capitalist from Maine, the head of the Small Business Administration.
With that, Mr. Obama has finished selecting his core team faster than any president-elect in decades. In trying to balance various constituencies and backgrounds, he assembled a 15-member cabinet that includes six current or former members of Congress, three current or former governors and two Republicans, including Mr. LaHood.
Under pressure to increase ethnic and gender diversity, Mr. Obama picked three women and three Hispanics for his cabinet, with Ms. Solis counting in both categories. He named two Asian-Americans and one African-American. (Other officials will also be given a cabinet rank.)
Beyond the cabinet, every new president puts his stamp on the White House itself to suit his priorities and the imperatives of his era. The National Security Council was created under Harry S. Truman. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy was created under Reagan. The National Economic Council was created by Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Obama is building new offices to coordinate his plans to expand health care, promote clean energy and reinvigorate urban policy. His choices to fill those posts also suggest how much influence they will have. He named a former Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, as health care czar, and a former Environmental Protection Agency director, Carol M. Browner, as energy czar.
And he effectively bolstered the clout of the National Economic Council by installing a former Treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, to lead that office.
What remains unclear is how these prominent White House officials will share responsibility with the relevant department and agency heads. Mr. Summers once led the Treasury Department, but that job now falls to Timothy F. Geithner, who used to work for him in the Clinton administration. Ms. Browner likewise once led the E.P.A. but now a former subordinate, Lisa P. Jackson, will direct the agency.
Mr. Daschle, cognizant of Mr. Clinton's failure to overhaul health care in the 1990s, insisted on taking the White House job in addition to his nomination as secretary of health and human services. He will have an office in the West Wing and will attend Mr. Obama's morning senior staff meetings when possible, Democrats close to the situation said.
Robert E. Rubin, who served as Mr. Clinton's Treasury secretary, made a habit of going to the White House each morning for those staff meetings, giving him greater access to decision making. One Democrat close to the transition said Mr. Geithner might duplicate that practice.
''So much of it is symbolic,'' said Karen M. Hult, a Virginia Tech political science professor who has written books on the evolution of the White House staff. ''You want to get close to the president because it signals to others that it's a top political priority and the person really has the president's ear. Now, of course, the more people you have like that, the less likely they really are to have the president's ear.''

HEADLINE: Chrysler Chief's Statement on Bailout Plan

 BODY:
Following is a statement issued Friday by Robert L. Nardelli, chief executive of Chrysler, on the White House announcement of federal aid for his company and General Motors:
 To Chrysler employees and other stakeholders: 
 We have received news that U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will provide $4 billion of initial funding to Chrysler LLC from the TARP (Troubled Assets Relief Program) as a loan to help bridge the current financial crisis. We appreciate the Administration's confidence in Chrysler. 
 As outlined in our submission to Congress, we intend to be accountable for this loan, including meeting the specific requirements set forth by the government, and will continue to implement our plan for long-term viability. The receipt of this loan means Chrysler can continue to pursue its vision to build the fuel-efficient, high-quality cars and trucks people want to buy, will enjoy driving and will want to buy again. 
 For Chrysler to succeed in its mission to return to profitability, we need the continued support of our many business partners. Terms associated with the bridge loan include Chrysler's commitment to work with key constituents including our owners, lenders, suppliers, dealers, management and employees to identify and achieve the cost-savings concessions we need to build a long-term viable enterprise. These concessions discussions will happen quickly, as a full governmental review and approval of our plan is expected by March 31, 2009. 
 We are meeting with our suppliers, mindful that they are going through a difficult period as well. But we must cooperatively find ways to further reduce our costs while maintaining normal operations. We will ask our suppliers to maintain their commitment to reasonable trade terms and normal fulfillment of orders for as long as the federal loan is outstanding. This will assure that neither Chrysler, nor our suppliers would suffer the substantial losses caused by the plant/production shutdowns that result from stop shipments or other disruptions. 
 We will seek continued dealer cooperation to improve our cash position and consolidate our U.S. network. Project Genesis is on the path to aligning our product portfolio with a smaller, healthier tri-branded dealer network based on the realities of our business environment. Because strong, healthy dealers are essential to our success, we are also working with our dealers to keep dealer inventories in line with the marketplace, focusing on how they can support their business despite the falloff in sales through sales of used vehicles, service and parts. 
 As a condition of the bridge loan, we have committed to work with our lenders to seek their participation in concessions as well. 
 Cerberus has already agreed to forgo any benefit from the upside that would, in part, be created from the bridge loan and any other government assistance that the Company may obtain. 
 All employees have and will continue to help support Chrysler's recovery. We have also partnered with the UAW to find new opportunities to increase our competitiveness. The Company has already undertaken and will continue to undertake significant cost reduction actions related to salaried workers also. 
 The bridge loan allows us to meet cash needs, pay our suppliers, continue developing great products and move forward with the restructuring and streamlining of our organization that we began in 2007. This restructuring will reduce the number of personnel layers while increasing managers' span of control, enabling us to reduce costs, make faster decisions and do our jobs effectively with fewer resources. 
 In our drive to profitability, we will not slow down on plans to provide the cars and trucks that people in markets around the world want to buy. We have 24 major launches in our plan from 2009 through 2012, with a key feature of this future product strategy being our capability as an electric vehicle company. Building on our status as the largest producer of electric-drive vehicles in the United States today with our GEM unit, we are focusing on electric as our primary clean-vehicle technology. Combined with our new products from our ENVI group, we expect that 500,000 Chrysler electric-drive vehicles will be on the road by 2013. 
 It is essential that we continue to promote our lineup of current and future products so that our customers understand the profound changes taking place at Chrysler. With that in mind, we will be revealing several important new products at the upcoming North American International Auto Show. We also sought the support of our local Detroit area dealers for the auto show, and I want to express my appreciation to all those that have provided assistance to help fund our exhibit. 
 While promoting our products, we will also appropriately scale back some of our presence at the auto show because of current business conditions. We have conserved costs in our press event with vehicle reveals that are product-focused and straightforward, and a simplified product display. 
 As we draw to the end of this very eventful and difficult year, I want to extend my thanks to all who contributed to Chrysler this year, including our many colleagues who have moved on. Against the difficult conditions of a global recession, you have once again shown the resilience that is the hallmark of Chrysler people. In recent weeks, I have received hundreds of letters of support from those in the extended Chrysler family, confirming that there is great enthusiasm to restore our company to success. 
 With the holidays upon us, I hope you can take time to enjoy the warmth and companionship of good friends and family. Please have a safe and joyous holiday season, and let's all return in 2009 with a renewed commitment to making Chrysler the great company we all want it to be. 
 Bob Nardelli

HEADLINE: Hope Amid The Gloom

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
Gail Collins is off today.

 BODY:
Is the end of the war in sight?
 I don't mean Iraq. I'm talking about the war against working people in the U.S. that has taken such a vicious economic toll over the past three decades. 
 Even as Americans by the thousands sign up for jobless benefits in this horrendous holiday season, or line up to declare bankruptcy, or stand sorrowfully aside as their homes are foreclosed upon, there are some slender reasons to hope. 
 On Friday, George W. Bush, in the slapstick final weeks of his disastrous presidency, grudgingly announced that, yes, emergency loans would be made available to prevent the collapse of the U.S. auto industry. He looked like a boy who had been forced to eat his spinach, or drink his castor oil. 
 But the economy is in such an awful state that even the most backward administration of our lifetime recognized that risking the chain reaction of a complete auto industry meltdown was not an option. (The Bush deal is unfairly onerous to auto workers, but the loans will serve as a bridge to the Obama era, when, presumably, a more equitable arrangement could be worked out.)
 Mr. Bush's announcement came a day after it was learned that President-elect Obama had chosen Representative Hilda Solis of California, a fierce advocate of workers, to be his labor secretary. The Obama administration also is committed to moving quickly on an economic stimulus package that could reach $1 trillion over two years.
 These are developments that portend a radically different environment for the nation's workers. From Ronald Reagan's voodoo economics to Henry Paulson's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, we've put the mighty resources of the national government overwhelmingly on the side of those who were already rich and powerful.
 Ordinary workers have suffered. It took years to get a lousy little boost in the minimum wage for the working poor. Attempts to expand health insurance coverage were fought almost to a standstill. Guaranteed pensions vanished. And the maniacs who set fire to the economy with their incendiary financial instruments (yet another form of voodoo) were hot to privatize Social Security.
 As Andy Stern, president of the huge Service Employees International Union, told me on Friday: ''We've had a 25-year experience with market-worshipping, deregulating, privatizing, trickle-down policies, and it has ended us up with the greatest economy on earth staggering, and with the greatest amount of inequality since the Great Depression.'' 
 The contempt for workers over this long period has hardly been hidden. Until Mr. Bush was forced by circumstances to tap the TARP program for the auto industry loans (small potatoes compared with the gargantuan Wall Street bailouts), the administration had gone out of its way to keep the program's hundreds of billions of dollars reserved for the elites of the financial services industry and their associates. 
 These elites, of course, were the geniuses who ruined the most powerful economy on earth. When Citigroup went into yet another swoon last month, the rush to rescue it was breathtaking. Posses don't come more elegant: the outgoing treasury secretary, Hank Paulson; the incoming treasury secretary (and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York), Timothy Geithner; and a former treasury secretary (not to mention Citigroup board member), Robert Rubin. 
 They materialized magnificently, armed with hundreds of billions in taxpayer bailout cash.
 Leo Gerard, president of the steelworkers union, summed up the government's attitude nicely when he said: ''Washington will bail out those who shower before work, but not those who shower afterwards.''
 Working people have been treated like enemies, a class to be preyed upon. Labor unions were ferociously attacked. Jobs were shipped overseas by the millions. People were hired as temps or consultants so benefits could be denied. 
 All of this may finally be changing. It remains to be seen how strong a voice Ms. Solis will have in the Obama administration, but she is pro-worker to her core, a politician who actually knows what it's like to walk a picket line.
 And there have been other promising developments. More than 200 laid-off workers staged a successful six-day sit-in at a factory in Chicago this month, demanding and eventually getting severance pay and benefits that they were owed by law.
 A more substantial victory occurred in Tar Heel, N.C., last week when workers, after a brutal 15-year struggle, succeeded in organizing the notorious Smithfield Packing slaughterhouse, the largest hog-killing and processing plant in the world.
 These are shaky steps in the overall scheme of things, to be sure. But at long last, they are steps in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Shares End Mixed After Brief Bounce

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
A huge bailout for Detroit was barely able to budge Wall Street on Friday.
Stock markets surged in early trading after President Bush announced plans to extend $13.4 billion in emergency loans to the troubled automakers General Motors and Chrysler. But Wall Street's reaction cooled, the morning's early gains eroded, and markets ended mixed.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.88 points, or 0.3 percent, to 8,579.11. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.60 points, or 0.29 percent, to close at 887.88. The Nasdaq gained 11.95 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,564.32. 
It was a middling end to a roller coaster week on Wall Street. Stocks rose 5 percent in a midweek rally after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to record lows of zero to 0.25 percent, but gave back most of their gains and closed flat for the week.
But some analysts found signs of recovery in Wall Street's indifference. Despite quarterly losses at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and another round of dour economic data that presaged a broad and lasting downturn, stock markets did not fall into a tailspin this week.
''Right now, all else equal, stocks want to go up,'' said Douglas M. Peta, an independent investment strategist. ''They're not going down on bad news anymore, and I think that does show there's been a change in sentiment. I don't know how long that's going to hold. We still have plenty of fundamental challenges to go through.''
A two-month rally in the price of government debt, which drove yields to record lows, abated slightly on Friday as credit markets continued to show signs of healing. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 14/32, to 114 14/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 2.12 percent, up from 2.08 percent late Thursday.
Crude oil prices fell for another day on Friday amid signs that stockpiles were increasing while global consumption slipped as people drove less and construction projects halted. Oil futures settled at 33.87 a barrel, down more than 75 percent from their peak of $145 a barrel in July. The energy sector was the worst performer on Friday, and oil companies like Exxon, Chevron and BP all closed lower on falling oil prices.
Shares of G.M., which have plunged by more than 80 percent this year as sales screeched to a halt and huge operating costs and legacy obligations drained cash, rebounded by 23 percent on news of the auto bailout. The Ford Motor Company gained 4 percent, although Ford said it was not taking the emergency government loans. Chrysler is not publicly traded.
In a statement before the markets opened, Mr. Bush said the government would be providing $13.4 billion in emergency loans to G.M. and Chrysler, with the possibility of another $4 billion in February. He said that an ''orderly bankruptcy'' -- an idea floated by the White House on Thursday -- was not possible, but said the automakers needed to undergo a major overhaul to become viable.
This fall, chief executives of Ford, Chrysler and G.M. made two trips to Congress to plead for a government rescue using money from the $700 billion bailout for financial companies. After the Senate refused to act on a plan, the White House stepped in.
While the government loan will probably keep the lights on at Chrysler and G.M. and prevent an imminent bankruptcy, analysts said it was too soon to say whether the companies would be able to become self-sustaining, or whether they would need to petition the Obama administration for more assistance if the economy languishes in a recession throughout 2009.
''Wouldn't it be wonderful if it turned out to be enough,'' said Dana Johnson, chief economist at Comerica Bank, who follows the auto industry. ''But you have to think that that's not the likeliest scenario.''
Standard & Poor's cut its credit ratings on 11 American and European financial institutions on Friday, reflecting concerns about their balance sheets and their future prospects amid stormy credit markets. Despite the downgrade, shares of the companies, which include JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, ended mixed.
Citigroup fell farther than most banks, by 5 percent, after its banking subsidiary, Citibank, received rate cuts from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. Moody's also cut Citigroup's credit by two notches.
''The agencies appear to have zapped away at least some of the holiday spirit that is already rather subdued,'' the research firm CreditSights wrote in a note.

HEADLINE: In Desperate Times, the Rise to Take the Reins and Take On Fear Itself

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
HYDE PARK, N.Y. -- As winds howl through the empty rooms of failed financial institutions and foreclosed homes, as unemployment statistics spike and stocks plunge, as an era of high hopes stutters with fear, and seeming shelters shake on fraudulent foundations, who would not hope that new leadership might stave off further catastrophe?
And a new leader, coming to power with his ''brain trust'' of advisers and his ''new deal'' for the nation, has but a short time to make his case before inertia and fear become dominant once again.
Does the analogy need to be spelled out? In his campaign, as the financial world was convulsing a few months ago, Barack Obama invoked Franklin Delano Roosevelt and cited his most famous line from the First Inaugural -- ''the only thing we have to fear is fear itself'' -- words delivered in 1933 during the worst days of the Depression. Four thousand banks had collapsed in two months, and one of every four workers was unemployed. Nearly half the country's $20 billion in home mortgages were in default. 
Since Mr. Obama's election, references to Roosevelt have become even more plentiful. Caricatures of the president-elect with a cigarette holder and an insouciant Roosevelt grin have appeared in major publications. Mr. Obama has implicitly invoked Roosevelt's approach to what was the worst financial crisis of the 20th century, saying he would enact the largest public-works program since the building of the federal highway system in the 1950s. And he has made clear (conceptually echoing Roosevelt) that his attention to the welfare of the citizenry would be inseparable from his attention to the health of the economy.
So it is fortunate that the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum here, commemorating the 75th anniversary of the start of the New Deal, mounted an exhibition, ''Action and Action Now: FDR's First 100 Days,'' referring to the brief period that Roosevelt treated as a self-imposed challenge to begin having an effect. During that time he oversaw the passage of 15 major pieces of legislation that transformed the country's view of itself and redefined the character of American government.
After Mr. Obama was elected, the New-York Historical Society in Manhattan borrowed rare items and documents from the Roosevelt library to present a miniature version of the exhibition -- really an expanded display case and a capsule view of those tumultuous days -- called ''A New President Takes Command.'' There are political cartoons, drafts of speeches and a few objects like a set of braces Roosevelt had worn on his paralyzed legs. A timeline provides, in compressed space, some sense of the urgency and haste with which problems were addressed.
In facing the crisis, Roosevelt had argued that he would need the equivalent of emergency wartime powers. Many were prepared to go further. On the day of his inauguration, March 4, 1933, The New York Herald-Tribune said it was ''for dictatorship if necessary.'' But a dictator could not have done more. Within five days of Roosevelt's taking office, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act, establishing procedures for reopening sound banks; that was just the beginning.
The Public Works Administration was created to provide jobs building highways, dams and public structures. The powers of the Federal Trade Commission were increased to regulate stock trading. The gold standard was abandoned. A Civilian Conservation Corps was established, putting a quarter-million young men to work in park development and outdoor projects. Farm and home mortgages were refinanced by the government to prevent foreclosures. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was created to protect bank deposits. And the National Recovery Administration was established to regulate the practices of American business.
Nearly everything we now take for granted about the federal government's role in dealing with unemployment, poverty and economic protection can be traced to programs started during this period. ''In three months,'' the show notes, ''F.D.R. created the basic toolbox of modern American liberalism.''
But ultimately, the Manhattan display, while informatively sounding every crucial theme, only whets the appetite for deeper understanding. The Hyde Park exhibition is far more thorough and absorbing.
It begins in a darkened gallery in which film clips and photographs of the Depression are projected onto a mock tree stump and clapboard house, showing images of poverty on a wide scale. This material makes clear just how dire the circumstances were, and why there was so much clamor for action beyond Herbert Hoover's hesitant and constrained approach. An attempted assassination of the president-elect in February 1933 nearly dashed all hopes.
But the inauguration brought promises of relief. The psychological effect was as important as any policy -- which, in any case, Roosevelt never outlined in advance. We can also hear the newly elected leader here in excerpts from the first of his many radio broadcasts: for the first time, ordinary citizens could hear a president's voice in an intimate setting.
Roosevelt expertly modulated his delivery. During the Hoover administration, we are told, 5,000 pieces of mail came to the president in a week; during the Roosevelt administration, 50,000 arrived. The week after Roosevelt's first address, so hungry were listeners for contact and reassurance, that nearly half a million came in. Copies of many of those letters wallpaper a gallery.
It becomes clear, too, that before 1933, the United States was a largely rural nation -- half the populace lived outside urban areas, and one in five workers was on a farm. The transformation wrought by the New Deal, a devastating drought and the growth of industry didn't just mean that a new form of federalism was being shaped, but that a new national culture was evolving, as if pieces were being fit together to create a new image. One display here notes that in 1933 10 million jigsaw puzzles were sold every week, some celebrating Roosevelt.
The New Deal legislation itself is dealt with in a kind of quick summary. Some achievements are clear, even in minor programs. The Civilian Conservation Corps, for example, ultimately hired three million young people for outdoor work and conservation, ultimately strengthening the national parks movement.
Others, conceived in an emergency, have a constricted character that might have caused as many problems as they solved. Did the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which tried to stabilize food prices by paying farmers not to produce crops, succeed in stopping the deflationary collapse of prices, or was the persistent drought responsible, amplified by other scarcities? This subsidy program even remains active today, though now it has the faint aura of a racket.
One reason there has been a conservative reaction against the New Deal in recent years is that so much writing about it has been so unabashedly celebratory, missing the movement's shadows. The National Industrial Recovery Act, for example, outlawed child labor and helped in the formation of unions, but it also led to arbitrary price- and wage-fixing and was ultimately declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Some examples of its overreach, outlined in Amity Shlaes's recent book, ''The Forgotten Man,'' are chilling.
Yet like Jonathan Alter's biography of Roosevelt, ''The Defining Moment,'' the exhibition suggests that the New Deal's main doctrine was experimentation. ''Certainly the record of the First 100 Days is mixed,'' the show concludes. ''Some of Roosevelt's initiatives succeeded. Others failed. Some programs were contradictory. Still, to suffering Americans, what mattered was that someone was taking bold action.''
In this way Herman R. Eberhardt, the show's curator, avoids engaging in the knotty, passionate debates about New Deal policies and Keynesian economics that are hinted at in excerpts from recent writings about the period. He makes the case that even though the Depression was to drag on for years, Roosevelt quickly succeeded in establishing the foundations for a new kind of social consciousness. The W.P.A. and relief programs asserted that there really was a larger public worth thinking about, transcending individual need and desire. The democratic trick then, as now, was to avoid turning the public into an absolute master demanding deference -- or vice versa.
There was a kind of moral psychology at work in the New Deal that should not be underestimated. The projection of ethical authority, genteelly applied, was one of Roosevelt's great political gifts. And it could hide the New Deal's flaws as well as display virtues. One of the show's most fascinating panels is an array of political cartoons published during those first 100 days, showing Roosevelt walking a tightrope over a chasm, or taming a caged lion, or pulling an injured Uncle Sam up the edge of a cliff, or comforting a disabled veteran -- all images of extraordinary physical courage and ability.
Of course Roosevelt was paralyzed from polio, and next to the cartoon display is a case with his leg braces, along with a rare photograph showing Roosevelt trying to walk in them -- an image that the press, for reasons of tact, and the president, for reasons of strategy and pride, never drew attention to.
This kind of dissembling would never work today, but with it Roosevelt was able to project fully the kind of power and stance he wanted. That image was part of the economic policy.
Contemporary analogies are strained: our economy is not yet close to the one Roosevelt faced. But at least so far, Mr. Obama has shown a comparable skill with image; the substance is yet to come.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid Should Be Earned

BYLINE: By LORNE CRANER, BILL FRIST, KENNETH HACKETT and ALAN PATRICOF. 
Lorne Craner, the president of the International Republican Institute; Bill Frist, a former Republican leader of the Senate; Kenneth Hackett, the president of Catholic Relief Services; and Alan Patricof, a founder of a venture capital firm, are appointees to the Millennium Challenge Corporation's board.

 BODY:
AS Barack Obama works to reinvigorate America's standing in the world, foreign aid will be one of his most precise tools of statecraft. Ever since the Marshall Plan helped rebuild Europe after World War II, aid has been instrumental in winning hearts and minds and catalyzing global economic growth that has contributed to America's prosperity. 
 But not all foreign aid is the same. Hard lessons learned over the past five decades have taught us that good governance, accountability, local ownership and long-term engagement are the keys to success. In January, the new administration will inherit the five-year-old Millennium Challenge Corporation, which was created by Congress to ensure that foreign assistance operates according to these principles. He would do well to adopt it as a core development tool.
 Aid works best in countries whose governments are capable and committed. Before directing any American aid to a country, the corporation measures its performance on 17 indicators of democratic government, anti-corruption efforts, investments in health and education (particularly for girls) and economic freedom. Only those countries that perform strongly are allowed to compete for a five-year compact that makes them eligible to receive American aid for programs intended to reduce poverty and stimulate economic growth.
 By building its program around independent measures of policy performance, the corporation has been able to catalyze reform in poor countries -- sometimes before any aid money is spent. Burkina Faso, one of the poorest countries in the world, has committed to improving girls' primary education. And in Guatemala, which does not yet qualify for a compact, the president has made improvement on the indicators a national priority and appointed the vice president to lead the effort.
 Aid programs are sustainable only when they are designed and carried out by the country that needs them. The Millennium Challenge Corporation insists on playing a robust consulting role to ensure that any program the United States helps finance has a good rate of return and a clear effect on reducing poverty, and that the highest standards of accounting are followed. But it also requires that poor countries assume primary responsibility for their own development to ensure that our assistance truly helps the poor help themselves.
 The corporation's board includes key members of the president's cabinet -- the secretaries of state and Treasury, the United States trade representative and the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development -- along with a bipartisan group of four citizens appointed by the president on the advice of Congress. The cabinet members make sure the program operates according to the president's foreign policy, while the four private members see that it remains faithful to the principles that Congress laid down for it.
 The long-term engagement with the United States that is required for any country to earn a Millennium Challenge Corporation compact provides a platform for the kind of robust diplomacy that President-elect Obama has embraced. As he seeks to adapt American foreign assistance to a transformed world, one decisive step he can take is to signal his strong support of the corporation's approach to global development.

HEADLINE: Reality Can Be Escapist, Too

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
One of the best things about old movies is that they're, well, old. Among other pleasures, they offer a unique form of time travel, immersing us in bygone styles of dress and speech, quaint habits and notions. Hollywood classics in particular provide glimpses of a very different America by showing us the culture and physical environments our grandparents and parents lived in, and by acquainting us with some of their fantasies and dreams. 
 But lately, when I've sought escape from the daily flood of cultural novelty (and the daily grind of economic bad news) by slipping an old favorite into the DVD player, I've been confronted with a disconcerting jolt of reality. Those silvery images don't seem to belong to the past, but to the scary here and now. On my recent, more or less annual viewing of ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' I was stopped in my tracks by the run on the building-and-loan company of the hero, George Bailey, as the panicked citizens of Bedford Falls try to rescue their nest eggs. George tries to explain that the money isn't available because they've invested it in each other -- one fella's savings helped to finance another's business or secure a neighbor's house -- but the scene, though meant as a tableau of solidarity, seems more eloquent today as an account of moral hazard. In any case, the townspeople don't believe George, who is rescued when his fiancee empties their $2,000 honeymoon fund to provide an emergency bailout. 
 Or consider ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' which I'd come to think of it as a slightly corny artifact. Early on in the film, a flashback shows Muley Graves, an Oklahoma dirt farmer, being dispossessed by a well-fed gentleman with a fine car and a big cigar who disavows any personal responsibility. He's just doing the bidding of the land company, which is doing the bidding of the bank, and on the chain goes -- all the way up to the fat cats back East. That no one is to blame puzzles poor Muley. ''Well, who do we shoot?'' he asks. A similar question may be forming in the minds of more than a few Americans in 2008. 
 And then there is ''Sullivan's Travels,''Preston Sturges's impish tale of a Hollywood director who sets out to make a serious movie about real-life poverty and misery only to discover that real people, however poor or miserable they may be, want laughter and escapism. All three of these pictures, though they evoke the Great Depression and seem to belong to it, in fact were released after the worst of the economic crisis of the 1930s had passed.
 In the case of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' (1940) and ''Sullivan's Travels'' (1941), the next crisis, World War II, was already on the horizon for Americans. And by the time ''It's a Wonderful Life'' came along, in 1946, the war, too, was over. 
 The movies themselves are central to how we remember the Great Depression. The mythology of that era includes the idea that Americans all went to the movies because the movies gave them what they needed. On every Main Street the Bijou or the Biograph showed double features that helped ease the sting of desperation and want. Hard-pressed, ordinary folks gratefully lost themselves in satiny, soigne comedies whose very titles -- ''Trouble in Paradise,'' ''Easy Living'' -- hinted of a glamorous, alluring world. There were also tough, socially conscious pictures, a lot of them produced by Warner Brothers and quite a few starring James Cagney. ''The Public Enemy,''''Angels With Dirty Faces'' -- stories of crime, poverty and punishment delivered, especially once the Production Code came into force in 1934, with redemptive, morally affirming endings. 
 It was in the 1930s that the movies' hold on the popular imagination solidified and grew, and the marvelous monster known as the ''studio system'' took shape. It's easy to forget just how new the cinema still was back then, and how uncertain its fate. When the stock market crashed in October 1929, sound film was younger than YouTube is now. Far from being the golden age of movie going, the first years of the Depression were a time of near collapse for the industry. Attendance fell precipitously, from 90 million in 1930 to 60 million three years later.
 It was only in 1934, according to the film historian Thomas Schatz (in the ''Oxford History of World Cinema''), that things began to turn around -- thanks to increased production, new investment from Wall Street and, intriguingly, by the intervention of the federal government under the aegis of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration.
 Will Hollywood studio bosses be the next executives to come to Washington pleading for a bailout? If so, it will make an interesting movie. In the meantime there are more immediate questions: Will the movies themselves still be there for Americans, and will Americans need them in a time when other entertainments are cheaper, the double feature has gone the way of the Studebaker, and the movie audience shows signs of shrinking? However much has changed since the 1930s, it still seems that in hard times people go to the movies.
 But why? To confront their troubles or to escape them? This may be the wrong question and the either/or phrasing too simple. Audiences want to be lulled by romance or tickled by comedy, but they also have a hunger to see reality depicted. Above all there seems a universal appetite to see the rawness of the world given the shapely and soothing order conferred by familiar genres. 
 The truth is that every movie, really, is an escape into someone else's story. Clint Eastwood's new film, ''Gran Torino,'' which is named for an American car and depicts the frustrations of a retired auto worker (played by Mr. Eastwood), seems to offer a grim, half-accidental timeliness -- it opened on the day the Big Three bailout bill died in the Senate. But its rough, resonant emotions transcend the limitations of its immediate time and place. So, too, a harsh story of deprivation and anxiety like ''Wendy and Lucy'' -- about a young woman and her dog drifting toward Alaska in search of something better -- can lift us out of ourselves. 
 The movies remain a popular art, which means an art for the people. Unlike the atomized landscape of solitary iPods and lonely widescreen TV sets, the crowd in the movie theater is an image of community. This may be a legacy of the Great Depression, which we remember as a golden age of movies. Back then, everyone went to the movies because whatever else was going on, everyone was in it together.

HEADLINE: Utah Activist Disrupts Sale Of Leases For Drilling

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
An environmental activist disrupted an auction of oil and gas drilling leases Friday by bidding up parcels of land by hundreds of thousands of dollars with no intention of paying for them, a federal official said. 
 The process was thrown into chaos and the bidding halted for a time before the auction was closed, with 116 parcels totaling 148,598 acres having sold for $7.2 million plus fees.
 ''He's tainted the entire auction,'' said Kent Hoffman, deputy state director for the federal Bureau of Land Management in Utah.
 Mr. Hoffman said buyers had 10 days to reconsider and withdraw their bids if they thought they had paid too much.
 The activist, Tim DeChristopher, 27, a University of Utah economics student, said he had accomplished his goal of disrupting the auction. Mr. DeChristopher won the bidding on 13 parcels, auction records show, and drove up the price of several others.
 ''We were hosed,'' said Jason Blake of Park City, a consulting geologist who was outbid on a 320-acre parcel. ''It's very frustrating. I hope the guy is prosecuted.''
 Several bidders said they had not decided whether to withdraw their bids. Some said they might reluctantly hold on to their leases despite the cost out of concern that the parcels might not be offered again under President-elect Barack Obama's administration.
 Criminal investigators for the Bureau of Land Management questioned Mr. DeChristopher, who said he expected to be charged. He was released, and the case was referred to federal prosecutors for possible fraud charges, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office said. 
 ''I'm willing to deal with that,'' Mr. DeChristopher said.
 The sale of the leases has drawn criticism from environmental groups and Robert Redford, the actor, director and environmental activist.
 Activists said the sale would threaten Utah's wild lands and spoil the view from some of the state's spectacular national parks with drilling rigs.
 The bureau had already pulled some parcels from the sale in response to complaints from the National Park Service and others. Ultimately, the agency dropped more than half of the 359,000 acres first proposed for auction.

HEADLINE: Double-Parked? Might Be a Moment to Say Cheese

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BINDLEY

 BODY:
IT was probably nothing more than a casual slip of the squeegee at the car wash that peeled back a corner of the emissions inspection sticker on the windshield of Laurie Robinson's white Hyundai. But whatever happened, it resulted in a $125 ticket. ''Do you see the sticker?'' Ms. Robinson, a 48-year-old legal secretary from Pelham Bay in the northeast Bronx, said on Monday evening. She was standing near Crosby Avenue, just south of the 6 train stop on Buhre Avenue, a busy strip where traffic agents issued 2,165 tickets for nonmoving violations during the previous fiscal year, according to Bret Collazzi, a spokesman for Councilman James Vacca of the Bronx.
 ''They gave me a ticket because the registration thing was, like, off a little tiny bit,'' Ms. Robinson added, noting that her information was up to date and highly visible, but deemed ''illegible.'' Because Ms. Robinson didn't want to take time off from work to spend the day fighting the ticket in court, she paid up. 
 Complaints of heavy-handed traffic agents issuing questionable tickets have long been common in the northeast Bronx, according to Mr. Vacca. On Dec. 9, with frustration among his constituents rising in recent months, Mr. Vacca proposed a bill that would require the city's 2,500 traffic agents to provide photographs along with most tickets as proof of the violations. 
 ''We have to remember that giving out tickets in New York City has become a major revenue raiser,'' Mr. Vacca said, noting that last year, the city issued 10 million parking tickets. On Nov. 28, The New York Times reported that the city collected 64 percent more in fines in the 2008 fiscal year than it did in 2002. 
 ''I don't think it's asking too much for traffic agents to have a check on the accuracy of their tickets,'' Mr. Vacca said, adding that the pictures would also help clear up the backlog of people arguing legitimate tickets in court. ''If people know that a picture is taken and know they're wrong, they won't go fight a ticket.''
 Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman at the mayor's office, said no comments would be issued on bills awaiting Council hearings. But James Huntley, the president of Local 1182 of the Communications Workers of America, which represents the city's traffic agents, contended that the current system was working and that photographs were unnecessary. 
 ''We believe that we do a great job,'' Mr. Huntley said, noting that agents go through 10 weeks of training to learn to properly identify violations. ''We also take an oath saying that affidavits on the vehicles is true.''
 Mr. Huntley offered an alternative to Mr. Vacca's plan to deal with the parking woes. 
 ''He could have a town hall meeting with his constituents and teach them how to read the signs,'' Mr. Huntley said. ''That way, they can effectively park in the area that's not in violation.'' 
 As for the costs of the equipment, Councilman John Liu, the chairman of the Transportation Committee, which is reviewing the bill, said the expense was insignificant and the benefits worth the cost. But he acknowledged that especially in tough economic times, ''there will be undoubtedly some hemming and hawing on the part of the city administration.''

HEADLINE: The Year Of the Simpler Gadget

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
THE National Bureau of Economic Research hardly stunned the nation this month when it announced that the United States had been in recession since December 2007.
 And, as it turns out, the buyers of consumer electronics could very well have been a leading economic indicator. Over the last year, they chose to buy two inexpensive and simple products, the Wii and the Flip, over competing gadgets bristling with more features. 
 Nintendo has sold more than 30 million Wii game consoles since they were introduced two years ago. The machine is still luring shoppers: lines of buyers still form on Sunday mornings outside electronics stores. Best Buy put the Wii, not big-screen high-definition TVs, on the cover page of its Sunday circular last week, in its bid to get resistant holiday shoppers into the store. 
 The machine is dimwittedly simple. The console itself is hardly bigger than a DVD. It lacks the deep rich graphics, the rumbling sound and many of the violent games of the Microsoft Xbox 360. But at $250, it is outselling the more expensive Xbox 360 and the Sony PlayStation 3 combined by almost 2 to 1. 
 The $130 Flip camcorder is also simple, and two to three times cheaper than camcorders made by Sony or JVC that have optical zoom, an optical viewfinder and special effects. The original Flip didn't even have a headphone jack. Revenue at Pure Digital Technologies, its manufacturer, grew 44,667 percent, the highest rate of any company in Silicon Valley, over the last five years, according to Deloitte, the business services firm. Pure Digital Technologies says it has sold more than 1.5 million Flips since it unveiled the product line in 2007.
 This shift in consumer preference to the cheaper electronic device could well be a reaction to the recession. But it isn't the same as the consumer suddenly, and consciously, reaching for the house brand of creamed corn instead of the one with the Jolly Green Giant on the label. It is not just the economics of a shopping-fatigued nation at work here. Consumers found the simple devices, which don't need instruction manuals to set up and use, more appealing.
 That shift in consumer preference could be ominous. As the United States enters a deflationary period, all kinds of companies will have to grapple with the consequences of falling prices. This is nothing new for electronics makers. Every year, competition and the effects of Moore's Law forced prices down. 
 The one defense that seemed to work was to offer a new product at the same price as the old one -- but with more features. The laptops got better graphics, the hard drives spun faster, the cameras picked up more detail, the memory cards held more. 
 Feature-itis was a disease, but it was better than the affliction known as consumer boredom.
 Even the Flip is experiencing some feature creep. It has a popular model that shoots high-definition video. It's still the smallest HD camcorder, but it has U.S.B. port rechargers and power adapters, fast forward and rewind and four times as much memory as the original. Wii is still aimed at the market that Microsoft and Sony neglected: young children, older people and others who never played video games. But it is selling add-ons like the Wii Fit, a souped-up bathroom scale that allows a person to play skiing games, balance contests and musical play-alongs.
 Apple, innovator of business models as much as it is an innovator of electronic geegaws, may have found a solution to the problem of simple products becoming more complex. The Apple iPhone is one of the easiest-to-use devices ever created. At $300, plus a two-year contract that quickly pushes the real price to $1,800, it is hardly in the thrift class with the Wii and the Flip. But it is one of the most popular consumer electronics devices of 2008. Apple is expected to sell more than 14 million of them this year, and it is already the best-selling handset in the United States, according to the market researchers at the NPD Group. 
 AS much as it is part of the distinct trend toward the simple, the iPhone is also part of a trend to make a device versatile. It is a pretty thing, with a sleek touchscreen that does away with a keyboard. But it is also a hand-held game machine and a musical instrument that plays cowbells or imitates an ocarina. It's clearly an entertainment device, one that can identify the song playing in a movie or find friends on a map. 
 While it is not clear that mainstream electronics manufacturers have caught on, some scrappy start-ups have noticed its utility. One of them, Sonos, has turned the iPhone into a pretty nifty remote control for managing music on Sonos's whole-house entertainment system. (The application can be downloaded free from the Apple AppStore.) The iPhone taps into a home's wireless network to control the wireless entertainment system in multiple rooms. 
 John MacFarlane, the Sonos chief executive, says creation of the software that makes the iPhone a Sonos controller lifted the company's sales by 20 percent in November. ''In this economy,'' he noted.
 The company gave up some revenue -- a regular Sonos controller is about $300 -- but the new device exposed the entertainment system to a new audience and thus expanded the market. 
 Sonos isn't interested in anything other than music, but a versatile little device that you never let out of your reach could also manage burglar alarms and heating and cooling systems. ''I think that is the universal remote control of the future,'' Mr. MacFarland said. ''And that's the direction we are headed.'' 
 Right along with stingier consu- mers.

HEADLINE: Bleeding Heart Tightwads

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
This holiday season is a time to examine who's been naughty and who's been nice, but I'm unhappy with my findings. The problem is this: We liberals are personally stingy.
 Liberals show tremendous compassion in pushing for generous government spending to help the neediest people at home and abroad. Yet when it comes to individual contributions to charitable causes, liberals are cheapskates. 
 Arthur Brooks, the author of a book on donors to charity, ''Who Really Cares,'' cites data that households headed by conservatives give 30 percent more to charity than households headed by liberals. A study by Google found an even greater disproportion: average annual contributions reported by conservatives were almost double those of liberals. 
 Other research has reached similar conclusions. The ''generosity index'' from the Catalogue for Philanthropy typically finds that red states are the most likely to give to nonprofits, while Northeastern states are least likely to do so.
 The upshot is that Democrats, who speak passionately about the hungry and homeless, personally fork over less money to charity than Republicans -- the ones who try to cut health insurance for children. 
 ''When I started doing research on charity,'' Mr. Brooks wrote, ''I expected to find that political liberals -- who, I believed, genuinely cared more about others than conservatives did -- would turn out to be the most privately charitable people. So when my early findings led me to the opposite conclusion, I assumed I had made some sort of technical error. I re-ran analyses. I got new data. Nothing worked. In the end, I had no option but to change my views.''
 Something similar is true internationally. European countries seem to show more compassion than America in providing safety nets for the poor, and they give far more humanitarian foreign aid per capita than the United States does. But as individuals, Europeans are far less charitable than Americans.
 Americans give sums to charity equivalent to 1.67 percent of G.N.P., according to a terrific new book, ''Philanthrocapitalism,'' by Matthew Bishop and Michael Green. The British are second, with 0.73 percent, while the stingiest people on the list are the French, at 0.14 percent. 
 (Looking away from politics, there's evidence that one of the most generous groups in America is gays. Researchers believe that is because they are less likely to have rapacious heirs pushing to keep wealth in the family.)
 When liberals see the data on giving, they tend to protest that conservatives look good only because they shower dollars on churches -- that a fair amount of that money isn't helping the poor, but simply constructing lavish spires.
 It's true that religion is the essential reason conservatives give more, and religious liberals are as generous as religious conservatives. Among the stingiest of the stingy are secular conservatives. 
 According to Google's figures, if donations to all religious organizations are excluded, liberals give slightly more to charity than conservatives do. But Mr. Brooks says that if measuring by the percentage of income given, conservatives are more generous than liberals even to secular causes.
 In any case, if conservative donations often end up building extravagant churches, liberal donations frequently sustain art museums, symphonies, schools and universities that cater to the well-off. (It's great to support the arts and education, but they're not the same as charity for the needy. And some research suggests that donations to education actually increase inequality because they go mostly to elite institutions attended by the wealthy.)
 Conservatives also appear to be more generous than liberals in nonfinancial ways. People in red states are considerably more likely to volunteer for good causes, and conservatives give blood more often. If liberals and moderates gave blood as often as conservatives, Mr. Brooks said, the American blood supply would increase by 45 percent.
 So, you've guessed it! This column is a transparent attempt this holiday season to shame liberals into being more charitable. Since I often scold Republicans for being callous in their policies toward the needy, it seems only fair to reproach Democrats for being cheap in their private donations. What I want for Christmas is a healthy competition between left and right to see who actually does more for the neediest.
 Of course, given the economic pinch these days, charity isn't on the top of anyone's agenda. Yet the financial ability to contribute to charity, and the willingness to do so, are strikingly unrelated. Amazingly, the working poor, who have the least resources, somehow manage to be more generous as a percentage of income than the middle class.
 So, even in tough times, there are ways to help. Come on liberals, redeem yourselves, and put your wallets where your hearts are.

HEADLINE: China To The Rescue? Not!

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Hong Kong 

 BODY:
 I had no idea that many of those oil paintings that hang in hotel rooms and starter homes across America are actually produced by just one Chinese village, Dafen, north of Hong Kong. And I had no idea that Dafen's artist colony -- the world's leading center for mass-produced artwork and knockoffs of masterpieces -- had been devastated by the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble. I should have, though. 
 ''American property owners and hotels were usually the biggest consumers of Dafen's works,'' Zhou Xiaohong, deputy head of the Art Industry Association of Dafen, told Hong Kong's Sunday Morning Post. ''The more houses built in the United States, the more walls that needed our paintings. Now our business has frozen following the crash of the Western property market.'' 
 Dafen is just one of a million Chinese and American enterprises that constitute the most important economic engine in the world today -- what historian Niall Ferguson calls ''Chimerica,'' the de facto partnership between Chinese savers and producers and U.S. spenders and borrowers. That 30-year-old partnership is about to undergo a radical restructuring as a result of the current economic crisis, and the global economy will be highly impacted by the outcome.
 After all, it was China's willingness to hold the dollars and Treasury bills it had earned from exporting to America that helped keep U.S. interest rates low, giving Americans the money they needed to keep buying shoes, flat-screen TVs and paintings from China, as well as homes in America. Americans then borrowed against those homes to consume even more -- one reason we enjoyed rising wealth without rising incomes.
 This division of labor not only nourished our respective economies, but also shaped our politics. It enabled China's ruling Communist Party to say to its people: ''We will guarantee you ever-higher standards of living and in return you will stay out of politics and let us rule.'' So China's leaders could enjoy double-digit growth without political reform. And it enabled successive U.S. administrations, particularly the current one, to tell Americans: ''You can have guns and butter -- subprime mortgages with nothing down and nothing to pay for two years, ever-higher consumption and two wars, without tax increases!'' 
 It all worked -- until it didn't. 
 With unemployment now soaring across the U.S., said Stephen Roach, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, Americans -- ''the most over-extended consumer in world history'' -- can no longer buy so many Chinese exports. We need to save more, invest more, consume less and throw out most of our credit cards to bail ourselves out of this crisis.
 But as that happens, we need China to take our discarded credit cards and distribute them to its own people so they can buy more of what China produces and more imports from the rest of the world. That's the only way Beijing can sustain the minimum 8 percent growth it needs to maintain the political bargain between China's leaders and led -- not to mention pick up some of the slack in the global economy from America's slowdown.
 However, if I've learned one thing here, it's just how hard doing that will be. China's whole system and culture nourish saving, not spending, and changing that will require a huge ''cultural and structural'' shift, said Fred Hu, chairman for Greater China for Goldman Sachs.
 In China, for instance, to buy a home you have to put at least 20 percent down, and the average is 40 percent. If you try to walk away from the mortgage, the bank will come after your personal assets. Moreover, China can't just shift production from the U.S. market to its own consumers. Not many Chinese villagers want to buy $400 tennis shoes or Christmas tree ornaments.
 Also, China has no real Social Security, health insurance or unemployment insurance. Without that social safety net, it's hard to see how Chinese don't end up saving most of their stimulus. ''You open up the newspaper every day and you hear about this factory shutting down or that supplier going belly up,'' said Willie Fung, whose company, Top Form International, is the world's leading bra maker. ''You can never be too careful in this financial climate.''
 As such, ''the world should not have a false hope that China can cushion the global downturn,'' by stimulating its domestic demand in a big way, said Frank Gong, head of China research for JPMorgan Chase. ''The best thing China can do is keep its own economy stable.''
 It's good advice. China is not going to rescue us or the world economy. We're going to have to get out of this crisis the old-fashioned way: by digging inside ourselves and getting back to basics -- improving U.S. productivity, saving more, studying harder and inventing more stuff to export. The days of phony prosperity -- I borrow cheap money from China to build a house and then borrow on that house to buy cheap paintings from China to decorate my walls and everybody is a winner -- are over.

HEADLINE: Pop Couture

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN

 BODY:
Sometimes the Web is most satisfying when it confirms a cliche from the world offline. 
 I'm thinking of the captivating street-style photoblogs, which display snapshots of chic pedestrians in cities around the world. Such blogs exist for Tel Aviv, Stockholm, Moscow, Sydney, Seoul, Berlin, Dublin, London -- you name it. Survey them one morning over coffee, and you'll feel like a boulevardier of the whole world, breezing past one stunning creature after another, free to cruelly assess or dumbly gaze -- at supreme leisure and invulnerable to reciprocal scrutiny. 
 What can be learned from a global anthology of fantastic-looking people? First off, you might find that looking at people on city streets is almost a perfect allegory of Web-browsing. Tellingly, the major Chinese search engine, Baidu, takes its name from an ancient poem about the search for (what the portal's FAQ calls) ''a retreating beauty amid chaotic glamour.'' Anyone encountering the bedlam of the Web seeks a resting place, even -- at times -- a literal or figurative embrace. The suspense of that exploration is mirrored in the story you find on the street-style blogs: the search for a quiet connection with beauty in a metropolis of strangers. 
 But what specifically do the photoblogs teach about fashion? The novelty of Aladdin pants, the sweetness of dove gray, bits and pieces of style -- gestalts, vibes -- the same vague revelations you might discover while walking in the Harajuku neighborhood in Tokyo or the French Quarter in New Orleans. Dozens of street-style blogs for Muslim women show inventive ways to wear a hijab and eye makeup. Some stylish people on the blogs look chipper and resourceful (Tokyo); some look pampered (Cape Town). Others appear proud (Stockholm), playful (Austin), radiant (Copenhagen), easygoing (Nairobi), celebratory (Buenos Aires), ferocious (London). The street-style blogs palpably lift the mood: human beings in their natural habitats and chosen adornments seem suddenly ingenious, unpredictable and above all beautiful. 
 That feeling mounts at the best sites -- Face Hunter, Style-Arena, Stockholm Street Style -- and peaks with a glance at The Sartorialist, the bellwether American site that turned this kind of cruising-photoblogging into an art form. Fathered by Scott Schuman, a onetime employee of the men's clothing enterprise Chess King who (though he detoured through a career in high fashion) never lost his eye for the sharp-dressed Everyman, The Sartorialist features not just handsome people but also handsome photographs. The site's generous, near-gilded portraits are especially pleasing when contrasted with stock rage-filled fashion spreads in glossy magazines. Schuman's images have no edge; they're all creamy center. 
 On an average day at The Sartorialist you might catch two students, she with a pink bow at her neck and he in a shrunken flannel shirt, loitering not far from a humorous-looking bearded man in a military-band jacket, who himself preens not far from a row of sophisticated winter women in dark stockings, heels, furs and vividly colored August-weight dresses. 
 Indeed, the street-style blogs of the world are so trippingly delightful and spontaneous that, while you forget your cares in your moneyless world tour, you may also forget all societal gravity and natural laws and snob hierarchies -- until. Hold up. At Garance Dore, a French blog named after its proprietress, you hit a hard truth, the immovable cliche of style: Paris. The Web came, the European Union, Tokyo style, war, Sarkozy, the crash of global markets. And still everyone dresses better in Paris.
 At least, I mean, they look sublime at the house of Garance Dore. Raised by a high-stepping mother who wore Mugler and Alaia, Dore is a fashion illustrator who in 2006 became ''a little frustrated with the commissions I had, and in particular by the lack of contact with the readers'' (as her freshly translated bio puts it). She closed the audience gap with a blog -- as so many do; at first, it showed sketches and captions and now features photos of people she encounters. You know, just people, regular people, like an ethereal redheaded It Girl outside a Karl Lagerfeld show, or the sultry French model Valentine Fillol Cordier at the Palais Royal.
 A friend of mine won't look at Garance Dore because he says it fills him with longing he can't bear. I feel nearly the same way, though I don't stay away; I'm pleasurably overwhelmed. Somehow Garance Dore gives viewers the sense that they are in the urban splendor too, or could be, or should be -- strolling or sauntering, rather than linking and clicking. And at this moment in cultural history, when the allure of Europe and Paris and the sumptuous, leisurely life is assumed to have faded, we're not on guard against it. Garance Dore should come with a caution.
 With their scarves and coats in muted colors, steady gazes and rosebud mouths, the figures who pause at Garance Dore seem somehow sainted. Unlike Schuman, Dore publishes photos of faces alone (often set above full-body shots), so her focus is less on silhouette and proportion and more on expression and complexion. While Schuman's camera is curious, Dore's is smitten. Her figures glow under her attention. They're nearly aflame. 
 As a rule, the street-style blogs don't take many ads. They're not advertorial, either. I haven't seen any that systematically caption their photos with information about brands, labels, prices. And if you think you might try to replicate one of the looks, you're thrown back on your wits and your own wardrobe: the sites don't suggest places to shop. A proposed ''shopping guide'' that was forever ''premiering soon'' on The Sartorialist seems to be stalled. 
 On the other hand, in this time of a downturn in traditional media that's said to be both ''cyclical and secular'' -- meaning that there's a recession on and that the businesses are fundamentally changing and moving online -- the street-style blogs suggest a new way of displaying fashion and, down the road, monetizing fashion reporting. Vogue's Style File blog at Style.com, which features celebrities and breaking fashion news, rarely draws a single comment. By contrast, a Garance Dore post of an unnamed woman in houndstooth and stripes drew 78 comments, in French and English. Sartorialist posts regularly draw more than a hundred. People return to these sites, and stay a long time. In the fashion frame of mind, some viewers would no doubt click on ads for e-tailers that might sell them clothes, jewelry, accessories and cosmetics. 
 It's also worth noting that if it's the styles of New York and Paris that play the best online, nothing in the taste of the times should be all that confounding to people who know the rules of traditional fashion. Although of course even the great Garance Dore -- who seems to me to be the guardian of all style -- can get confused. Recently, Dore reported that she came across a stunning young woman with ''uneallure incroyable'' in black eyeliner and a vintage blue puffer coat. Dore speculated that she might be from an exotic land, perhaps where grog is drunk. (At times, the French fashion world seems to be intoxicated by Scandinavian beauty and style.) 
 Though Dore addressed her in English, the alluring woman was entirely French, called Marianne (''Comme la Republique Francaise,'' the woman added helpfully). It turned out that she was Dore's neighbor in Paris. A stylish Parisienne? Quelle surprise.

 Points of Entry
 THIS WEEK'S RECOMMENDATIONS
 THE STREET: Seeking men and women fully dressed? The joyful street-style blogs are for the traveler who likes the sit-in-a-cafe-and-observe part and can be brought around -- in the recession, anyhow -- to the from-the-comfort-of-your-home part. My favorites are the pristine ones that don't have muddy, trashy party pictures that really belong on MySpace. I like a point of view, lucid pictures, some analysis and lots of air in the design. That means: Face Hunter (London and beyond), The Sartorialist (New York and beyond), Garance Dore (Paris), Copenhagen Street Style, Stockholm Street Style, Altamira NYC, Stil in Berlin, The Style Scout (London), Style-Arena (Tokyo by neighborhood; see especially Harajuku, which first defined street style), The Streetswalker (Tel Aviv), Toronto Street Fashion, Styleclicker (Munich), On the Corner (Buenos Aires), Austin Style Watch, 2 Threads (Australia), The MidWasteland (Chicago), Miss at the Playa (miscellaneous), Hel-Looks (Helsinki), Look at Me (Moscow), Shanghai Viva, Glam Canyon (London), ReykjavikLooks.

HEADLINE: A New Career That's Warm And Fuzzy

BYLINE: By CHIARA SFORZA. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen. E-mail: preoccupations@nytimes.com

 BODY:
UNTIL last year, I was an assistant vice president in the global cost analysis and support department at Deutsche Bank. I had worked there for eight years. We tracked expenses for the company's global technology projects, reconciled the balance sheet and produced various management reports. I was let go in July 2007, three months after my department moved to Jersey City from New York. Now I'm a dog walker and pet sitter for Fetch Pet Care of New Jersey Gold Coast in Fort Lee.
 It was actually a relief when I was finally laid off. The company had notified us in March 2007 that the department was going to be outsourced to Manila, and I couldn't stand the stress of waiting. I've been downsized several times over the years, but I always landed on my feet. Of course, I was in my 30s and 40s then. Now I'm in my 50s, and it makes a difference. 
 When I applied for other jobs I was overqualified for the available positions. I was willing to take a pay cut and a lesser title, but no one would give me an opportunity. I had been an accounts-payable supervisor years ago, so I even applied for those positions. Employers were afraid that I would become bored. Deutsche Bank also provided us with the services of an outplacement agency, so I redesigned my resume with its help. I still had no luck. I was even willing to work as a consultant with no benefits.
 After my unemployment ran out, I had to do something; I'm self-supporting. Pet-sitting and dog-walking give me an opportunity to do something different. I'm tired of going to work every day in jobs where I have to worry if my position is going to be outsourced, and the new job is actually working out well. I knew I would have to give up some luxuries to take a job like this, and I was willing to do that. 
 I met Deborah Jack, who started this Fetch Pet Care franchise, when I needed someone to take care of my cats while I went on a trip. I found the company on the Internet. Deborah was just starting out, and she took care of my cats herself. She did great work. When I couldn't find a job, I e-mailed her about becoming an employee, and she was receptive. I told her that this had to be a full-time job for me, and she said she could keep me busy. 
 I've been doing this for six months. I'm assigned to seven dogs, which I walk individually. I also pet-sit cats. On the days I work, the company generates a schedule for me. Occasionally, a client will work late and ask me to walk a dog an extra time.
 I meet the owners when I start, and we discuss everything I need to know. If clients go on vacation, they may call and ask for status reports. Sometimes I take a photo of their pet and text it to them. If I run into a dog that is hard to handle, Frank Richardone, Deborah's business partner, will take over or assign it to another pet-sitter.
 I do miss socializing at the bank. I had a lot of friends there, but most of them have been laid off, too. I'm a people person, so I enjoy the interaction with the pet owners. If someone has a puppy and is a first-time pet owner, I try to reassure them. For example, when puppies are being crate-trained, they often cry when the owner walks into the room. I tell the owners that this is normal and that the puppy usually stops when they leave.
 I don't know what I'm going to do about the future. I don't make anywhere near my corporate salary, but this job is perfect for now. I have a little flexibility because I have savings. Being happy while making some money is more important to me right now than making a lot of money and being miserable. At this stage in my life I'm willing to make the sacrifice.
 I've always wanted to do something with pets. In the beginning I had a few doubts about dog-walking because it's so totally different and I didn't know if it would work out. But as the weeks went by, and I built a rapport with the dogs and built a clientele, I realized how happy I was. And it's physically challenging and keeps me in shape.
 If someone were to say I took a lower-level job, I'd say I wanted to. I was burned out and needed a break. This job is fulfilling different needs. When you work in the corporate world, it's not always gratifying when you meet the challenges set in front of you. That's the job; it goes with the territory. But I get so much gratification from walking dogs. They're so appreciative of the simplest things you do for them. No matter how bad my day may be going, when I walk into a home and the dog is so happy to see me and gives me kisses, it puts a different spin on the day.

HEADLINE: Greetings, From Hardy Stock

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY. 
Guy Trebay is a reporter for the Styles section of The New York Times.

 BODY:
CHRISTMAS is a ghost-haunted season. Dickens formalized this truth, of course, but anyone who sends holiday cards is familiar with the insight. Who are all these people in one's address book? Where are they? More troublingly, perhaps, do they still exist? 
 To consult a Christmas card list is to venture into memories best left undisturbed. And so each autumn I resolve to forgo this annual ritual and to concede the dull truth that e-communication and the horror show of constant connectivity have rendered such archaic niceties as the handwritten card pointless and quaint. 
 But then I lapse. 
 To be honest, I dislike writing by hand -- the difficulty of finding the right surface, the wrist cramps that follow efforts to govern my unruly penmanship, the bird-track runes that result. And yet I am a confirmed stationery freak and particularly love sending Christmas cards, and here is why. One is not required to say much (in fact, the less you write the greater the chance the hen scratch will be legible). Unlike most mail that drops into a box these days, people are generally happy to open a Christmas card. And, no matter whether you are composing your cards -- on a venerable mahogany desk or, more likely, at a cheap kitchen table -- a lot of senses are engaged when writing on nice paper by hand. 
 Not the least of these are sight and touch and smell. And while it may be impious and weird of me to liken the faintly starchy aroma of a good paper card to that of a communion wafer, that is the association that leaps to this nonbeliever's mind.
 Anyhow, Christmas cards are a convenience, as the Englishman Henry Cole understood when he first devised this form of standardized holiday greeting in the 19th century.
 It was 1843 when Cole had an artist whip up something he could send to all his friends, thereby cutting down on the need for individual letters at the end of the year. (No Fun Walls in those days, or printouts of the family bulletin filled with tantalizing news about cheerleading camp, Fluffy the poodle or Junior's triumph on the SATs.) Even in Victorian London, it cannot have been cheap to buy heavy card stock, hire an engraver and send out what amounted to a mass mailing. It is certainly no bargain in the Manhattan of today. 
 That I have no intention of relinquishing this seasonal extravagance, even in Times Like These, has something to do with both guilt and the aforementioned pleasures. If it is true that a good engraved card in a lined envelope can cost about as much as a 20-minute foot massage in Chinatown, that is partly because the laborers that produce all those gorgeous letterpress cards on the market seem to be Wall Street refugees with Wharton M.B.A.'s.
 Multiply one such card by the number of names on one's list, then add postage, and you will soon find yourself questioning whether the federal government should add a snail mail bailout to its festival of holiday handouts and economic triage.
 It may be worth mentioning here that the cost of sending holiday cards is not just of concern to those of us clinging to the middle rungs of the income ladder. Or so I concluded on a visit to the annual holiday fair at Brick Church on the Upper East Side. I had gone there to visit the engravers Bill and Mary Miller of the Printery in Oyster Bay, N.Y., whose cards are favorites of stationery fiends because they are neither schoolgirl twee nor so pompous as to resemble a summons to a papal installation. 
 We have all seen the cards I mean. Some of us have sent or received them. If I now question the holiday cards I once bought from the stationer Mrs. John L. Strong that depicted a jaunty biplane engraved in gold and trailing a sky-written message of Merry Christmas in silver smoke, it is with a thought for my now-pathetic 401(k) and not because they were aesthetically overblown.
 CHRISTMAS, let's face it, is not really the time for restraint or quiet taste. This reality even some of the folks on line at Brick Church seemed to understand. A well-known socialite confided to me that day that while her checkbook might be on lockdown, and her annual holiday party and skiing vacation to Gstaad mothballed, economizing on Christmas cards is a cost-saving measure that never entered her mind.
 Now more than ever, as Mr. Miller explained it, the card as a form of friendly greeting has taken on extra meaning as a gesture of bravado. With little prospect of raises or bonuses, of Christmas turkeys from the boss or, in many cases, even a job, it remains an important matter of pride, as Mr. Miller explained, ''to let friends know that everything is still cool, everything is O.K.'' 
 And so the Printery has booked 3,000 orders this year, among them mine. And, while I did not spring for anything as opulent as the gilded Bernard Maisner cards sold at Bergdorf Goodman, which can run to $25 apiece and are roughly the size of a movie poster, I confirmed my status as a Manhattan spendthrift by buying cards that each cost almost as much as a six pack of Budweiser and that bear scant resemblance to the 2.1 billion others likely to cram American mailboxes this year. 
 It is not that I am too snobbish to send something from among the 2,700 holiday designs offered by Hallmark. I considered, for instance, impersonating John Waters by sending out Hallmark's Candy Greetings, which come with a chunk of something inside termed reindeer corn. 
 Instead I settled on a classic Christmas tree from the Printery as my way of staying connected with what Mr. Miller calls the ''great chain of being'' -- or, anyway, of alerting friends from around the corner and also those who are far-flung and long-lost, that this particular spirit is still hanging around.

 BODY:
RETURN TO DRAGON MOUNTAIN: Memories of a Late Ming Man, by Jonathan D. Spence. (Penguin, $16.) The comfortable life of the Chinese essayist and historian Zhang Dai was interrupted in 1644 by the Manchu invasion, which toppled the Ming dynasty his family had served for generations. In exile and then back home in Dragon Mountain, Zhang puzzled out the reasons for the dynasty's fall. He became an ''excavator,'' someone who ''tried to get into the deep and dark places'' of memory, Spence says, examining his own as well as his country's past. In the Book Review, Christopher Benfey said that Spence, a professor of history at Yale, is an excavator himself, opening up ''a magic-lantern realm lost until now and movingly retrieved.'' 
 WAR AND PEACE, by Leo Tolstoy. Translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. (Vintage Classics, $19.95.) ''We have tried to be true to Tolstoy's rhetorical power, his sharp irony and his astonishing delicacy,'' Richard Pevear writes in the introduction to this new translation of Tolstoy's masterpiece, which has been praised by many critics. The lively discussion it inspired in the Book Review's online Reading Room last year is available at readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/war-and-peace/. 
 NUREYEV: The Life, by Julie Kavanagh. (Vintage, $19.95.) With his ''powerful body'' and ''dark soul,'' Rudolf Nureyev ''led the way'' for the classical male dancers of his era and ''brought sex to ballet like no one had before,'' Toni Bentley wrote in the Book Review. 
 THE APPEAL, by John Grisham. (Delta, $14.) When a small Mississippi law firm wins a big verdict against a chemical company that dumped carcinogens, the corporate defendant fights to win on appeal -- by securing the election of a friendly judge to the State Supreme Court. With the help of shadowy political consultants, the middle-of the-road incumbent is portrayed as a left-wing slut and defeated by the chosen candidate, a gun-friendly family man who throws out the case. Our reviewer, Steven Brill, praised this ''gripping tale.'' 
 BEARS: A Brief History, by Bernd Brunner. Translated by Lori Lantz. (Yale University, $15.) As the only animal known to Westerners that walked upright, bears have long occupied a special place in the animal kingdom. Brunner's book is full of information about the relationship between bears and humans, and is delightfully illustrated with period engravings. Writing in The Times, William Grimes called it a ''little gem.'' 
 MOUTH WIDE OPEN: A Cook and His Appetite, by John Thorne with Matt Lewis Thorne. (North Point, $16.) Thorne is an essayist and thinker more than a generator of recipes, although this book, written with his wife, has plenty of them. What it also has is Thorne's ability to convey ''how much fun . . . kitchen work can be,'' feeling ''the suspense build, until that delicious moment when it suddenly all comes together, and there you are.'' 
 PROVENCE A-Z, by Peter Mayle. (Vintage Departures, $14.95.) They may have begun as outtakes from Mayle's other Provence books, but this dictionary's brief entries, from ''aioli'' to ''zingue-zingue-zoun'' (a Provencal word to describe the sound of a violin) are full of amusing facts and useful information. In 30 DAYS IN SYDNEY: A Wildly Distorted Account (Bloomsbury, $13), Peter Carey, the Australian novelist, evokes the city where he once lived through his conversations with old friends. 
 GOMORRAH: A Personal Journey Into the Violent International Empire of Naples' Organized Crime System, by Roberto Saviano. Translated by Virginia Jewiss. (Picador, $15.) Since the Italian publication of this account of the Camorra, the Neapolitan crime organization, Saviano, a young journalist, has lived under police protection. Today's cammoristi have gone global, selling toxic waste and laundering money while politicians look the other way. ''Part economic analysis, part social history, part cri de coeur,'' this is ''the most important book to come out of Italy in years,'' Rachel Donadio wrote in the Book Review. 
 LOVE AND SEX WITH ROBOTS: The Evolution of Human-Robot Relationships, by David Levy. (Harper Perennial, $14.95.) By the middle of this century, Levy, an expert on artificial intelligence, predicts, ''love with robots will be as normal as love with other humans.'' He builds his case gradually, beginning with what scientists know about why humans fall in love with other humans (''reciprocal liking'' can be programmed into a robot's behavior) and looking at the developing technologies (flexible polymers that can be used as artificial skin) that might make you want to cuddle with one. He's serious. 
 AN INCOMPLETE REVENGE, by Jacqueline Winspear. (Picador, $14.) Maisie Dobbs, the private investigator/psychologist heroine of Winspear's four thoughtful and moving period mysteries, is asked to look into arson and vandalism in a village in Kent in 1931. To win the trust of a Romany band that has set up camp outside the village, she must acknowledge her own heretofore ignored Gypsy blood.

HEADLINE: Who Wants to Kick a Millionaire?

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
DURING the Great Depression, American moviegoers seeking escape could ogle platoons of glamorous chorus girls in ''Gold Diggers of 1933.'' Our feel-good movie of the year is ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' a Dickensian tale in which we root for an impoverished orphan from Mumbai's slums to hit the jackpot on the Indian edition of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' 
 It's a virtuoso feast of filmmaking by Danny Boyle, but it's also the perfect fairy tale for our hard times. The hero labors as a serf in the toilet of globalization: one of those mammoth call centers Westerners reach when ringing an 800 number to, say, check on credit card debt. When he gets his unlikely crack at instant wealth, the whole system is stacked against him, including the corrupt back office of a slick game show too good to be true. 
 We cheer the young man on screen even if we've lost the hope to root for ourselves. The vicarious victory of a third world protagonist must be this year's stocking stuffer. The trouble with ''Slumdog Millionaire'' is that it, like all classic movie fables, comes to an end -- as it happens, with an elaborately choreographed Bollywood musical number redolent of ''Gold Diggers of 1933.'' Then we are delivered back to the inescapable and chilling reality outside the theater's doors.
 Just when we thought that reality couldn't hit a new bottom it did with Bernie Madoff, a smiling shark as sleazy as the TV host in ''Slumdog.'' A pillar of both the Wall Street and Jewish communities -- a former Nasdaq chairman, a trustee at Yeshiva University -- he even victimized Elie Wiesel's Foundation for Humanity with his Ponzi scheme. A Jewish financier rips off millions of dollars devoted to memorializing the Holocaust -- who could make this stuff up? Dickens, Balzac, Trollope and, for that matter, even Mel Brooks might be appalled.
 Madoff, of course, made up everything. When he turned himself in, he reportedly declared that his business was ''all just one big lie.'' (The man didn't call his 55-foot yacht ''Bull'' for nothing.) As Brian Williams of NBC News pointed out, the $50 billion thought to have vanished is roughly three times as much as the proposed Detroit bailout. And no one knows how it happened, least of all the federal regulators charged with policing him and protecting the public. If Madoff hadn't confessed -- for reasons that remain unclear -- he might still be rounding up new victims.
 There is a moral to be drawn here, and it's not simply that human nature is unchanging and that there always will be crooks, including those in high places. Nor is it merely that Wall Street regulation has been a joke. Of what we've learned about Madoff so far, the most useful lesson can be gleaned from how his smart, well-heeled clients routinely characterized the strategy that generated their remarkably steady profits. As The Wall Street Journal noted, they ''often referred to it as a 'black box.' '' 
 In the investment world ''black box'' is tossed around to refer to a supposedly ingenious financial model that is confidential or incomprehensible or both. Most of us know the ''black box'' instead as that strongbox full of data that is retrieved (sometimes) after a plane crash to tell the authorities what went wrong. The only problem is that its findings arrive too late to save the crash's victims. The hope is that the information will instead help prevent the next disaster.
 The question in the aftermath of the Madoff calamity is this: Why do we keep ignoring what we learn from the black boxes being retrieved from crash after crash in our economic meltdown? The lesson could not be more elemental. If there's a mysterious financial model producing miraculous returns, odds are it's a sham -- whether it's an outright fraud, as it apparently is in Madoff's case, or nominally legal, as is the case with the Wall Street giants that have fallen this year. 
 Wall Street's black boxes contained derivatives created out of whole cloth, deriving their value from often worthless subprime mortgages. The enormity of the gamble went undetected not only by investors but by the big brains at the top of the firms, many of whom either escaped (Merrill Lynch's E. Stanley O'Neal) or remain in place (Citigroup's Robert Rubin) after receiving obscene compensation for their illusory short-term profits and long-term ignorance. 
 There has been no punishment for many of those who failed to heed this repeated lesson. Quite the contrary. The business magazine Portfolio, writing in mid-September about one of the world's biggest insurance companies, observed that ''now that A.I.G is battling to survive, it is its black box that may save it yet.'' That box -- stuffed with ''accounting or investments so complex and arcane that they remain unknown to most investors'' -- was so huge that Washington might deem it ''too big to fail.''
 Sure enough -- and unlike its immediate predecessor in collapse, Lehman Brothers -- A.I.G. was soon bailed out to the tune of $123 billion. Most of that also disappeared by the end of October. But not before A.I.G. executives were caught spending $442,000 on a weeklong retreat to a California beach resort.
 There are more black boxes still to be pried open, whether at private outfits like Madoff's or at publicly traded companies like General Electric, parent of the opaque GE Capital Corporation, the financial services unit that has been the single biggest contributor to the G.E. bottom line in recent years. But have we yet learned anything? Incredibly enough, as we careen into 2009, the very government operation tasked with repairing the damage caused by Wall Street's black boxes is itself a black box of secrecy and impenetrability.
 Last week ABC News asked 16 of the banks that have received handouts from the Treasury Department's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program the same two direct questions: How have you used that money, and how much have you spent on bonuses this year? Most refused to answer. 
 Congress can't get the answers either. Its oversight panel declared in a first report this month that the Treasury is doling out billions ''without seeking to monitor the use of funds provided to specific financial institutions.'' The Treasury prefers instead to look at ''general metrics'' indicating the program's overall effect on the economy. Well, we know what the ''general metrics'' tell us already: the effect so far is nil. Perhaps if we were let in on the specifics, we'd start to understand why.
 In its own independent attempt to penetrate the bailout, the Government Accountability Office learned that ''the standard agreement between Treasury and the participating institutions does not require that these institutions track or report how they plan to use, or do use, their capital investments.'' Executives at all but two of the bailed-out banks told the G.A.O. that the ''money is fungible,'' so they ''did not intend to track or report'' specifically what happens to the taxpayers' cash. 
 Nor is there any serious accounting for executive pay at these seminationalized companies. As Amit Paley of The Washington Post reported, a last-minute, one-sentence loophole added by the Bush administration to the original bailout bill gutted the already minimal restrictions on executive compensation. And so when Goldman Sachs, Henry Paulson's Wall Street alma mater, says that it is not using public money to pay executives, we must take it on faith. 
 In the wake of the Madoff debacle, there are loud calls to reform the Securities and Exchange Commission, including from the president-elect. Under both Clinton and Bush, that supposed watchdog agency ignored repeated and graphic warnings of Madoff's Ponzi scheme as studiously as Bush ignored Al Qaeda's threats during the summer of 2001. 
 But fixing that one agency is no panacea. All the talk about restoring ''confidence'' and ''faith'' in capitalism will be worthless if we still can't see what's going on in the counting rooms. In his role as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Timothy Geithner, Barack Obama's nominee for Treasury secretary, has been at the center of the action in the bailout's black box, including the still-murky and conflicting actions (and nonactions) taken with Lehman and A.I.G. His confirmation hearings demand questions every bit as tough as those that were lobbed at the executives from Detroit's Big Three. 
 On Friday, Geithner's partner in bailout management, Paulson, asked Congress to give the Treasury the second half of the $700 billion bailout stash. But without transparency and accountability in Washington's black box, as well as Wall Street's, there will continue to be no trust in the system, no matter how many cops the S.E.C. puts on the beat. Even the family-owned real-estate company of Eliot Spitzer, the former ''Sheriff of Wall Street,'' had entrusted money with Madoff. 
 We'll keep believing, not without reason, that the whole game is as corrupt as the game show in ''Slumdog Millionaire'' -- only without the Hollywood/Bollywood ending. We'll keep wondering how so many at the top keep avoiding responsibility and reaping taxpayers' billions while relief for those at the bottom remains as elusive as straight answers from those Mumbai call centers fielding American debtors. 
 This wholesale loss of confidence is a catastrophe that not even the new president's most costly New Deal can set right.

HEADLINE: Benefits Fund Solvency Worries Labor Officials

BYLINE: By DERRICK HENRY

 BODY:
THE sour economy and rising joblessness have New Jersey labor officials worried about depleting the state's unemployment fund.
 In the first week of December, there were 18,386 initial claims for unemployment benefits in the state. That was 43.6 percent higher than the 12,800 initial claims filed the same time in 2007. 
 New Jersey's unemployment rate climbed to 6.1 percent last week, the highest since August 1996. Nationwide, the unemployment rate is 6.7 percent, a 15-year high. With the economy in a recession, officials fear that the number of unemployed will continue to climb. 
 New Jersey's unemployment fund has been paying about $40 million in benefits each week, said David J. Socolow, the state's labor commissioner. The fund currently has a balance of $711 million, down from $3.1 billion at the end of the 2001 fiscal year.
 ''It's certainly lower than we want it to be,'' Mr. Socolow said. ''We're hit with another downturn and we have a depleting fund.''
 While the unemployment fund would still pay valid unemployment claims no matter what happens, as required by law, there are concerns that it is edging toward insolvency.
 A report in October from the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers and the jobless, listed New Jersey among eight states whose unemployment funds are nearly insolvent. In the report, New Jersey's unemployment trust fund balance was estimated at about $792.9 million, with a monthly benefit payout of $177 million. That is enough for four months of payments if no additional revenue is collected from payroll taxes.
 Rick McHugh, a staff lawyer who helped write the report, said that although New Jersey's fund is among those considered in trouble, it likely will not have to borrow money from the federal government if the recession does not deepen.
 By the end of the 2002 fiscal year, an economic downturn reduced the fund to $2.3 billion, from 3.1 billion the year before. The balance has dropped each year and stood at $650 million at the end of the 2007 fiscal year. 
 The fund's balance suffered as revenue was diverted to pay for the state's hospital charity care from 1991 to 2005. That diversion amounted to $4.7 billion, Mr. Socolow said. 
 ''Our opinion is if you never took the money in the first place, we wouldn't be here right now,'' said John D. Rogers, the vice president of human resource issues for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. In a 2006 report, the association's research affiliate warned that the diversions might undercut the fund's health if another economic downturn hit.
 In the 2008 fiscal year that ended June 30, businesses paid about $1.5 billion into the unemployment fund, the state labor department said. In New Jersey, workers also pay a payroll tax into the unemployment fund. Their share came to about $500 million.
 ''Our concern is what would happen to employers if the fund is depleted,'' Mr. Socolow said. If the unemployment fund's balance goes too low, then an automatic tax increase on businesses would keep benefits flowing.
 To avoid that, five months ago, Gov. Jon S. Corzine and state lawmakers authorized an infusion of $260 million into the unemployment fund. That money came from a budget surplus the previous fiscal year, Mr. Socolow said. But as the economy becomes leaner and meaner, there is less money to move around in the state budget.
 Third-quarter data from the federal Labor Department's Division of Fiscal and Actuarial Services show that New Jersey ranks 49th out of 53 -- the figures include Washington, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands -- among unemployment trust funds in terms of a ratio that measures fiscal health, with 53 being the lowest. The state's average weekly benefit payout, however, is $366.34, which ranks third-highest among programs.
 Mr. McHugh said strong benefits should be the goal of any unemployment program, especially in New Jersey, where workers pay for part of the program.
 ''To have people who have been laid off to totally stop spending money,'' he said, ''to not be able to support their families, is bad for the economy.''

HEADLINE: In 7 Fish (More or Less), A Holiday Tradition

BYLINE: By MARIA LAURINO. 
Maria Laurino's new memoir, ''Old World Daughter, New World Mother: An Education in Love and Freedom,'' will be published in April.

 BODY:
TODAY, as households are becoming more ethnically and religiously diverse, partaking in holiday traditions can fulfill a need for a collective gathering as well as a religious ritual. During these tough economic times, as families cut corners and scale back on gift giving, holiday meals provide both a communal thanks and a connection to ancestral pasts. Jewish Americans fry Hanukkah latkes; Japanese-Americans bite into mochi, the chewy rice cakes that usher in hopes for a prosperous New Year; and African-Americans renew vows to family and community while eating Kwanzaa dishes like rice, black-eyed peas and fruit kebabs.
 For Italian-Americans, it is re-creating the feast of the seven fishes and sharing it with family and friends, a multiday enterprise that forces us to take time off from our normal routines and reflect upon the start of the winter solstice. Old World tradition sits snugly in my Italian-American family, like a plant in its pot, the tightly contained roots feeding on the soil (and toil) of generations. 
 A few weeks before Christmas some years back, my Aunt Natalie broke her hip. Despite her advanced age (she will turn 89 this month) and her discomfort, she was determined to continue the family tradition of an all-fish dinner on Christmas Eve.
 Needing to use a walker, my aunt had trouble moving around the kitchen, reaching into cabinets and pulling out drawers. Yet she remained undaunted. She used some string to attach the necessary utensils to each side of her walker, enabling her to saute eel on one burner and stir the Italian staple of salted cod, or baccala, in tomato sauce on another.
 This week, my 87-year-old mother plans to clean squid, fry small silvery smelts, and stuff sweet pickled peppers with pine nuts, raisins and anchovies for the Christmas Eve dinner.
 Italian-Americans of all generations reach back to their heritage, and their cookbooks, as guides to preparing the feast of the seven fishes. The significance of seven types of fish has yielded numerous theories, including a correspondence to the number of sacraments in the church, the seven days of creation, the seven virtues of Christian theology, and a reminder of the seven deadly sins. Families have their own interpretations, perhaps based on the region from which their ancestors came; and the number of dishes prepared can vary widely -- from 3, representing the number of wise men, to 13, signifying Jesus and the apostles.
 My family never ate the traditional seven -- my mother mainly cooked baccala, squid, smelts and sometimes scungilli or conch. I doubt there was any particular significance to the number we chose; it probably said more about the limits of my mom's stamina and the family aversion to eel and shellfish. 
 This season, with the economy foremost on everyone's mind, those who have continually lamented the commercialization of the holidays may for once find their gripes heard. Elaborate gift giving feels as out of sync as Santa sunning in Capri. 
 A traditional meal that unwraps course by course may not satisfy the children's need for piles of boxes and ribbons, but it can help satiate the deeper longings of adults. And today's children -- unlike the girl I once was -- exposed early on to multicultural dishes, may appreciate the exoticism of ethnic feasts. I never told my friends about our Christmas Eve banquet, fearing that the words squid and scungilli would send them away squealing.
 In fact, in the past several decades, I have found it ironic that the Italian peasant traditions upon which I was raised -- and which I desperately wanted to escape -- have become chic. Learning, for example, that my maternal and paternal grandfathers, both of whom had died before I was born, pressed grapes in their New Jersey basement or backyard only confirmed my belief that I was some kind of Italian-American Beverly Hillbilly, plunked down in the middle-class section of the affluent suburb Short Hills.
 Back in the '70s (to add to the layers of my ethnic shame), Italian-American culture was defined by Francis Ford Coppola's ''The Godfather,'' long before Mr. Coppola began roaming his extensive Napa vineyards and bottling his own brand of wine. 
 But even the Old World practice of making wine has re-emerged in the new millennium, sometimes exclusively packaged. A few years ago, I read in this newspaper about a California wine ''country club'' that charges a $140,000 initiation fee for the privilege of harvesting several rows of Napa grapes. Among the club's members was a doctor from my hometown who described the delight of having his ''fingers soaked in grape juice'' and boarded a jet to California to seek a wine finer than what he had made in his refrigerated garage. 
 Today, the excess of flying to Napa seems, well, oh so 2007. But the message of the Old World remains -- slow down and smell the full bouquet.
 Or the whole fish. The salty baccala, the slithering squid, the flaky smelts -- those aromas will always crack open the door to all those Christmases past.

HEADLINE: Bargains Pop Up in the Luxury Suite

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
THERE is no shortage of travel deals advertising Las Vegas hotels from $22 a night and three-night Caribbeancruises as low as $99. But as business travel continues to decline and even the wealthy begin to cut back on spending, the luxury travel segment is being hit hard, resulting in a bevy of bargains for those with cash to burn. 
 ''We are seeing special offers from luxury properties that have never had them in the past,'' said Tim MacDonald, president of Classic Vacations, a luxury vacation package company owned by Expedia, which is offering $500 airfare credits for some destinations. While most high-end hotels are trying to avoid dropping room rates, many are offering discounts like free nights or ''hundreds of dollars of spa or resort credits,'' Mr. MacDonald said. 
 For example, Four Seasons hotels in New York, Miami and Scottsdale, Ariz., have been offering a third night free. For Christmas, the Boca Raton Resort & Club in Florida has a family holiday package that offers two connecting rooms for the price of one (starting at $249 a night), as well as access to the resort's kids' camp, which normally costs $65 for each child. In Miami's South Beach, the sleek Angler's Resort is now offering rooms on the weekend of Dec. 26 for about $260 a night, almost $200 less than the price quoted a little over a month ago, while the popular Hotel of South Beach, which reported being completely sold out for that weekend a month ago, now has rooms available starting at $267 a night, rates more comparable to what the hotel charges in the off-season.
 In the Caribbean, the Bitter End Yacht Club on Virgin Gorda, which rarely offers discounts during the high season, is offering 25 percent off through April for travelers who book its seven-night Reefing the Rates deal by Jan. 5. CuisinArt Resort & Spa in Anguilla is handing out $500 resort credits to guests who stay five nights between Jan. 4 and March 2009. Caneel Bay on St. John and Little Dix Bay on Virgin Gorda are offering a fifth night free from Jan. 3 through April. And Parrot Cay, on a private island in the Turks and Caicos, is offering seven nights for the price of five between Jan. 10 and March 12. That brings a weeklong stay in a garden-view room to $3,875, down from $5,425 -- a deal that can be combined with an ''early bird offer'' of breakfast and dinner for the week at no extra cost, if booked by Jan. 31. 
 Part of the problem for high-end hotels is that they've been losing corporate business, not just because of shrinking business travel budgets but also because many corporations don't want to be perceived as being ostentatious in today's economic environment. Luxury hotels and meeting planners say the trend started after a subsidiary of American International Group was castigated for hosting a $442,000 conference at a luxurious Southern California resort days after a federal bailout. A.I.G. subsequently canceled a gathering at the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay as well as other company meetings.
 Concerned about shareholder and public perception, other companies are moving conferences from luxury resorts to more modest sites, selling private jets and canceling meetings. 
 At the same time, wealthy leisure travelers are scaling back. Sixty-seven percent of Americans with household discretionary income of $100,000 or more said they were planning to cut back on personal travel, according to the Annual Survey of Affluence and Wealth in America, produced by American Express Publishing Corporation and Harrison Group. 
 Premium airline travel declined by 8 percent over the 12 months to September, according to the latest statistics on first- and business-class travel from the International Air Transport Association. Economy travel also fell during that period, but only by 4 percent. In October, luxury hotels saw the biggest drops in room rates, revenues and occupancy rates compared with any other hotel segment, according to the most recent monthly data available from Smith Travel Research. For example, occupancy rates fell 8.9 percent and average daily room rates fell by 3.9 percent at the luxury level. By comparison, occupancy dropped 6.8 percent while room rates increased by 1.1 percent at midscale properties.
 To fill the empty rooms, high-end hotels are turning to third-party Web sites. Luxurylink.com, which offers discounts on high-end hotels and villas through online auctions and special deals, has posted 42 percent more luxury deals so far this quarter than the same period last year. Earlier this month the site was auctioning off a five-night package at the Hotel Carl Gustaf on St. Bart's, including breakfast, spa treatments and a five-day car rental with a starting bid of $1,755. The package normally costs $4,380.
 Another place to look for deals is the front of the plane. Lufthansa is offering deeply discounted business-class fares for travelers who book by Dec. 26 and depart by Jan. 2. For example, business-class seats from New York to Rome start at $1,894 round trip, compared with $3,343 to $8,000 normally. Swiss International Air Lines has been offering $2,590 round trip business-class fares for travel from Boston to Zurich, down from $8,994, and $2,274 for travel from New York to Rome, down from $8,501.
 Luxury cruise lines are also rolling out significant savings. The Yachts of Seabourn is offering $1,000 off seven-day Mediterranean voyages in 2009, which start at $3,550 a person not including the discount, for passengers who book by March. To encourage new customers, the cruise line is also giving $1,500 in onboard credit to each couple in a group of six or more when they bring first-time customers. 
 For the most bang for your buck, take your vacation during that sweet spot just after New Year's. ''After the holidays and before Presidents' Week, which is traditionally a busy time, there's very likely to be pockets of weakness,'' said Scott D. Berman, a principal and hospitality consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers in Miami, ''so it's quite practical that on the 7th or 8th of January we see a whole host of deals.''

HEADLINE: To New School Critics, Their Leader Lacks Focus

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO and MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
Elevator access to the university's eighth-floor administrative offices has been shut off to all but a few. After a 30-hour sit-in at another building, a proposed student assembly was canceled on Friday for security reasons. Some professors are so fearful that they have stopped using the e-mail system.
 Over the last 10 days, the New School has become a campus in open revolt against the leadership of its president, Bob Kerrey, who was given a 269-to-18 vote of no-confidence by the full-time faculty. Mr. Kerrey, the former governor and senator from Nebraska, who took over the university in 2001, made some concessions, admitted certain mistakes, started a blog to face his critics and spent two hours listening to complaints from dissident professors. Yet the mutiny has intensified.
 The catalyst for the rebellion was the recent dismissal of a popular provost, but the outpouring of anger and frustration has revealed a deeper, more complex set of problems with both the substance and style of Mr. Kerrey's efforts to make over the university. The board of trustees, which controls the president's fate, has so far stood behind him. 
 A politician without a Ph.D., Mr. Kerrey, 65, was recruited largely for his star power, and given a mandate to unite the New School's eight disparate divisions and turn a campus long viewed as a kind of academic shopping mall for continuing education into a more ambitious and rigorous one with a greater undergraduate focus.
 During his tenure, enrollment in degree programs has grown to 9,800 students from 7,100, and the endowment has more than doubled, to $214 million from $90 million. Freshman applications are up 28 percent since 2006.
 But these successes have often come at a cost of alienating constituent groups at the university, spread across multiple buildings in Greenwich Village.
 In dozens of interviews with professors, deans, trustees, students and former provosts, complaints abounded that Mr. Kerrey lets economic considerations trump academics, leaves professors out of decision-making, and has a frenetic and mercurial management style that has led to high turnover: In seven years, 18 deans have rotated through eight positions, and there have been four provosts, the last leaving after only a few months.
 Critics said that Mr. Kerrey's drive to change the New School has also been marked by about-faces on important matters, including capital projects, academic programs and faculty appointments. Even a 2005 campaign intended to help integrate what one professor called academic ''silos'' fell flat with names that made clear the programs were part of a larger whole but were tortuous to say: Parsons the New School for Design; Eugene Lang College the New School for Liberal Arts. 
 ''There's a profound lack of communication between the president and the faculty,'' said David Howell, an economics professor at Milano the New School for Management and Urban Policy and co-chairman of the Faculty Senate (which Mr. Kerrey helped create, but whose meetings he rarely attends).
 A key flashpoint in the growing dissent is James Murtha, the university's executive vice president, who has often acted as Mr. Kerrey's enforcer and who was also the subject of no-confidence votes by the faculty and of resignation demands by students. Several professors likened Mr. Murtha to Vice President Dick Cheney; at an unabashedly left-wing institution, there could hardly be a more stinging insult.
 Mr. Murtha, who did not return calls seeking comment, has his hand in nearly every aspect of the university, according to current and former deans and faculty members. The turnover of provosts -- the chief academic officers -- has only strengthened the hand of Mr. Murtha, the chief finance officer. 
 ''There is a sense that academics can never control their whole destiny because Murtha sits above the whole enterprise,'' said one former dean, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing retribution. Another colleague quipped: ''I am not sure I can go to the bathroom without his permission.'' 
 In an interview, Mr. Kerrey stood by Mr. Murtha, saying he had no plans to remove him. 
 After spending 45 minutes listening to faculty diatribes on Tuesday and trying to meet with the protesting students on Thursday, he suggested that the hubbub should be seen in historical context at a university that was founded in 1919 by a group of renegade Columbia professors and was a haven for scholars fleeing Hitler's Europe in the 1930s.
 ''This university was born in chaos and it ought to thrive in chaos,'' Mr. Kerrey said. ''This is a very important moment in the life of the school. It's very constructive -- not very pleasant, but I have been through more unpleasant things in my life.''
 The New School is by all accounts a difficult place to lead, since it is so many things to so many people.
 Eugene Lang, established 21 years ago, is most like a traditional college, but its 900 undergraduates are a small fraction of the student body of 6,068 undergraduates, 3,320 graduate students and 13,000 adults enrolled in 1,000 continuing-education courses. Tuition and accommodations at its 10 dormitories are more than $40,000 a year, much like Columbia and New York University, with which it would like to be compared; average SAT scores are considerably lower, though, and it is far easier to be admitted. 
 About a quarter of New School students come from foreign countries. Of the Americans, 40 percent are members of minorities. More than half the undergraduates receive financial aid. 
 When Mr. Kerrey arrived, the New School was emerging from a period of relative obscurity, when it was known more for its night courses than for the scholarly work in the social sciences that had never stopped. It was also hopelessly fractured: some students enrolled in the design or music divisions did not realize they were part of the New School. Mr. Kerry's goals were to bolster the institution's finances and raise its profile.
 Professors say they largely believe in the need for integration, but they object to the way Mr. Kerrey has gone about it.
 The Parsons fashion program -- featured on the Bravo network's reality show ''Project Runway'' -- is one of the university's best-known and a huge money-maker, in part because the overhead per student is comparatively low. The much smaller architecture department, also part of Parsons, is more expensive, to operate, because each student requires expensive materials. 
 A former Parsons dean said that Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Murtha rejected efforts to expand the architecture department and instead instilled ''enormous'' pressure to expand the fashion program: it has more than doubled, to 663 students from 291 in 2001 (architecture has remained fairly steady, with 74 students now). 
 ''They were shoving kids in anywhere they could fit them,'' the former dean said. ''It is as if the school was Procter & Gamble and we were talking about how many units of Tide to sell.''
 Mr. Kerrey makes no apologies for trying to capitalize on profitable divisions, especially since the university is heavily dependent on tuition because of its relatively small endowment, even after he was able to double it .
 ''The architecture program costs a million dollars a year more than it generates -- I have to make that million dollars up somewhere,'' he said in the interview. ''If you are not aggressive on enrollment at the New School, you find yourself underenrolled and in real financial trouble.''
 One of the most common complaints at Mr. Kerrey's meeting with the faculty on Tuesday was of wasted committee work, particularly on amuch-discussed faculty handbook that sought to establish universitywide standards in hiring, promotion and evaluation. 
 While faculty members were involved in drafting it, Professor Howell, of the Milano school, said that the handbook was approved by the provost and the board of trustees in 2006, ''hastily and over objections.'' Worse, he said, faculty members, with a green light from administrators, have since spent ''hundreds of hours'' on revisions, but the instability in the provost's office has stymied progress.
 ''The effect is that the work has been put in a drawer and closed,'' he said. ''The handbook looks exactly the way it did in 2006.''
 Faculty members also blamed Mr. Kerrey for flip-flopping, rejecting his own ideas or studying them into oblivion. They cited proposals for a culinary program and a law school that went nowhere, and a signature building planned and planned, on a prominent site, at Fifth Avenue and 14th Street, then ultimately scrapped.
 In 2004, Mr. Kerrey decided that he wanted to replace the existing building on that site, which has classrooms, a cafeteria and a library, amid wide agreement that it was drab and outdated. But participants in the planning said that the president pushed ahead with design ideas before the university had even settled on its mission.
 ''If he was talking to Donna Karan, trying to raise money, he would say it was going to be a fashion building,'' recalled one, again speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of being punished. ''If he was talking to someone else, he would say something else.''
 The architect Frank Gehry said that when he visited the New School for a lecture and dinner in 2004, he was offered the commission to design the building -- only to discover a week later that another firm had been hired. 
 ''He stood up at the dinner and talked all about how I was going to design this great new building,'' Mr. Gehry said of Mr. Kerrey. ''I was very excited. It is a block long and a great site.''
 Mr. Kerrey denied that he ever offered Mr. Gehry the job; four years later, the run-down building, on the east side of Fifth Avenue between 13th and 14th Streets, remains untouched. 
 Others cite similar incidents that have bred ill will.
 Stephen C. Schlesinger, a foreign policy expert and author of ''Act of Creation: The Founding of the United Nations,'' recalled his nine years as director of the World Policy Institute, which used to be part of the New School.
 The institute functioned as a policy group, with two dozen fellows who did not teach but were ''great advertisements for the New School,'' Mr. Schlesinger said. But it lost money. Mr. Schlesinger said he discovered that Mr. Kerrey did not want to ''put up with that anymore'' by reading a statement from him to that effect in The New York Observer.
 Mr. Schlesinger asked Mr. Kerrey for a one-year sabbatical, and said the president asked him ''four or five times'' during that year to come back and teach. But when he went to discuss specifics of returning, Mr. Kerrey ''said 'there is no teaching job,'' Mr. Schlesinger recalled, adding that he had ''turned down other jobs.''
 Mr. Kerrey described Mr. Schlesinger's account as ''pretty close to true.'' 
 ''I just couldn't find a place for him to teach,'' he said. ''I wasn't able to keep my promise.''
 ''That's the problem with Bob Kerrey,'' said Mr. Schlesinger, a son of the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. ''He charms everybody when they first meet him and then something happens and he turns around and punches them in the stomach. After that, you say, 'How can I trust this guy?' ''

HEADLINE: Letters: Roots of the Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Before the Fear, There Was Foolishness'' (Everybody's Business, Dec. 14) related the wonderful aphorism that if a fish could think, the last thing it would think about is water. That's because it takes water for granted. 
 In reacting to the current crisis, it seems, some economists take jobs for granted. They propose to fix the economy by making credit easier, so that people will borrow and spend more.
 But most people determine what they'll spend by the size of their paychecks, after factoring in their future prospects at their jobs and making their monthly payments. I suspect that only a small number crunch the numbers, add in the equity from their homes and figure out the cost of a loan before spending. It's the current job and its future prospects that make people feel wealthy or poor. Everything else is secondary.
 This is where our economy has been lacking for the last seven or eight years. People don't feel secure in their jobs, and yearly raises have been low. Only when we fix that problem can the economy improve.
 Andrew S. Thompson
 Mountainside, N.J., Dec. 14
 To the Editor:
 While in the column Ben Stein contended that ''this is not the time for timidity by government'' and that we should leave to researchers ''the discussion of who is ideologically purest,'' this is indeed the time for ideology.
 Because a panoply of government interventions encouraged the credit binge -- artificially low interest rates, tax deductions for mortgage payments, and the Community Reinvestment Act, among others -- it would be wise to step back and rethink the ideology of the regulatory state.
 Assisting ''real people'' is a goal I share with Mr. Stein. To do so, however, we should not continue the series of panicky, immediate-gratification bandages that government officials have hurried to apply in recent months. These measures only hide the underlying causes of the crisis, exacerbate government's strangulation of our economy and prolong the suffering. This is exactly the time to reflect on what the relevant philosophical principles can teach us.

HEADLINE: Focus on Money Hurts the N.F.L.'s Credibility

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 I have to protest the N.F.L.'s hypocrisy involving Plaxico Burress, Adam Jones and Michael Vick. Yes, these players have made mistakes. 
 But when N.F.L. officials tell us that they want to rid the organization of bad role models for kids, they are not sincere. If they were, the league would eliminate all the alcohol commercials that pander to young viewers and stop showing cheerleaders as busty, mindless man toys. 
 Moreover, the wife of Ralph Wenzel (Pittsburgh Steelers and San Diego Chargers, 1966 to 1973), who has degenerative dementia, an ailment often the result of head injuries, cannot even get an audience with Commissioner Roger Goodell. Finally, the game promotes violence that leads to serious injuries among young players. So, let's stop beating up on people like Burress, Jones and Vick and just admit that the N.F.L. is all about the almighty dollar and not about morality. Greg Smith

 Was It Worth It?
 To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''New-Look Yankees Add Burnett,'' Dec. 13: The Yankees' signing of A. J. Burnett for $82.5 million, on the heels of them signing C. C. Sabathia for $161 million, is sickening to me, a lifelong Yankees fan. 
 It's so unseemly when a great many Americans are losing their jobs. It also accentuates yet again the ridiculous situation in baseball that permits a haves-versus-have-nots system. They just lost me as a fan. Robert Miller 
 New York
 After C. C. Sabathia and A. J. Burnett were introduced to the New York news media on Thursday, readers of the Bats blog had plenty to say about the Yankees' free-spending ways.
 Please sign Teixeira; it is a no-brainer. Ahmed Fatouh
 What gall in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depressoin -- to pay nearly a quarter of a billion for two players while still seeking help from the public sector. I hope A. J. Burnett and C. C. Sabathia give away lots of their money to the less fortunate.KN
 Has anyone ever doubted the willingness to spend by the Yankees? With a G.M. named Cashman, it's almost comical. Being a Yankee fan, I wonder if this has really benefited them. We'll see. Just don't trade Melky Cabrera, a 23-year-old for a 36-year-old. That's a terrible idea. 
 Impartial/Observer
 What happened to Cashman's plan of Hughes and Kennedy, building from within, and not overpaying? CRB
 For what the Yankees are paying these two guys, they could have offered decent jobs to 5,000 unemployed New Yorkers -- but I guess pitching is important. Leo
 These guys were well coached by the New York Yankee media-relations department before the press conference. But if they stay healthy, it's the best 1-2 combo in the A.L. East.Adam Dunagan
 Manny Ramirez is an all-time great hitter; he also quit on his team. Let him go somewhere else. NYJ
 We gave them the money because we want the pitching that might justify slapping Joe Torre in the face.
 In my humble opinion, if we'd kept him, we wouldn't necessarily need these guys.
 However, I'll say this much: If Joe Girardi doesn't get us in to the playoffs, the Yankees would do well to grovel to get Joe back.
 Think, Please
 Good luck with Burnett. All of us in the Toronto area will be laughing hard when he cracks under the pressure of playing on the big stage. He was great for us at times, ... but he was AWOL often, too. Glad you spent the coin and not us.
 Tom MacInnes
 They will never know what hit them. Forty million a year for two pitchers is over the top. The gods of baseball have a tendency to even things out and will be outraged at this much money for only two players. Expect blistered fingers and sore elbows. C. Perry

HEADLINE: Revising Loan Modifications

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AS home foreclosures continue to rise, lenders are intensifying efforts to assist troubled homeowners. But financial advisers warn that borrowers should be vigilant about the type of help they are being offered.
 ''The average loan servicer wants to reach a resolution about a loan modification with a single letter or a phone call,'' said Steven Horne, the president of Wingspan Portfolio Advisors, which helps clients renegotiate loan terms. But, he said, devising an effective long-term strategy to enable a borrower to avoid foreclosure might take several rounds of communication.
 Many borrowers who obtain loan modifications, in fact, soon find themselves in trouble again. According to a government survey, 53 percent of the borrowers who had changes to their loans in first quarter of 2008 began missing payments within six months. 
 John C. Dugan, the comptroller of the currency, said he was baffled by the results, which were released this month.
 But Mr. Horne, a former executive at Fannie Mae, suggested that the new loans had not been structured to best meet borrowers' financial circumstances, in large part because the loan servicers that collect mortgage payments cannot engage in a lengthy analysis of each borrower's finances.
 It is up to the borrowers, therefore, to be more proactive. Mr. Horne says they can increase the likelihood of securing the right loan if they push for more personal attention, and do a little homework about their own finances. 
 Borrowers should devise a firm budget and determine what monthly payment they can actually afford. Some help can be found at the Internal Revenue Service's Web site (IRS.gov). Visitors who type in ''Collection Financial Standards'' into the search box will be directed to pages (sometimes by state) that offer guidelines, based on consumer surveys, of what they can reasonably expect to pay for food, clothing, housekeeping supplies, out-of-pocket health care, utilities and transportation.
 For instance, an average family of four in Manhattan (with no one over age 65) would incur total monthly expenses of about $7,614. That includes $1,370 for food, clothing and other items, $228 for out-of-pocket medical expenses, $652 for public transportation and $5,364 for housing-related expenses.
 The latest foreclosure figures suggest that New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are generally doing better than the rest of the nation but that problems are worsening. 
 According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the foreclosure rate for so-called prime mortgages with fixed interest rates was twice what it was two years ago. In Connecticut, 0.52 percent of these mortgages were in foreclosure at the end of October, the trade group said. In New York, the figure was 0.71 percent, and in New Jersey, 0.9 percent, just slightly higher than the national average of 0.86 percent.
 The picture for subprime adjustable-rate mortgages was bleaker. About 17.7 percent of these loans were in foreclosure at the end of October in Connecticut. In New York, the figure was 24.5 percent, and in New Jersey, 25.6 percent. The national average was 20.65 percent. 
 At the same point in 2006 -- before most subprime ARMs started adjusting upward -- Connecticut's foreclosure rate for these loans reached 4.6 percent. In New York, the failure rate was 5.8 percent, and in New Jersey the figure was 4.7 percent, which was identical to the national average.
 Subprime ARMs in the three states total 172,257, 12 percent less than two years ago, according to the mortgage trade association.

HEADLINE: A City That Shopped Till It Dropped

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: Emeryville, Calif. 

 BODY:
 AS he points to some Uggs boots on display in his shoe store, Jason Wayman looks forlorn. 
 He used to have trouble keeping this ever-trendy footwear in stock at his store, called Elements, in this small city across the bay from San Francisco. Now, he watches as a steady stream of shoppers still try the boots on, but often leave without buying.
 ''You can see them doing the calculations in their minds: Will they ever be on sale? Is this an expense I can afford right now?'' he said.
 The situation would be difficult for any retailer in any community. But the people of Emeryville are feeling the pain of this disappointing holiday shopping season more acutely than most. 
 A 1.8-square-mile sliver of a city wedged between Berkeley and Oakland, Emeryville is a retail mecca. It is also one of many American cities that hitched its wagon over the last several decades to what seemed like the limitless ability of American shoppers to spend money.
 Now that faith in the retail engine is being sorely tested. Consumer spending dropped 7.8 percent in November, according to the federal government, and many economists think it will fall further as consumers are buffeted by losses in the stock market, declines in home values and the unsettling fear that they may lose their jobs.
 ''I would be worried if I were a city father or mother in a town like Emeryville,'' said Joseph E. Gyourko, a professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania. ''Not all this retail can make it, given the fact that Americans have to cut consumption to restore their savings.'' 
 Once a largely abandoned, polluted industrial wasteland, the Emeryville of today is almost all densely developed. Companies like Pixar, Peet's Coffee and Tea, the Chiron unit of Novartis and a host of Internet and biotech start-ups call it home. 
 That would seem to give the city a degree of shelter from a sharp drop-off in consumer spending -- but perhaps not enough. Twenty-five percent of the city's revenue comes from sales taxes collected largely at four large retail centers, including a six-year-old, upscale outdoor promenade, Bay Street Emeryville, home of Elements. The city also has a comprehensive collection of big-box stores, from Best Buy to Home Depot to the huge blue IKEA that hulks prominently over Interstate 80. 
 Along with declining property taxes and the woes of California's state government, declining sales tax revenue has helped to open up significant deficits in Emervyille's municipal budget. According to California's Board of Equalization, Emeryville's sales tax collections fell 23 percent in the third quarter this year from the same period last year, among the steepest drops in the state.
 ''We are definitely vulnerable,'' said Patrick D. O'Keefe, the city manager, who has proposed new taxes and cuts in spending and government hiring.
 Emeryville's woes aren't confined to retail. The downturn has touched all aspects of its economy. The Townhouse Bar and Grill, a 19-year-old restaurant, is located in a former speakeasy -- a building that's a souvenir of the wilder Emeryville of the Depression era.
 Ellen Hope Rosenberg, the Townhouse's owner, said executives used to fill the restaurant at lunchtime. Now some may have just stopped coming -- perhaps, she speculates, as expense accounts dry up. And not a single company has bought out the place for a holiday party. (Last year, five did.)
 Like other restaurateurs around the country, Ms. Rosenberg has taken emergency precautions: replacing expensive dishes on the menu like filet mignon with lower-price alternatives like top sirloin and cutting back drastically on her staff's hours.
 The abrupt decline in consumer and corporate spending raises a disturbing existential question for Emeryville and other communities like it. 
 Did a city that worked so hard to clean up the mess left by abandoned steel mills and rubber plants ultimately trade one kind of urban blight for another, more modern variety?
 RETAILERS and restaurateurs throughout Emeryville tell variations on the same story: An already lackluster year for sales hit the wall in September. On a recent late afternoon, when shoppers would normally be flooding the premium stores along the Bay Street shopping center, designed to look like a quaint urban village, stores like the Gap, Banana Republic, Magnolia Audio and Video, Kay Jewelers and Bath and Body Works were almost eerily quiet. 
 For Agnes Hsu, owner of Teacake Bake Shop, the biggest problem is not the amount of traffic in her store or the number of shoppers willing to pay for the frosted cupcakes and cookies that have earned her a loyal following. Teacake also depends on supplying treats to birthdays and wedding showers, and that business, she said, ''started to flat-line'' about the time Lehman Brothers and A.I.G. hit the headlines this fall. 
 ''That's when even the affordable luxuries were hit,'' she said. ''I guess people are just baking their own birthday cakes.'' 
 Ron Weller, general manager for Madison Marquette, Bay Street's owner, acknowledges the pain being felt in the retail world. But he said it was too early to judge conclusively the holiday turnout on Bay Street. The promenade, he said, is ''holding its own.''
 ''We are busy,'' he added, ''but of course, everyone has everything on sale.''
 Across town from Bay Street is another Emeryville attraction, the Emerybay Public Market, nestled along the unsightly train tracks that bisect the city. This mall, opened in 1988, includes a movie theater, a Borders bookstore, a smattering of other stores and an inner food court of two dozen ethnic food stalls. For people who run some small businesses there -- even the shoeshine man, idly thumbing through his checkbook during lunchtime one day this month -- 2008 has been a year to forget.
 Denise Russell-Lewis, owner of Jamaica Place, which offers dishes like jerk chicken and curry goat, describes being squeezed between declining sales and increasing costs prompted by higher energy prices. The price of a 50-pound box of parboiled rice, for example, jumped to $20 from $16 earlier this year; a 10-pound box of skinless tilapia rose to $31 from $22. Neither adjusted after the price of oil reversed course, and Ms. Russell-Lewis says she is now late on her lease payments. 
 ''In this business we expect fluctuations,'' she said. ''But not at the level we are experiencing. This is more drastic.'' 
 Denise Pinkston of TMG Partners, Emerybay's owner and Jamaica Place's landlord, said Emeryville's location at the heart of one of the country's most populous regions meant that the city would almost certainly persevere.
 ''We might all be making less money, but we'll still be here in three years when the recovery is in full swing,'' she said.
 But for some entrepreneurs, any prospective recovery is too late. The Blue Sky Family Club, a family restaurant and play space with organic pizza and nonelectronic games, opened its doors in September to the worst financial environment since the Depression. It closed less than two months later.
 ''We got ran over by a tidal wave,'' said the owner Patrick O'Laughlin, still audibly shaken from the experience a month later. ''It's a concept I still believe in. But will I revisit it? Probably not.''
 IN 1988, Powell Street Plaza became Emeryville's first pure shopping center -- a Garden of Eden of sorts for the city's retail resurgence. Residents recall that it sits on land once occupied by a company whose odd assortment of products included gopher poison. Today, the plaza is an island, surrounded by a loud, unpleasant cordon of traffic-jammed streets and highway overpasses.
 The shopping center appeared relatively busy on a weekday earlier this month. It boasts one of the most popular Trader Joe's stores in the East Bay, a new Beverages & More and a Starbucks that draws a reliable crowd of morning commuters streaming into Oakland.
 But there are also signs of recession-related trouble. A Shoe Pavilion recently departed after the company, which is based in Sherman Oaks, Calif., announced in October that it was liquidating assets. That empty storefront sits next to a still-vacant lot that once belonged to a Jo-Ann Fabrics & Crafts, which moved this year to a neighboring city. Next door to that is a Circuit City -- the electronics retailer that filed for bankruptcy protection last month. Regency Centers, Powell Street's owner, says it is filling its two vacancies. 
 City boosters acknowledge that dependence on the retail industry is creating some new problems for the city. But they look at the larger picture, and a city that has remade itself from a polluted eyesore into a regional destination. 
 In a way, over the last 122 years of its existence, this peculiar city of only 9,000 permanent residents has been a microcosm of the evolving American economy at nearly every stage of growth. In the late 19th century, the city was an agricultural hub and a center for handling cattle and processing meat; it became widely known in the region for its foul smell. 
 During the Depression, Emeryville was jammed with speakeasies, racetracks and brothels and became known as a somewhat lawless center for entertainment. Then, until the 1970s, the city was the industrial cradle of Northern California, full of steel mills and factories, until the heavy industry migrated overseas, leaving polluted lands in its wake.
 Most locals take pride in what happened next. Civic leaders banded together and created a redevelopment agency that allowed the city to borrow money for the cleanup through the sale of long-term bonds. Then it basically gave away the land to developers, along with rich tax incentives, and is slowly paying back the debt with the new property tax revenue.
 Bay Street Promenade, for example, was built on heavily polluted lands once covered by a paint plant. The huge blue IKEA store opened in 2003 on the former site of Judson Steel, once among the largest steel manufacturers in the Western United States.
 Emeryville officials note that the city has a more diversified revenue stream than places like Detroit, the capital of the beleaguered auto industry, or parts of Southern California in the 1980s that were wholly dependent on aerospace and military contractors.
 BUT that is of little consolation to area businesses, whose problems are likely to become worse as Emeryville tries to address its new challenges. With new budget holes opening, the City Council has proposed a variety of new taxes, including a levy to raise additional money for the city's parks and take pressure off of other parts of the budget. 
 City managers are considering other tax increases as well, like raising the charge on the city's lone surviving card room, the Oaks Card Club, whose tax contributions comprise 8 percent of the city annual budget.
 Its owner, John Tibbetts, says the recession has affected the gambling industry because people have less to wager with. Business has declined 15 percent from last year, after the card room raised the ''drop,'' or fee per hand, to $4 from $3. Mr. Tibbett appeared before city managers last month to argue against increasing the gambling tax and appears to have won the argument, at least for now. 
 ''If the city does need more money, I thought it should be broad-based and not have one individual business singled out,'' he said.
 Emeryville has another possible answer to its fiscal problems: it is pursuing even more retail-oriented development, which would derive new sales and property taxes. The city is cleaning up an undeveloped lot north of Bay Street and planning an expansion of the shopping center -- perhaps a Macy's or a Nordstrom, with a high-rise hotel and more condominiums.
 That strategy -- in effect, betting anew on the curative powers of the American shopper -- has some Emeryville residents worried. Members of a small but increasingly vocal group, Residents United for a Livable Emeryville, say the city has given too much power to developers and made too large a bet on the American consumer without extracting benefits for people who call it a permanent home.
 ''We want jobs that have a future,'' said Tracy Schroth, one of the group's co-founders, who married a longtime Emeryville resident, Scott Donahue, six years ago. ''We want a community that is aesthetically and culturally interesting, as opposed to a big retail center that creates a lot of traffic and noise and has no soul.''

HEADLINE: Leveraging Nostalgia

BYLINE: By WALTER KIRN; Walter Kirn is a frequent contributor. His most recent novel is ''The Unbinding.''

 BODY:
In Akron, Ohio, where I was born and where most of my father's extended family still lives, the dominant industry of the 20th century was manufacturing car and truck tires. The site of this heroic enterprise was generically called ''the plant.'' In the shadow of the Goodyear blimps, those icons of airborne Americana that flew sorties from their local hangars to major ball games all across the continent, thousands of workers for Goodyear, B F Goodrich, Firestone and other homegrown companies toiled at jobs that kept the nation rolling, literally and figuratively, down the road toward where all roads lead: the future. This was a problem for Akron, as it turned out, when the future arrived. With the advent of a new tire design, the radial, and a new economic system, globalization, the plants closed down, the workers were laid off and the ''Rubber Capital of the World'' became the capital of nothing, except for a certain strain of brawny nostalgia that I was exposed to on holiday visits, when my father would invariably drive us out to behold the monumental buildings that had been erected to house the blimps. 
 Nostalgia for those moments of nostalgia -- a meta-nostalgia, as it were -- was roused in me lately by another tour of America's expansive blue-collar past. This tour was conducted through the media and led by the management of the Big Three auto companies, the industry we generically call ''Detroit,'' as they bargained for what their dependent city, Akron, long ago ran out of: time. The barons of Detroit pleaded for their own salvation, but in putting their endangered workers out front, they played upon sentiments that I, for one, haven't entirely run out of. 
 The auto workers, whose latest, most critical job was to save their managers' necks (same as it always was, they might feel), came off as beings of toughness and modest expectations, their ample benefits packages notwithstanding. It has been a few decades since we have seen their type spotlighted on the national stage. The last time, as I remember it, was in the post-Vietnam 1970s, during the craze for all things truck-related that gave us the AM radio hit ''Convoy'' and a number of movies featuring chest hair, air horns and buxom waitresses. The theme of those songs and movies was stamina. The American trucker, beyond all else, endured. That was his gift. He moved on down the highway, fueled by a combination of country music, vaguely alluded-to chemical stimulants and faith in the promise of a middle-class livelihood that didn't rely on academic training, or even on the education of his employers, who were portrayed, by and large, as well-groomed imbeciles not unlike today's Big Three execs.
 The auto workers, who have taken to the news shows to plead in public for the kind of aid that investment bankers won more discreetly, are supposed to evoke, like the truckers of the '70s, our American pride in large machines. As a son of Akron and a lifelong driver of pickups (the last of Detroit's successful product lines, and the one it relied on for far, far too long), I'm susceptible to this gear-head romance. The rigs I used for farm work as a teenager and to cross mountain ranges as a grown-up were as sturdy and dependable as Detroit's smaller vehicles were flimsy, and it was impossible, when behind their wheels, not to feel a steely exultation that went beyond the personal. The people who had tightened the bolts on these colossi, the people who had welded the panels of their chassis, had more than earned their paychecks, it seemed to me, as I hauled hay bales or blasted through a snowdrift. Even when driving such pickups became prohibitively expensive, I never lost touch with the sense that under their hoods lay something larger than a mere engine. 
 That horsepower, that torque, originated in human hands. In the decades following the '70s, right up to about a month ago, those hands were invisible in the larger culture. The programmer and the financier overshadowed, and finally eclipsed, the laborer as the bulwarks of our economy. It felt a bit bizarre at first, this shift -- away from the body and up into the mind, off the factory floor onto the trading floor and away through an unseen network of wires and fibers -- but after a while I got used to it, much as I got used to the idea that my beloved pickup was outmoded and would have to be traded in quite soon for a lighter, more efficient and probably foreign-manufactured vehicle. I put off making this change, partly out of my archaic loyalty to Midwestern swing-shift pullers, but when I capitulated and bought Asian I experienced no regrets. The opposite. I felt as if I were joining the world at large, leaving the gray confines of the Great Lakes for the blue freedom of the global oceans. 
 But the members of the U.A.W., partly on their own behalf and partly on the behalf of their employers, yanked me back in time. They also urged me to contemplate an American future without them, without the plant. It worked, too, at least for me, though it might not work forever. It worked because one cold weekend, many years ago, while I was attending a Big Ten football game, all the heads in the stadium tilted back in unison. A great oblong craft had floated into view, the pride of my declining native city. It was huge, that dirigible. Monstrous. Yet reassuring. It took up a space in the midday sky that hadn't seemed empty until it filled it.
 Then the thing sailed off and vanished.

HEADLINE: Playing for Your Business on Main Street

BYLINE: By MARGARET FARLEY STEELE

 BODY:
IN Greenwich, merchants were staging Sunday ''block parties.'' Darien planned to show free movies on Saturday to try to woo customers to local shops, and New Haven restaurateurs and theaters were collaborating on pre- and after-theater specials.
 Faced with what some retail owners say is the toughest holiday shopping season in memory, savvy small-business owners are working harder and smarter to ring up transactions as layoffs and fear of a prolonged recession threaten to take the ''ca-ching'' out of holiday sales.
 ''People are starting to get a little more creative in luring customers out to their businesses,'' said Anthony Rescigno, president of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce. 
 On East Putnam Avenue in Greenwich on a recent Sunday, a magician strolled the block west of Church Street, and face painters decorated rosy cheeks. ''We really want to create a warm and welcoming family environment 5 to 10 minutes from home,'' said Holly Adam, the owner of Cashmere Inc. and the brainchild behind the block party. 
 While giant retailers from Macy's to Neiman Marcus and even Target are suffering this season, the pain is being felt more acutely in the small shops of many downtowns in Connecticut. Many Main Street businesses were surviving on thin profit margins even before the current economic meltdown, and most of them depend heavily on sales from the holiday season. Even longtime store owners say they worry whether they will be able to survive. 
 While national chains and department stores are offering deep discounts, little downtown businesses are employing other more creative ways to attract customers.
 ''It's a challenge,'' Ms. Adam said. ''We independents cannot compete with the malls. We've chosen to take a quality, owner-on-the-premises route. An owner who knows your husband and your kids, greets you by name and knows what you like. That's what will keep us here.''
 On Sundays this month, many Greenwich stores are honoring $25 gift cards from a local newspaper ad with purchases of $100 or more. ''Discounting doesn't sound as nice as 'We're going to give you a gift,' '' said Mary Ann Morrison, president and chief executive of the Greenwich Chamber of Commerce. On Greenwich Avenue, where the rents average $125 a square foot, a half-dozen failed businesses look like missing gemstones in a jeweled necklace, visual cues that retail sales nationwide are the weakest in 35 years. 
 Cities that successfully reinvented themselves in recent years, like New Haven and Stamford, face new challenges now. Late-night Thursdays are a holiday staple in New Haven, but new this season are horse-drawn carriage rides and performances by regional school choirs meant to draw more foot traffic to its restaurants and shops. 
 A further inducement: Twenty restaurants and three theaters are promoting $29 three-course dinners before 6 or after 9 o'clock. Reservations doubled the week of Nov. 9, when the prix fixe menus were tried out, and 70 percent of diners surveyed said they were either sampling the city's night life for the first time or returning after a long while. ''This is the first time in the history of New Haven that the restaurants have all come together,'' said Anne Worcester, chief marketing officer of Market New Haven.
 ''Everybody has the same common goal: As goes New Haven, there goes their business,'' she said. ''The collaboration is probably what sets New Haven apart from other small cities I know about.'' 
 In Stamford, at A Step Ahead, which has outfitted girls for bat mitzvahs and proms for 23 years, the family owners are attempting to organize citywide events a la First Night that would target a different community each month and benefit a charity. 
 ''We are in trouble,'' said Monica Needle, daughter of the owners. Sales in November were off 25 percent from last November, and December looks far worse, she said. At that rate, the store cannot last more than a month or two, Ms. Needle said. 
 ''Our friends are all in the same position,'' she said. ''If we make ourselves stronger, we can accomplish something for the area.'' 
 Working with her is Lynn McGee, owner of the Bridal Suite, whose business on Bedford Street has gone from boom to bust in the past year. ''All the girls want now are samples,'' Ms. McGee said, and they want to negotiate the marked prices. ''They come in asking, 'What can I get this for?' '' That sort of haggling never happened before, she said, noting that she was selling $2,000 try-on gowns for $400. 
 Bedford Street, once a premier shopping area, has long been in the shadow of the local mall. ''We are all struggling so bad,'' Ms. McGee said. Her husband's pizzeria down the street is getting by because of its affordable lunch menu, but many other places to eat are hurting, she said.
 To boost dining downtown, a Stamford restaurant guide was delivered in October to every office complex in the city, said Sandy Goldstein, president of the Downtown Special Services District, which is Stamford's business improvement association. ''So many of our restaurants are mom-and-pops, and there's not much margin for error,'' Ms. Goldstein said. 
 The city's new blue holiday lights -- inspired by bulbs on the Champs-Elysees in Paris -- are another attempt to draw traffic downtown. ''I don't know if people love them or hate them, I just want them to come and stay for dinner,'' Ms. Goldstein said. 
 At the state level, declining sales mean less revenue from sales tax receipts. For municipalities, the bottom line is lower property taxes: As Ms. Goldstein put it, healthy businesses bring in higher rents, boosting real estate values, which then translate to higher taxes. The opposite occurs in a downturn.
 In smaller towns, retailers and marketers are thinking outside the gift box, too. 
 In Darien, on the day after Thanksgiving, characters from the Cirque du Soleil bebopped around the town's shopping districts dressed as snowballs. Two days later, at the town's holiday tree lighting, Chamber of Commerce volunteers handed out merchant goody bags that included discount coupons, said Carol Wilder-Tamme, president and chief executive of the chamber. 
 The verdict after that weekend: ''People were out, but they were very careful about what they were buying,'' Ms. Wilder-Tamme said. To help spotlight its merchants, the chamber is taking out full-page newspaper ads, which it buys at a discount that it passes on to the retailers. The chamber has also created a new slogan: Darien, a Destination of Distinction. 
 On Saturday, two free films were to be shown in the hope that moviegoers would stay in town, have lunch at local restaurants and shop locally rather than at the malls.
 In New Canaan, with 11 vacant storefronts in its town center, landlords were asked to dress up the bare shop windows. Empty stores convey a message of hard times and reduce spillover traffic between stores, said Pamela Ogilvie, executive director of the New Canaan Chamber of Commerce. ''It's a small town, and we have to work our way out of this together.'' 
 While some business owners seek strength in numbers, others are spending money to make money. Aitoro Appliance and Electronics in Norwalk recently erected a $100,000 electronic billboard outside the store to announce daily specials, thank local organizations and promote its half-price ''dent and scratch'' sale. 
 ''For us, to move merchandise that we own is important. We have to turn some dollars,'' said Tony Aitoro, a partner in the 60-year-old family business. Aitoro's has increased advertising and in-store events like charity functions, which are especially good for business, he said. ''The next time they need a refrigerator, they'll think, 'Aitoro's -- I've been there and they're very community-minded,' '' he said. 
 The Aitoros have survived other downturns. ''It's a cycle,'' Mr. Aitoro said. ''It'll come around. We just have to be good businessmen and be prepared for the next wave of buying.''

HEADLINE: A Financial Guru Who Keeps It Personal

BYLINE: By TAMMY LA GORCE

DATELINE: BRIARCLIFF MANOR 

 BODY:
 JEAN CHATZKY, an author and personal finance columnist who makes regular appearances on the ''Today'' show, measures her personal wealth in a way those who have never installed a computer stock widget might relate to. 
 ''Boy, did I strike it rich with my neighbors,'' Ms. Chatzky said during an interview in her living room here. ''They're incredible. Such great friends.'' She was being metaphorical, but only by half. Neighbors, or at least a gift for neighborliness, have helped grease the gears in a career now in overdrive as a result of the recent financial crisis. 
 In addition to her broadcast work, Ms. Chatzky, 44, writes a monthly column for More magazine and a weekly one for The New York Daily News. She has also been fielding more questions than ever from the monetarily stricken on her Web site, JeanChatzky.com. 
 And lots of other places, as well.
 ''I'm one of those people you just come up to,'' she said. ''People ask me things in the Loehmann's dressing room, in the airport. I do my best to help. I think I'm able to present what people need to know about money in a way that's not confrontational.''
 Approachability is what landed Ms. Chatzky her slot on ''Today'' 14 years ago. At the time, she was writing a column for Smart Money magazine. ''The magazine had a really aggressive P.R. guy, and he'd throw everybody he could on TV,'' she said. ''I just stuck.'' 
 Her personal finance niche has also served her well throughout four books aimed at the fiscally mixed-up.
 ''Pay It Down!'' (Portfolio), Ms. Chatzky's best-known book, tackles the subject she is most passionate about: debt. Though it was published in the relatively financially rosy year of 2004, it was such a hit it led to ''The Debt Diet,'' an ''Oprah Winfrey'' five-show series now sold as a DVD. 
 She worried that she was not adamant enough. 
 ''I think I should have screamed louder and stomped my feet more, because maybe -- I mean, we had a million people on 'The Debt Diet' -- but maybe I could have helped solve the problem,'' she said. ''I wish I had done more. I look at the pain people are in; it's not as if people in a community like ours aren't feeling it.''
 Ms. Chatzky, the mother of a 14-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl, began meeting with community leaders convened by Westchester Jewish Community Services last month to help steer people toward finding whatever financial help they need, whether it is counseling or directions to the local food bank.
 ''It's a way to help people who've taken on more than they can handle,'' she said. 
 In March, she will publish a new book, ''The Difference'' (Crown). ''It's based on a survey of 5,000 people to look at why it is some people have an easy time getting from paycheck to paycheck into financial security and others get stuck,'' Ms. Chatzky said. ''It was fascinating for me.'' 
 Among her findings: gratitude counts. ''It doesn't seem to matter if you write a check or get involved; if you're cognizant of what you've been given, if you don't necessarily take it for granted, that humility rather than hubris tends to go a long way,'' Ms. Chatzky said. 
 Not that anyone's money is apt to go a long way in the immediate future, she said. Which is why Ms. Chatzky outlined three pieces of advice she hoped her Westchester neighbors would follow, at least for the short term.
 No. 1, she said, is do not pull money out of a 401(k). No. 2 is to track spending. And No. 3 sparked Ms. Chatzky's most impassioned plea: ''If you're in a precarious financial place, don't try to hide it from your kids,'' she said. ''I know there are a lot of parents saying, 'We'll have Christmas, but we're not going to have the same kind of Christmas.' Let's explain it more than that, so our kids understand they don't have to be scared we're not going to put food on the table, but that maybe we're not going to get a new game system this year.
 ''There are a lot of kids out there, even kids in Westchester, who are not going to have a holiday at all,'' she continued. ''Wouldn't it be better if we take some money and go buy something for them?''

HEADLINE: A Payoff Out of Poverty?

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG. 
Tina Rosenberg, a contributing writer for the magazine, has written extensively about Latin America.

 BODY:
FORTY-NINE YEARS AGO, the anthropologist Oscar Lewis published a book called ''Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty,'' detailing a single day in these families' lives. One family, headed by Jesus Sanchez, a food buyer for a restaurant, continued to tell its story in a second Lewis book, the widely read ''Children of Sanchez.'' Lewis singled out elements of a culture that, he argued, keep those socialized in it mired in poverty: machismo, authoritarianism, marginalization from organized civic life, high rates of abandonment of illegitimate children, alcoholism, disdain for education, fatalism, passivity, inability to defer gratification and a time orientation fixed firmly on the present. 
 We still call this the culture of poverty today. But the idea has taken on a life far beyond the world of Mexican peasants. And although the concept originated with Lewis, it has come to mean almost the opposite of what Lewis intended. 
 Lewis was a man of the left. He saw the culture of poverty as a defense mechanism adapted by the poor in response to capitalist inequality. For a while, the culture of poverty remained a leftist idea: Michael Harrington used it throughout his hugely influential 1962 book, ''The Other America,'' which laid the foundation for President Johnson's War on Poverty. But Lewis soon lost control of the concept. With the publication of Daniel Patrick Moynihan's 1965 report ''The Negro Family,'' the ''culture of poverty'' became a shorthand for black ghetto culture, a defect of the poor. Then Edward Banfield, a conservative political scientist, introduced the notion that the culture of poverty was immutable; his 1970 book, ''The Unheavenly City,'' attacked the key assumption of the War on Poverty -- the idea that government can help. Banfield argued that poverty was a product of the poor's lack of future-orientation, and that nothing government could feasibly do would change that orientation or stop parents from transmitting it to their children.
 Banfield's book is widely seen as retrograde today, but he still seems to own the culture of poverty. Lewis had used the phrase to describe habits acquired in response to structural factors -- the standard left-wing argument that people are poor because of low wages, discrimination and bad schools. But the phrase has essentially become shorthand for the right-wing argument that poverty stems from the limitations of the poor and is largely impervious to outside intervention. 
 Persistent poverty has retreated from the political debate in the United States. But outside the headlines there has been a gentle evolution in thinking about the causes and cures for poverty, one that moves away from blaming capitalism and blaming the poor alike. Today, the most interesting development in that evolution -- one with implications for fighting poverty around the world, including in the United States -- is coming once again from Mexico, this time from the grandchildren of the children of Sanchez. 
 WE DO NOT KNOW exactly where Jesus Sanchez was born, but it was a village in Veracruz and it easily could have been Paso de Coyutla, a village of 134 families in the mountains along the San Marcos River. Until just a decade ago, Paso de Coyutla was one of the most marginalized places in Mexico, a place where men scratched out a living farming ever-more-subdivided, ever-smaller patches of corn, joined by their children who left school too early, robbed of a future by the need to work. There, on a recent trip, I met Irma Solis, 37, and Pedro Hernandez, 43, a couple that has four children. 
 Solis's and Hernandez's grandparents were poor, their parents are poor and they are poor. Hernandez, a stocky man with thick, graying hair and a mustache, raises corn; Solis gathers the husks to sell for wrapping tamales. They live in a pink cement house on a hill in Paso de Coyutla. Early this year, Hernandez had to borrow $1,000 at a crippling 20 percent monthly interest to buy seeds and fertilizer. When I arrived in July, he had just harvested and sold the crop -- but earlier than he would have liked, because he could no longer afford the interest. He made just enough on his corn crop to repay the debt. 
 In Paso de Coyutla, it seemed that the culture of poverty was indeed immutable. Generations after Jesus Sanchez, the lack of interest in education, failure to think about the future, machismo and authoritarianism persisted. There was every reason to think that life would be exactly the same for Solis and Hernandez's four children. 
 But it may not be. Today their oldest daughter, Maleny, who is 17, is finishing high school and wants to be a teacher. Her 13-year-old sister, Maria Fernanda, wants to be a nurse. Two younger brothers also plan to stay in school. Maleny's bus takes up to 20 kids from Paso de Coyutla to her high school every day. ''Around here, kids helped their parents in the fields,'' Solis said. She is solidly built, with a lively intelligence and a ready laugh. ''But now they want to do other things,'' she added, flashing a smile revealing the silver that rims her two front upper teeth. 
 The change did not come gradually. Lewis's description of the culture of poverty probably still fit Paso de Coyutla 10 years ago. It doesn't anymore. The town has transformed itself in the past decade, a result of a deceptively simple government program that is now rewriting poverty-fighting strategies throughout Latin America and around the world. The program is called Oportunidades, and in 1997, Paso de Coyutla became one of the first places in Mexico to enroll. The program gives the poor cash, but unlike traditional welfare programs, it conditions the receipt of that cash on activities designed to break the culture of poverty and keep the poor from transmitting that culture to their children. 
 Until recently, for example, children like Maleny did not go to high school. Though Maleny's school is public, families often prefer not to pay the fees they're assessed or to pay for school supplies, food and transportation. More important, if she were not in school, she, too, could be working in the fields. Such work is especially common among girls, as their education has been widely derided as a waste of money in rural Mexico -- why educate someone who is just going to get married? 
 Now Maleny goes to school because her mother is enrolled in Oportunidades. Solis gets $61 a month from the Mexican government on the condition that Maleny goes and maintains good attendance. (If she worked in the fields and earned a typical salary, she would be paid $7.40 for an eight-hour day.) Such grants start for students in third grade, increase for each year of school and are higher for girls, which gives families added incentive to send them. 
 Solis also receives money for the family's food -- again, subject to certain requirements. She gets a $27-a-month basic food grant if she takes her family to regular preventive health checkups at Paso de Coyutla's clinic, which provides vaccinations, pap smears and the like. She must also attend a monthly workshop on a health topic, like purifying drinking water. In total, the grants the family receives for food and the oldest three children's educations come to almost as much as Hernandez earns farming. 
 I first visited Paso de Coyutla on Oportunidades' payday, which falls every two months. Hundreds of people, mostly women wearing their credentials around their necks, small children clutching their legs, were gathered in the town's open-air hall. The atmosphere was festive. The women stood in long lines to receive their envelopes of cash. Others were working behind banquet tables at the back, showing off embroidery and crafts made by Oportunidades beneficiaries.
 When the program began, under the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, it was called Progresa. Zedillo's successor, Vicente Fox, changed the name. Five million families are enrolled nationwide -- a quarter of the country's households, including virtually every Mexican family at risk for hunger. Seventy-three of the 134 families in Paso de Coyutla are enrolled today. Oportunidades is now the de facto welfare system in Mexico, and it marks the first time modern Mexico has had an effective anti-poverty program.
 The elegant idea behind the program -- give the poor money that will allow them to be less poor today, but condition it on behaviors that will give their children a better start in life -- is called conditional cash transfers, and the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank promote it heavily. At least 30 countries have now adopted Oportunidades, most of them in Latin America, but not all: countries now using or experimenting with some form of conditional payments include Turkey, Cambodia and Bangladesh. Last year, officials from Indonesia, South Africa, Ethiopia and China contacted or visited Mexico to investigate. Perhaps the most startling iteration is in New York City. Opportunity NYC, a pilot program begun last year after Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited Mexico, will test whether the Oportunidades model can help the New York neighborhoods where poverty is passed down from parent to child. Britain has been successfully using a form of conditional cash transfers to keep teenagers in school and is now running pilots to broaden the program to other areas. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is starting a pilot program in several American states to test whether low-income students will stay in college if they get cash payments to do so.
 Conditional cash transfers are a convergence point in two different evolutions in understanding and combating poverty. One is taking place in poor countries, which have long tended to concentrate their social services on building universities and hospitals for the urban middle class -- a group with substantial political clout -- as opposed to primary schools and clinics for the voiceless rural poor. In such countries that are governed by centrists, politicians are starting to help the rural poor because they now know how -- and because the poor, who have not benefited from globalization, have flashed new political muscle by electing leftists elsewhere.
 The situation is different in rich countries. In New York, Mayor Bloomberg has been able to experiment with Opportunity NYC because of a philosophical shift in how Americans think about poverty. Liberals have largely abandoned entitlements -- the so-called nanny state -- that took care of people with welfare and other payments while demanding little or nothing on their part. And most conservatives now acknowledge that government must play a role in fighting poverty. But that role is taking a new form. Lawrence M. Mead, a political-science professor at New York University and a former Republican Congressional staff member, calls it ''the new paternalism.'' The nanny state offered unconditional love; the new paternalism is tough love, directly aimed at smashing the culture of poverty. Paul Starobin, a staff correspondent for The National Journal, has coined the term ''daddy state'' -- government as lifestyle supervisor and enforcer of civic responsibilities. Welfare reform, which imposes work requirements on welfare recipients, is the best-known example.
 Conditional-cash-transfer programs, part of the new paternalism, defy the traditional poverty wisdom on both left and right. But intriguingly, they are postideological in another sense too. Do the poor fall into the culture of poverty for structural reasons, as Lewis contended, or behavioral ones, as Banfield argued? Oportunidades and Opportunity NYC have a novel answer to that question: maybe it doesn't matter.
 In the mid-1990s, Mexico's antipoverty programs were a failure. A third of the population lived in extreme poverty, which meant their income did not even pay for food. Poverty was both more widespread and deeper in rural areas than in cities. Mexico's help for the poor was dispensed mainly in the form of subsidies on milk, tortillas and bread -- a program that was inefficient, badly targeted and corrupt. 
 In 1994, the Mexican peso crashed, and the next year the economy contracted by more than 6 percent. It hit poor people especially hard. President Ernesto Zedillo -- an economics Ph.D. who had run the food-subsidy program (and other social services) as a Treasury official and knew intimately what a mess it was -- asked Santiago Levy, an undersecretary in the Finance Ministry, for new ideas on how to protect the poor. 
 Levy, who had been a professor of economics at Boston University, had long advocated scrapping food subsidies. But the first paper he wrote for President Zedillo, he told me in an interview, also included a new idea that occurred to him -- conditional cash transfers. He had concluded that food subsidies were simply an inefficient way to give money to the poor. So why not just directly give them cash? 
 He presented his arguments to the cabinet. ''They said, 'This is nuts,' '' he said. Some cabinet members warned that there were good reasons that other countries didn't give the poor cash, and worried that it would be misspent, frittered away on alcohol. Others worried about the logistics of reaching remote villages. There were also more politically motivated objections -- some cabinet members realized that their own fiefs were threatened. ''That's when I decided to run a pilot program without telling anybody,'' Levy said. 
 He set up an experiment in two small cities in far-off Campeche State. He found that people preferred getting cash to buying subsidized food and were willing to meet conditions; he also found that it was feasible to distribute cash and that men didn't beat up their wives, take the money and go to the cantina. Armed with his data, he won approval to start the program gradually, beginning in the most marginalized villages, like Paso de Coyutla.
 In part because the program began stealthily, without the usual political bargaining and fanfare, Levy was able to design Oportunidades to resist special-interest pleading and concentrate on the poor. It tries to be comprehensive, tackling health, education and nutrition. It aims at the poorest Mexicans -- and research shows that it is successful. The program used census data to find the poorest rural areas and urban blocks, and within those areas, gave out questionnaires about people's income and possessions: Do you have a dirt or cement floor? Own a hot-water heater? The homes of those who qualified were visited to verify their answers. The criteria apply nationally -- the program allows for no local discretion. Families must be recertified every six years, and according to Salvador Escobedo, Oportunidades' director today, about 10 percent leave each year, either because they have failed to complete their responsibilities or because they are no longer extremely poor.
 Levy also aimed the program at the group that will spend money on the family: women. Surveys show that 70 percent of Oportunidades' payment is spent on food -- mostly fruit, vegetables and meat. Much of the rest goes to kids' shoes and clothing and home improvements. The program is also designed to combat the typical afflictions of Latin American social programs. Local political leaders have no influence and so cannot use the payments to extort political support. Oportunidades staff members do not handle money -- local banks hand out the envelopes of cash, and recipients are encouraged to open bank accounts to receive direct transfers.
 Oportunidades is now one of the most-studied social programs on the planet. The program has its own research unit and publishes all the data it generates. In addition, a wide variety of the program's features have been examined in hundreds of surveys and papers by independent academics. The results are put to work. When research showed, for example, that many children receiving a nutritional supplement still had anemia, the supplement was changed to one with a more absorbable form of iron. 
 Levy paid for the program in a time of economic crisis by phasing out the general food subsidies. But since Oportunidades has virtually no infrastructure, it is still relatively cheap, costing Mexico about $3.8 billion annually. Escobedo boasts that 97 percent of the budget goes directly to beneficiaries. 
 The program does have its problems. For one thing, Oportunidades lacks the impact in urban areas that it has in the countryside. This may be because it is newer in cities, and the supply of schools and clinics lags behind the increased demand. Even in the countryside, I met with some students who had classes with as many as 42 children, and I saw some clinics with half-day waits for appointments.
 The most widespread criticism of the program's design I heard, from academics who study the program and from Oportunidades staff, is that it should attach more conditions to the handing out of money. These observers say that student achievement, not just attendance, should be rewarded. Oportunidades is now running a pilot program for this, but figuring it out is complicated by the fact that school quality in Mexico varies widely, and in rural zones it is largely awful. An initial study focusing on school achievement found that Oportunidades didn't have much impact on test scores. But the study had some flaws, and the topic needs further research. 
 Yet in general, Oportunidades is, in many respects, an astonishing success. Though it is still too early to know its impact on the adult life of the children who have grown up in the program, the poverty indicators speak to the effects of Oportunidades today. In 1994, before the peso crisis, 21.2 percent of Mexicans lived in extreme poverty. In 1996, just after the crash, 37.4 percent did. But that figure had dropped to 13.8 percent by 2006. Mexico's economic growth during the decade averaged an unspectacular 3 percent, which would not by itself have produced such gains for the poor. And these statistics underestimate the program's true influence, as its greatest effects were concentrated on the very poorest.
 In Mexico today, rates of malnutrition, anemia and stunting have dropped, as have incidences of childhood and adult illnesses. But the most pronounced effects are in education. Children in the program drop out less frequently, repeat fewer grades and stay in school longer. In some rural areas, the percentage of children entering middle school has risen by 42 percent. High-school enrollment in some rural areas has risen by 85 percent. The greatest gains were found in families where the mothers had the lowest levels of schooling. 
 During my visit to Mexico, I met family after family with distinct before-and-after stories. In the village of Tajin, Veracruz, I met a young mother named Minerva Santes Hernandez. We talked on her spotless patio (several of the health workshops have dealt with household sanitation) while her three children, ages 6, 5 and 2, climbed on and off her lap. She entered the program when her two oldest were toddlers. ''When we came into the program we found that they were undernourished,'' she told me. ''I took them for weighings every month. The clinic gave me cereal and vitamins and told me to make them fruits and vegetables.'' The two older kids are fine now -- the girl is quite tall. The 2-year-old was born into Oportunidades and has never had a problem, Santes said. 
 Before Oportunidades started, a major objection was that it could increase domestic violence. Poor, rural Mexicans are machista -- and it's easy to imagine that they'd be provoked by Oportunidades, which requires women to leave the house to attend workshops, get their money and go to the clinic. Some of the workshops are about women's rights or about self-esteem. Women also get their own money and control how it is spent. 
 Among the most macho was Solis's own husband. ''He was very angry in the beginning of the program,'' Solis said. ''He'd come pull me out of a meeting, yelling: 'Your child fell down and hurt himself! See what happens when you abandon your house!' ''
 Pedro Hernandez cheerfully pleaded guilty. ''I didn't accept it at first,'' he said. ''If the clothes were hanging on the line and it started to rain, I wouldn't take them down -- I'd go pull her out of a workshop. Or I'd complain my food was cold. I didn't want to heat it up myself.'' 
 I asked if he knew how. He smiled. ''Now I even know how to cook,'' he said.
 What changed him was a burst appendix two years ago. Because of Oportunidades, the family received priority at a public hospital, where the operation cost $100, not the $3,000 the private hospital wanted. ''I realized that it helps,'' he said. ''We have food, shoes, school supplies, the kids have education. We have fewer problems.'' 
 Researchers on Oportunidades have not turned up much evidence that it has increased domestic violence, but they acknowledge that problem is often hidden. In the days before Oportunidades, ''rights were only for men,'' said Reyna Luisa Olmedo Vasquez, the nurse at Paso de Coyutla's clinic. ''So when that began to change, we began to see more mistreatment of women.'' One woman, she recalled, was beaten by her husband for letting a male doctor do a breast examination. But in Paso de Coyutla, it seemed, the men eventually accepted that the world had changed. After about five years, violence began to diminish, Olmedo Vasquez said, and now there is less than before the program started -- an assessment echoed by doctors I met in other villages. 
 OPORTUNIDADE'S SUCCESS has begun to echo in some unlikely places. In 2006, Mayor Bloomberg convened a 32-member group called the Commission on Economic Opportunity, charged with finding new ways to help poor New Yorkers. Oportunidades was discussed. ''But there was enormous skepticism,'' says Veronica White, the executive director of the Center for Economic Opportunity, which was established to carry out the group's recommendations. Linda Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, says that the members preferred to stick with the idea of caseworkers helping poor families. The group's report did not recommend an Oportunidades spinoff for New York City. But in his response to the report, the mayor did. A pilot program began in September 2007, financed by private donors, including Bloomberg himself. 
 The study enrolled nearly 5,000 families in six consistently poor community districts in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan, 80 percent of which are single-parent families, the vast majority of which are headed by women. Half are in a control group and the other half get payments -- for example, $25 for attending a parent-teacher conference or discussing test results with teachers. They get $25 per month if an elementary- or middle-school child maintains 95 percent attendance; for high-school students, the rate is $50 a month. (In the case of high-school students, rewards for attendance, accumulating credits and graduating go in part to the student.) Beneficiaries receive $150 monthly for holding down a full-time job -- more for taking courses while employed. Participants receive their money after returning coupons signed by their doctors and sometimes their teachers. A family that completes all the requirements can make more than $4,000 per year. 
 It is too early to know if poor New Yorkers respond to payments as readily as poor Mexicans do; the first evaluation, carried out by the social-science research group MDRC, won't be out for a few months. Gordon Berlin, the president of MDRC (which also designed the pilot), says that precedents exist. He cites programs in Wisconsin, Minnesota and two provinces of Canada that gave the poor extra money for working. All brought increases in work and earnings as well as benefits to the schooling of the participants' young children. 
 If Chandra Hannah is any indication, many New Yorkers will respond. Hannah is a 41-year-old black woman with six children, ranging from infant twins to a 22-year-old son, living in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. When I met her in August, she had just finished her bachelor's degree and was preparing to start a master's, hoping to open her own early-childhood special-education center in the neighborhood. But she said Opportunity had led her to become far more involved with her own children's health and education. ''I talk to their teachers more,'' she said. ''Now I go to conferences all the time. I didn't know about the tests they took before. I mean, I knew about them, but I never really looked.'' She went to a workshop at school for parents on how to help and motivate their children. ''Now I spend an hour with my 11-year-old when he comes home from school on his homework,'' she said. ''With the twins, we'll read to them -- I'll read one paragraph and then he'll read a paragraph.'' 
 Jose Gonzalez, an enrollment and outreach worker at Urban Health Plan, which administers the pilot program in the Bronx, told me: ''Once they find out they're getting paid, their children's attendance in school gets a lot better. Getting them to stay current on health insurance is probably the hardest task. The yearly medical checkup is done most often. That's $200 right there.'' 
 But there were a few people enrolled in the pilot program in East New York who hadn't yet even picked up their coupon books, said Candice Perkins, who coordinates East New York's pilot program from the storefront office of Groundwork, a social-service agency. Hannah and Perkins sat in Groundwork's small conference room and dissected the neighborhood's low test scores and high drop-out rates. Perkins said that as part of her duties for Groundwork, she gives talks on the importance of sending kids to school and of being involved with their teachers and counselors. ''But sometimes people say, 'I'm too tired to send them to school.' Or the child has asthma -- and misses 13 or 14 days.'' Perkins was a young and earnest black woman, dressed to kill with glitter makeup at 10 a.m. She was frustrated with people's lack of interest in the job banks and training programs offered to help them. ''We get less than 5 percent attendance at workshops,'' she said. ''Some people, their mind-set is dependence, and to go that extra mile to get resources is hard.'' 
 For conservative critics of Opportunity, this disconnect is crucial. Heather Mac Donald, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, has written articles on the program that echo Perkins's complaint: ''Talk to any inner-city teacher,'' Mac Donald wrote in The Weekly Standard, ''and you will hear how difficult it is to get parents involved in their child's education, or students to bother with homework. Countless schemes for tutoring and job training sit on the shelves unused because the 'clients' never show up.'' 
 ''If Opportunity NYC goes large scale,'' Mac Donald told me in an interview, ''it will further break down the moral obligation to care for one's child and adopt the repertoire of parenting behaviors the middle class takes for granted. It will replace that with the expectation that I'm only going to do it if you pay me.'' She cites Banfield that living in the present is the central cause of poverty and echoes his skepticism that government can help. ''What government cannot do is create personal responsibility and drive in individuals,'' Mac Donald has written. 
 But government can change toxic cultures. If the women of Paso de Coyutla are not yet wearing the pants, as Pedro Hernandez nervously jokes they are, they certainly describe themselves as different people than they were 10 years ago. In large part, they've come to believe in their own capacity to take care of their families; they believe they are part of a group; they organize to improve the village; they invest all they can in their children's futures. Change is usually generational, produced by education. But it came astoundingly quickly in many parts of Mexico. 
 Opportunity NYC will not be able to help those parents too apathetic to pick up their coupon books. But those parents are just a small handful. As for the rest, one of the most tantalizing lessons of the program is that the answer to why Mom skips the parent-teacher conferences may not matter. 
 This is the symbolic controversy of the poverty debate. Are these absentee moms just too busy working two jobs, overwhelmed with the problems of being poor? Opportunity NYC will probably help them. Or have they just not bothered? It may help them too. ''There is no inherent contradiction in saying this problem is caused by something other than lack of money and saying that money is the incentive to fix it,'' Levy says. ''That's Economics 101. But you have to evaluate it.'' 
 Linda Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, agreed. ''We know that education and health as children are key to getting out of poverty as adults,'' she said. ''You can have an endless, circular debate about why people don't do things. This program is less focused on the why and more focused on whether a different approach can have an impact in a way traditional approaches have not.''
 Education and health, however, will take you only so far. Suppose Opportunity NYC succeeds. The likelihood is that these families will still be poor. One in three jobs in America pays less than $11.11 an hour, with no benefits. Full time, that's less than $23,000 a year.
 Mexico has it even worse. Anyone reading Oportunidades' reviews might reasonably ask: so why is there still so much misery? One reason is that the payments, helpful as they are, are still heartbreakingly small. Emma Pasaran in the town of Venustiano Carranza in Puebla, told me that one of the benefits of the program is that ''I am never without money. If my daughter says, 'Mom, I need a pencil,' I can say to her, 'Here's the money.' '' She mimes taking a coin out of her purse, a proud smile on her face. 
 In the same town, I talked to Elia Valderrama Vargas, a mother of three, in her dirt-floor house, about the jobs that will be open to her soon-to-be-educated children. ''My husband cuts weeds with a machete,'' she told me. ''My children will be able to work in a tortilla factory because they'll know how to cobrar'' -- how to add purchases and give change. For Pasaran, buying a pencil on a whim was the fulfillment of a dream; for Valderrama, it was seeing her children in indoor work.
 It is not enough -- Oportunidades is only an antipoverty program, just one part of a solution, when what is needed is a whole strategy. Few good jobs await even educated young Mexicans. This is Levy's latest crusade -- to get Mexico to channel poor people into productive jobs in Mexico's legal labor market. ''Creating formal-sector jobs is Mexico's central challenge,'' Levy said. Without that, he added, ''it is as if Oportunidades were financing an improved labor force for the United States.'' But if Mexico can find a way to create better jobs, it will have access to a work force that, because of Oportunidades, has acquired more of the good health and education necessary to take advantage of them.

HEADLINE: Other Voices: When Labels Carry Moral Weight

 BODY:
Re ''Separating the Terror and the Terrorists'' (Dec. 14):
 I write as the father of Alisa Flatow, who was murdered by Islamic Jihad in April 1995.
 While I appreciate your approach to the use of ''T-words'' for a situation that ''shocks the conscience,'' it is, because of its subjective nature, nothing more than a small step, albeit in the right direction. 
 The general refusal of The New York Times and its writers and editors to recognize that people who intentionally target and murder civilians, whether on a bus in Gaza or in a hotel in Mumbai, are attempting to alter a political situation (the classic definition of terrorism) and are therefore terrorists defies logic.
 STEPHEN M. FLATOW West Orange, N.J., Dec. 15, 2008 
 I write as a long-retired C.I.A. station chief and chief of the counterterrorism staff. I served abroad in East and West Europe and the Middle East over a 25-year career. 
 Some insurgents commit terrorist acts (Chechnya) and some terrorists run hospitals (Hamas). It is a confusing landscape, but the fact remains that differentiating accurately between terrorists and insurgents is extremely important. The label you give any person, act or program will determine who signs on to your program to deal with it and, more important, the tactics you will use to counter it. 
 The wrong label is likely to produce the wrong tactics and ultimately produce unintended negative consequences, as in Afghanistan and Iraq.
 The answer to this conundrum may well lie in labeling acts, rather than people.
 HAVILAND SMITH Williston, Vt., Dec. 14, 2008
 You reiterate The Times's policy of ''not rushing to label any group with the word terrorist before we have a deeper understanding of its full dimensions.'' Therefore The Times may eventually put the terrorist label on Lashkar-e-Taiba, the group that apparently orchestrated the Mumbai attacks, ''but reporters are still trying to learn more about it.'' 
 The fact is that Lashkar, and its leader, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, were officially designated years ago as ''global terrorists'' by the United States, Interpol and the Security Council of the United Nations. So what ''deeper understanding'' is The Times waiting for?
 Unfortunately, you confirm an emotional accusation many Indian friends have made to me that the American media reserve the label terrorist exclusively for terrorism committed against America or Israel. 
 AMIT SARKAR Scarsdale, N.Y., Dec. 14, 2008
 Does your ''broad guideline'' -- ''if it looks as if it was intended to sow terror and it shocks the conscience'' -- include the acts of Israelis, which often fit that definition? I'm sure you remember the thousand-pound bomb that Israel dropped on a populated apartment in the Gaza Strip, or the cluster bombs in Lebanon, or the phosphorus bombs used in Lebanon. 
 If you have a nice workable definition of terrorism and terrorists, apply it equally and fairly if you have the intellectual honesty. 
 M. HAMUD El Monte, Calif., Dec. 14, 2008
 Choice of terminology is a moral statement. If morally neutral terminology is used for morally repugnant acts, it reduces the sense of repugnance. And when the same terminology is used for a moral and immoral act, a moral equivalence is created.
 The Times and other news media influence the morals of our society. Do you want readers to believe that a terrorist deliberately killing civilians in a coffee shop is morally equivalent to, for example, American soldiers attacking the Nazis to end a world war, who certainly killed some civilians accidentally? 
 If society is conditioned by the media to treat moral and immoral actions as equivalent regardless of intent, context and goal, the media will have failed, and society will pay the price.

 The Rich and the Famous
 Re ''The Privileged and Their Children'' (Dec. 7): I was surprised to read about angry readers who didn't like the pictures that stressed the advantages of the ''rich'' mother who is renting a uterus from the ''poor'' mother. Would different pictures convince anyone that the opposite could be true: a rich woman might rent out her womb to a stranger? 
 Why didn't Alex Kuczynski, who wrote the article in The Times Magazine, acknowledge that this is at least a hard question to answer? Why didn't she probe Cathy Hilling's statement that she didn't become a surrogate mother for the money? And why wasn't there any follow-up on the interesting fact that Ms. Hilling's daughter sold her eggs to pay for college tuition? This seems like a family economic strategy in hard times. 
 (My family has a large burden from one daughter's college tuition, but we quashed the idea immediately when she brought up the possibility of selling her premium eggs.)
 JOYCE LESLIE Piscataway, N.J., Dec. 8, 2008
 You say of the front-page article on Angelina Jolie, ''The Times covers war, recession, politics, science and more with a great thoroughness, and a change of pace is refreshing.'' 
 No, it is not refreshing. It is pandering and bad judgment. If you feel this is an interesting topic, it belongs in the arts section, not on the front page.
 I was disturbed to read that the article's veracity is in question. Why would such an article belong on the front page?
 This reminds me of The Times's fleeting mention of allegations of a John McCain affair, which apparently was also unproved. 
 If The Times is going to print rumor-mongering as fact, shouldn't it say up front that this is a rumor, based on well-appointed sources who are not willing to come forth?
 AURORA MAKO Mendham, N.J., Dec. 7, 2008
 The Need for a Debate
 Re ''Expert Opinions, From Neutral Observers'' (Nov. 30):
 The Times's business columnists are filling in a huge gap in the public's understanding of the economic crisis. As much as I admire Joe Nocera, I was totally in Andrew Ross Sorkin's camp on the issue of the automakers. But when I saw Mr. Nocera's conclusion, I paused to consider the issue further.
 So I encourage you to rethink your conclusion that business columnists should be primarily analytic. I get your concerns over the blurring of the lines by writers who report as well as opine, but The Times needs its writers to actively debate these issues in the paper's pages and, yes, provide a point of view clearly identified as such.
 I believe the present crisis is a war between those seeking to ensure the prudent and responsible functioning of our economy and the interests of those who have taken much and added little, leaving scorched earth in their wake. 
 Don't discourage the business writers from reaching conclusions on where things went wrong, who the bad guys were and how to prevent this from happening in the future.

HEADLINE: Coming Home to Roost Dec.14-20

 BODY:
THE NEWS Officials at the Interior Department frequently interfered with scientific work in order to give endangered species as little protection as possible, according to a report by the department's inspector general. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS In examining 20 policy decisions about endangered species, the report cited serious flaws in the way the department reached 15 of them, and suggested that the new administration reconsider them. Most involved Julie A. McDonald, who was a senior official in the department until May 2007. Her ''zeal to advance her agenda'' did ''considerable harm'' both to the species and the department's integrity, morale and reputation, the report concluded. 
 THE NEWS The Securities and Exchange Commission said that it had missed repeated opportunities to uncover what was apparently an immense financial fraud -- a Ponzi scheme run by Bernard L. Madoff with losses that could run as high as $50 billion.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The commission said it would investigate how and why it had failed to follow up on credible indications of wrongdoing at the Madoff firm, some dating back to 1999, and would also look into whether staff contacts with the Madoff family and firm played any role. A lawyer who led compliance investigations at the commission left in 2006 and married a niece of Mr. Madoff the following year. 
 THE NEWS Credit Suisse, a leading banking and brokerage house, said that instead of all-cash bonuses for its executives and traders this year, they would be paid partly with the ''toxic'' assets on the bank's books -- the troubled mortgage-backed securities and other instruments whose collapse in value has driven the financial crisis. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The investment banks that once reported huge profits and paid huge bonuses based on those securities are now getting bailout money from the Treasury because of huge losses on them. Top executives at many large banks have said they would take no bonus at all this year and would cut back those for subordinates.
 THE NEWSBlackwater Worldwide, the security contractor protecting American diplomats in Iraq, ''faces a real possibility'' of being denied a license by the Iraqi government and being banned there, the State Department's inspector general warned.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The company's role and its methods have been controversial for years. Five of its guards were indicted in the United States this month in connection with a 2007 shooting in Baghdad that left at least 17 Iraqis dead. Officials said Blackwater's services would be hard to replace, especially if, as many expect, American contractors lose their immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law.
 THE NEWS The White House approved giving $17.4 billion in federal bridge loans to General Motors and Chrysler, saying that letting either company fall into bankruptcy now would be too disruptive to the economy.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The announcement came a week after Senate Republicans blocked an automaker bailout that had been negotiated by the White House and Democrats. To get the loans, the companies must by March 31 agree to limit executive pay, sell their corporate jets, negotiate deep cuts in labor costs and make other sweeping changes to return to financial health and be able to repay the Treasury. Otherwise, they face bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Condos Flood In; Hipness Stays Afloat

BYLINE: By JEFF VANDAM

 BODY:
WHERE is the Northside Williamsburg of lore? 
 Various institutions in North Brooklyn's eccentric waterfront neighborhood are disappearing -- even some of the recent additions to an enclave that once housed the borough's industrial giants. Galapagos Art Space of North Sixth Street, where a discussion over beers could be interrupted at any time by an impromptu burlesque show, has shuffled off to Dumbo. 
 And the wrinkled newspapers and Tolstoy turkey sandwiches for the literary-minded at Read Cafe on Bedford Avenue -- they, too, are out of the picture. 
 Instead, the Northside neighborhood has firmly entered the Age of the Condo. Rising with efficiency, even in the sad reality of this economy, apartment buildings cluster in bunches, outfitted with the kind of luxury furnishings one would never find inside the neighboring vinyl-covered row houses. 
 The Sub-Zero refrigerator/granite countertop crowd has opened a front among the young and hip, and the result is friction.
 ''I think it's a shame that Northside is no longer the quaint artists' neighborhood that I first met,'' said A. C. Berkheiser, a 30-year-old creative director who recently moved back to Williamsburg after a year in the East Village, only to find that things had changed.
 In part, the culprit is the city's zoning code, amended in 2005 to allow buildings of up to six stories on inland streets but many more floors on the waterfront, provided that some low- and middle-income apartments are made available. The enthusiastic response from developers is evident in the constant din of drilling, hammering and shouting from workers perched on metal beams above the streets. 
 The waterfront's two new tower complexes -- Northside Piers and the Edge -- are well under way, with many residents already moved in. Lower-scale developments have welcomed new faces as well, and some of them see the neighborhood as having held onto its pleasing imperfections.
 ''There's still that raw appeal,'' said Silvia Fuster, 34, an architect who moved with her husband and baby daughter, Clara, into a $741,000 1,000-square-foot loft on North Third Street this fall. ''Anyone who lived in Williamsburg 5 or 10 years ago probably thinks it's a joke for me to even say that. But it has that raw depth to it. It's not all touched up.'' 
 The rawness and youthfulness of the neighborhood have not entirely disappeared. Stroller pushers are now mixed in with those in tight black jeans among the hordes of Bedford Avenue, but the record shops, art spaces and bars serving frozen margaritas in Styrofoam cups still flourish.
 ''I'd rather be in this stage of it,'' said Natalie Vogel, 32, a lawyer who moved into a $400,000 one-bedroom condominium in Northside Piers in October, ''rather than five years from now when everything is done, when it'll turn into Prince Street in SoHo, with Michael Kors, and Dean & DeLuca with the $7 coffee.''
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 Despite the presence of a building called the Edge, Northside Williamsburg left edginess behind some time ago. Yet in its northernmost reaches, forklifts still buzz around boxy warehouses and factories, many of which seem to produce plastic bags.
 Signs of irony-inspired hipness surface on North 12th Street with the Gutter, a year-old eight-lane bowling alley with beer logo lampshades. North 12th is also where signs of demolition and construction emerge. There, yellow crane arms begin to stretch over lots separated from the sidewalk by plywood and rows of laminated permits from the Department of Buildings.
 A recent general rule in Northside is that the number of new developments multiplies as the street numbers go lower. At Berry and North 10th Streets, three of the four corners have new construction projects, while just down North 10th another project describes itself as ''Williamsburg's first green rental building.'' Some lots have half-finished structures, seemingly abandoned; others are full of workers rushing around at a frenetic pace.
 Despite the loss of some of its standbys, Bedford Avenue retains the paradelike flow of humanity to and from the L train station at North Seventh Street. Stores like the Bedford Cheese Shop and Spoonbill & Sugartown Booksellers benefit from the heavy foot traffic, though nearby residents may not. 
 ''Doing normal weekend errands is a sort of surreal experience,'' said James Gaddy, a magazine editor who lives on North Ninth Street. ''It's really weird to drop my laundry off and have to fight through the crowds.''
 On the waterfront, Manhattan has arrived, or at least a high-rise facsimile. The Edge and Northside Piers towers ascend, similar in scale though not in surroundings to their neighbors in Long Island City, Queens.
 While the buildings in the two areas are comparable, said Ms. Vogel, the new Northside Piers resident, ''I just think Long Island City is a great investment for someone who has some time to wait. Long Island City needs another eight years, I'd say. Williamsburg is there.''
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 According to third-quarter figures from the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, the transaction volume in North Brooklyn, which includes North Williamsburg, was down 20.7 percent from last year (though transactions in Brooklyn as a whole were down 38.2 percent). An unusually high 83.2 percent of sales were condominiums, indicating an outsized number of new units.
 ''Some of those, unfortunately, are entering the market as the general environment is weakening,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the firm's president and chief executive. ''And that's going to place downward pressure on price levels.''
 Thus far, however, prices for new construction have remained at $700 to $850 a square foot, said Tom Le, a vice president at the Corcoran Group. 
 But discounts are popping up. At 80 Metropolitan, a 114-unit condo loft building with nine town houses on North First Street, the average price per square foot is $837, and separate rooftop cabanas start at $75,000. But the building has begun to shave those prices by up to $50,000 when people buy a condo and cabana together. 
 Closing costs, too, have become ''flexible,'' said Jay K. Overbye, a Halstead broker managing sales for the building. And the development is implementing price protection, meaning buyers already in contract will be compensated if units in their vertical line sell for less than they paid.
 ''You need to ask questions,'' said Sarah Burke, a senior vice president at the Developers Group, offering advice to buyers looking to negotiate. '' 'How sold are you? How many units are in contract? How many contracts are out?' If they're at 40 percent sold now, and they need to get to 50 percent, they're going to need those next two deals.''
 Town houses pop up occasionally, many costing less than new two-bedroom condos (though perhaps not in impeccable condition). Three-story houses start in the $900,000 range, said Linda Williams, an agent at Kline Realty. 
 Rentals are widely available, Ms. Williams said. Large one-bedrooms rent for around $2,500 a month, two-bedrooms for about $3,000, though bargain hunters may find better deals on Craigslist. 
 WHAT TO DO
 To the north, McCarren Pool in McCarren Park is undergoing a $50 million renovation, so the summer parties featuring bands like the Walkmen and Ghostland Observatory will move elsewhere, possibly to one of Williamsburg's waterfront parks. One of those, the expansive East River State Park at North Eighth Street and Kent Avenue, offers wide views of Manhattan. 
 THE SCHOOLS
 On last year's progress report for Public School 17, on North Fifth Street, 62.5 percent of fourth graders were proficient in English, 90.6 percent in math, versus 61.3 and 79.7 percent citywide. Those numbers earned the school an A. 
 At Conselyea Preparatory School, a junior high on North Fifth Street, 78.4 percent of eighth graders were proficient in math and 59.2 percent in English; the citywide scores were 59.6 and 43. Conselyea, too, got an A.
 SAT averages at Automotive High School on Bedford Avenue were 394 in math, 399 in reading and 371 in writing, versus 503, 488 and 475 statewide. 
 THE COMMUTE
 Getting to Manhattan is a quick trip via the L train station at Bedford Avenue and North Seventh; the next westbound stop is at First Avenue and 14th Street. It's not uncommon for rush-hour travelers to let a train or two go by before finding one with space to stand in. 
 THE HISTORY
 Even in an age before hipsters, Williamsburg was seen as valuable for its proximity to Manhattan; a ferry entrepreneur bought land here in 1792 and named it after a surveyor named Jonathan Williams. The business failed, but the area soon attracted rich immigrants who built breweries and other businesses; traffic grew even more once the Williamsburg Bridge opened in 1903.

HEADLINE: Where Bribery Was Just a Line Item

BYLINE: By SIRI SCHUBERT and T. CHRISTIAN MILLER

DATELINE: MUNICH 

 BODY:
 REINHARD SIEKACZEK was half asleep in bed when his doorbell rang here early one morning two years ago. 
 Still in his pajamas, he peeked out his bedroom window, hurried downstairs and flung open the front door. Standing before him in the cool, crisp dark were six German police officers and a prosecutor. They held a warrant for his arrest. 
 At that moment, Mr. Siekaczek, a stout, graying former accountant for Siemens A.G., the German engineering giant, knew that his secret life had ended. 
 ''I know what this is about,'' Mr. Siekaczek told the officers crowded around his door. ''I have been expecting you.'' 
 To understand how Siemens, one of the world's biggest companies, last week ended up paying $1.6 billion in the largest fine for bribery in modern corporate history, it's worth delving into Mr. Siekaczek's unusual journey. 
 A former midlevel executive at Siemens, he was one of several people who arranged a torrent of payments that eventually streamed to well-placed officials around the globe, from Vietnam to Venezuela and from Italy to Israel, according to interviews with Mr. Siekaczek and court records in Germany and the United States.
 What is striking about Mr. Siekaczek's and prosecutors' accounts of those dealings, which flowed through a web of secret bank accounts and shadowy consultants, is how entrenched corruption had become at a sprawling, sophisticated corporation that externally embraced the nostrums of a transparent global marketplace built on legitimate transactions. 
 Mr. Siekaczek (pronounced SEE-kah-chek) says that from 2002 to 2006 he oversaw an annual bribery budget of about $40 million to $50 million at Siemens. Company managers and sales staff used the slush fund to cozy up to corrupt government officials worldwide.
 The payments, he says, were vital to maintaining the competitiveness of Siemens overseas, particularly in his subsidiary, which sold telecommunications equipment. ''It was about keeping the business unit alive and not jeopardizing thousands of jobs overnight,'' he said in an interview.
 Siemens is hardly the only corporate giant caught in prosecutors' cross hairs. 
 Three decades after Congress passed a law barring American companies from paying bribes to secure foreign business, law enforcement authorities around the world are bearing down on major enterprises like Daimler and Johnson & Johnson, with scores of cases now under investigation. Both companies declined comment, citing continuing investigations.
 Albert J. Stanley, a legendary figure in the oil patch and the former chief executive of the KBR subsidiary of Halliburton, recently pleaded guilty to charges of paying bribes and skimming millions for himself. More charges are coming in that case, officials say. 
 But the Siemens case is notable for its breadth, the sums of money involved, and the raw organizational zeal with which the company deployed bribes to secure contracts. It is also a model of something that was once extremely rare: cross-border cooperation among law enforcement officials.
 German prosecutors initially opened the Siemens case in 2005. American authorities became involved in 2006 because the company's shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 In its settlement last week with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Siemens pleaded guilty to violating accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which outlaws bribery abroad. 
 Although court documents are salted throughout with the word ''bribes,'' the Justice Department allowed Siemens to plead to accounting violations because it cooperated with the investigation and because pleading to bribery violations would have barred Siemens from bidding on government contracts in the United States. Siemens doesn't dispute the government's account of its actions. 
 Matthew W. Friedrich, the acting chief of the Justice Department's criminal division, called corruption at Siemens ''systematic and widespread.'' Linda C. Thomsen, the S.E.C.'s enforcement director, said it was ''egregious and brazen.'' Joseph Persichini Jr., the director of the F.B.I.'s Washington field office, which led the investigation, called it ''massive, willful and carefully orchestrated.''
 MR. SIEKACZEK'S telecommunications unit was awash in easy money. It paid $5 million in bribes to win a mobile phone contract in Bangladesh, to the son of the prime minister at the time and other senior officials, according to court documents. Mr. Siekaczek's group also made $12.7 million in payments to senior officials in Nigeria for government contracts.
 In Argentina, a different Siemens subsidiary paid at least $40 million in bribes to win a $1 billion contract to produce national identity cards. In Israel, the company provided $20 million to senior government officials to build power plants. In Venezuela, it was $16 million for urban rail lines. In China, $14 million for medical equipment. And in Iraq, $1.7 million to Saddam Hussein and his cronies. 
 The bribes left behind angry competitors who were shut out of contracts and local residents in poor countries who, because of rigged deals, paid too much for necessities like roads, power plants and hospitals, prosecutors said. 
 Because government contracting is an opaque process and losers don't typically file formal protests, it's difficult to know the identity of competitors who lost out to Siemens. Companies in the United States have long complained, however, that they face an uneven playing field competing overseas. 
 Ben W. Heineman Jr., a former general counsel at General Electric and a member of the American chapter of Transparency International, a nonprofit group that tracks corruption, says the enforcement of some antibribery conventions still remains scattershot. ''Until you have energetic enforcement by the developed-world nations, you won't get strong antibribery programs or high-integrity corporate culture,'' he said.
 Afghanistan, Haiti, Iraq, Myanmar and Somalia are the five countries where corporate bribery is most common, according to Transparency International. The S.E.C. complaint said Siemens paid its heftiest bribes in China, Russia, Argentina, Israel and Venezuela.
 ''Crimes of official corruption threaten the integrity of the global marketplace and undermine the rule of law in the host countries,'' said Lori Weinstein, the Justice Department prosecutor who oversaw the Siemens case.
 All told, Siemens will pay more than $2.6 billion to clear its name: $1.6 billion in fines and fees in Germany and the United States and more than $1 billion for internal investigations and reforms.
 Siemens's general counsel, Peter Y. Solmssen, in an interview outside a marble-lined courtroom in Washington, said the company acknowledged that bribes were at the heart of the case. ''This is the end of a difficult chapter in the company's history,'' he said. ''We're glad to get it behind us.''
 Mr. Siekaczek, who cooperated with German authorities after his arrest in 2006, has already been sentenced in Germany to two years' probation and a $150,000 fine. During a lengthy interview in Munich, a few blocks from the Siemens world headquarters, he provided an insider's account of corruption at the company. The interview was his first with English-language news outlets.
 ''I would never have thought I'd go to jail for my company,'' Mr. Siekaczek said. ''Sure, we joked about it, but we thought if our actions ever came to light, we'd all go together and there would be enough people to play a game of cards.''
 Mr. Siekaczek isn't a stereotype of a white-collar villain. There are no Ferraris in his driveway, or villas in Monaco. He dresses in jeans, loafers and leather jackets. With white hair and gold-rimmed glasses, he passes for a kindly grandfather -- albeit one who can discuss the advantages of offshore bank accounts as easily as last night's soccer match.
 SIEMENS began bribing long before Mr. Siekaczek applied his accounting skills to the task of organizing the payments.
 World War II left the company shattered, its factories bombed and its trademark patents confiscated, according to American prosecutors. The company turned to markets in less developed countries to compete, and bribery became a reliable and ubiquitous sales technique.
 ''Bribery was Siemens's business model,'' said Uwe Dolata, the spokesman for the association of federal criminal investigators in Germany. ''Siemens had institutionalized corruption.'' 
 Before 1999, bribes were deductible as business expenses under the German tax code, and paying off a foreign official was not a criminal offense. In such an environment, Siemens officials subscribed to a straightforward rule in pursuing business abroad, according to one former executive. They played by local rules. 
 Inside Siemens, bribes were referred to as ''NA'' -- a German abbreviation for the phrase ''nutzliche Aufwendungen'' which means ''useful money.'' Siemens bribed wherever executives felt the money was needed, paying off officials not only in countries known for government corruption, like Nigeria, but also in countries with reputations for transparency, like Norway, according to court records.
 In February 1999, Germany joined the international convention banning foreign bribery, a pact signed by most of the world's industrial nations. By 2000, authorities in Austria and Switzerland were suspicious of millions of dollars of Siemens payments flowing to offshore bank accounts, according to court records. 
 Rather than comply with the law, Siemens managers created a ''paper program,'' a toothless internal system that did little to punish wrongdoers, according to court documents. 
 Mr. Siekaczek's business unit was one of the most egregious offenders. Court documents show that the telecommunications unit paid more than $800 million of the $1.4 billion in illegal payments that Siemens made from 2001 to 2007. Managers in the telecommunications group decided to deal with the possibility of a crackdown by making its bribery procedures more difficult to detect.
 So, on one winter evening in late 2002, five executives from the telecommunications group met for dinner at a traditional Bavarian restaurant in a Munich suburb. Surrounded by dark wood panels and posters celebrating German engineering, the group discussed how to better disguise its payments, while making sure that employees didn't pocket the money, Mr. Siekaczek said. 
 To handle the business side of bribery, the executives turned to Mr. Siekaczek, a man renowned within the company for his personal honesty, his deep company loyalty -- and his experiences in the shadowy world of illegal bribery.
 ''It had nothing to do with being law-abiding, because we all knew what we did was unlawful.'' Mr. Siekaczek said. ''What mattered here was that the person put in charge was stable and wouldn't go astray.''
 Although Mr. Siekaczek was reluctant to take the job offered that night, he justified it as economic necessity. If Siemens didn't pay bribes, it would lose contracts and its employees might lose their jobs. 
 ''We thought we had to do it,'' Mr. Siekaczek said. ''Otherwise, we'd ruin the company.''
 Indeed, he considers his personal probity a point of honor. He describes himself as ''the man in the middle,'' ''the banker'' or, with tongue in cheek, ''the master of disaster.'' But, he said, he never set up a bribe. Nor did he directly hand over money to a corrupt official. 
 German prosecutors say they have no evidence that he personally enriched himself, though German documents show that Mr. Siekaczek oversaw the transfer of some $65 million through hard-to-trace offshore bank accounts.
 ''I was not the man responsible for bribery,'' he said. ''I organized the cash.''
 Mr. Siekaczek set things in motion by moving money out of accounts in Austria to Liechtenstein and Switzerland, where bank secrecy laws provided greater cover and anonymity. He said he also reached out to a trustee in Switzerland who set up front companies to conceal money trails from Siemens to offshore bank accounts in Dubai and the British Virgin Islands.
 Each year, Mr. Siekaczek said, managers in his unit set aside a budget of about $40 million to $50 million for the payment of bribes. For Greece alone, Siemens budgeted $10 million to $15 million a year. Bribes were as high as 40 percent of the contract cost in especially corrupt countries. Typically, amounts ranged from 5 percent to 6 percent of a contract's value.
 The most common method of bribery involved hiring an outside consultant to help ''win'' a contract. This was typically a local resident with ties to ruling leaders. Siemens paid a fee to the consultant, who in turn delivered the cash to the ultimate recipient. 
 Siemens has acknowledged having more than 2,700 business consultant agreements, so-called B.C.A.'s, worldwide. Those consultants were at the heart of the bribery scheme, sending millions to government officials.
 MR. SIEKACZEK was painfully aware that he was acting illegally. To protect evidence that he didn't act alone, he and a colleague began copying documents stored in a basement at Siemens's headquarters in Munich that detailed the payments. He eventually stashed about three dozen folders in a secret hiding spot.
 In 2004, Siemens executives told him that he had to sign a document stating he had followed the company's compliance rules. Reluctantly, he signed, but he quit soon after. He continued to work for Siemens as a consultant before finally resigning in 2006. As legal pressure mounted, he heard rumors that Siemens was setting him up for a fall.
 ''On the inside, I was deeply disappointed. But I told myself that people were going to be surprised when their plan failed,'' Mr. Siekaczek recalled. ''It wasn't going to be possible to make me the only one guilty because dozens of people in the business unit were involved. Nobody was going to believe that one person did this on his own.''
 The Siemens scheme began to collapse when investigators in several countries began examining suspicious transactions. Prosecutors in Italy, Liechtenstein and Switzerland sent requests for help to counterparts in Germany, providing lists of suspect Siemens employees. German officials then decided to act in one simultaneous raid.
 The police knocked on Mr. Siekaczek's door on the morning of Nov. 15, 2006. Some 200 other officers were also sweeping across Germany, into Siemens's headquarters in Munich and the homes of several executives.
 In addition to Mr. Siekaczek's detailed payment records, investigators secured five terabytes of data from Siemens's offices -- a mother lode of information equivalent to five million books. Mr. Siekaczek turned out to be one of the biggest prizes. After calling his lawyer, he immediately announced that he would cooperate.
 Officials in the United States began investigating the case shortly after the raids became public. Knowing that it faced steep fines unless it cooperated, Siemens hired an American law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, to conduct an internal investigation and to work with federal investigators. 
 As German and American investigators worked together to develop leads, Debevoise and its partners dedicated more than 300 lawyers, forensic analysts and staff members to untangle thousands of payments across the globe, according to the court records. American investigators and the Debevoise lawyers conducted more than 1,700 interviews in 34 countries. They collected more than 100 million documents, creating special facilities in China and Germany to house records from that single investigation. Debevoise and an outside auditor racked up 1.5 million billable hours, according to court documents. Siemens has said that the internal inquiry and related restructurings have cost it more than $1 billion.
 Siemens officials ''made it crystal clear that they wanted us to get to the bottom of this and follow it wherever the evidence led,'' said Bruce E. Yannett, a Debevoise partner.
 AT the same time, Siemens worked hard to purge the company of some senior managers and to reform company policies. Several senior managers have been arrested. Klaus Kleinfeld, the company's C.E.O., resigned in April 2007. He has denied wrongdoing and is now head of Alcoa, the aluminum giant. Alcoa said that the company fully supports Mr. Kleinfeld and declined to comment further.
 Last year, Siemens said in S.E.C. filings that it had discovered evidence that former officials had misappropriated funds and abused their authority. In August, Siemens said it seeks to recover monetary damages from 11 former board members for activities related to the bribery scheme. Negotiations on that matter are continuing. 
 Earlier this year, Siemens's current chief executive, Peter Loscher, vowed to make Siemens ''state of the art'' in anticorruption measures. 
 ''Operational excellence and ethical behavior are not a contradiction of terms,'' the company said in a statement. ''We must get the best business -- and the clean business.''
 Siemens still faces legal uncertainties. The Justice Department and German officials said that investigations were continuing and that current and former company officials might face prosecution.
 Legal experts say Siemens is the latest in a string of high-profile cases that are changing attitudes about corruption. Still, they said, much work remains. 
 ''I am not saying the fight against bribing foreign public officials is a fight full of roses and victories,'' said Nicola Bonucci, the director of legal affairs for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is based in Paris and monitors the global economy. ''But I am convinced that it is something more and more people are taking seriously.''
 For his part, Mr. Siekaczek is uncertain about the impact of the Siemens case. After all, he said, bribery and corruption are still widespread. 
 ''People will only say about Siemens that they were unlucky and that they broke the 11th Commandment,'' he said. ''The 11th Commandment is: 'Don't get caught.' ''

HEADLINE: IN NEED OF CASH, MORE COMPANIES CUT 401(K) MATCH

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Companies eager to conserve cash are trimming their contributions to their workers' 401(k) retirement plans, putting a new strain on America's tattered safety net at the very moment when many workers are watching their accounts plummet along with the stock market. 
 When the FedEx Corporation slimmed down its pension plan last year, it softened the blow by offering workers enriched 401(k) contributions to make up for the pension benefits some would lose. But last week, with Americans sending fewer parcels and FedEx's revenue growth at a standstill, the company said it would suspend all of its contributions for at least a year.
 ''We will have to work more years and retire with less money,'' said Lee Higham, a 44-year-old senior aircraft mechanic at FedEx, who has worked there for 20 years. ''That's what we are up against now.'' 
 FedEx is not the only one. Eastman Kodak, Motorola, General Motors and Resorts International are among the companies that have cut matching contributions to their plans since September, when the credit markets froze and companies began looking urgently for cash. More companies are expected to suspend their matching contributions in 2009, according to Watson Wyatt, a benefits consulting firm. 
 For workers, the loss of a matching contribution heightens the pain of a retirement account balance shriveling away because of the plunging stocks markets. 
 ''We are taking a beating,'' said another FedEx mechanic, Rafael Garcia. ''In a year, I lost $60,000 of my 401(k). You can't make that up.''
 To many retirement policy specialists, the lost contributions are one more sign of America's failure as a society to face up to the graying of the population and the profound economic forces it will unleash.
 Traditional pensions are disappearing, and Washington has yet to ensure that Social Security will remain solvent as baby boomers retire and more workers are needed to support each retiree.
 The company cutbacks may mean that some employees put less money into their retirement accounts. Even if they do not, the cuts, while temporary, will have a permanent effect by costing many workers years of future compounding on the missed contributions. No one knows how long credit will remain scarce for companies, or whether companies will start making their matching contributions again when credit loosens and business improves. 
 ''We have had a 30-year experiment with requiring workers to be more responsible for saving and investing for their retirement,'' said Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School. ''It has been a grand experiment, and it has failed.''
 In the typical 401(k) plan, the employer's matching contribution is more than just money for retirement. It also motivates employees to set aside more of their own money for old age. The more that workers save in a 401(k) plan, generally, the more ''free money'' they can get from their employers under the matching provisions.
 Retirement policy specialists said they did not expect employees to react immediately to the loss of this incentive by stopping their own contributions. Study after study has shown that employees procrastinate when it comes to retirement-plan chores, and in this case the inertia may work, unwittingly, in their favor. 
 Americans, however, are facing extreme household financial pressure. President-elect Obama has said that he would support allowing withdrawals from retirement plans without penalties, which would provide short-term relief but would further undercut American's long-term savings. 
 Benefits specialists said that if matching contributions continued to dwindle, fewer newly hired workers could be expected to join 401(k) plans. And employees might eventually slow or stop their contributions if the recession drags on and their own cash runs short. 
 ''The problem is, we are heading into this serious recession, and we don't know how long it will go on for,'' said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ''The bottom line is, people will have less money in their 401(k) plans, not just because the financial crisis has decimated their assets, but also because they will not have the employer match for some time.''
 Currently, most companies that offer 401(k) plans do provide some sort of matching contributions, according to David Wray, president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, an association of employers that provide such plans. 
 The most typical arrangement is for employers to match 50 cents of every dollar their employees set aside in their retirement accounts, up to 6 percent of pay. Sometimes the match is more, sometimes less, and some employers vary it depending on profitability. Over all, the employer's cost usually works out to about 3 percent of payroll. 
 The latest 401(k) cutbacks underscore workers' vulnerability in an age when companies have been replacing defined-benefit pension plans with the newer 401(k) design. Modern 401(k) plans give workers the power to opt in and out and require them to invest their own money, bearing market risk on their own. That may be appealing when the markets are rising, but it can be terrifying when they fall, as they have recently.
 An employer's contributions to a traditional pension plan cannot be switched on and off at will. Federal rules set a firm contribution schedule, with deadlines and penalties for companies that fall behind. Employers also get significant tax and accounting benefits from operating a traditional pension plan, so they tend to think long and hard before freezing such a plan to save money when the economy cools. 
 In a 401(k) plan, by contrast, the employer has much greater freedom to stop making matching contributions when times are tough. The contributions are normally measured as a percentage of payroll, and the savings from any cuts are realized immediately. That greatly simplifies planning and making changes. 
 ''Every percent you cut is a percent of payroll,'' Ms. Munnell said. ''It comes down to the choice of laying people off, or cutting back on some fringe benefits.''
 Many of the latest 401(k) cutbacks are turning up in industries with obvious financial problems, like the auto industry, health care and newspaper publishing. Industries that depend on free-spending consumers, like resorts and casinos, are also seeing cuts. Often when one company in an industry cuts its benefits others will follow, to keep their labor costs competitive. 
 General Motors and Ford Motor have both suspended their matching contributions to their salaried employees' 401(k) accounts, although their pension plans for unionized workers are unchanged. 
 Motorola, struggling to stay competitive, stopped contributions to its 401(k) plan this month and froze its pension plan as well. 
 Other recent cuts have occurred at Resorts International Holdings, Vail Resorts and Station Casinos. 
 In addition to stopping their 401(k) matching contributions, companies have been freezing salaries this fall, shifting more of the cost of health care to their workers, and laying people off. 
 ''These are really hard times and people are losing their jobs, and in some ways, a suspension of a 401(k) match, while bad, is probably one of the lesser evils out there,'' Ms. Munnell said. 
 In announcing the suspension of the contributions last week, FedEx made clear that its workers in the sorting centers would not be the only ones feeling the pinch. Pay to senior executives is to be cut by 7.5 percent to 10 percent, and the chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said he would take a 20 percent pay cut. The cutbacks are projected to save $200 million in the remainder of the 2009 fiscal year and $600 million in the 2010 fiscal year.

PERSON: Howard M. Pack 

HEADLINE: Howard Pack, 90, Magnate And Innovator in Shipping

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Howard M. Pack, who as president and later chairman of Seatrain Lines was a leader in the industry in changing the way ships carry goods from port to port, died Dec. 9 in Manhattan. He was 90 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y. 
 The cause was heart failure, his daughter Loren Pack said.
 Mr. Pack and his longtime friend and business partner, Joseph Kahn, acquired Seatrain Lines for $8.5 million in 1965. It was a time of transformation for the industry. 
 Seatrain, founded in 1931, had six ships that could carry railroad box cars from port to port, a major change from the days when freight was loaded, bit by bit, by crate, net and crane. Seatrain's new owners were among the first in the business to switch to vessels capable of carrying cargo containers that could be lifted off and onto trucks or trains, speeding the shipping of goods to markets. 
 The company eventually had more than 50 ships of several types making regular runs from New York Harbor to ports in Texas, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Guam, the Far East and the Middle East. One type of ship would carry grain to the Middle East, where its holds would be thoroughly scrubbed so that it could be loaded with oil for the return trip. 
 By the early 1970s, Mr. Pack and Mr. Kahn were running a company that was earning $250 million a year and had 4,000 employees working out of the old Brooklyn Navy Yard and a shipyard in Weehawken, N.J. But the Arab oil embargo, strikes by dockworkers and overbuilding by the shipping industry began to take their toll. 
 Mr. Pack and Mr. Kahn expanded into the chartering of tankers, management of ports, oil refining and coal mining in West Virginia. Still, revenue faltered and in 1981 the company closed.
 Howard Meade Pack was born in Manhattan on Sept. 21, 1918, the eldest of three children of Benjamin and Ida Winograd Pack. His father was a furrier. 
 Mr. Pack graduated from Columbia with a degree in economics in 1939 and went to work with his father. He served in the Coast Guard in World War II, then returned to the family business. He met another furrier, Mr. Kahn. 
 They both hated the fur business, Mr. Pack's daughter Loren said, and by 1951 they had joined with other investors to buy two Liberty ships that had been decommissioned by the federal government. 
 They started Pack/Kahn, which later became Transeastern Associates, the shipping company that took over Seatrain in 1965. Mr. Pack was president of Seatrain until 1977; vice chairman until Mr. Kahn died in 1979; and then chairman. 
 Besides his daughter Loren, Mr. Pack is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Dorothy Culbertson; two other daughters, Susan and Ellen Pack; a son, Warren; his brother, Jay; his sister, Ethel Schneider; and nine grandchildren. Mr. Pack's first wife, Nancy Buckley, died in 1959; another son, Daniel, died in 1991.

HEADLINE: Yonit Golub, Joe Serkin

 BODY:
Yonit Shoshana Golub, the daughter of Judith R. Golub and Rabbi Robert R Golub of Manhattan, is to be married Sunday afternoon to Yosef Mordechai Serkin, the son of Marcy Serkin of Manhattan and Paul Serkin of Teaneck, N.J. The bride's father is to officiate at Bridgewaters, an event space in Manhattan, with Rabbi David Serkin, an uncle of the bridegroom, taking part. 
 The bride, 25, works in the office of Robert C. Lieber, the New York City deputy mayor for economic development; she specializes in communications and speechwriting. She graduated from Johns Hopkins, from which she also received a master's in international relations. 
 Her father, who works in Manhattan, is the executive director of Mercaz U.S.A., the Zionist arm of the Conservative movement. He is on the boards of the American Zionist Movement and the Jewish National Fund, both in Manhattan; and the World Zionist Organization in Jerusalem. Her mother is the director of administration for the department that focuses on fund-raising at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, part of Yeshiva University. 
 The bridegroom, 26, who is known as Joe, is a New York City police officer in the 28th Precinct in Harlem. He graduated from Brandeis. 
 His mother also works for Yeshiva University, where she is the director of technical training and data quality control for the fund-raising and support staff. She works on the university's Manhattan campus. His father is a senior project manager of software applications at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. 
 The couple met on a blind date their mothers set up in 2007. Ms. Golub said she had given her mother carte blanche in helping in her search for Mr. Right after her mother said that Ms. Golub could never seem to find someone worth going with on a third date. 
 She remembered telling her mother that if she was so convinced that finding the right man for her is easy, ''then give him my number,'' Ms. Golub said. 
 But her mother would not settle for any ordinary Joe. Three years later, in her first week at Albert Einstein, her mother met Mr. Serkin's mother. Mrs. Serkin saw Mrs. Golub's daughter in a family photograph on her desk. Both mothers compared notes and agreed that Yonit and Mrs. Serkin's son, whom she referred to as Yosef, might have enough in common to hit it off. 
 But Ms. Golub and Mr. Serkin wound up meeting days before the blind date. Ms. Golub said that she had tagged along with her roommate to a birthday party at a Times Square restaurant for one of her roommate's friends from Brandeis. At the party Mr. Serkin was briefly introduced as Joe to Ms. Golub. 
 The next day her mother brought up the prospective blind date, and Ms. Golub said she told her: ''Sure I'll go out with that Yosef guy.'' 
 That evening Ms. Golub learned that he was the same man she had met the night before. 
 She was initially unsure she wanted to follow through. But it was too late. Mr. Serkin had already been given her number. So Ms. Golub figured one date is one date. 
 Mr. Serkin called her that night. But at this point he was unaware that Ms. Golub was the same woman he'd already met.
 ''My mother mentioned that she worked with a woman who had a daughter my age I would like,'' Mr. Serkin said. ''She sent me a picture of Yonit, but I didn't recognize her from the party.''
 During that call, which lasted for hours, Ms. Golub revealed all, and the two made dinner plans for the following Saturday night. 
 On their first date, they both had a good laugh about the whole thing. 
 Unlike her previous fix-ups, Ms. Golub discovered that she had finally found someone worth a third date. ''Our mothers did a good job,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Hartford Story Tries To Dodge an Abrupt End

BYLINE: By LARY BLOOM. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Hartford 

 BODY:
 THE boy suspected where the conversation with his grownup visitor was heading. As a fifth grader at Fox Elementary School, after all, he had learned a thing or two. He was aware, for example, that he was having a hard time with reading -- tests showed him at the third-grade level. And so now he had someone called a mentor. 
 Carl Guerriere, executive director of the Greater Hartford Literacy Council, knew the boy's proficiency level was not horrific by local educational standards, but it was worrisome enough in a city that has one of the lowest adult literacy rates in the nation. 
 Mr. Guerriere asked, ''What do you want to do when you grow up?'' The fifth grader, picking at a lunch of Spanish rice and chicken (he ate the skin, not the meat), replied with a common dream for that age: ''A policeman,'' and then, not getting the cliche quite right, added, ''I want to take drug dealers out of the road.'' He meant, of course, off the streets.
 His mentor knew that the boy was living in a household where only Spanish was spoken -- an impediment to reading and speaking proper English. Mr. Guerriere, 52, understood the difficulty from first-hand experience. In the working-class household where he grew up, Italian was spoken (by his father), and Ukrainian (by his mother). As the fifth son of parents who had dropped out of school, his speech was once rife with double negatives. Moreover, he understood precisely the boy's vulnerability -- because he had been in that chair himself.
 What could he tell the child? That though he'd eventually earned a bachelor's degree from Trinity College and a master's from Columbia, he had once been a punk on the road to nowhere? Or that by the age of 12 he and his aimless buddies were much more devoted to marijuana and Boone's Farm wine than academics? It wasn't cool, after all, to bring a book home. Or that, magically, school saved him. Eighth-grade teachers in Bristol discovered his promise, pushed him, and did what some urban teachers today find difficult because of overwhelming societal forces.
 Yes, Mr. Guerriere could have mentioned this, but instead concentrated on the task at hand -- getting the boy to understand that in order to become a police officer he would have to become proficient in English.
 This circumstance at Fox may reasonably stand for what has been at stake in Hartford, where educational statistics over the years have set new standards for grimness, and where financial support for the work of the Greater Hartford Literacy Council, which Mr. Guerriere has headed since its inception in 2001, has dwindled to almost nothing.
 Indeed, when I visited his headquarters on the third floor of Hartford's Union Station in early December, his multitasking had an eerie quality. On the one hand, he expressed the particulars of the city's deep problem. On the other, he was packing posters and other materials to take them to, well, where? He wasn't quite sure. And he prepared for a meeting later in the day with the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving that would determine whether his doors would be open much beyond New Year's Day.
 The economic crisis and drop in corporate and political support have come at a critical moment -- just as efforts to address the city's literacy rate are gaining some traction. Mastery Test scores, never a source of pride in Hartford's schools, are slightly up. One of the reasons is the work of Mr. Guerriere, his staff (now down to one) and the council's confederation of dozens of nonprofits and schools in 35 towns. Those efforts have raised public awareness and begun something of a reading renaissance.
 Mr. Guerriere is particularly concerned about the vulnerable city around him -- and has wanted to create a culture of reading in urban households -- hence, the effort to place books in households. If the council's doors close there will still be literacy programs. Books will be distributed to children by the statewide program Read to Grow, which recently attracted the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison to a fund-raiser. The author told the audience of 600 in New Haven that it was critical to teach children ''the language they dream in.'' But, as in the past, many other programs will be low profile and without regional support. This, to Mr. Guerriere, is not surprising. ''Poor people don't have advocates,'' he says. 
 Indeed, that afternoon, the meeting with the foundation, which in the past has been, along with the city, a primary benefactor, did not go well. Mr. Guerriere left with the prospect that the best his organization could do, as it dissipates, is distribute materials and guidance to other stakeholders. The meeting did not offer Mr. Guerriere a chance to talk about the boy he has mentored, and who puts a human face on the issue. 
 At one of the mentoring sessions, he and the child played a table version of basketball, trying to coax a small plastic orb into a net. He let the boy keep score, and noticed the fifth grader had trouble adding two points to the total. Years from now, that could still be the case as he applies for jobs, without basic qualifications. Or, armed with inspiration and guidance from those like Mr. Guerriere, who knows that anything is possible, the boy may one day become a mentor himself, and pass along the magic of the written word.

HEADLINE: Dancing To Taped Music: One Exception To the Trend

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Consequences of Going to the Tape'' by Alastair Macaulay [Dec. 14]: 
 I applaud Mr. Macaulay's piece, which celebrates the joys of live music in dance performances and offers a cautionary call to arms in anticipation of the decreasing use of live music in these economically challenging times. Mr. Macaulay is correct to praise the use of such music and to bemoan the increasingly frequent decisions to forgo live music for economic reasons.
 Sadly, however, Mr. Macaulay omits the one dance company that is most completely committed to live music at every performance: New York City Ballet. The company's adherence to the core principles instituted by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein 60 years ago is evident today in every one of the more than 175 New York City Ballet performances that are played annually by the New York City Ballet Orchestra, a full-time orchestra of 63 musicians.
 By ignoring New York City Ballet's fundamental commitment to live music at every performance, Mr. Macaulay fails to report the example of an organization that deeply believes in the importance of live music to dance. His position could only have been strengthened by holding up City Ballet as a shining example of a company that says to others: ''You too can do this.''

HEADLINE: Characters Abroad, Conflicts Close to Home

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
IN a disappointing year for serious American movies, two television series, AMC's ''Mad Men'' and Showtime's ''Brotherhood,'' far outshone in truthfulness and complexity most of what American filmmakers created for the big screen. Hollywood, in its awards-seeking mode, keeps recycling the same sanctified topics -- the Holocaust and civil rights. The industry would do well to heed the words of my colleague Manohla Dargis, who recently wrote of ''The Reader'': ''You have to wonder who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears.'' Amen. 
 4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS, 2 DAYS The stark Romanian drama, directed by Cristian Mungiu and set during the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, portrays a country mired in depression and paranoia where everyday life involves navigating through a cruel bureaucratic jungle. The story follows two college girls, frightened, scatterbrained Gabita (Laura Vasiliu), who seeks an abortion, and her steadfast roommate, Otilia (Anamaria Marinca), who does all the difficult work in arranging the illegal and dangerous procedure. Otilia, who has her own problems, must abandon her friend in the shabby hotel in which the abortion is performed to attend a nightmarish dinner given by the family of her selfish, possessive boyfriend. With no cinematic frills and no music, ''4 Months'' is grimly realistic and unforgettable.
 THE EDGE OF HEAVEN The destinies of six characters intersect in the compelling cross-cultural drama by the German-born Turkish filmmaker Fatih Akin, whose 2004 film ''Head-On'' established him as a major international talent. They include a boorish Turkish widower living in Germany; a prostitute he shelters in exchange for conjugal favors but accidentally kills during a squabble; his son, a German professor who moves back to Istanbul and buys a bookstore; the prostitute's daughter, a headstrong political zealot; the young German woman she falls madly in love with; and the German woman's strait-laced mother, a former hippie (memorably portrayed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder's muse, Hannah Schygulla). As the paths of these fascinating, complicated people cross (two go to jail), Mr. Akin regards them with unwavering compassion. 
 WALL-E The Pixar masterpiece is both an endearing family entertainment and a satirical allegory of consumerism run amok. The first part of the movie, which is directed by Andrew Stanton and set 700 years in the future on an abandoned Earth overrun with trash, follows the title character, a squeaky garbage-collecting robot as makes his lonely rounds. In these scenes Wall-E is as comically poignant as any silent movie clown. The satire kicks in after he discovers a tiny green plant, the first sign of vegetation growing in the rubble, and is picked up by an orbiting spaceship crowded with fat, lazy humans. The fragile sign of life he brings with him suggests it might be time for humanity to return to Earth. 
 MILKGus Van Sant's documentary-style account of the life and times of Harvey Milk, the gay-rights advocate and San Francisco city supervisor who was murdered in 1978, is lighted from within by Sean Penn's fluid, incandescent performance. Perhaps the greatest of his career, it exceeds even his heartbreaking turn in ''Dead Man Walking.'' Predominantly a political biography, the movie traces Milk's development into a community organizer nicknamed the Mayor of Castro Street, but it only glancingly touches on his tumultuous private life. After Milk tangles with his fellow supervisor Dan White, a repressed Catholic family man, White (perfectly embodied by Josh Brolin) assassinates Milk and San Francisco's mayor George Moscone.
 THE LAST MISTRESS The French feminist director Catherine Breillat's erotic costume drama, adapted from Jules-Amedee Barbey d'Aurevilly's novel, ''Une Vielle Maitresse'' and set in 1830s Paris, is the year's sexiest movie and has its most searing female performance in Asia Argento's. It observes the consuming 10-year affair of a hotblooded, cigar-smoking Spanish-Italian courtesan (Ms. Argento) who flouts the rules of polite society, and a sloe-eyed dandy (Fu'ad Ait Aattou) who is unable to let her go. The study of unbridled sexual combat between two willful sensualists is a politically charged exploration of sexual and social role playing. 
 HAPPY-GO-LUCKY One of a fortunate few who are born with a sunny disposition, Poppy (Sally Hawkins), is the voluble subject of this comedy by the British director Mike Leigh. When bad things happen to Poppy, she tends to shrug them off; life is too rich for her to dwell on the negative. An elementary school teacher who instinctively spreads good will, she meets her stubborn opposite in Scott (Eddie Marsan), her repressed, self-loathing, xenophobic driving instructor who is driven crazy by her cheerfulness in scenes that are both sidesplitting and heartbreaking. Forget Julie Andrews's synthetic cheer; Ms. Hawkins's performance offers the real thing. 
 A CHRISTMAS TALE In some respects the Vuillards, the volatile French clan who convene for Christmas in Arnaud Desplechin's artfully messy film, could be any dysfunctional family engaged in petty warfare at a holiday reunion. Individually, however, not one member is a stereotype. In this serious ''genetic'' comedy, Catherine Deneuve is the unflappable matriarch, recently diagnosed with the same rare form of leukemia that took her first-born son decades earlier. When the three surviving children arrive with their spouses and children, little wars break out and peace agreements are negotiated, as Ms. Deneuve's character considers candidates to donate bone marrow for a transplant that her body may reject. 
 TELL NO ONE The delicious French thriller written and directed by Guillaume Canet has everything you would want in a 21st-century version of an Alfred Hitchcock mystery. In the twisty plot, a kindhearted pediatrician (Francois Cluzet) finds himself on the run after his beautiful wife reappears years after her supposed death. The movie has the best chase sequence (through Paris) of any movie this year and the scariest female killer since Lotte Lenya in ''From Russia With Love.'' The conspiracy plot is as complex as that of ''The Big Sleep'' but more satisfying because its pieces sort of fit. The doctor's obsession with his dead wife (shades of ''Vertigo'') gives the movie a hot romantic center. 
 FROZEN RIVER Courtney Hunt's somber film, set in upstate New York near the Canadian border at Christmas, was ahead of its time in evoking a perfect storm of present-day woes: worsening economic hardship, ethnic tension and illegal immigration. At its center is Melissa Leo's monumental portrayal of the flinty mother of two children whose father has just abandoned the family. Struggling to eke out a living, she teams up with a Mohawk Indian woman (Misty Upham) from a nearby reservation to earn money smuggling illegal aliens across the frozen St. Lawrence River. 
 THE VISITOR The unassuming hero (Richard Jenkins) of ''The Visitor'' is a professor teaching in Connecticut who discovers on a rare trip to New York that his seldom-used city apartment has been rented to a Syrian drummer (Haaz Sleiman) and his Senegalese girlfriend (Danai Gurira). After recovering from the shock, he allows them to stay there and the Syrian, Tarek, to give him drumming lessons. But the arrangement ends when Tarek is arrested and held in a detention center for illegal immigrants, and the professor springs to the rescue. If the concept of Thomas McCarthy's film -- depressed middle-aged man is uplifted by his friendship with a third-world life force -- sounds sentimental and patronizing, it is realized by the director of ''The Station Agent'' with such grace, humanity and toughness that you embrace it in spite of your qualms.

HEADLINE: Solar Power Rebate Program Is a 'Victim' of Its Own Success

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPEIGEL

 BODY:
IT'S the good news-bad news dilemma. Connecticut's rebate program for home and business owners who purchase solar systems to generate electricity has become so popular, money has run out for some residential rebates, and rebate applications for commercial, government and nonprofit groups are being cut off next month.
 ''We're victims of our own success,'' said Lise Dondy, president of the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, which runs the solar rebate program. 
 Aside from leaving people in a solar lurch, success is also breeding widespread concern that unless money is injected into the program, the momentum built up over its four-year life will be lost, taking with it some of the dozens of companies and hundreds of jobs it created. Many fear that would put a damper on the growth of so-called green-collar jobs, which they also see as a key to reversing the economic downturn.
 ''We don't want to be in position to put together all this wonderful momentum and then tell them we can't sustain them: 'Go away,' '' said Michael Trahan, executive director of Solar Connecticut, an industry group. ''That's a serious hiccup that will take years to fix.''
 For short-term funding, Mr. Trahan is working with state legislators to come up with a bonding proposal. On a separate front, the Clean Energy Fund's board of directors, at its monthly meeting on Monday, was expected to consider proposals that would reallocate money from another part of the fund to the residential solar program, though at a much lower rebate level.
 Until now, Connecticut's solar rebate program had been widely regarded as the best run and most generous in the nation. Since January 2005, more than $20 million was committed to 815 residential solar projects and, since May 2005, nearly $65 million to 127 business and government projects. 
 The money comes from fees on electric bills. The current funding cycle runs from July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2010. But a 300 percent growth in purchases of residential systems for the first six months ate up its entire $8.5 million. And because Ms. Dondy expects the commercial program to exhaust its two-year allotment of more than $18 million this spring, she announced last week that no applications would be accepted after Jan. 15.
 Most of the money, however, is still available for a recently unveiled lease program in which homeowners essentially rent a solar system. But its appeal has been limited by an income cap that excludes wealthier people and because there are costs at the end of the lease. Some people also just prefer to buy.
 ''It should be supplemental,'' Paul Israel, president and founder of Sunlight Solar Energy in Milford, said of the lease program. ''It shouldn't be what they're relying on.'' 
 He and others also questioned the fund's abrupt suspension on Nov. 19 of the solar residential purchase rebate program. ''Could they have put a brake on the money early to sustain it, or tiered the rates down?'' he asked. ''Industry as well as the Clean Energy Fund should have had a firmer control on the funds.
 ''We are paying consequences now.''
 Because of stages in the application process, it is not always clear how much money has been committed, Ms. Dondy said. ''Could we have done it better?'' she said. ''Probably.''
 Jared Haines, president of Mercury Solar Systems, which added a Greenwich office about 18 months ago, worried that he would have to shift employees to his New York operation. ''You get to know the ins and outs and know all the people, and a few months later they run out of money,'' he said. ''It's pretty disappointing.'' 
 Mr. Haines and other installers said customers seem to be hanging back for now.
 Lee Lasberg of Ridgefield was partway through the rebate application process when the money ran out. ''The conclusion was without the rebate, it was not economically feasible,'' he said. But he has prepared his house, which was being renovated in any case, for solar if the rebates resume.
 Officials in Gov. M. Jodi Rell's office and others said they hoped that commitments to clean energy by the incoming Obama administration would free up funds for solar power. And the lease program is likely to be adjusted to make it more acceptable, though the income cap is not likely to be raised, Ms. Dondy said.
 Timothy Bowles, chairman of the fund's board and a co-chairman of a working group created by the General Assembly to come up with a long-term overhaul of the solar rebate program, said he expected the board to approve some kind of fix on Monday. ''We have to take a look at the next generation of clean energy as an economic driver,'' Mr. Bowles said. ''To lose any jobs here in Connecticut, and people currently employed here in Connecticut, is incredibly shortsighted.''

HEADLINE: Even Used Cars Are Slumping

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
CONSUMERS have been buying fewer new cars because of the slumping economy, volatile gas prices, tighter loan standards and vanishing lease deals. But, oddly, the used-car market, which typically does well in a poor economy, has also declined. 
 Sales of used cars fell 20.7 percent in November, compared with the period a year earlier, according to CNW Research, a Bandon, Ore., company that follows the auto industry. Sales are on track to fall to 36.6 million for the year, down 11.5 percent from 2007. That would mark the third consecutive annual decline in used-car sales, which would also reach their lowest levels since the 1982 recession. 
 The value of used cars has also declined. CNW said that the average price for used cars, excluding S.U.V.'s and other vehicles, fell 5.2 percent this year, to $11,468, compared with $12,101 in 2007.
 The most prominent reason for the declines, auto market analysts said, is fear of the future. Consumers are so worried about the sinking value of their homes and savings, and the possibility of losing their jobs, that they are holding off on buying big-ticket items, including cars.
 ''Everyone seems to be waiting until the dust settles,'' said Jesse Toprak, chief industry analyst at Edmunds.com, an auto information Web site. ''The economy needs to show some kind of stability'' before consumers jump back into the market.
 According to CNW Research, used-car dealers have seen about half as much traffic in their showrooms this year. And those customers coming in the door are finding it harder to get loans because dealers are asking for more money down and demanding higher credit scores from people taking out loans. That is leading buyers to put off buying a car or forcing them to buy a lesser car, Mr. Toprak said. 
 The average credit score needed to borrow money to buy a vehicle has risen 4.1 percent this year, CNW said. The highest increases in required credit scores have been for pickups (which have plummeted in value) and economy cars. 
 Consumers with cash and sturdy credit ratings who might have bought new cars are instead finding deals on used cars, particularly trucks, vans and S.U.V.'s that have fallen the most in value this year. But sales to well-financed buyers have been more than offset by the number of consumers who, because of lower credit ratings, have not been buying cars.
 ''The fact that a used-car buyer is more economically challenged than a new-car buyer trumps the idea of new-car buyers dipping into the used-car market,'' said Jack R. Nerad, the executive market analyst at Kelley Blue Book.
 S.U.V.'s and other gas-guzzling vehicles that fell out of favor are not the only used vehicles in little demand. Perversely, cars with reputations for dependability and fuel efficiency -- as well as those with generous 10-year warranties -- are not selling either, because fewer are available. Alexander Edwards, president of automotive market research at Strategic Vision in San Diego, said the owners of these cars were simply hanging onto them.
 ''You would expect Toyota to sell well because of their record,'' he said. ''What Toyota people are doing today is keeping their car even longer.''
 In Consumer Reports surveys of owners with 1998-2007 vehicles, Japanese-built models accounted for 59 of the top 65 most reliable. The problem, analysts said, is that dealers are having a hard time finding enough attractive used cars to sell.
 Of course, some drivers have no choice but to shop for a car, particularly people whose leases are coming due. Dealers are eager to take back cars that have strong residual values, like the Honda Fit, Toyota Corolla and Volkswagen Rabbit, and are offering better terms to get those drivers to lease another new vehicle. But when customers return cars with weaker resale values, like large S.U.V.'s with V-8 engines, dealers -- or their finance companies -- are trying to persuade them to buy the car, said Terrence Wynne, director of editorial and data services at NADA Used Car Guide, a company in Costa Mesa, Calif., that tracks vehicle prices.
 ''They would try to sell the vehicle to the person as a used car and structure it in a beneficial deal,'' he said.
 One growth area, Mr. Toprak of Edmunds.com said, is the market for ''buy here, pay here'' cars for drivers who are having trouble getting financing. Independent used-car dealers are offering financing, but also asking buyers for a down payment of several thousand dollars.
 That strategy reduces the dealer's loan risk because in many cases the down payment covers the dealer's cost of acquiring the vehicle. The dealer then makes its profit from the loan payments made by the buyer.
 To ensure that monthly payments are made, the vehicles, which are typically from three to eight years old, are often equipped with GPS devices that let the dealer disable the car's starter if the buyer falls behind on payments.
 Analysts said the market would rebound once the economy stabilized and consumers felt better about their prospects. Indeed, the number of consumers surveyed by Edmunds.com who said they intended to buy a car has risen 16 percent since Election Day.

HEADLINE: Paradise, Jolted by the Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
THE Web site for Molasses Reef -- a planned Ritz-Carlton resort in the Turks and Caicos -- promises ''barefoot luxury'' and ''island life the way it was meant to be.'' But these days, the resort buildings, which include a hotel and large villas, stand empty and unfinished.
Lehman Brothers was financing the project. And after the investment bank's demise in September, construction was halted, leaving the developers and their contractors with a host of problems. 
Among them was the fate of laborers brought over from China by the Ashtrom Group, an Israeli construction conglomerate. On Oct. 15, about 60 of them followed Ashtrom managers around the island of West Caicos, demanding to be paid. (The standoff ended when Ashtrom paid the workers money owed to them by a subcontractor, an Ashtrom executive told The Associated Press.)
But Jonathan Siegel, the managing partner of the Logwood Hotel Development Company, the partnership that owns Molasses Reef, said he has spent two months dealing with the fallout from the incident. ''Of the 400 Chinese workers, everyone has gone home, with the exception of about 50 guys,'' he said. ''Those guys will be off West Caicos by Dec. 31.''
His goal now, he said, is to ''protect the asset,'' by which he meant the unfinished buildings. Important tasks, he said, include keeping the interiors dry and even providing air-conditioning in places where mold might form before construction can resume.
Lehman had been bankrolling a number of hotel projects, including two in New York: the Nobu Hotel, partly owned by the actor Robert De Niro and set to rise in Lower Manhattan; and a Shangri-La hotel planned for Midtown. Work on both projects has halted. At Molasses Reef, Logwood had already spent about $200 million of Lehman's money, Mr. Siegel said, and construction was about 75 percent complete.
Bjorn Hanson, an associate professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, said he believed that of the hotel projects that stopped this year because of the credit crisis, fewer than 10 percent had already broken ground. But, he added, such projects have the potential to create countless disputes -- with contractors over unpaid bills, with governments over taxes, with franchisors over fees, and even with neighbors concerned about the dangers posed by unsecured construction sites. (He said he was not familiar with the particular problems at Molasses Reef.)
A newsletter published by the Molasses Reef developer before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy showed a pair of 52-foot yachts that would shuttle guests to and from the Turks and Caicos island of Providenciales. (Other guests would arrive by private plane or helicopter.) Room rates were expected to start at about $600 a night, and Gray Kunz, a celebrated New York chef, was slated to open three restaurants at the resort.
Indeed, the hotel was going to be called a Ritz-Carlton Reserve. Simon F. Cooper, the president and chief operating officer of Ritz-Carlton, a division of Marriott International, described that title as denoting ''signature, one-of-a-kind boutique resorts located in choice settings, each with a distinctive personality and sense of place.''
The resort was to include the hotel and 75 Ritz-Carlton-brand villas, with prices starting at $2.6 million. Lehman was both a part-owner of the project and its main lender, according to Mr. Siegel and Karim Alibhai, the founder and principal of the Gencom Group. Gencom, based in Miami, is the controlling partner of Logwood.
Mr. Alibhai said Gencom had weathered crises before, but that this was a ''very unfortunate situation that no textbook could have prepared us for.'' He added, a bit ruefully, that ''the only lender that ended up going bankrupt, out of all the lenders, is Lehman Brothers.''
Lehman had already disbursed about $200 million for construction of the hotel, Mr. Siegel said.
''But you don't get all the money at once,'' he explained. ''Each month, you'd put in a draw request for the next $22 million or $18 million or $20 million, and then you'd pay that month's bills.''
He said that there were no warning signs before the process came to an abrupt halt three months ago. ''The people we were dealing with at Lehman were as surprised as we were,'' he added. The project quickly went into what he called suspension mode.
Mr. Siegel, who divides his time between New York and Turks and Caicos, now has to ensure that the buildings are secured before construction can begin again. ''Right now we've got to batten down the hatches,'' he said. He said he hopes construction will resume in 90 to 180 days, but ''that's just an optimistic guy talking.''
''Right now,'' he added, ''we have no financing.''
Mr. Siegel said he was working to determine the fate of the Lehman Brothers loans. ''We don't have a 'get out of jail free' card, to pretend we don't owe the money,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''Before you can find new money, you have to deal with the bankrupt entity.''
Mr. Alibhai says he is searching for another bank -- possibly one outside the United States -- to provide $250 million in replacement funding. That would be used to complete Molasses Reef as well as two other Gencom hotel projects that Lehman was financing: a Ritz-Carlton in Rancho Mirage, Calif., which is about 70 percent complete, and a Ritz-Carlton in the Bahamas, which had not yet broken ground. According to Mr. Siegel, at least $100 million more is required to complete Molasses Reef.
One thing that's clear is that money to salvage the hotel won't come from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, which is based in Chevy Chase, Md. ''We are a management company and cannot provide the needed funding to complete the project,'' said Vivian A. Deuschl, a company spokeswoman, when asked about Molasses Reef.
Still, Mr. Siegel said -- a bit of optimism in his voice -- that Ritz-Carlton could introduce to him a potential investor.
''It's not their role to fix our problems,'' he said of Ritz-Carlton, ''but they have a vested interest in seeing our problems fixed.''

HEADLINE: The Jewel Box of Union Square

BYLINE: By CAROLINE H. DWORIN

 BODY:
LATE in the evening on a mid-November Wednesday, when Union Square was dark and quiet, a mild-mannered, blue-eyed man named Eldon Scott stood near the bronze statue of George Washington with a surveyor's wheel in his hand and counted out six paces. Fishing a nub of yellow chalk from the pocket of his green zippered fleece, he stooped down to make a T-shaped mark on the paving stone.
 Moving through the park, Mr. Scott mapped out where the edges of booths would sit for the Union Square Holiday Market, which opened the Saturday before Thanksgiving and runs until Christmas Eve. 
 With simple chalk lines, he indicated where the market would loop back around the statue like a horseshoe, in tidy rows and narrow aisles, to accommodate 110 retailers. They come from as far away as Israel, where a company called Nio produces lotions and soaps made of minerals from the Dead Sea, and as near as Chelsea, home of the studio of the ceramics company Our Name Is Mud. 
 Mr. Scott, the president of Urban Space Management in New York, an organization that brings commercial bustle to city spaces, often in the form of artisans, artists, galleries and restaurants, founded the Union Square market 13 years ago. He had previously developed markets in London and then moved to New York to found the holiday market at Grand Central Terminal.
 He has a keen understanding of cities and the life of the streets, an intuitive sense of how people move through them naturally. He speaks of creating a market as an annual feat of urban planning on a somewhat smaller scale. 
 ''Carts are objects,'' Mr. Scott said. ''These are little buildings.''
 The difference between his markets and traditional street fairs is palpable.
 A recent study by the Center for an Urban Future found that among at least 350 street fairs throughout the city, most of them sold more or less the same generic rotation of wares -- T-shirts, gyros and imitation name-brand purses -- and that nearly half the permits were held by a mere 20 vendors. 
 When Mr. Scott opened the city's first holiday market at Grand Central 15 years ago, he made a point of not only selecting vendors individually but also ensuring that they sold a variety of products.
 Although his organization no longer runs the Grand Central market, it operates the markets at Columbus Circle and Union Square, the latter of which has become something of a crown jewel. It seems ''authentic,'' customers say.
 Like its sister markets, the one at Union Square springs up every year from nothing, like Brigadoon, a self-contained township of brightly colored stalls, each one glowing and unique. Warm and alive, the market's products and vendors are as geographically diverse as the city itself.
 The merchants come from Bali, by way of the Flatiron District, or Lebanon, by way of Ditmars, Queens. In their stands, one can find sheepskin moccasins, woolen houndstooth scarves, wooden puppets carved in Indonesian villages, wallets from Mexico made of brightly colored candy wrappers woven as if they were fabric, Turkish lanterns with candles glowing in their glass bellies, and cookies flavored with Earl Grey tea.
 ''I think of it as an artificial reef constructed in an empty plaza,'' Mr. Scott said of the market that late-autumn night. ''A piece of coral. The life comes to it with all the brightly colored fish.''
 A GOOD market reads like a collection of short stories, each booth a tale of 60 square feet, a little pocket of history, color, light and scent, where the covers open each weekday at 11 a.m. and close most nights at 8.
 ''There's no single story,'' Mr. Scott said, ''and it's counterintuitive. You walk down an aisle and you see one booth with a big crowd around it and another -- empty.'' 
 One winter 16 years ago, a newly minted college graduate from Westchester named Jon Kornbluh moved across the country after college to a cabin in Telluride, Colo. Because the place lacked 20th-century utilities, he started dipping tapers in beeswax. On the suggestion of a roommate, he made a few more candles and discovered he could earn decent cash selling them around town. He hired the roommate, and a few friends. 
 Now he runs a company called Bluecorn Naturals from the little Colorado town of Rico. Each winter since the market's beginning, he has come to Union Square to sell his wares.
 ''And what's the population of Rico?'' asked David Callicott, who works at the Bluecorn booth.
 ''About 250,'' replied Mr. Kornbluh, framed by tea lights, pillars and votives scented with rosemary, lavender and nutmeg. ''We're the town's largest employer.''
 For the more than 100 places at the Union Square Market, Urban Space Management receives about 150 applications, and the selection process works more like that of a fine department store than a juried craft show. Applicants are interviewed and asked to provide samples of their merchandise. One couple, eager to demonstrate that they could design a lively business, photographed a rehearsal booth they had rigged in their living room. 
 About a third of those selected each year are new to the market, though many vendors have been there for years, and some, like Bluecorn Naturals and Monkey Business, which sells toys and ornaments, are among the original merchants.
 The market is modeled loosely on the Christkindlmarkts, the so-called Christ child markets that began in Germany in the late Middle Ages and can still be found around the country. But while the German markets focus on food and drink, the Union Square market, like its sisters, is composed mostly of craftspeople, artisans, retailers who own shops in the city or world travelers who return to New York each year with trunks full of merchandise. One of the only echoes of the original inspiration is the syrupy smell of Gluhwein, a warm, mulled wine that is spiced with cinnamon and sugar -- a staple at German markets and sold at a booth in Union Square.
 The tents, which have wooden sides and floors, are 10 feet long and 6 feet wide (half sizes are available, as are doubles) and are dressed in a red-and-white tarpaulin, with peaked roofs, overhangs and a zippered front to roll open and tuck in. For the four-week season, a full-size booth goes for $12,000. Each one is rigged with electricity to accommodate lights and space heaters, fueled by a large biodiesel generator that hums at the east side of the square. 
 These spaces are transformed into odd little houses whose adornment can be as intricate as their wares. Just as children transform shoeboxes into dioramas, vendors do with their spaces what they will.
 ''I'm not saying it's like nothing I've ever seen in New York,'' said a visitor, a white-haired man named Ron Skinner who this evening was bundled in a red raincoat and whose hands shook with the cold. ''I'm saying it's like nothing I've seen before.'' 
 A RESIDENT of Providence, R.I., Mr. Skinner was in New York with his partner, Anne Henderson, a retired computer scientist; they had come here to celebrate her 62nd birthday. The couple browsed at BaliMade, one of the many businesses that began with a curious traveler caught up in the life of a village across the world, delighted by the local artisans and moved to bring their products home. After wandering the market, Ms. Henderson returned to BaliMade to buy a carved yellow cat that hung on a swing.
 ''Here,'' said Klaus Ronnex-Printz, whose wife, Mick Joseph, runs the company. ''Happy birthday.'' Taking a heart-shaped ornament made of cloves, Mr. Ronnex-Printz dropped it into Ms. Henderson's bag. 
 At the market, success and failure can often feel intensely personal. Pride in a product, so invaluable to themarket's strength, can make it hard on the morale when sales are down, especially when vendors are packed in so tightly and can see one another's crowds, or the lack thereof. And these merchants, who see each other only once a year, but at least for a few weeks, day in and day out, grow close. They look out for one another, gossip, commiserate: A rainstorm! A recession! You've got to be kidding.
 Anxiety is particularly keen this year as dismal economic news provides a glum background for the almost theatrical glow. Mr. Ronnex-Printz, whose wife's company has been at the market for eight years, has noticed apprehension among vendors when they talk about how they're doing.
 ''Of course, it all depends on who they're telling, if it's raining and what day,'' he said. The difference between a bad day and a good day, he estimates, can range from a few hundred dollars to $7,000. But of that $7,000 day, he said, ''it's not going to happen this year.'' 
 Mr. Scott's data is anecdotal. After each season, he surveys vendors about how they fared. Vendors say the past two years have been banner years. But this year, they sense, both mood and sales have been very different, especially on those days that the bad weather seemed to have tag-teamed with Wall Street. 
 Matt Schwartz, the 34-year-old owner of a photography company called She Hit Pause, based in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, could not have been happier on a recent evening, despite sour weather and the recently declared recession. 
 Mr. Schwartz's fashion-inspired Polaroid prints included a hazy nude covered in jellybeans and a moody image of a beach and the sky. They ranged from $65 to $200 and adorned the walls of his red and yellow booth.
 ''What news?'' he said of the economy. ''I just don't read it. My demographic is mainly female, 18 to 35. They're still coming. And students -- they don't have stocks. They don't know what stocks are.''
 Outside the booth, the rain fell in sheets, and in the distance, the summit of the Empire State Building hung hidden in the clouds. 
 ''I'm probably not supposed to feel this confident,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''Maybe ignorance is bliss.'' And, he added: ''I'm young. Thirty-four, no kids. I don't really have that much to lose.''
 There had been a day, though, when he had been particularly worried, and on a whim and in a panic, he had gone home to whip up a batch of smaller, lower-priced prints to sell for under $30. Turned out he did not need them. People were buying, and he kept the smaller prints to give away for promotion. 
 ''In 14 days,'' he said, ''I'd already made back the price of the booth.'' For him, a slow day can mean $60, a good one $3,000.
 ''On one very cold night, I put cardboard boxes on either side of the heater and made a little nest,'' Mr. Schwartz said.
 ''I was huddled with a candle,'' he added, ''writing in my journal: 'If I ever question my prices, or if I'm deserving of success, I will remember this moment.' ''
 JAMIE GOLDHAGEN, the owner of the Monkey Business booth, has been at the market since the beginning, when she was 33. This night, she was wearing a black woolen hat over her black hair, along with rose lipstick perfectly applied. Ms. Goldhagen, who was raised on the Upper East Side, now lives in Bali, where she designs tiny ornaments, among them delicate animals with intricately jointed limbs; sparkling ruby slippers; shimmering golden stars; and little black-winged kittens, two for $5 or $10.
 One night this month, lights from her booth glimmered gold and trembled from the reflections in puddles. All around the market came the sound of rainwater crashing to the ground as vendors emptied their sagging awnings with umbrellas or broom handles.
 Alexandre Sazonov, Ms. Goldhagen's next-door neighbor, stepped into Monkey Business for a cigarette and a dance. He took both her hands in his own, and the two of them danced a few small steps in the booth's tiny quarters. The ornaments sparkled above. 
 ''My booth is usually slammed,'' Ms. Goldhagen said when the dance ended. ''But I've been having zero price resistance.''
 She has a way with people, a loud and easy wit. She calls her customers honey or pussycat and implores them to make purchases. ''Buy something, please!'' she had called out to a customer earlier that day. ''So I can put my French poodles through college!''
 At 7 the next evening, the rain still strong, a New York University professor of Spanish named Carlos Martinez strolled with Judith Nemethy, a colleague in the department. Ms. Nemethy bought a pair of leather gloves from the same booth that she buys gloves every year, then bade Mr. Martinez goodnight.
 He then headed off to find a jeweler's called Coko, from whom in previous years he had purchased gifts for his wife, among them earrings and a pendant, each containing a tiny, delicate photograph of a tree set in sterling silver. This year he was back in search of a ring. 
 His wife has very small fingers, size 4 1/2, he told Cornelia Koller, who runs Coko, and she promised to check in her studio to see if she had something appropriate. Mr. Martinez told her he had been a customer years ago, and how much he enjoyed her work. 
 They shook hands warmly across the counter, and he stood, only partly sheltered by the awning, his leather shoulder bag darkening with rain, to chat a little longer. ''I will come back,'' he promised. And he did.

HEADLINE: Jobless, Networking and Hoping to Work

BYLINE: By FRAN SILVERMAN

 BODY:
STAMFORD, Conn.
SOME were newly unemployed, some had been looking for more than a year and others were trying to make the transition to a new career, but got caught up in the frozen recessional job market. Over eggs, soup and coffee, the members gathered at a local diner to offer one another possible job leads, connections, helpful Web sites -- and mostly comfort.
Armed with pens, pencils, clipboards and business cards -- and their anxieties about the future -- the unemployed workers, whose occupations varied widely from dance instructor to tech support, spent more than an hour at lunchtime at the Bedford Street Diner here discussing their goals and their many frustrations.
Lou Winington, 36, from Monroe, told the group he had been laid off twice from human relations positions in the past three months. 
Leila Dreskin, 24, of Stamford, said she thought she had finally found steady employment as an actuary with a major corporation after years of working at low-paying and hard-to-keep positions as a dance teacher only to be laid off in the fall.
Kenneth Lee, who had worked in information security at I.B.M., said he has been searching for a job for more than a year, and interviews had all but dried up in the past two months. Mr. Lee, 46, of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., said this was the first time he had ever lost a job.
Across the region, business support groups have been swamped with the newly unemployed, whose mantra is network, network, network. Last month saw the biggest number of jobs lost since 1974, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the repercussions are being felt in neighborhoods like these all over the country. Some of those out of work are turning to state unemployment offices to sign up for benefits, but many more are invisible, except in small gatherings like this one popping up all over.
Increasingly, these newly unemployed professionals are reaching out, banding together and getting out from behind the loneliness of their computers to carve a path back to the work force through face-to-face contact.
Steven J. Greenberg, a board member of the Darien Professionals Networking Group who founded a job search Web site for people over 40, said many of those laid off were facing unemployment for the first time in their lives.
''These are people who are in their early 40s, have stellar resumes, tremendous work ethics, always held good jobs and were steadily moving up the chain, and now they find themselves looking for jobs,'' said Mr. Greenberg, of Westport. ''They are all trying to frantically network and build groups as a way back into the job market.''
In Princeton, Trinity Church has started weekly meetings for job hunters, many of whom are high-level executives. Joel Pacheco, a member of the church and a human relations department executive, said many of the attendees are executives who had been laid off from banking and financial positions. He said many were angry at Wall Street's implosion.
''They are saying, 'Why did they let this get out of control?','' Mr. Pacheco said. ''People are going through a mourning process.''
Much of the networking is being fueled by online career and social sites like linkedin.com and meetup.com where job hunters can find groups to attend at the click of a button. Membership surged on linkedin.com to one million new users every two weeks in August and September as the stock market faulted, up from about one million each month, said Krista Canfield, a spokeswoman for the California-based site. Some 1,700 career Meetup groups started in October compared with 550 in July, according to Andres Glusman, vice president for insights and strategies for meetup.com.
AS more people connect online, they are attending an increasing number of networking groups off line that have been springing up in the region.
Michael Arons, a certified public accountant, helped form a new networking group at his synagogue, Beth El in Stamford, after several members told the congregation's rabbi that they had lost their jobs.
''Some of it is career counseling,'' Mr. Arons said. ''The other part is the support side to let people know they are not the only ones out there looking for a job.''
Tony M. Palomba, who helps run the Black Rock Employment Networking Group sponsored by the Black Rock Congregational Church in Fairfield, Conn., said more than 65 people attended a dinner meeting earlier this month.
''We've gone from 20 to 35 to 45 to 65 at our meetings,'' Mr. Palomba said. ''I've been blown away as the numbers keep increasing.''
Mr. Palomba, a financial planner from Shelton who was out of work for almost a year in 2001, said the group strived to do more than just help connect members to job opportunities.
''We focus on encouragement,'' said Mr. Palomba, who makes it a point to meet or to send an e-mail message to every new member who comes to a meeting.
''There is a roller coaster of emotions they are going through, the highs and the lows, the excited moment when they speak to someone about a job but never hear back,'' Mr. Palomba said. ''There is self-doubt. They start to lack appreciation for their abilities. They wonder if they are capable of finding jobs, and are up at one in the morning wondering how they are going to make their mortgage payments. They start to alienate themselves from relationships with friends and family. It breaks people.''
When she was laid off from her law firm about two months ago, Joanne Fanizza, 51, a lawyer from Massapequa Park, quickly reached out to the Long Island Breakfast Club, a networking and unemployed support group.
''I thought, oh well this group sounds like my situation, 50- and 60-year-olds who have been downsized and laid off because of economic times,'' Ms. Fanizza said. ''It's nice to find camaraderie with others who are in the same situation with me.''
At the Bedford Street Diner, some of the attendees said getting out and talking to others made them feel so much better than sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring or sending another resume into cyberspace.
Mr. Winington, who has two children, a wife and a mortgage, said he went door-to-door to find another job as a human relations manager for hotels. He landed one at an upscale hotel in Manhattan only to be laid off three weeks later. He was finding it depressing to apply over the Internet for jobs.
''It's a black hole of press 'send,' '' Mr. Winington said. ''But where does it go?''
Nicole Campbell, 35, of White Plains, a project manager and strategy planner, said she had hit a brick wall with her job search. Ms. Campbell, who recently started her own networking group in Westchester and also attends the Bedford Street Diner group, had tried to make the transition to a new career as a skin care therapist, but that effort floundered when the economy stalled.
''I see jobs on the Internet, people send me jobs, I apply, but how do I get my foot in the door?'' Ms. Campbell asked the group.
''Well, that's the million-dollar question,'' answered Donna Sweidan, a career consultant and therapist who leads the group.
As they swap career war stories and sip their drinks, Ms. Sweidan advised them to check into different job posting sites, update their profiles on linkedin.com and focus their job hunt on specific companies.
''Don't lose hope,'' she said quietly but with cheer. ''Don't fall into the hole.''

HEADLINE: Repent? Evolve? Will Bjork Be There?

BYLINE: By BOB MORRIS. 
Bob Morris is the author of ''Assisted Loving,'' and a former columnist for Sunday Styles.

 BODY:
FORGIVE my indulgence, but I'm going to the Caribbean for the holidays. Yes, I feel guilty about it, but what can I say? I had a good year and it's a nonrefundable trip that was booked before the economic ax fell. This was also before my betrothed and I cavalierly bought a new weekend home at top price just days in advance of the real estate collapse. You'd think I'd figure out some way to cancel the trip and enjoy getting cozy in the new place, with our holidays by the fireplace, friends and family nearby.
But, as the French say, non. I prefer the tropical option, the utter languor, health-defying tanning and guilty pleasure of ordering overpriced drinks while chaise-bound. 
It has not always been so. In my earlier, leaner years, I stayed in Manhattan, avoiding the throngs, high hotel costs and noisy families. I'd tell myself it was great to go to museums and to be invited to urbane New Year's Eve parties. But the city is actually full of tourists during the most wonderful time of the year. And as for New Year's Eve, it eventually became clear that if there were any glamorous parties, I wasn't invited. When I tried to give them myself, I found that too many friends were on some island.
A few years ago, I crossed over to the other side, and we booked a last-minute vacation in Rincon, a surfing town in western Puerto Rico. It was pleasant and eco-friendly but not social enough in the aggressive and boldfaced way I had hoped. So the next year we pushed our way into Tulum, on the Yucatan Peninsula -- another low-rise, eco-friendly area, but with more cachet. We knew people who vacationed there, media-savvy types and social operators who did yoga and wore the right sandals.
But the arrogance of staff and lack of service at our extremely chic hotel was annoying. And all my social machinations to eat dinner with the right people at the right overpriced restaurants became stressful, too. We came home from our oh-so-chic vacation exhausted, and worried about melanomas and credit card bills. If the point was rejuvenation and getting away from it all, we had failed. But at least I could tell people that I was tan because I'd spent my holidays at a hipster resort with yoga mats.
I know. I sound like a deeply superficial person, especially in these times. I mean, along with lowering hemlines, recessions are supposed to raise your spiritual awareness.
One Hollywood friend of mine is going to India this year ''to find profound things'' that will help her come home and see her world ''in a slightly different way,'' she told me. Others are going on service vacations to rebuild homes in devastated areas. Wouldn't this be my moment to figure out how to repent and evolve, too, and then pull out of this year's overpriced vacation at the newest, hippest Blackwell resort in Jamaica?
The reasons to try to cancel are beyond financial. What about the carbon footprints? And how about that it's no longer cold enough at this time of year to justify going away? A proper tropical holiday in these newly sober times would be building a hospital in Haiti, not wondering which malnourished rock star will be sleeping in the next bungalow.
''Gwen Stefani, Bjork and Grace Jones have all stayed there,'' I told an acquaintance about Geejam, the resort where we're booked. ''It's going to be a blast.''
''I thought you were a more reflective person than that,'' she said.
Nope, and it's hard to know how I got this way. But in the great tradition of my generation, I would like to blame my parents, who are deceased and can't argue.
Modest as they were in their spending, they always took my brother and me to warm places for the holidays. My childhood is filled with winter memories of snorkeling, plantain fritters, steel drums and yellow birds called bananaquits.
These annual vacations filled endless reels of Super 8 film transferred to video and DVD. Witness the shot of my fun-loving father in Bermuda shorts on St. Martin, waving to the camera while eating sugar cane, then tripping and falling down a little hill. Here's the footage of him waving with Johnny, an Antiguan musician he befriended who needed to get to his girlfriend on the other side of the island. My father, an impossibly generous man, offered him our rental car and driving lessons because he didn't know how to drive.
The old photo albums I have are full of faded snapshots. In one, my brother and I are dancing with my parents to a Calypso band on Nevis. A few years later, with mouths full of braces, we play with two dogs on a St. Thomas beach. Here is my teetotaler mother in the shimmery white dress she wore for New Year's Eve 1966, when she got sick from too many daiquiris. (I ran around our St. Croix hotel announcing so with misplaced excitement.) Her two-tone hairdo (half dark and half light, like a black and white cookie) was as unfortunate as the sunglasses and sunhats we wore, but we all look as if we are having a ball.
IN later years, my mother, who was born during the Great Depression, became unwell. But when we took those childhood tropical vacations, she was healthy, beautiful and thrilled to have a loving (if somewhat unpredictable) husband and a comfortable life with trips to the Caribbean that she never thought possible in her youth. She didn't care where we stayed or who else was there. The weather was warm, water a dreamy turquoise, and her family was at her side, sun-kissed and entirely happy.
Maybe warm holidays are my way of recreating the easy innocence of childhood, before I knew about things like power tables and insider destinations. Maybe the harsher economic years ahead will teach me to tone down my silly expectations, stop obsessing about status and try to recapture the easy delight my parents had with everything good in their lives. At any rate, when you're used to holidays in the Caribbean, it's hard giving them up. And travel statistics indicate that many people are stuck having to take their expensive vacations right now because it's too late to cancel.
Pity us poor sojourners. We will have to cut back on taxis when we get home.
Meanwhile, I'm dreaming of a tan Christmas, and for that I blame and thank my parents.

HEADLINE: How to Pay for a 21st-Century Military

 BODY:
In recent weeks, this page has called for major changes in America's armed forces: more ground forces, less reliance on the Reserves, new equipment and training to replace cold-war weapons systems and doctrines. 
 Money will have to be found to pay for all of this, and the Pentagon can no longer be handed a blank check, as happened throughout the Bush years. 
 Since 2001, basic defense spending has risen by 40 percent in real post-inflation dollars. That is not counting the huge supplemental budgets passed -- with little serious review or debate -- each year to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Such unquestioned largess has shielded the Pentagon from any real pressure to cut unneeded weapons systems and other wasteful expenses. 
 As a result, there is plenty of fat in the defense budget. Here is what we think can be cut back or canceled in order to pay for new equipment and other reforms that are truly essential to keep this country safe: 
 End production of the Air Force's F-22. The F-22 was designed to ensure victory in air-to-air dogfights with the kind of futuristic fighters that the Soviet Union did not last long enough to build. The Air Force should instead rely on its version of the new high-performance F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which comes into production in 2012 and like the F-22 uses stealth technology to elude enemy radar. 
 Until then, it can use upgraded versions of the F-16, which can outperform anything now flown by any potential foe. The F-35 will provide a still larger margin of superiority. The net annual savings: about $3 billion. 
 Cancel the DDG-1000 Zumwalt class destroyer. This is a stealthy blue water combat ship designed to fight the kind of midocean battles no other nation is preparing to wage. The Navy can rely on the existing DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyer, a powerful, well-armed ship that incorporates the advanced Aegis combat system for tracking and destroying multiple air, ship and submarine targets. The Navy has sharply cut back the number of Zumwalts on order from 32 to two. 
 Cutting the last two could save more than $3 billion a year that should be used to buy more of the littoral combat ships that are really needed. Those ships can move quickly in shallow offshore waters and provide helicopter and other close-in support for far more likely ground combat operations. 
 Halt production of the Virginia class sub. Ten of these unneeded attack submarines -- modeled on the cold-war-era Seawolf, whose mission was to counter Soviet attack and nuclear launch submarines -- have already been built. The program is little more than a public works project to keep the Newport News, Va., and Groton, Conn., naval shipyards in business. 
 The Navy can extend the operating lives of the existing fleet of Los Angeles class fast-attack nuclear submarines, which can capably perform all needed post-cold-war missions -- from launching cruise missiles to countering China's expanding but technologically inferior submarine fleet. Net savings: $2.5 billion. 
 Pull the plug on the Marine Corps's V-22 Osprey. After 25 years of trying, this futuristic and unnecessary vertical takeoff and landing aircraft has yet to prove reliable or safe. The 80 already built are more than enough. Instead of adding 400 more, the Marine Corps should buy more of the proven H-92 and CH-53 helicopters. Net savings: $2 billion to 2.5 billion. 
 Halt premature deployment of missile defense. The Pentagon wants to spend roughly $9 billion on ballistic missile defense next year. That includes money to deploy additional interceptors in Alaska and build new installations in central Europe. After spending some $150 billion over the past 25 years, the Pentagon has yet to come up with a national missile defense system reliable enough to provide real security. The existing technology can be easily fooled by launching cheap metal decoys along with an incoming warhead. 
 We do not minimize the danger from ballistic missiles. We agree there should be continued testing and research on more feasible approaches. Since the most likely threat would come from Iran or North Korea, there should be serious discussions with the Russians about a possible joint missile defense program. (We know the system poses no threat to Russia, but it is time to take away the excuse.) A research program would cost about $5 billion annually, for a net savings of nearly $5 billion.
 Negotiate deep cuts in nuclear weapons. Under the 2002 Moscow Treaty, the United States and Russia committed to reduce their strategic nuclear weapons to between 1,700 and 2,200 each by 2012. There has been no discussion of any further cuts. A successor treaty should have significantly lower limits -- between 1,000 and 1,400, with a commitment to go lower. 
 President-elect Barack Obama should also take all ballistic missiles off hair-trigger alert and commit to reducing the nation's absurdly large stock of backup warheads. These steps will make the world safer. It will give Mr. Obama a lot more credibility to press others to rein in their nuclear ambitions. 
 It is hard to say just how much money would be saved with these reductions, but in the long term, the amount would certainly be considerable. 
 Trim the active-duty Navy and Air Force. The United States enjoys total dominance of the world's seas and skies and will for many years to come. The Army and the Marines have proved too small for the demands of simultaneous ground wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. They are the forces most likely to be called on in future interventions against terrorist groups or to rescue failing states. Reducing the Navy by one carrier group and the Air Force by two air wings would save about $5 billion a year.
 Making these cuts will not be politically easy. The services are already talking up remote future threats (most involving a hostile China armed to the teeth with submarines and space-age weapons). Military contractors invoke a different kind of threat: hundreds of thousands of layoffs in a recession-weakened economy. We are all for saving and creating jobs, but not at the cost of diverting finite defense dollars from real and pressing needs -- or new programs that will create new jobs.
 The cuts above could save $20 billion to $25 billion a year, which could be better used as follows:
 Increase the size of the ground force. The current buildup of the Army and the Marine Corps will cost more than $100 billion over the next six years. Trimming the size of the Navy and Air Force, deferring the deployment of unready missile defenses and canceling the Osprey will pay for much of that. 
 Pay for the Navy's needed littoral combat ships. These ships, which operate in shallow waters to support ground combat, cost about $600 million each. Canceling the DDG-1000 destroyer (more than $3 billion per ship) and the Virginia class submarine (more than $2 billion each) will help provide that needed money.
 Resupply the National Guard and the Reserves. At the present rate for replacing weapons left behind or destroyed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Guard will still be more than 20 percent short of what it needs in 2013. Canceling the F-22 will provide enough money to do better than that years sooner. 
 Some of these changes would have been made already if the Pentagon procurement system were more responsive to present needs and less captive to service and industry lobbyists. Defense Secretary Robert Gates complains about what he calls ''next war-itis,'' the system's built-in preference for what might be needed in potential future wars over what is clearly needed now. Privately, most of the service chiefs concede that their budgets, which have seen little discipline since 9/11, have some margin for cuts. 
 Congress will need to develop a lot more realism and restraint. Lobbyists pushing costly and unneeded weapons systems find ready allies in lawmakers looking to create or protect federally financed jobs in their districts. Big contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics have become masters at spreading those jobs around to assemble broad Congressional voting blocs. Work on the F-22 has been parceled out to subcontractors in 44 states. 
 Mr. Gates, who will stay on, must make reforming the procurement system a priority. The era of unlimited budgets is over, and Mr. Gates needs to make tough calls and stick to them. Congress must give more weight to the nation's overall needs and less to parochial interests. 
 Fixing the Pentagon's procurement process will require the full backing of Mr. Obama. We believe American taxpayers are eager to support changes that would make the country more secure while making more effective use of their money.

HEADLINE: Just Call It Hoosier Baroque

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
COLLATERAL damage from the credit crisis continues to crop up in the most unlikely places. Consider southern Indiana, where the Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative, serving 800,000 farm, small-business and residential customers, is under threat. 
 Unlike many other enterprises today, Hoosier is not in financial distress. It is, in fact, thriving. 
 What imperils the cooperative is the kind of financial alchemy that has magnified our money mess: an atrociously convoluted deal that Hoosier struck with the John Hancock Life Insurance Company in 2002. 
 Because part of that deal is now in jeopardy, John Hancock is trying to force a termination payment of $120 million that could push Hoosier into bankruptcy protection. 
 Problems with the Hoosier-John Hancock transaction are the subject of a lawsuit in federal court in Indianapolis. David F. Hamilton, chief judge in the Southern District of Indiana, recently granted Hoosier's request for a preliminary injunction preventing any termination payment from being made until the dispute between the parties could be resolved. 
 Like most electric cooperatives, Hoosier does not generate significant profits. Any earnings are either kept to offset future losses or returned to members of the cooperative. Its nonprofit status is central to the deal vexing Hoosier today.
 The deal was offered to Hoosier as a way for the cooperative to sell tax losses that it couldn't use to a profit-generating company that could. John Hancock was that company. Known as a ''sale-in, lease-out''-- SILO for short -- the arrangement was fashioned by Babcock & Brown, an Australian investment firm. 
 Detailed in 4,000 pages of fine print, the SILO was a deal that only a Wall Street contortionist could love. Its components included a sale and leaseback, two credit-default swaps and a tax shelter similar to those that the Internal Revenue Service has since deemed abusive. 
 In other words: a veritable trifecta of tortured finance. 
 The investment bankers and lawyers on the deal made out, of course; they generated $12 million in fees, court filings show. 
 Here's how the SILO worked: Hoosier leased some assets at one of its power plants to John Hancock for 63 years, beyond the useful life of the assets. Hancock paid $300 million to Hoosier, which leased the assets back for 30 years, agreeing to make regular payments to Hancock.
 Other nonprofit entities, such as transit authorities in some of the nation's largest cities, did similar deals; several federal agencies blessed the arrangements when they became popular in the early part of the decade.
 Of the $300 million received in the deal, Hoosier kept about $20 million. It deposited the rest with the Ambac Assurance Corporation, a financial guarantor. Ambac got involved because the transaction required an insurer to enter into two credit-default swaps guaranteeing that the lease payments would be made to John Hancock over the life of the deal. If Hoosier defaulted on its obligations under the contract, Ambac would pay John Hancock an early-termination fee, then demand the same amount from Hoosier.
 Since the deal was struck, Hoosier has made all the necessary payments. But problems loomed last June when the credit rating agencies cut Ambac's debt rating to a level that was no longer acceptable under the SILO's terms. 
 Hoosier had 60 days to find a new insurer with stronger ratings. If it failed, Ambac would have to fork over $120 million to John Hancock, then demand that amount from Hoosier. Because Hoosier has already deposited some money with Ambac, the cooperative would have to pay an estimated $110 million over four years. 
 When Hoosier was unable to find a replacement insurer within 60 days, John Hancock gave the cooperative additional time. But it lost patience. On Oct. 23, it informed Hoosier that a default had occurred and that the termination payment of $120 million was due in a week. 
 Oddly, Hancock's notice of default came despite the fact that Hoosier was in final negotiations with Berkshire Hathaway to execute a surety bond to replace the Ambac contract, according to court filings. Hoosier's board had just approved the change when Hancock pulled the plug. 
 Hoosier's creditors started to shut down some of the cooperative's lines almost immediately, the company said. And Judge Hamilton wrote that Hancock's move could force Hoosier into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 
 A filing could have other effects -- like making the cooperative default on hundreds of millions of dollars of other loans, lines of credit and long-term supply contracts. 
 On Nov. 25, the judge granted the temporary restraining order. 
 So why is John Hancock forcing the termination payment issue when a replacement for Ambac seemed imminent? 
 Hoosier has some thoughts on that. It believes that John Hancock is trying to use Ambac's difficulties to generate a quick $120 million. 
 ''Hoosier has been extremely disappointed that John Hancock is using our nation's credit crisis to try to reap a windfall,'' said Reed S. Oslan, a lawyer at Kirkland & Ellis in Chicago representing Hoosier. ''Hancock's position has caused severe economic strain at Hoosier, and it will continue to protect itself as necessary.'' 
 No, no, no, says Jonathan Chiel, John Hancock's chief counsel. He says his company's actions have nothing to do with trying to snare a windfall. ''We only want Hoosier to find a suitable replacement for Ambac,'' he said, ''and we are more than willing to keep the transaction in place under those circumstances.'' 
 The company must also look out for its shareholders, Mr. Chiel said.
 Still, it seems odd that John Hancock is pressing the default even though its deal may run afoul of the I.R.S., as similar
 SILOs have. It could be required to pay back taxes and penalties if the I.R.S. ruled against it. 
 Hoosier is not vulnerable to an adverse I.R.S. ruling on the transaction, other than probably having to repay John Hancock the $20 million or so that it received when the deal was done. Hoosier was careful to ensure that it had no risk or responsibility if the SILO was ruled a sham.
 ''The I.R.S. will certainly deny the tax benefits that Hancock is claiming,'' testified Alan Joseph Bankman, an expert witness in the case who is a professor at Stanford Law School. He told the court that the I.R.S. has offered tax amnesty to entities that have struck SILO deals, if they give up future benefits and return 80 percent of deductions taken. 
 About 80 percent of companies involved in such deals have accepted the I.R.S.'s amnesty offer, the judge said in a recent opinion. 
 But not John Hancock. Its general counsel said the company believes its deal would pass muster with the I.R.S. It has no interest in unwinding it. 
 What a web our financier friends have woven around us. Unhappily, it seems that no one can escape its entanglements.

HEADLINE: Extended Benefits Are a Lifeline for Many Unemployed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: HUDSON, Fla. 

 BODY:
Rick E. Rockwell plopped his large frame down in front of his laptop on Thursday morning, next to a foot-wide sheaf of unpaid bills still in their envelopes, lined up like an accordion on his desk. He logged into his bank account to see if his unemployment check had been deposited yet. 
 His balance, however, remained stuck at $57.17. 
 ''That's amazing to me,'' Mr. Rockwell said. ''It still hasn't posted yet.'' 
 So Mr. Rockwell began another day as a man of the middle class who is now living on an economic precipice.
 Mr. Rockwell, 56, who estimates he has sent out more than 400 job applications over the last year and gone to just four interviews, is one of the more than 5.4 million people across the country receiving unemployment benefits. And Mr. Rockwell is part of arguably the hardest-luck group of all -- those who have been out of work for so long that they are depending on a second emergency extension of unemployment insurance that Congress passed and President Bush signed last month. 
 In the 21 states and the District of Columbia currently with three-month average unemployment rates above 6 percent that means 20 more weeks of what has become an economic lifeline for many in the midst of one of the deepest recessions in the past century. Florida's rate for November was 7.3 percent. (The other states get seven additional weeks.)
 For Mr. Rockwell, who lost his job in January as a sales manager at a computer store that he and his brother owned, the weekly checks of $275 -- the maximum allowed him under Florida law and a little less than half his former take-home pay -- have become like a crucial piece in the game Jenga, in which players construct a tower of blocks by removing one at a time from the bottom and moving it to the top. Mr. Rockwell is playing a balancing act so he can keep the edifice of his former life from crumbling, paying off certain bills and letting others lapse, so he can stay just ahead of his creditors.
 Mr. Rockwell has been without benefits for more than a month after he exhausted the first federal extension, which lasted 13 weeks, on top of the 26 weeks he had received from the State of Florida, back in October.
 After supporters were unable to get the legislation through Congress before the election, Mr. Bush signed the second extension in late November. Florida, like other states, has been rushing to get checks to so-called gap people like Mr. Rockwell whose benefits had expired. Advocates estimate there are about 800,000 of them nationwide. 
 ''States are really overwhelmed in terms of responding to claims,'' said Andrew Stettner of the National Employment Law Project. ''They were pushed beyond the brink in terms of doing the second extension.''
 Florida added 50 staff members to its unemployment insurance division in recent weeks, bringing its total to around 870. It also recently added 345 lines to its phone system for a total of just over 1,000, and has extended its call-in hours.
 There are, of course, people who are much worse off than Mr. Rockwell; but there are also many who have had much more of a financial cushion to get through this crisis. 
 Last year, he was making $31,200 a year as sales manager of a small computer store that he had started 15 years ago with his brother, Rodney. 
 But the rise of big-box stores like Best Buy, along with the recession, combined to drive their store, Comp-U-Save, into the ground.
 ''All of a sudden, the floor came out from underneath it,'' said Rodney Rockwell, who closed his old store in October and re-opened under a new name. 
 The brothers agreed that Rick would leave in January because the store, by that point, was depending mostly on its repair business, which was Rodney's specialty. They also figured that because Rick was younger and had some background managing restaurants, he would be able to find a job relatively easily.
 He had a little over $5,000 in his bank account, mostly what was left over from a $40,000 second mortgage he took out on his home four years ago for home repairs that never materialized. 
 But Mr. Rockwell has been succumbing to a slow economic death, which accelerated significantly in the last month as his unemployment benefits lapsed. 
 His mortgage lender has begun foreclosure proceedings on his modest two-bedroom home, which he bought in 1998 and still owes $117,000 on. He has begun packing to move into his 84-year-old mother's two-bedroom condominium nearby.
 He is in danger of losing his red 2005 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder convertible, a prized possession that he keeps gleaming in his garage, because he is behind in his payments. He has listed for sale both that car and a 1996 Toyota RAV4, which he owns outright and keeps in the driveway, but he is hoping to keep the Spyder. The only reason he can still drive it at all is because his mother, who is mostly living just on Social Security, paid his car insurance for this month. 
 He is two months behind on his electric bill. A partial payment by a local church that he went to recently for help helped him stave off losing his power. His water bill is in arrears as well. 
 Mr. Rockwell was settling into his love seat two weeks ago to watch the teenage drama ''One Tree Hill'' -- an afternoon pleasure he developed while sitting around out of work -- when he found his cable had been cut off.
 Last Wednesday, after returning home from dinner with a reporter, Mr. Rockwell found a note on his door from his neighbor that someone had been looking for him. 
 It turned out to be a collection agency for one of his credit cards. Mr. Rockwell has racked up about $15,000 in bills on various cards, reaching his limit on all but one.
 In a final indignity, Mr. Rockwell wakes up most mornings flat on his back on the ground because the air mattress he now sleeps on, after his waterbed sprang a leak earlier this year, has a hole in it.
 Mr. Rockwell now spends most of his days hunched in front of his laptop. He spends several hours going through new job postings in the morning and then devotes himself to several Internet marketing schemes promising riches that he has stumbled upon.
 Keeping in mind the criticism of those who say expanded unemployment benefits keep people from working, Mr. Rockwell conceded he might appear to be too picky in the jobs he would accept. He has mostly ruled out commuting to Tampa, a much larger city an hour away, because of the distance. He has also tried to confine himself to looking for management-level restaurant jobs. 
 ''I'm not going to clean grills, take out the garbage,'' Mr. Rockwell said. ''I've done that before, but I feel I'm beyond that.''
 His home is overflowing with sports memorabilia -- autographed posters, baseballs and cards of every sort that he has collected. He has sold off some but is reluctant to part with others at fire-sale prices.
 On Thursday, Mr. Rockwell spent several hours plowing through job listings and wound up applying -- or re-applying, actually -- to just two, one for a restaurant manager at an Arby's in nearby New Port Richey and one for a shift supervisor job at a Wendy's in Tampa. 
 He logged into his bank account again the next day and found to his surprise that his unemployment check had finally been deposited. It is a small reprieve for now.

HEADLINE: Nassau and Suffolk Expecting More Funds

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
NASSAU and Suffolk Counties' victory against the United States Census Bureau to have their population counts increased will result in more federal and state money for programs there, officials from both counties say.
 Earlier this month, the Census Bureau accepted new evidence submitted by both counties that boosted their combined population for 2007 by 105,031 from earlier bureau estimates -- up 46,528 in Nassau, to 1,353,061 from 1,306,533, and up 58,503 in Suffolk, to 1,511,732 from 1,453,229. That pushed the estimate for Long Island's population to more than 2.86 million.
 As a result of the higher estimates, over a period of years the economies in Nassau and Suffolk will receive more than $75 million and $95 million, respectively, in state and federal aid for programs and services like Medicaid, Community Development Block Grants, low-income home energy assistance and federal grants for building homes near train stations, officials from both counties said. 
 Census data affects how more than $300 billion in federal and state money is allocated each year to communities for neighborhood improvements, public health, education, transportation and other programs and services.
 Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, said this was the first time either county had contested the Census Bureau population estimates. The bureau undertakes a census every 10 years but updates population estimates annually. 
 The biggest difference will be additional money for Department of Housing and Urban Development programs, said Patricia Bourne, executive commissioner of the Nassau County Planning Commission. 
 ''The extra people counted will mean an additional $750,000 a year in federal funds to be used for Community Development Block Grant programs,'' she said.
 One example of such a program is in downtown Westbury. Homes will be built near the train station, the plaza will be redone and an old movie theater and facades of commercial buildings will be renovated.
 Programs to help the homeless and to develop new housing will also get a boost, Ms. Bourne said. 
 How much more money will flow to such programs is difficult to determine because the amounts are determined by complex formulas, she said.
 Seth Forman, chief planner of the Long Island Regional Planning Council, who coordinated the appeal, said the Census Bureau's method of determining population might have undercounted new immigrants, college students, young adults beginning a career, military personnel and new arrivals in communities that grew. The final decision accepted the numbers submitted by Nassau and Suffolk Counties, with only minor differences, he said.
 For Long Island, the evidence of additional population was based on information provided by the Long Island Power Authority from utility meter hookups and data provided by municipalities on building and demolition figures. 
 To estimate population, LIPA relied on active residential electric meter records. Household population was obtained using a formula that multiplied households by people per household, then added group quarters, which are those places where people live in establishments that are not considered residential households, like health care facilities, jails and dormitories. 
 THE relationship between households (determined from the 2000 census) and meters (from LIPA in 2000) was also used to estimate current households for each village, hamlet and city. Analyses of utility records and field investigations were performed to estimate and then subtract meters that were active but not used because they were at unoccupied homes. 
 Kevin Law, the LIPA chairman, applauded the census victory for Long Island.
 ''It's in LIPA's interest to work with the counties to make sure everyone is counted,'' he said. ''If Long Island receives more federal dollars, it means less to be raised in taxes by the municipalities, and since LIPA pays more than $450 million a year in taxes, any savings will help to lower LIPA rates.''

HEADLINE: Those Ample, Good Old Days (This Year)

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
THE New York theater, like virtually every other enterprise in America, appears to be heading for some lean times. In recent years new shows often had to fight for access to a Broadway theater at the height of the spring and fall seasons. With a half-dozen Broadway shows, including the big-ticket musicals ''Hairspray'' and ''Young Frankenstein,'' closing on the first Sunday of the new year alone -- Black Sunday on the Rialto? -- there are clear indications that the boom times may be over. 
 At least this bygone era of amplitude is ending on a note of unusual aesthetic strength. Many of the marquee events of the last year on Broadway were superb examples of high-end stagecraft at its most rewarding. Lincoln Center Theater's ''South Pacific'' brought a soft human glow to a musical best known to many from the synthetic movie version of 1958. The gorgeously realized production of ''The Seagull,'' led by a radiant Kristin Scott Thomas, restored the luster to the oft-abused star-driven model of theatrical resurrection. And ''Billy Elliot'' arrived on our shores with unusual timeliness, offering the sweet release of escapism alongside a bracing dose of truth telling. We cannot all jete our way into a dreamy future, after all, although we can share in Billy's soaring journey to self-fulfillment for a few hours. 
 All of those shows could handily have made my list of the most memorable nights spent at the theater this year. But in the interest of spreading the wealth -- the wealth of critical approbation, at least -- I've decided to limit my selection to shows I covered this year. There was more than enough to stuff the annual stocking. 
 ADDING MACHINE Small, dark and spellbinding, this Chicago-born musical adaptation of Elmer Rice's expressionist classic proved that adventures in new musical making aren't limited to the fringes of New York. With a prickly, varied score by Joshua Schmidt and Jason Loewith, this tale of an Everyman downsized into oblivion now looks spookily prescient, capturing as it did the view from the bottom of the American barrel just as the shadows of economic collapse began to gather. 
 CHEKHOV LIZARDBRAIN Along with the first-rate production of the Sarah Kane play ''Blasted'' at Soho Rep, this spellbinding curiosity from the Pig Iron Theater Company of Philadelphia was the gem of the Off Off Broadway season. The superlative actor James Sugg played a man locked in the echoing chambers of his mind, endlessly recalling his encounters with a trio of brothers he yearns to connect with. 
 ECCENTRICITIES OF A NIGHTINGALE Although I didn't review this small production of Tennessee Williams's revised version of ''Summer and Smoke,'' I'm including it because it brought my attention to the Actors Company Theater, one of several enterprising little outfits -- the Red Bull Theater, the Mint Theater and the Keen Company are others -- striving to keep some diversity in the spin cycle of reviving old plays. (''Hedda Gabler,'' again?)
 GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS Martha Clarke's landmark dance-theater work, first created in 1984, looked ageless in a revised production at the Minetta Lane Theater. A hallucinatory meditation on a triptych by Hieronymus Bosch, this beautifully danced drama charts the human journey from innocence to experience with a physical grace that brought out the scary beauty in the idea of going straight to hell. 
 LIZA'S AT THE PALACE... Technically I didn't review Liza Minnelli's return to New York after a turbulent six years, but Ms. Minnelli is an exception to every rule. The voice may have lost a measure of power and suppleness, but Ms. Minnelli's intensity and generosity glow more brightly than ever in this captivating concert performance, culminating in an ebullient tribute to Kay Thompson, Ms. Minnelli's beloved godmother.
 ON THE TOWN The fall celebration of Leonard Bernstein's 90th birthday hosted by the Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall also occasioned a zesty concert version of his first Broadway show from Encores! To hear Bernstein's score played in its entirety was to feel in your bones the giddy charge of excitement of an artist embracing his subject -- the rude, bustling glory of New York City -- with a gusto that still sings in every bar of music.
 OUR TOWN David Cromer, who also directed ''Adding Machine,'' staged a modest but wonderfully resonant production of Thornton Wilder's evergreen at a funky theater in Chicago. Employing a youthful cast in contemporary costume, this gifted director scrubbed away the sentimental gloss that often obscures the plangent feeling -- and cosmic darkness -- in Wilder's drama. Look for Mr. Cromer to restage the production in New York this winter. 
 PASSING STRANGE The heartbreak of the year on Broadway was the cometlike run of the singer-songwriter Stew's theatrical memoir of his own sentimental education. Bold, fresh and fired by a surging rock score, the musical won plaudits but couldn't stick around long enough, Broadway economics being what they are, to break through to a mainstream audience. 
 STREAMERS Scott Ellis, a regular (if uneven) director for the Roundabout Theater Company, brought a firm hand and a fresh young cast to this potent revival of David Rabe's 1976 drama about the racial and sexual tensions among soldiers getting ready to ship out for Vietnam.
 WHAT'S THAT SMELL: THE MUSIC OF JACOB STERLING The wonderfully unappetizing title is a clear clue that this is not the songbook of a Broadway composer you've never heard of. It's a brilliant sendup of the more absurd impulses of musical-theater composers, written by and starring the terrific David Pittu. The show has transferred from the Atlantic Theater Company's smaller stage to New World Stages. Anyone exasperated -- or fascinated -- by the often solipsistic mind-set of musical theater lovers should pay Jacob a visit.

Who gets it right? According to a recent survey by Forrester Research, the businesses that leave customers the most satisfied are retailers, hotels and insurance companies. Who is more likely to get it wrong? The industries with the lowest scores included Internet service providers, TV service providers and health insurance plans. 
 Consumers evaluated 114 companies in 12 industries on their usefulness, ease of use and enjoyability. The individual companies that received the highest scores were Barnes & Noble, the credit-card provider USAA, Borders, Amazon and Costco. At the bottom were the Internet service of Charter Communications, Medicaid, the health plan Blue Shield of California, and the TV services of Charter and Time Warner Cable.
 It could be argued that things like books are easier to get right -- they don't have wires or complicated service plans. Still, it might behoove the industries at the bottom of the list to see if they can borrow a few tactics from those at the top. PHYLLIS KORKKI

HEADLINE: Tough And Tougher

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
WITH sales of co-ops and condominiums in New York City slowing to a virtual trickle in recent weeks, many brokers suspect that would-be buyers are sitting back and hoping to time their apartment purchases to coincide with the exact moment that the real estate market finally hits bottom. 
 Some sellers, meanwhile, are considering renting their homes instead of selling them in hopes of avoiding that bottom. And if they are trying to sell co-ops, they are hoping that the co-op board will loosen the rules and help widen the buyer pool by allowing the purchase of pieds-a-terre or permitting parents to buy for children. 
 But brokers, lawyers, property managers and co-op board members agree that if anything, co-op boards are going in the opposite direction -- more carefully scrutinizing potential buyers and establishing tougher financial requirements. 
 ''No one is loosening their admissions policies,'' said Stuart M. Saft, a lawyer and the chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. ''What's going on in the market has just reconfirmed their belief that they have to be watchful of who they let into the building.''
 The rigorous financial review that most co-op boards have long required of buyers is precisely what has kept the foreclosure rate in New York City extremely low, Mr. Saft said.
 ''Boards feel that protecting all of the residents of the building through strict policies is the best thing they can do,'' he said.
 Frederick Warburg Peters, the president of Warburg Realty, says that boards are not likely anytime soon to relax rules on who can buy into their buildings. ''A co-op board tends to see itself as a guardian of the shareholders who remain in a building,'' Mr. Peters said, ''not as a facilitator of sellers.'' 
 With financial markets in crisis and unemployment rising by the hour, many co-op boards are looking very skeptically at buyers who have large stock portfolios or who earn much of their income in year-end bonuses that may not materialize.
 To counter that and to satisfy the concerns of co-op boards, these buyers are finding that they must either increase their down payment to 50 percent of the sale price or more, or put six months' to two years' worth of maintenance into an escrow account.
 Some boards have also made it clear that they prefer buyers with fixed-rate mortgages over those with adjustable-rate mortgages; buyers with interest-only mortgages need not apply. These are not the sorts of requirements that appear in the bylaws or the house rules, but in this market, word gets out quickly after a board rejection.
 ''If you get a board turndown, you can ask how to improve the application,'' said Richard Grossman, the executive director of downtown sales for Halstead Property. ''I've seen some approvals lately where the board tried to work with the buyer, either by asking for money in escrow for maintenance or for additional down payment to increase the equity in the apartment.''
 Robert J. Rosa, an executive vice president at Century 21 NYC, said that's exactly what happened in a recent deal. He represented a father buying an alcove studio for his daughter on East 21st Street. The father, an investment banker, planned to take out an interest-only mortgage even though he had about $10 million in liquid assets and could easily have paid cash for the studio. 
 Board members told Mr. Rosa that they wanted the father to get a fixed-rate mortgage. And because the daughter earns only about $50,000 a year, they also requested that a year's worth of maintenance, about $10,000, be put in escrow. The buyer said he would agree to those terms, even though it would increase the mortgage rate and require a higher down payment, but he told Mr. Rosa to seek a 20 percent price reduction from the seller.
 ''I said: 'You're crazy, the owner won't agree to that,' '' Mr. Rosa recalled. But to his surprise, the owner agreed to about a 10 percent reduction.
 ''He was annoyed, but in this market, he didn't want to lose the deal,'' Mr. Rosa said. The apartment, which had been listed at $517,000, sold for $462,000.
 These kinds of circumstances have inadvertently given co-op boards much more authority over deals than they had when they merely said yes or no to a potential buyer, according to Paul Gottsegen, the director of property management at Halstead.
 He said he had seen several deals recently in which co-op boards had asked for a year's maintenance in escrow and, rather than risk losing the buyers, the sellers had agreed to put the money into the account on behalf of the buyers. ''Buyers are scarce and sellers are anxious,'' he said. ''So a board's determination can give it a great deal of power over the actual contract between the buyer and the seller.''
 Real estate agents say they have also heard of co-op boards that rejected applications because they believed the sale price was too low and would adversely affect the values of other apartments in the building. 
 Lisa Lippman, a senior vice president at Brown Harris Stevens, says such behavior is characteristic of transitional markets.
 ''Everything is going to be below 2007 prices, and it's going to take awhile for boards to get used to those prices,'' she said. ''But the risk they run is: if they reject a contract for being too low, the next one could be even lower.''
 A co-op board that believes it is protecting property values by rejecting low bids is being unrealistic, said Richard Siegler, a Manhattan lawyer who represents about 150 co-ops. ''You can't keep prices fixed forever,'' he said. ''And it affects everybody at some point, because eventually nobody can sell their apartments.''
 If the market slowdown follows the pattern of previous ones, one area where co-ops may start to loosen up is subletting. Brokers and property managers said they expected to see that happen next summer, about nine months into the market's decline. 
 ''It's only when shareholders have had their places on the market for nine months or longer that it's clear there's trouble, and they become clamorous for help,'' said Mr. Peters of Warburg.
 Mr. Siegler said that co-op boards had used subletting as a safety valve in previous downturns. If an owner has already moved out, renting the apartment might prevent that owner from going into default and could also ensure that the building continues to collect maintenance charges for the apartment. ''Subletting would allow them to continue owning until prices go back up and the market is stabilized,'' he said.
 At Two Fifth Avenue, a 20-story building with more than 300 apartments, Adelaide Polsinelli, the co-op board president, said that several shareholders had already asked if they could rent their apartments as an alternative to selling.
 The building previously allowed sublets for only one year in the entire ownership of a shareholder or two years if a shareholder could prove hardship. But the board decided this month to extend the limit to two years for all shareholders and up to three years in the event of hardship.
 ''It was in response to the times -- a way to give people options and pre-empt them from having to struggle,'' Ms. Polsinelli said. ''I've been around a cycle or two, and I thought I'd try to get in front of the problem.''

HEADLINE: At the Crest of a Greek Wave

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN

 BODY:
''So is Greek the new Thai?'' a dining companion asked me not long ago. Could be. Despite an economic climate about as hospitable to new ventures as the Aegean is to polar bears, casual Greek restaurants are springing up all over New Jersey.
 About time, you might say. What's not to like about Greek food? Those long, flowing names -- spanakopita, taramosalata. The bright, clear, bracing flavors, like sea wind through cypresses. The often gentle prices. The dietary virtues: If done right, this cuisine is all but incapable of being heavy or muddled. 
 Vasili Mastrokostas does it right. A 58-year-old native of Missolonghi, on Greece's west coast, he came to New Jersey in 1978. Like many of his countrymen, he started out washing dishes in a diner, working his way up to owner of a cafe in Leonia. He sold the place there and opened Vasili's Taverna, in neighboring Teaneck, in January 2007. Along the way he married Catherine O'Mara, from Dublin, who still translates for him and runs the front of the house.
 It's a little house, with just 40 seats, in a storefront across the street from a big wine market -- a lucky thing, because you must bring your own bottle. (The Greek word taverna means small restaurant, not tavern.) The decor is cheery and evocative: One long sky-blue wall is hung with sea-blue shutters that open on a painted Greek harbor.
 Fittingly, much of the food just about swims to your table. Mr. Mastrokostas haunts the region's seafood markets, his wife says, and a sidewalk chalkboard advertises daily specials like red mullet, whiting and whole sardines. 
 In the Greek manner, fish get the simplest possible treatment. The Platonic ideal is boned (if necessary), filleted (or left whole), brushed with olive oil, lemon juice and herbs, flung onto a charcoal grill and delivered to the table a bare 15 minutes after you've ordered it. There are variations, of course: The octopus is tenderized through long marination, so it's imbued with lemon and olive oil, along with the smoke of the grill. Served with sweet red peppers, it is tender and meaty and dense -- a great, elemental appetizer.
 Vasili's does small things well, too. The bread basket -- pita triangles and sliced peasant bread, all of it singed on the grill -- comes with a ramekin of mild hummus. Melitzanes salata, or eggplant salad, comes in a pale ball that looks a bit unappetizing but shimmers with flavor. 
 The stuffed grape leaves called dolmades are exceptionally fresh and tangy. Zucchini ''meatballs'' (really, meatless croquettes) have a surprising lightness and a lively upper register of dill. And in an appetizer called feta fotias, humble feta is grilled until blistered, elastic and smoky -- a whole new cheese.
 While there's no faulting the treatment of seafood, the accompaniments can be mundane -- pale, flavor-deprived roasted potatoes, overcooked peas. The two meat dishes we tried were pleasant enough, but reminiscent of diner food: chewy lamb kebabs with peppers, onions and tomatoes, over a heap of rice; and moussaka, the layered dish of eggplant, potatoes, ground beef and a thick, nutmeggy stratum of bechamel sauce.
 Those minor disappointments did have the virtue of steering our attention back to the fish. The red mullet, for example: four six-inch specimens, left whole and pan-fried with a minimum of breading. They had a haunting, almost gamy flavor. Sauteed fillet of sole was buttery and tender. And a simple mixed grill of salmon, sole, octopus, squid and shrimp was simply beautiful, every ingredient precisely cooked and filled with character.
 On top of everything else, Mr. Mastrokostas makes the desserts from scratch, including diner-worthy rice pudding (in this context that's a compliment) and a wonderfully crisp and tender baklava. If Greek is indeed the new Thai, he's a perfect ambassador. His English may be limited, but his cooking needs no translation.

HEADLINE: ... And No Renovations in the Lobby

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
WITH the recession taking firm hold and the number of jobs lost in New York City expected to grow by as many as 150,000, co-op boards across the city are doing what they can to help keep costs down for shareholders. 
 As boards determine next year's budgets, many are opting to postpone large projects to help minimize increases in maintenance charges.
 ''Boards are concerned about passing along increases, and they're taking a hard look at projects that might be discretionary,'' said John Janangelo, the president of Bellmarc Property Management, which manages more than 50 buildings in Manhattan and Queens.
 Dated lobbies and dowdy hallways may not get a makeover for another year, he said, and upgrades on security cameras or health clubs may also be deferred. But repairs on essential systems like air-conditioning or boilers will still be approved. 
 And if there is anything positive in the economy's implosion, it's a decrease in fuel costs. There were big spikes in energy costs in the last two years, which put maintenance increases at 10 percent on average. But maintenance increases in 2009 will probably be much lower, Mr. Janangelo said.
 At 300 Riverside Drive, the co-op board made several decisions that will ultimately reduce the overall monthly bill for shareholders in 2009. ''We did these things because we understand that these are difficult times,'' said Jon Reiner, the co-op board president.
 The building had a net gain of $500,000 when it refinanced its mortgage at a lower rate this fall, and the board initially planned to use that money to shore up its reserve fund, redesign the lobby and begin construction on a roof deck. Because of the economic downturn, the board decided to proceed with the lobby renovation but put off the roof deck.
 The board also voted to use some of the proceeds from the refinancing to retire debt, which will eliminate a monthly assessment worth about 6 percent of each shareholder's monthly maintenance. Even with a 3 percent increase in maintenance fees, shareholders will still get a 3 percent reduction in overall costs. 
 ''In other years, we might have decided to proceed with the roof deck,'' Mr. Reiner said. ''But what we're doing will be a benefit to shareholders in the tough year that we will be facing.''

HEADLINE: Museum Growth Meets Hard Times

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
THE grand opening of the Newseum's new building in Washington last spring was upbeat and festive. A trained eagle flew across the sky. Confetti cannons shot colorful flakes toward the clouds. A block party on Pennsylvania Avenue continued inside with speeches by luminaries like the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and John G. Roberts Jr., chief justice of the United States. Visitors poured in, and attendance has since remained strong despite the economic downturn and a $20 admission fee.
 Nonetheless in the last few months the museum, which focuses on the history of news reporting and specializes in hands-on exhibits, has been struggling to adjust to a new world. In challenges paralleling those facing other cultural institutions, the Newseum has seen its endowment shrink by roughly 25 percent, to about $450 million from $600 million. Some 20 employees, 10 percent of the staff, have accepted buyouts. And the museum's $50 million annual operating budget is expected to drop by about 10 percent. 
 ''I was certainly surprised and dismayed we would have to do that,'' Joe Urschel, the museum's executive director and senior vice president, said of the cutbacks. ''I also was not prescient enough to see this coming economic collapse.''
 Opening a new building or wing is always a gamble for arts organizations. The potential payoff is a surge in visitors and visibility, but there is also the burden of higher operating expenses and the pressure to draw big crowds. An economy like this one, in which charitable donations have steeply declined and many people just stay home, makes such new chapters even more difficult.
 ''Many organizations have an edifice complex -- they're so excited by the glory of a new facility,'' said Michael M. Kaiser, the president of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, who trains arts managers. ''Now it's particularly challenging because the pool of money is smaller.''
 As of early December about 365,000 people had visited the Newseum since the $450 million building, designed by Polshek Partnership, opened in April, Mr. Urschel said. In Arlington, Va., where the museum was previously located and admission was free, annual attendance reached 480,000 at its peak. Charles L. Overby, the museum's chief executive, said he expected to surpass that by April based on figures so far. 
 ''We didn't know what to expect as a paid museum on Pennsylvania Avenue,'' said Mr. Overby, who is also chief executive of the Freedom Forum, which runs the museum. 
 As part of the cuts, Mr. Overby said, the Newseum will scale back spending on video productions and the acquisition of artifacts. The Newseum also expects to draw more heavily on its endowment: 6 to 8 percent, rather than the typical 5 percent, Mr. Urschel said.
 The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History reopened on Nov. 21 after a two-year, $85 million renovation designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. In the first two weeks -- with the benefit of Thanksgiving weekend tourism -- attendance was ''phenomenal,'' said the director, Brent D. Glass; over the first 12 days 200,000 visitors streamed through the doors. 
 Even though the building was not completely ready, ''we pushed hard to open before Thanksgiving,'' he said. ''We're 98 percent where we wanted to be in terms of all the finish work, but there's a punch list we're going to work through over the winter.'' 
 Admission is free, as it is at all Smithsonian museums, which presents a special challenge. Mr. Glass said he anticipated even more visitors during the economic recession and worried about accommodating the large numbers, particularly people flocking to crowd-pleasing exhibits like the Star-Spangled Banner and one on Lincoln that opens in January, or a gallery devoted to popular entertainment that features Judy Garland's shoes from ''The Wizard of Oz.''
 ''The popular culture collection is enormously popular,'' Mr. Glass said. ''People will stand in line for half an hour to see the ruby slippers.''
 The museum's hopes hinge on spending in its shops and cafes, given that the institution must raise $8 million to $10 million in operating expenses each year. ''Will they continue to spend and buy food and buy gifts and buy souvenirs?'' Mr. Glass said. ''That's what's unknown right now.''
 In New York two museums cut the ribbon in a similarly shaky climate: the Museum of Arts and Design at Columbus Circle and the Brooklyn Children's Museum in Crown Heights both opened in September.
 Officials at these museums said they were encouraged by the public response so far. ''Attendance has way exceeded our expectations,'' said Holly Hotchner, the director of the Museum of Arts and Design, where admission is $15 but free for members. 
 But she added that fund-raising for the $90 million building project, a sweeping redesign by Brad Cloepfil of Edward Durell Stone's 1964 structure, had been tough. She said the museum had trimmed its $11 million annual operating budget to around $10 million, mainly by delaying the opening of a couple of big exhibitions for a year. 
 The museum had hoped to build its endowment to $20 million by 2010, Ms. Hotchner said. That may have been overly optimistic. With pledges, officials expect that the endowment will reach about $13 million in 2009. Salaries are frozen; there will be no raises this year. 
 ''People on the board have been hit dramatically,'' Ms. Hotchner said. ''This year is going to be challenging for everyone.''
 The Brooklyn Children's Museum, designed by Rafael Vinoly, has greeted more than 76,000 visitors since it opened, 34 percent more than projected. As a result the museum has increased its attendance goal to 225,000 for the current fiscal year, ending in June. Admission is $7.50 per person and free for members. 
 ''I'm pleased that the economic environment isn't affecting families' '' attendance, said Carol Enseki, the museum's president.
 Membership has tripled, to 3,300 from 1,100, since July, so the museum has increased its target to 5,000 by the end of the fiscal year. In moving to the new building the institution raised its annual operating budget to $6.5 million from $5.4 million. (It had planned on $7 million but later cut back on expenditures like bringing in outside performers and developing new programs.) 
 ''Even with all the planning in the world,'' Ms. Enseki said, ''you can't anticipate situations like what we're facing now.''

HEADLINE: Financial Time Bombs

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUELFER and JIM RICKARDS. 
Charles Duelfer, the former director of the Iraq Survey Group, is the author of the forthcoming ''Hide and Seek: The Search for Truth in Iraq.'' James Rickards was general counsel of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management and oversaw its rescue by the Federal Reserve.

 BODY:
THE economic crisis has made it painfully obvious that the United States economy has become very vulnerable to broken gears in the global financial system. But this is not simply a financial or economic problem -- it is a grave national security risk, and our government must treat it as such.
 Historically, Washington's national security and financial apparatuses have operated independently. Intelligence analysts have focused on explicit threats posed by weapons and conflicts. Those parts of the government charged with ensuring economic health have a different mind-set, monitoring capital markets where they assume threats are not malicious, but competitive in nature. This needs to change. 
 For a model, consider the evolution that took place in the 1990s with respect to cyber-threats. While this was initially the preserve of information technology experts and companies, government officials came to recognize the enormous potential threats to the power grid, the Internet and government computer systems. 
 In terms of economic security, however, a complicating factor is that financial experts and national security officials view risk in very different ways. The meltdown on Wall Street is largely a result of an overriding incentive to see risks as low. The group dynamic among financial houses was to lend more under more precarious conditions -- if you didn't, a competitor would, and he would generate greater near-term returns, lure more investors and get a higher bonus.
 Conversely, the national security community, tends to maximize risk assessments. Aerospace companies sell more weapons if the threat is judged to be increasing. National security analysts don't get jobs if they say there is no danger. It's all about playing up risk -- sometimes too far, as the miscalculation over Iraqi weapons of mass destruction threat showed. 
 Despite these divergent views of risk, the talents of professionals in the capital markets and national security experts must be combined if America is to identify and respond to financial threats.
 For example, while China has behaved appropriately during the global financial crisis, there is no doubt that its enormous reserves give it de facto veto power over some of Washington's interest rate and exchange rate policies. What would we have done if Beijing had responded differently? And the desires of Russia (then fighting in Georgia) were a consideration during the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts, because it is one of the largest holders of government agency debt. 
 Al Qaeda has declared that damage to the American economy is its second most important goal after mass casualties. Presently, who would warn the White House if foreign entities made a concerted attack on our financial system? Who is charged with detecting such activity? 
 The Obama administration needs to place a new priority on the national security implications of capital and commodities markets. The National Security Council needs to draw together the powerful talents and tools from segregated agencies to tackle the problem. 
 Our spy agencies alone lack the direction and specialized expertise to provide the real-time market analysis required. It calls for talent more likely found among hedge fund managers and open-market traders. After all, the data does not need to be captured clandestinely -- much is readily available from exchanges, brokers and other open sources. Quick analysis -- with the sorts of quantitative engines traders use, redesigned for national financial security objectives -- may be the most critical aspect. 
 There is a tremendous range of global threat indicators that can be gleaned from careful scrutiny of trading activity. For example, in August 2006 an unexplained decline in certain airline stocks took place shortly before the arrests in Britain of terrorists plotting to blow up trans-Atlantic airliners. 
 The global financial meltdown is going to give our enemies new ideas to create economic havoc. We don't have much time to plan our response.

HEADLINE: The Carver One, a Truly Lean Machine, Tilts Like a Motorcycle

BYLINE: By NICK KURCZEWSKI

 BODY:
's-Gravendeel, the Netherlands
THE Carver One resembles a giant mechanical insect, yet its bizarre looks give no hint that the three-wheeler has moves to rival a ''Dancing With the Stars'' finalist.
It works like this: When steering into a corner, the front wheel and the passenger cabin lean like a motorcycle. Flick the steering wheel back and forth and the Carver bobs left and right like a prizefighter dodging jabs. 
Meanwhile, the two rear wheels, along with the 4-cylinder engine mounted between them, remain parallel to the road. Hold the steering steady and the cabin quickly rights itself.
Engineered in the Netherlands and built in Germany, the Carver One is promoted as the world's only available tilting car. Its balancing act is controlled by a high-tech hydraulic system that Carver calls Dynamic Vehicle Control. Linked to the steering, it calculates a lean angle based on vehicle speed and the cornering forces on the front wheel.
The Carver One tilts to a 45-degree maximum, which could be handy for picking up dropped change at a parkway toll booth or a fast food drive-thru.
As appealing as that may sound in today's economy, don't head off to the local auto mall for a test drive; the Carver is not offered in the United States (and sales this year will total only about 200, the company said). My test drive required a trip to the headquarters of Carver Europe, here in the western part of the Netherlands, about 15 miles southeast of Rotterdam.
Anton van den Brink, the company's co-founder, said the idea for the Carver came to him while he was stuck in a Paris traffic jam about 20 years ago. Noticing that most cars had only a driver inside, he reasoned that a small three-wheel car would be vastly more efficient for transporting one or two people. A narrow vehicle would take up less space while minimizing wind resistance and improving fuel economy.
Beginning in the early 1990s, Mr. van den Brink, along with his sons, Chris and Peter, and a small group of engineers, began development of the car. The team spent years perfecting the tilting mechanism, which is designed to lower the center of gravity in turns and keep the skinny three-wheeler from tipping over. Eighteen systems were tested before they settled on a control unit.
''Traditional sports cars are sold with the g-kick,'' said Mr. van den Brink, referring to the g-forces -- that exciting (or nausea-inducing) punch to the stomach -- felt when accelerating quickly or cornering sharply. ''We have our own kick, the tilting kick.''
That kick doesn't come cheap. In the Netherlands a base model costs 48,000 euros, or roughly $68,000. It is on sale now in Europe and places as far-flung as Japan, South Korea and New Zealand.
The Carver's three-wheel layout makes it eligible to be registered as a motorcycle in many countries. This often saves customers money on taxes and licensing fees, but it also means the Carver comes without air bags, traction control or air-conditioning.
In person, the Carver One looks like a cross between a motorcycle and Mothra. It's not pretty, but like a skyscraper-eating insect, it gets noticed. The only door is on the left side, and it opens wide to reveal a two-place, tandem-seat layout. The back seat is not for the modest; the passenger's legs are splayed to either side of the driver.
Life is better up front. The driver's seat has wide bolsters and because the windshield curves up and over the driver's head, forward visibility is excellent. The side windows are huge, and the hardtop can be removed to let the sun in. But check the weather forecast beforehand: the Carver has almost zero luggage space, so if you choose to drive al fresco, you'll have to leave the top at home.
The tilting system is locked out in reverse and below 5 miles an hour. Once up to speed, the 1,400-pound Carver begins its acrobatics. Turn the steering wheel and the entire cabin heels over, changing your perspective to a wide angle shot of the road ahead, the sky above and a blur of asphalt creeping closer and closer to the side window. Once you learn to trust the D.V.C. system, the Carver One feels like an amusement park ride.
Unfortunately, its acceleration is more of a tea-cup ride than Space Mountain. The 68-horsepower 659 cc 4-cylinder engine needs 8.2 seconds to haul the Carver to 60 miles an hour. Good fuel economy somewhat offsets the lethargy: Carver estimates the mileage at 40 miles a gallon in mixed city and highway driving.
A more powerful engine is under development, though what the car begs for is an automatic or paddle-shift gearbox. In fast corners, with the Carver at full tilt and the world at a 45-degree angle, it's nearly impossible to find the correct gear in the H-gate shifter near one's right knee. It doesn't help that the 5-speed manual requires a gorilla-strength shove to slot it into gear.
The Carver One isn't perfect, but it's still a ridiculous amount of fun to drive. When I wasn't cursing the gearbox -- or waving at people snapping photos on their cellphones -- I was laughing out loud. Future versions, including the model planned for the United States, promise to be even leaner and greener.
That is because Carver Europe has licensed its tilting technology to a California-based company, Venture Vehicles. Howard Levine, the co-founder of Venture Vehicles, said his company planned to produce a more affordable, more aerodynamic, electric-powered version of the Carver for the United States by ''2010 or 2011.''

HEADLINE: Hit With a Double Crisis, And Coming Back Slowly

BYLINE: By ABBY AGUIRRE

 BODY:
She started working at Brooks Brothers in 1977, in accounts payable; he in 1979, in purchasing. They made eyes in the elevator. He looked for reasons to borrow envelopes. Their first date was on Feb. 14, 1980. Less than two years later, in his best suit -- solid navy, flannel, three-piece -- he proposed under the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center.
 Their last date, too, fell on a Feb. 14, decades later, in 2007. They came home to their Queens apartment from work -- she still in accounts payable, now at Finlay Fine Jewelry, he now in sales, still at Brooks Brothers -- to music playing, eggplant sandwiches and a note from their two children: ''Happy Valentine's Day, Mom and Dad.'' 
 ''The trouble,'' as they call it, began two weeks later, when Catherine Cossentino, 57, lost her job. She and her husband, Joe Cossentino, 49, might have managed without her $43,000 salary if, three weeks after that, his lungs had not collapsed.
 At the hospital, doctors discovered that Mr. Cossentino had Brugada syndrome, a kind of cardiac arrhythmia that carries a risk of sudden death. He underwent emergency heart surgery.
 As their income took another hit -- his $50,000 yearly salary fell to $184.75 a week in disability payments -- doctors added diabetes to his list of ailments, which also included asthma, hypothyroid disease and three herniated disks. Brooks Brothers co-workers took a $600 collection to his hospital bed, but with bills piling up, Mr. Cossentino asked to go back to work.
 ''Your wife should be standing at your casket,'' one doctor told him.
 Uncertain whether he would be able to return to work in September when his disability payments would end, Mr. Cossentino applied for Social Security disability in June 2007. He was denied, he says, because the government's doctors determined, based on his medical records, that he could work a 40-hour week. Worried about what might happen to his health insurance, he also applied for Medicaid, but was denied, he says, because he was receiving the disability payments.
 ''I never took a penny from the government,'' Mr. Cossentino says. ''Thirty years of working and I was turned away.'' 
 A cousin of Ms. Cossentino's lent them $2,000. An uncle of Mr. Cossentino's started a collection and sent $9,000. Doctors gave Mr. Cossentino samples of medications he could not afford.
 In August, with expiration of the disability payments imminent, he called his union to ask about Cobra and about returning to work afterward.
 ''Cossentino, yes, I have your termination papers right here,'' the woman said.
 He had been let go.
 That week, Mr. Cossentino ran into an old friend, Msgr. Bob Thelen, who referred him to Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
 ''You don't know how hard it was for me to walk into Catholic Charities,'' Mr. Cossentino says. ''I almost wanted to die.''
 Mr. and Ms. Cossentino left with onions, potatoes, broccoli, carrots, brown rice, dried milk, peanut butter and, drawn from the fund, a check for $1,400: one month's rent.
 After being sued for back rent, they avoided eviction in December. In March 2008, after a year of looking for work, Ms. Cossentino began bringing home $2,200 a month as a home health aide. They moved to a smaller apartment, cutting their rent to $1,000. And in October, Medicaid coverage came through for Mr. Cossentino.
 Until he is approved for Social Security, though, he is not entitled to his Brooks Brothers pension. To pay rent, buy food and pay off $12,200 in bills, they rely on occasional help from their children, Christina, 25, and Stephen, 23, and shrewd home economics, which were not enough to prevent the recent repossession of their car.
 ''If I'm down, she pulls me up; if she's down, I pull her up,'' Mr. Cossentino says. ''But when we're both down, it feels like there's no hope.''

HEADLINE: My Tiny, Briny Luxury Item

BYLINE: By MARY ROACH. 
Mary Roach is the author of ''Stiff'' and, most recently, ''Bonk,'' which will be published in paperback by W.W. Norton in April.

 BODY:
I HAVE always been cheap, but the current economy has made me insufferable. I follow my husband, Ed, through the Montclair farmers market in Oakland, Calif., muttering about the price of a grass-fed lamb chop, the arrogance of a radish that wants $2.75 a pound. Do you know what our utility bill was last month? We can't afford these beets. I'm an external neurosis, hissing and gabbling in his ear. 
 Yet every time we go, I peel off to indulge a luxury I will never give up: a single Kumamoto oyster, $1.75, shucked on the spot, at Rudy Figueroa's little altar of ice chips. 
 I wait in line behind the holiday oyster buyers -- the stew chefs and the stuffing makers -- and I hold out my two bills. He never says much, this Rudy Figueroa. Once I asked him how Miyagis differ from Kumamotos, and he said, ''One's like macaroni and cheese, and one's peanut butter and jelly.'' Rudy is part of the luxury. 
 Sometimes Ed will look up from his greens and catch me in the act, eyes closed and head tilted back. People enjoying oysters look like parishioners taking communion back in the days when priests put the host straight onto the tongue. Depending upon how devout a Catholic or an oyster-eater (or both) one is, the expression is much the same, too. 
 Ed has never eaten a raw oyster. I try to explain the singular ecstasy of the oyster -- the usual cliches. ''It's like eating the ocean on a fine, clear day: the surf, the seaweed, the cries of the gulls ...''
 ''... the unkempt guy with the metal detector.'' 
 Ed assumes that raw oysters are rubbery and pungent and that you swallow them without chewing, like a medication. He has no idea. Nonetheless, because he enjoys seeing me happy, he encourages my habit. Every time we go, he tries to buy me a couple more Kumamotos. He thinks I'm limiting myself to one because I'm cheap. 
 But that's not why. I have $3.50. But I have no chair, no fellow oyster lovers, no candlelight. A splurge needs the proper setting. I'll happily wallow in my share of a dozen oysters if the mood and the place and the company are all just so.
 At Zuni Cafe in San Francisco, for instance, where the oysters earn their own daily menu and are presented to you on a stand, elevated above the bread and olives. As opposed to eating a dozen while standing around in the sweatpants you slept in, with the inevitable farmers market minstrels doing ''Greensleeves'' in the background. There, at the farmers market, you eat just one. You barely break stride. You're renewing your vows is what you're doing. Yes, these oysters are pure joy, and yes, one day soon, when the time and the lighting are right, I will eat many, many more.
 Even then, you must be careful with your indulgences. The more you eat of something you love, the less of a luxury it becomes. 
 A fabulous man named Sam once held a party for me. He'd been told I love oysters and went out and bought two grubby sacks of them from a local supplier, as well as a shucking tool. Very few of the people who came to Sam's party liked raw oysters, as it turned out, and toward the end of the evening, I set myself to the task of finishing them up. Because, my God, you cannot throw away an oyster! Somewhere into the third dozen, the ice had melted and the magic wore off and I began to see them through Ed's eyes: costly gray mucoid matter with visible organs. 
 We don't make it to Zuni very often these days, but we still go to the farmers market, and Rudy, I'm thankful, is always there. Rudy is, I imagine, one of the few purveyors of luxury these days who is faring better, not worse. People are learning that one oyster tastes better -- is more of a luxury -- than one of a dozen.

HEADLINE: Never Again, For Real

BYLINE: By MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT and WILLIAM S. COHEN. 
Madeleine K. Albright, the secretary of state from 1997 to 2001, and William S. Cohen, the secretary of defense from 1997 to 2001, are the co-chairmen of the Genocide Prevention Task Force.

 BODY:
SOME we see; others remain invisible to us. Some have names and faces; others we do not know. They are the victims of genocide and mass atrocities, their numbers too staggering to count. 
 This month was the 60th anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It has been 20 years since the United States became a party to the treaty. Despite six decades of efforts to prevent and halt systematic campaigns of massacres, forced displacements and mass rapes, such atrocities persist. Why are we still lacking the necessary institutions, policies and strategies?
 It is not because the public doesn't care. We have seen a surge in interest in this country, galvanized by the crisis in Darfur and driven in large part by students and faith-based organizations. And it is not because our leaders do not care. Over the years, many champions in Congress and successive administrations have demanded more action to stop genocide.
 When we were in the Clinton administration, we experienced firsthand the challenges of responding to such crises, sometimes because the political will was lacking, but more often because the American government simply does not have an established, coherent policy for preventing and responding to mass atrocities.
 Moreover, a lack of dedicated resources for prevention and the absence of bureaucratic mechanisms allowing rapid analysis and response have impeded timely action. What is needed is a national blueprint to prevent genocide and mass atrocities. 
 Barack Obama should demonstrate at the outset of his presidency that preventing genocide is a national priority. No matter how one calculates American interests, national borders today provide little sanctuary from international problems. Left unchecked, genocide will undermine American security.
 First, genocide fuels instability -- usually in weak, undemocratic, corrupt states. It is in these states that we find terrorist recruitment and training, human trafficking and civil strife.
 Second, genocide and mass atrocities have long-lasting consequences that go far beyond the states in which they occur. Refugees flow into bordering countries and then across the globe. The need for humanitarian aid can quickly exceed the capacities and resources of a generous world. The international community, including the United States, is called on to absorb displaced people and to undertake relief efforts. And the longer we wait to act, the higher the price tag.
 Third, America's standing in the world is eroded when we are perceived as bystanders to genocide. Yes, we must understand that preventing mass killings may eventually require military intervention, but this is always at the end of the list of intervention options, not the beginning. We must learn to recognize the early warning signs of genocide and move quickly to marshal international cooperation, to bring diplomatic and economic pressure to bear against those who violate the norms of civilized behavior.
 Success will require that the president summon political will not only during a crisis but before one emerges. This means taking on inertia within the government, investing political capital, doing the heavy lifting of persuasion. It means fending off critics and cynics. It means taking risks.
 We are keenly aware that the incoming president's agenda will be daunting from Day One. But preventing genocide and mass atrocities is not an idealistic addition to our core foreign policy agenda. It is a moral and strategic imperative.

HEADLINE: The Scramble for Downtown Dollars

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

DATELINE: OSSINING 

 BODY:
 DESPERATE times call for desperate measures. 
 Melita Silva, owner of a colorful ceramics and antiques store on Main Street here called Melita's, is staying open on her normal day off and working two extra hours on other days so she can snare more customers. And she has lowered the price on some hand-painted Portuguese bowls and plates so that they cost as much as a traveler might pay in Portugal. 
 ''This is the worst I've seen in 10 years,'' she said. ''Most of my clients are high end, and if the husband loses a job, the wife won't come in to shop. Even if they have money, they're trying not to spend.''
 Meanwhile, she and the other hard-pressed merchants and restaurateurs in Ossining have banded together to lure that endangered species -- the full-throated, money-spending shopper -- with the first of a series of monthly First Friday events designed to bring crowds downtown. 
 On Dec. 5, they staged several happenings in Market Square, including a holiday tree-lighting ceremony especially rescheduled by the village. Shops stayed open until 8 p.m. and offered discounts of 20 percent, while restaurants marked down meals by 10 percent. Josie LaRiccia, the local dance instructor, gave free tango lessons, and the Open Door Family Health Center gave free body mass index screenings. 
 Improvisation is the name of the game in Westchester's cities as well. 
 Take White Plains. Vino 100, a liquor store, is offering a ''Financial Collapse Special,'' featuring wines for under $10 that the owners have vetted as agreeable.
 Zanaro's, at the crossroads of Mamaroneck Avenue and Main Street, has taken in Joe DiMaggio Jr. -- a menu designer who says he is a distant cousin of Joltin' Joe -- as a managing partner to refashion its menu in an effort to drum up new diners. 
 Mr. DiMaggio -- who likes to say that the answer to the question ''Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?'' is now White Plains -- has come up with what he describes as more traditional Italian peasant fare, Grandma's Meatballs and Grandma's Pasta Fagioli. Happy hour drinks are 50 percent cheaper, and there is a $6 to $9 afternoon menu.
 ''The restaurant was breaking even,'' Mr. DiMaggio said. ''You don't run a restaurant to break even.''
 It is in such ways that village and urban downtowns are trying to fight back against the new frugality gripping Americans -- Westchester included -- as home values plummet, companies lay off workers and mutual funds are drained of their lifeblood. In some places, merchants take more scattershot and individual approaches; in others, they have realized that misery needs company and that coming up with joint strategies may save them all from sinking. 
 As a result, sidewalk sales, restaurant tastings, farmers' markets, outdoor concerts, holidays from metered parking -- anything that will draw people downtown -- have flourished in recent months. Some of these strategies were employed before the downturn, but, even in those cases, they have been enhanced and multiplied.
 Not every village has the esprit de corps shown by Ossining. In Scarsdale, Gregory Gilin, owner of Gregory Gilin Jewelers, said that it is hard to organize merchants into a team because so many are rivals.
 ''We have five jewelry stores in the village,'' he said. ''If I'm a jeweler, we may have a little resentment against each other.''
 So with his luxury business down more than 50 percent, he has come up with his own ploys. Mr. Gilin is now placing advertisements in local newspapers urging customers to bring in timeworn gems or ones they have grown weary of, and he will refashion them -- an old diamond ring into a pendant, a brooch into a pair of earrings. 
 ''I used to sell from the window,'' he said, explaining why he is marketing more aggressively. ''People would walk in and purchase something, but that has not been the case lately.''
 In Hartsdale, it has also been hard for Manish Kapur, owner of Big Top, a toy store, to organize his fellow merchants. The shopping bazaar along East Hartsdale Avenue lost 20 percent of its business in April 2007 after the flooding caused by a northeaster shuttered 14 shops for weeks -- at least 4 permanently -- and shoppers strayed to other outlets. The nation's economic meltdown has dampened business an additional 10 percent, Mr. Kapur said.
 ''We're next to Scarsdale, where the whole town is based on the financial industry,'' he said, ''and they got socked, and people, whether they have money or not, tend to shop according to their mood.'' 
 But Mr. Kapur has been unable to get merchants to come up with a cohesive response. So to seduce customers, he has taken matters in his own hands, adding another 20-percent-off sale this holiday season.
 Main Streets are the heart of most villages because, with their storefront facades, lampposts and greenery, they define their villages' character for residents and visitors alike.
 For years, Ossining, with its stock of gingerbread Victorians and overlooks to gaze at the Hudson River, has been talking about enlivening its Main Street, said Linda G. Cooper, the village manager. It has wanted to publicize the charms of a suburban village with a polyglot character, rich with clusters of Portuguese, Ecuadorean and Colombian immigrants and their restaurants, shops and native customs like the Ecuadorean religious processions. 
 There is some hope that the downturn will light a fire under often warring village officials to proceed with economic development. Jerry Gershner, president of the Greater Ossining Chamber of Commerce, has been urging the village to build on the four downtown parcels it owns, preferably apartment houses that would create a natural base of customers for downtown shops. In the meantime, First Friday will have to be that draw.
 Yonkers, Westchester's largest city, with almost 200,000 people, has been offering free weekend parking on streets and municipal garages around Getty Square for all of December. 
 Dorette Brown, owner of the four-year-old Body and Soul Essentials on Getty Square, is letting customers dip their hands in a grab bag and pull out numbers from 5 percent to 20 percent that they could use to reduce the price of their purchase. Customers seem to like the surprise, she said. While she has used this tactic on single days before, this time she extended it to two days before Christmas, Dec. 19 and 20. 
 White Plains, a city whose ragged downtown has blossomed over the past decade, has been holding various events designed to draw crowds -- sidewalk sales in July and September, a Wednesday farmers' market in warmer weather, a New Year's Eve ball drop and fireworks. 
 Rick Ammirato, the executive director of the business improvement district, said that while his organization's 300 retailers and merchants will do fine until the end of the year, he worries about what will happen through the postholiday dead zone of January, February and March. 
 The merchants are talking about printing discount cards that would offer shoppers 10 percent off and then a Manhattan-style restaurant week in February that would offer prix fixe meals at reduced prices.
 ''We've been on an upswing in White Plains for 10 years,'' Mr. Ammirato said. ''And this is the first time we're seeing people concerned about the coming months.''

HEADLINE: Suffolk to Sue Tribal Smoke Shops Over Taxes

BYLINE: By MARY REINHOLZ

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE 

 BODY:
 A DAY after the governor signed a state law to block sales of tax-free cigarettes on Indian reservations, the Suffolk County Legislature voted here Tuesday to pursue a federal lawsuit against smoke shops at the Unkechaug tribe's Poospatuck Reservation in Mastic.
 The lawsuit would seek to allow Suffolk to begin enforcing the collection of county taxes on bulk tobacco sales to non-Indians by the tribal smoke shops. 
 Tribe members are allowed to buy tax-free cigarettes for personal use, but the state contends that nontribal buyers who purchase tobacco at a reservation must pay the state sales tax -- $2.75 a pack. The tribal vendors are not charging that tax or the county sales tax, 4.25 percent.
 The Suffolk measure, which passed 17 to 1, seeks recovery of what it says are millions of dollars in revenue from the county sales tax being lost because reservation tobacco vendors are not charging it on bulk sales to people who are not Indians.
 The Unkechaug say the Poospatuck Reservation is sovereign territory and not subject to the taxes.
 Colleagues of Legislator Louis D'Amaro, the Huntington Station Democrat who introduced the bill, questioned him about jurisdiction, investigations of tribal sales, sovereignty issues and a recent lawsuit by New York City in federal court in Brooklyn against seven Unkechaug tobacco vendors. 
 Legislator Jay H. Schneiderman, Republican of Montauk, said it was important to be clear why the Legislature should initiate ''aggressive action against an indigenous people'' during its final 2008 session. 
 ''I'm not doing anything to anybody,'' said Mr. D'Amaro, who is chairman of the Legislature's Ways and Means Committee. ''All I'm asking is to get a fair hearing to determine whether or not this sales tax can be collected at a time when we're talking about raising park fees to bail out the Vanderbilt Museum. So if you don't want to roll the dice to find out whether we should be getting tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue for the county each year, then vote against it.'' 
 The sole dissenting vote came from Legislator Kate M. Browning, a member of the Working Families Party from Shirley, who said the bill failed to address tobacco sales on the Shinnecock Reservation. Her motion to table Mr. D'Amaro's bill failed. 
 Mr. D'Amaro said in an interview that he did not name the Shinnecock vendors in his bill because he relied on New York City's documentation of the Poospatuck Reservation sales. But he added, ''If it turns out that the Shinnecocks are doing the same thing, they will also be subjected to the same enforcement.'' 
 Harry Wallace, the Unkechaug chief and a smoke-shop owner, criticized Mr. D'Amaro's bill and the city's lawsuit against tribal vendors in remarks before the Legislature Tuesday morning, claiming that both attack the Unkechaugs' sovereignty.
 ''You will not collect any tax revenue on our land without our consent,'' he said. 
 After the bill was passed, Mr. Wallace called it ''hypocritical and self-serving.''
 ''If they think they can walk over this tribe,'' he said, ''they're in for some surprises.'' 
 The Suffolk vote came one day after Gov. David A. Paterson signed a bill requiring wholesalers and tax-stamping agents to certify that they have placed tax stamps on tobacco products delivered to all retailers, including Indian merchants. 
 Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr., a Republican from Sag Harbor whose district includes the Shinnecock and Poospatuck Reservations, voted against the bill, saying it would elicit ''legal challenges that go on and on.'' 
 Mr. Thiele called the Suffolk Legislature's vote to sue Poospatuck tribal vendors ''ill considered.'' He said the Unkechaug nation had been recognized as ''one of the few to have successful economic development.'' 
 ''And that shouldn't be disturbed,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Hiring Window Is Open At the Foreign Service

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
 A RARE bright spot has appeared in a job landscape dominated by layoffs: the Foreign Service. 
 For the last several years, hiring in the United States Foreign Service was minimal because of a lack of Congressional funding. In addition, war has created an urgent need for diplomatic personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, and as officers have moved to these countries their previous jobs have remained unfilled. 
 So, in the last several months -- with a new president on the horizon and new funding from Congress -- both the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development, or Usaid, are ramping back up. 
 A supplemental war funding bill, which became law in June, has provided money for Foreign Service hiring. And President-elect Barack Obama ''has talked explicitly about the need to increase the Foreign Service and we hope he will make that a priority,'' said John Naland, president of the American Foreign Service Association, the professional association and labor union representing career diplomats. 
 The State Department has asked for funding for 1,500 new positions for the current fiscal year. Of these, roughly 800 are Foreign Service and 700 civil service, said Luis Arreaga, director of recruitment, examination and employment at the department. Many of those positions are being filled because of attrition but about 160 are new. ''We consider that a down payment,'' said Mr. Arreaga. 
 Felix Salazar, hired as a junior officer by the State Department in September, said that during the interview process he felt ''a sense of urgency, that they were actively hiring and really valued my experience.'' Mr. Salazar, who spent three years in the Peace Corps, leaves in February for his first posting, in South Africa.
 Not everyone is cut out for Foreign Service work, which can be stressful and highly demanding. About two-thirds of a diplomat's career is spent overseas; officers usually move every two to four years and can be exposed to dangers like disease and war. The State Department offers a suitability quiz for prospective applicants on its Web site.
 Yet career diplomats like Ronald E. Neumann, a former ambassador to Afghanistan who now heads the American Academy of Diplomacy, called it the best job in the world. ''I enjoy what I'm doing now but it's nothing like working on foreign policy,'' he said. ''In my 37 years of service I may have gone home tired or frustrated with how a decision came out, but I never went home and asked myself if what I was working on was worthwhile.''
 Applying for a job with the State Department involves written and oral examinations. Those who pass the oral exam become conditional officers and receive a ranking score based on oral-exam performance and language skills. The higher the rank, the sooner they will be assigned. 
 Of the 12,000 to 15,000 people who register annually for the written exam, about 450 officers are hired, said Frank J. Coulter, management officer with the Foreign Service and a member of the State Department's board of examiners. 
 The first time he took the written exam, Mr. Salazar failed, after running out of time during the essay portion. He was so determined to pass that he spent the next year writing an essay in 30 minutes every day. ''When I took it the second time and got my results, it actually sent chills down my spine,'' he said.
 New Foreign Service officers at the State Department choose one of five career tracks: consular affairs, economic affairs, management affairs, political affairs or diplomacy. No matter the track, all entry-level officers spend their first several years working in a consulate, interviewing applicants for United States visas and working with American citizens who need their help. 
 The State Department also hires Foreign Service specialists, who provide technical, security and administrative support overseas or in Washington. Specialists must pass an oral assessment but not a written exam, and start in a specialty like medicine, information technology or law enforcement, Mr. Coulter said. All newly hired officers and specialists are trained at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington. 
 Each of the first two postings overseas last two years; after that, it is generally a three-year posting in each country. One-year hardship postings -- in a region too dangerous to allow an officer's spouse and children to accompany him or her -- are required at least twice in the course of a career. After two assignments, Foreign Service personnel can bid on postings -- requesting particular countries or Washington -- but everyone is expected to serve in a variety of assignments, Mr. Arreaga said. 
 Usaid's entry-level Foreign Service officers must have a master's degree in an appropriate technical area, like economics, agriculture, public health or education. The average Usaid entry-level officer has four years of relevant experience; many come from the Peace Corps, but others have worked for nongovernmental organizations, in private industry or the military. 
 Thousands apply to Usaid each year and about 1 in 20 will be called for an interview, said Susan Riley, Usaid's chief of Foreign Service personnel. 
 Foreign Service officers with Usaid work on a range of projects, like assisting farmers in developing countries or working in programs to reduce the prevalence of diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
 Last year, the agency kicked off its Development Leadership Initiative, a recruitment effort to hire more than 1,000 Foreign Service officers in the next two years. ''This is the most that we've planned to hire above attrition in 15 years,'' Ms. Riley said. 
 THE base salary for entry-level Foreign Service officers ranges from about $40,000 to $72,000 annually, but compensation can increase depending on the danger level of the posting and on a region's cost of living.
 For Foreign Service specialists, the salary range is anywhere from about $26,500 to more than $100,000; for civil service employees at Usaid, the salary ranges from $16,500 to over $100,000. Overseas benefits include housing and private school for dependent children.
 Many of those choosing Foreign Service work do so out of a dedication to public service and see it as not just a career, but also a way of life.
 Salman Khalil, hired in May, took a 50 percent cut in take-home pay to join the Foreign Service after a decade in the I.T. industry. Any day now he will leave for his first assignment, in India. ''In my I.T. profession I was helping big companies make more money and it wasn't satisfying for me,'' he said. ''What I wanted to do was serve in a capacity where I could directly help people.''

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about renewed hiring in the Foreign Service referred incompletely to one of five career tracks that new Foreign Service officers at the State Department can choose. It is public diplomacy -- which involves working with the media and foreign audiences to promote understanding -- not diplomacy.

HEADLINE: In the Face of Loss, Celebrating Ties That Bind

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
A year ago the big crisis in the film world -- which always has to be in some crisis or another -- was a glut of movies. Last December my colleagues and I feared we would crack under the strain of winnowing more than 600 releases into lists of 10. Filmmakers and studio executives, meanwhile, worried that so many pictures crowding into theaters would overwhelm the audience and cripple the business. 
 Now, at the end of 2008, all signs point to a future of scarcity, a bleak and blighted landscape that has already begun to materialize around us. There are fewer companies putting out movies and fewer salaried critics writing about those movies than there were a year ago, and the attrition is sure to continue. But there are not, or not yet, fewer movies demanding attention. This year new films arrived on New York screens at the rate of more than 50 per month. By Dec. 31 the annual tally of film reviews published in The New York Times will once again exceed 600. 
 The problem, though, is not a surfeit of movies. Honestly, how could there be too many movies? The problem is that too many of them are the wrong movies. The box office may have remained robust, but all year the enterprise of moviemaking and the practice of movie watching have been shadowed by fatigue and irrelevance. This was not entirely the fault of the Hollywood studios and their somewhat beleaguered specialty divisions, which continue to exert a near-monopolistic hold on what is shown in American multiplexes and art houses. It was awfully hard for any scripted spectacle to compete with an election that was at once a hugely consequential political event and a nonstop media bonanza. And no blockbuster could match the slow-motion, real-life disaster epic of a collapsing economy, a horror show that has kept most of us queasy, riveted and in a perpetual state of anxious suspense.
 Such unexpected competition from real life, however, serves only to emphasize the shortcomings of mainstream moviemaking, which runs more and more on caution, complacency and the willingness to turn any fresh idea into a marketing formula. I'm not thinking only, or primarily, of the puerile comedies and comic book spectaculars of summer, but rather of the somber and polished dramas that arrive in the waning weeks of the year as a stimulus package for Oscar-campaign publicists. 
 ''Doubt,''''The Reader,'' ''Frost/Nixon,'' ''Revolutionary Road'' -- all of these transplants from stage or page are impeccably acted, exquisitely production-designed excursions into the recent past. And each one is a hermetically sealed melodrama of received thinking, feverishly advancing a set of themes that are the very opposite of provocative. The suburbs are hell on earth. Richard Nixon was a monster. Literature is good for you. Religious authority is bad. The Nazis too. Kate Winslet is hot. 
 Why argue? And, for all the shouting and finger pointing that goes on in these films, they exist to be admired, not argued about or with. The interesting movie debates of 2008 were incited by the populist entertainments of summertime, ''Wall-E'' and ''The Dark Knight,'' contrasting allegories pitched at the anxieties of the moment. Curiously enough, the makers of ''Wall-E'' took it upon themselves to deny that the film was a parable of environmental devastation as well as a disarmingly sweet love story, while some who commented on ''The Dark Knight'' pushed the allegorical interpretation as far as it would go, reading the film as a cloaked apologia for -- unless it was a veiled critique of -- President Bush and his policies. 
 That was perhaps a bit much, but ''The Dark Knight'' did bring some of the central preoccupations of Bush-era filmmaking to a grim, lustrous apotheosis. For most of the past seven years the actual, political contours of the post-9/11 world have been left mainly to documentarians, while the realm of pop-culture fantasy has bloomed with poisonous flowers of grief, vengeance and dread. Christopher Nolan's second exploration of the Batman mythos was a cartoon opera of good and evil, solemn enough to seem important, but vague enough to avoid the risk of overt topicality. 
 Its glum, masochistic exploration of terror and vigilantism was artful, but also seemed strategically incoherent, its central moral question -- what kind of hero do we need? -- posed with more grandiosity than insight. And by year's end the central standoff between a mournful, angry avenger and a figure of pure anarchic malice has taken on the fusty air of cliche. In due course Max Payne and the Punisher came to collect their brutal payback, joining a vigilante army that even managed to conscript poor James Bond, once the avatar of puckish, British political heroism. 
 But at least he survived, and may recover his sense of humor in time for Bond 23. That makes him one of the lucky few, since the only theme more pervasive than vengeance this year was martyrdom. I would spoil the whole month of December if I listed the movies that end with the main character's embrace of death, frequently in an uncompromising, implicitly self-aggrandizing act of sacrifice. 
 But somehow all this messianism and overblown superheroism rings false, both within individual films and out here in the rumpled, stressed-out, hopeful, uneasy world where movies live. Who will save us? Whom should we kill? These don't strike me as the most useful questions right now, and they are generally not the kind posed by the films I found most challenging and interesting this year, which in general were less concerned with moral abstractions than with ethical predicaments. 
 Consider Mike Leigh's ''Happy-Go-Lucky'' and Kelly Reichardt's ''Wendy and Lucy,'' each one about a woman making her way in an indifferent and sometimes hostile world. Poppy and Wendy are mirror images (Wendy being decidedly unhappy and unlucky), difficult people who challenge the people around them, and the audience, to care. And while neither film has an overtly political message, each implicitly challenges us to think about what how the world as presently organized constrains and limits our impulses toward compassion, generosity and fellow feeling. 
 These impulses are easily sentimentalized of course. And while I am suspicious of easy affirmation or forced happy endings, I am nonetheless grateful for movies that, in spite of everything, investigate the possibility of hope. The 10 movies listed below are not all expressions of optimism, but they are all about the obligations, responsibilities and accidents that bind people together, within and across formally constituted families and communities. And they are also about the refusal to give up, to give in to darkness or despair. These are movies, as Harvey Milk might put it, about various kinds of ''us-es'' -- about how fragile such connections can be and about how necessary they are. In the year to come we will need more movies like them.
 WALL-E The visual sublimity of Andrew Stanton's latest Pixar masterpiece is matched by a depth and sweetness of feeling not seen since the heyday of Charlie Chaplin. I don't know why it seems so fitting that the year's most humane hero should be a robot, or that its most tender love story should involve a romance between two soulful machines.
 SILENT LIGHT Another otherwordly love story, this one set in a Mennonite settlement in Mexico. The director, Carlos Reygadas, photographs people and landscapes with a devotion as deep as the spiritual conviction that is his subject. Rarely has a film depicted religious experience with such power and clarity, bringing the audience uncannily, exaltingly close to a state of holiness. 
 THE SECRET OF THE GRAIN Abdellatif Kechiche's long, warm, bustling couscous epic, set among mainly second-generation North African immigrants in a sagging French port city, is both the best family drama in a year filled with them and the best of a dazzling and diverse crop of French movies released in America in 2008.
 MAN ON WIRE Part true-crime story, part elegy, James Marsh's documentary about Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope dance between the towers of the World Trade Center is like found poetry: beautiful, charming and hauntingly strange.
 THE EDGE OF HEAVENFatih Akin, a German director of Turkish descent, explores the complicated links between his two homelands in this knotty, moving drama of converging destinies and chance encounters. 
 HAPPY-GO-LUCKY As Poppy, Sally Hawkins is like a flesh-and-blood, female Wall-E: hard-working, steadfast, compulsive, perhaps slightly annoying and capable, by dint of sheer decency and determination, of saving humanity from its worst impulses. 
 WENDY AND LUCY This tiny sliver of a story -- a girl, traveling to Alaska with her dog, runs into trouble somewhere in Oregon -- is heartbreaking and resonant, an intimation of hard times coming and a sad, sober assessment of just how alone each of us may be in facing them.
 MILK In Gus Van Sant's accessible, intelligent biography, Harvey Milk, the San Francisco gay rights activist and city supervisor assassinated along with the city's mayor in 1978, is not a martyr or a saint, but rather an excitable, passionate champion of dignity and freedom. Let ''Che'' fight it out with ''W'' for a distant second place. This is the best political film of the year.
 RACHEL GETTING MARRIED The addiction story may feel a little familiar, but Jonathan Demme's sprawling family-therapy wedding blowout is bracing for the window it offers into a mixed-up, multi-everything America that has existed, up to now, just about everywhere except in our movies and our politics.
 CADILLAC RECORDS Joy and pain; rhythm and blues; blacks and Jews. Darnell Martin's group portrait of the Chess Record label is a smart and insightful history lesson, and you can dance to it too.

HEADLINE: Downturn Sparks Upturn in Promotions

BYLINE: By MARY JO PATTERSON

 BODY:
WITH only a few days left before the end of the holiday shopping season, shopkeepers along New Jersey's Main Streets have but one wish: for a frenzied last-minute rush.
 Despite many new promotions and events intended to lure people downtown, their season got off to a slow start. In recent weeks the spotlight has been on national retailers, most of which reported double-digit declines in November sales. But the picture may have been just as bleak for small stores in all of the nation's downtowns. In places like Montclair, Morristown, Westfield and Somerville, merchants are working to avoid the fate of many of their larger counterparts that are suffering through one of the bleakest holiday seasons in recent memory. 
 There are no government data to track how suburban downtowns are faring, at least not yet. But a New Jersey Business and Industry Association survey of employers, released late last month, characterized retailing as the hardest-hit sector of the state's economy, with housing construction close behind. 
 ''No one's expecting a massive crash, but it's going to be a disappointing season,'' said Kathleen Miller Prunty, president of Downtown New Jersey, a statewide association that provides downtowns with business advice and recently offered a seminar on surviving tough times. The stores that are likely to weather the current storm are in communities where the median household income is high, and where not more than 18 percent of residents work in the financial or real estate industries, N. David Milder, a business consultant in Kew Gardens, N.Y., told the group.
 Ms. Prunty is also manager of the Downtown Management Corporation in Cranford, where, she said, most stores were taking a hit but expected to survive. ''That said, one or two that were already teetering, or on the brink, could fail,'' she said. ''For them, this could be a make-or-break season.''
 Business owners, meanwhile, were bending over backward to cater to customers. ''I see them providing extra wrapping or putting out coffee and cookies in their stores,'' Ms. Prunty said. ''They're in overdrive.'' 
 Those who have been in business a long time seem most likely to be taking the downturn in stride.
 On West Main Street in Somerville, Mary Pekun, the owner of the Crystal Palace, a collectibles store, said 23 years in retailing had taught her that people buy even in lean times, provided a store has ''the right merchandise, at the right price.''
 ''I'm just hoping things will fall in place,'' she said one afternoon this month, before rushing off to take care of the store's lone customer, an older man in search of a figurine. ''Besides, I think people are tired of malls. They want the individuality and the attentiveness that comes with a small store, and the nostalgia. For many people that's comforting.'' 
 Few New Jersey towns mounted a more vigorous campaign for a merry shopping season than Somerville, the county seat of Somerset County. The borough has only 12,500 residents, but nearly 70 shops. The Bridgewater Commons mall, which opened one mile away in Bridgewater in 1989, ''did sap businesses away from the downtown, but new businesses evolved in their place,'' said Bill Lawton, a former chairman of the District Management Corporation of Somerville, a quasi-governmental entity that fosters economic growth. Today the town has a lively downtown and a growing reputation as a restaurant destination and antiques center.
 In September, as Wall Street churned and consumers cut back spending, Cynthia Hollod, executive director of Somerville's District Management Corporation, looked for ways to counteract the souring economy. She knew that many shops, like the Crystal Palace or the Hungry Hound, the dog bakery and pet boutique across the street, rang up a third of their annual sales from Thanksgiving to Christmas. She started marketing early and hard.
 At Halloween, Somerville handed out candy canes with stickers heralding Santa's arrival downtown, instead of the usual candy. Free parking on lots commenced Nov. 1, one month early. More money was spent on radio advertising, and more discount coupon books were printed. At the holiday kickoff celebration, shoppers were encouraged to bid on four ice sculptures -- a bear, an angel, a Christmas tree and a reindeer -- made at an ice-carving demonstration. Proceeds from the auction went to the local high school's cheerleaders, who came downtown for the occasion, trailing family and friends.
 ''We knew having an auction for a local cause would draw even more people,'' Ms. Hollod said. ''Every little thing helps. We can't compete with national retailers. But we want people to see the uniqueness of our stores.''
 Other downtowns also readied countermeasures.
 In Summit and Red Bank, businesses invested in regional advertising, hoping to attract out-of-towners.
 MAPLEWOOD introduced a new festival for this weekend ''Las Posadas on the Avenue,'' patterned after a Spanish tradition. There will be treats for children at participating stores, and other entertainment for the family including the band Bones Unlimited, flamenco dancing and mariachi music.
 Morristown staged a scavenger hunt, sponsored by the New York Jets; set up more holiday decorations than usual on the Green; and created a Web page where shoppers could download coupons from local businesses. 
 Westfield worked out a series of new promotions, starting with a sidewalk sale in April. It invented ''customer appreciation days,'' and dreamed up a contest where the winner gets $500 in gift cards from downtown businesses. For the first time in memory, it also made parking lots free during the last half of December. 
 ''We've been very busy working on new promotions because of the economy,'' said Sherry Cronin, executive director of the Downtown Westfield Corporation. ''October was horrible, in November things picked up, and we are crossing our fingers this month.'' Half the retailers in Westfield's downtown are national brands, including Banana Republic, Coach and Talbots. 
 ''But even in the nationals, there are store owners who know you by name,'' Mrs. Cronin said. ''They don't have the turnover that the stores in the mall may have. One day I saw someone familiar on line in town. I said, 'Don't I know you?' and she said, 'I work for Ann Taylor, and I sold you your last suit.' '' 
 In Montclair, one business owner joined with other stores in a campaign urging residents to shop local. The group's Web site, www.shoplocalmontclair.com, directs customers to weekly holiday deals offered at more than 50 participating stores.
 ''Since no government bailout is coming our way, we have joined our efforts to let you know that shopping locally this holiday season is one of the most energy-efficient, heart-warming, self-sustaining contributions you can make to your community,'' the site says.
 Kelly DelRosso, who owns Semplice, a home furnishings and gift store on Bloomfield Avenue in Montclair, said she decided to set her competitive instincts aside and collaborate with other stores in town after the malls began advertising discounts of 60 or 70 per cent.
 ''I was planning a promotion in my own store,'' she said. ''Then I realized that one sale in one town would not be enough to compete with the barrage of advertising saying everything at the mall was on sale. I thought, if 10 of us had a sale, we could have an impact. 
 ''December is the month that you go into the black and make your profit for the year,'' Miss DelRosso said. ''Will we all get through a tough December? Probably.''
 The campaign made sense to Kathy Clark and her husband, Dan Rich, who live in New York City and were in Montclair one day recently to visit a friend. They spent a few minutes inside Terra, a tearoom and fair trade retail shop on Church Street. 
 ''I would always much prefer to go to a local store,'' Ms. Clark said. 
 Many New Jersey downtowns have accepted the view that the pain will not end any time soon.
 Nancy Adams, executive director of RiverCenter, Red Bank's business improvement district, scheduled an economic summit for local businesses on Jan. 27.
 ''The forecasts for January and February are very grim,'' she said. ''A recession like this can be tough on individual business owners, for sure. But it can also bring opportunities. We need to find them.''
