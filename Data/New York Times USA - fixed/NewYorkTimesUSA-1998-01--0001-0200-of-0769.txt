Maybe Spain's 1898 Defeat Was No Great Loss After All

BYLINE: By Al Goodman

DATELINE: SALAMANCA, Spain

 BODY:
Heading diligently into the centennial of the Spanish-American War, Spain is ready to feel less pain when remembering the Maine. A new spin on history says the loss of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines was not such a disaster after all.
The three colonies were not vital to the nation, goes the argument, part of the latest debunking of Spanish textbooks. Further, many scholars now contend that writers like Miguel de Unamuno and Pio Baroja, of the literary group known as the Generation of '98, fretted less over the end of the empire than was widely believed. Rather, they were busy worrying about more important things, the scholars say. 
 "There has been a very simplified vision of the Generation of '98 linking it to the loss of the colonies," said Victor Garcia de la Concha, a literature professor at the University of Salamanca. "Today we have a distinct vision."
The new interpretation is strong in this medieval university town, about 130 miles west of Madrid, where Columbus visited the cavernous stone buildings before the conquest of the New World began. Those buildings have lately been outfitted with modern heating, computers and professors unwilling to accept the usual explanations about the Spanish-American War's impact on Spain and its writers.
The Generation of '98, they point out, was not even considered a literary movement until a Madrid newspaper article in 1913, a full 15 years after the war. And the group's half-dozen disparate poets and novelists, ranging from political progressives to conservatives, were unhappy at being lumped together.
Their criticism of the image of a decaying, inward-looking Spain started several years before the United States battleship Maine exploded on Feb. 15, 1898, in Havana harbor, the event precipitating the war that made heroes of Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders.
After the war, the Generation of '98, which included Antonio Machado, Jose Martinez Ruiz (known as Azorin) and Ramon Maria del Valle-Inclan, wrote little specifically about it and indeed expressed virtually no anti-American sentiment. Later, one of Unamuno's daughters even taught Spanish in the United States.
In their novels, plays, poems and essays, the writers explored existentialism, spirituality or literary themes, managing to challenge Spain's sense of identity.
Unamuno, the bearded, stern-faced philosopher who was the most prolific writer of the Generation of '98 and also the rector at the University of Salamanca, unleashed some of his sharpest barbs in the postwar period.
"We Spaniards have intolerance in our blood, it has been said and repeated, and there is something to that," he wrote in 1902. "It is not Catholicism that made Spaniards intolerant, but Spaniards who made Catholicism intolerant."
Baroja, a novelist whom Hemingway admired, addressed Spain's difficulty in accepting its status as a more modest country after the end of the empire.
"Before, without a doubt, it was quixotic country, which thought of itself differently from what it really was," Baroja wrote in 1927. "Before, in the period of adventures, Spain was led by Don Quixote. From now on, it would be directed by Sancho Panza."
These comments typically came in newspaper articles or minor essays, not their more well-known works, like Unamuno's "Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations" (1913), about absolute faith, and Baroja's trilogy of novels, "The Struggle for Existence" (1904).
The group's literary output was tied less to the war than to the perceived moral, esthetic and philosophical crisis affecting Spain and Europe at the turn of the century, said Manuel Perez Lopez, a Salamanca literature professor.
Still, the Generation of '98 will be dissected, along with the war, at numerous centenary symposiums and expositions planned for 1998 in Spain as well as the United States, the Philippines and Puerto Rico. The University of Salamanca alone has scheduled seven conferences, with a major one in June about Unamuno.
He was the Generation of '98 writer most deeply linked to Salamanca, having spent more than half his life here. The city remembers him devoutly, with three statues and a street, a cafe and two schools named for him. Unamuno's home, with his personal library of 5,500 volumes in a dozen languages, is a research museum, visited by professors and schoolchildren alike.
The rest of Spain is bound to think about Unamuno this year, too. A dozen new books on the war and the writers already have been published, with more scheduled for release, not to mention the television specials.
"We live for commemorations," said a Salamanca history professor, Antonio Morales. "It's a good time to get funds and a good opportunity to publish."
Despite the revisionism, the Generation of '98 label seems in little danger. "It's in all the books, impossible to avoid," said Mr. Perez. Even those who criticize the term have to use it, he said, "contributing to its permanence."
The changing attitude about the Spanish-American War, and the writers tied to it, has been gaining adherents since Spain's transition to democracy in the late 1970's. Some historians now argue against viewing Spain mainly as an oddly romantic and dramatic country, for despite the flamenco dancing and bullfights, they say, it is developing an economic and political structure like its European neighbors, though at a slower pace.
"The thesis of Spain as a failure as a nation was strong in the Generation of '98," said Juan Pablo Fusi, a University of Madrid historian. "Now, most people aren't so pessimistic about Spain."
Certainly not Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who spoke here in April at the inaugural session of the state commission for the centennial. He urged Spaniards "to flee from a sense of being victims, and not connect the events of '98 with the lament over territorial loss, which forced Spain to live realistically its destiny."

HEADLINE: Immigration Is Fueling Cities' Strong Growth, Data Show

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
The Census Bureau today offered fresh evidence of the impact of immigration on the country's population in this decade, reporting that several major metropolitan areas -- notably New York, Los Angeles and Chicago -- grew strongly even as many longer-term residents left for other parts of the country.
The influx of immigrants helped turn these areas, as well as the Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston regions, into some of the biggest gainers in population in the country. Growth in those regions was also aided by high numbers of births, another side effect of immigration because immigrant families are more likely to be of child-bearing age, and immigrant women tend to have higher birth rates than their American-born counterparts. 
 "If you look at some of the Frost Belt areas like New York and Chicago, international immigration is very important," said Marc Perry, a demographer with the Census Bureau. "Their population increases aren't coming from domestic migration."
Two year-end studies, containing figures for 1990 through 1996, and interviews with demographers indicate that two years from the end of the century, Americans are a people in motion, willing to move often and across long distances in search of better jobs, a more enjoyable or less expensive life style or a strong support system of family and friends.
The data, from the Census Bureau, will undoubtedly add to the debate over whether increased competition for jobs in areas where immigrants have clustered is pushing out people who are already living there, or whether those who depart would have left anyway, lured by better economic prospects elsewhere.
The impact of immigration on population patterns was derived from two studies released today: one on population changes state by state and the other on changes in the country's 273 metropolitan areas -- cities and their surrounding suburbs.
Sifting through the Census Bureau's data reveals three trends that have dominated population shifts in the 1990's: Growth remains strongest in the Sun Belt states of the South and West, which contain the 50 metropolitan areas with the fastest rates. Las Vegas, Nev., fueled by the economic engine of the gambling industry, is the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the country. And the impact of immigrants has been profound.
Perhaps most striking of these involves immigration.
The Census Bureau report on metropolitan areas indicated that 3 of the 10 areas experiencing the fastest rate of growth -- McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Tex.; Laredo, Tex., and Brownsville-Harlingen-San Benito, Tex. -- are in the Rio Grande Valley and are gateway cities for many immigrants from Mexico.
The report also noted that of the 10 metropolitan areas that have gained the most people, 8 -- Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Washington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle -- have benefited from high levels of immigration.
Even as some of these regions gain population over all, their central cores continue to lose people. In New York, for example, Census Bureau demographers estimate that although the metropolitan area gained nearly 389,000 people from 1990 through 1996, more than 900,000 migrated out from the core area of New York's five boroughs, plus Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties. The Census Bureau considers the New York metropolitan region to be this core area, Long Island and parts of Southern Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
In California, more than 1.2 million people left Los Angeles County from 1990 through 1996. But because of immigration and a high number of births, the Los Angeles metropolitan area gained 963,626 people, making it the biggest gainer in population of all the country's metropolitan areas.
The same held true last year for California as a whole, according to the report on state-by-state growth. Last year, the state added more than 410,000 people, far and away the largest numerical increase of any state. Census Bureau demographers say that increase is the result of births and immigration, because California continues to experience the strong levels of domestic out-migration that it has throughout the 1990's.
As depicted in the Census Bureau reports, the experiences of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and of Las Vegas graphically illustrate the difficulty in determining whether immigrants are displacing longer-term resident in some cities.
According to the Census Bureau, Las Vegas has been the fastest-growing metropolitan region in the 1990's, increasing by 40.9 percent. Las Vegas' growth far outpaced the city in the No. 2 spot, Laredo, which grew by 32.7 percent.
Las Vegas' growth rate is based on job growth tied either directly or indirectly to the area's ever-expanding gambling industry. The rate of population growth is even more stunning considering that, unlike Laredo, which is a relatively small area, Las Vegas started out the decade already a large metropolitan area. In 1990, the region's population was 852,646. By July 1996, it stood at more than 1.2 million.
"That just jumps out at you," Mr. Perry said. "It's grown nearly 41 percent in six years. And it's not starting from a low base."
But unlike Los Angeles, roughly 80 percent of the growth in the Las Vegas area comes from movement of people already in the country, Mr. Perry said. And many of those people come from Southern California.
A study conducted by the Department of Comprehensive Planning in Clark County, Nev., showed that in 1993, 29 percent of the people who moved to the county that year were from five counties in Southern California -- Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino. All five of those counties have seen heavy flows of immigrants in the 1990's.
Such a pattern has caused some demographers, like William Frey of the University of Michigan, to speculate that low-skilled and low-income whites and blacks are leaving some major cities in the face of increased competition for jobs from immigrants, or when they see other economic opportunities elsewhere.
"This is what happens to the native born," Mr. Frey said in an interview today. "They have other options. When they see increased competition, they go somewhere else."
But Mr. Frey acknowledges that it is an open question whether those leaving an area like Los Angeles are being forced out by competition from immigrants, or lured away by the expanding economic opportunities in Las Vegas.
"There's both pushes and pulls for people who leave," he said.

GRAPHIC: Table: "AT A GLANCE: Moving In, Moving Out"
A study released yesterday by the United States Census Bureau shows rapid growth in the metropolitan areas in some states, fueled by immigration, births and the movement of people already in this country. Table lists Metropolitan Statistical Areas (M.S.A'.s) (defined as urban concentrations of at least 100,000 people) with the fastest growth, 1990-1996. It also lists M.S.A.'s and Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (defined as large groupings of metropolitan areas) with the biggest population gains, over the same period.

HEADLINE: Not Just a New Year: A 100th Birthday for a Unified City

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
When the ball dropped above Times Square last night, it not only ushered in 1998, but it also marked the 100th anniversary of the consolidation of the five boroughs into the city that is now New York.
To celebrate, more than 200 cultural institutions across the city were planning a yearlong string of events, large and small. From historic walks through Queens and the Bronx, to special film screenings to a host of lectures and symposiums, the central theme is to remind New Yorkers, a species consumed by present and future, also to think about their past. 
 "You could walk out your door any day in New York during the coming year, and there is something about New York's history and heritage happening," said Marie Salerno, the president of New York City 100, the nonprofit group coordinating the different birthday events. The group's founding sponsor is The New York Times Company Foundation.
Ms. Salerno said that prospective events, which depend on the success of fund-raising effort, include a light show in each borough and two outdoor concerts. Among the scheduled events are historical exhibits, walking tours and discussions on topics like the City Charter.
Advocated a century ago by Manhattan's business class, the consolidation of the five boroughs was far from universally beloved when it occurred on New Year's Day, 1898. Overnight, it increased the city's population to 3.4 million people from 2 million, making New York the world's second-largest city then, behind London. But many residents in the other boroughs worried that their interests would bow to those of Manhattan.
The hotbed of resistance was Brooklyn, and even now, similar sentiments can be heard in a statement this week by the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden. "If the consolidation had not taken place," he wrote, "it seems clear that continued independence for Brooklyn, Long Island City or Queens and New York City would have fostered intense competition among the municipalities, resulting in dynamic economic growth and an even stronger metropolitan region than we have today."
But the historian Robert A. Caro contended that it was far too soon to forswear consolidation. He admitted that many outlying neighborhoods have suffered from centralized power, particularly places torn apart by immense city works projects like highways. But Mr. Caro, an advisory board member of New York City 100, said consolidation has allowed New York to become "a canvas" for a huge influx of immigration that has made the city what it is today.
"Because of the consolidation, they are all pouring into the same place, not five different places, not five different cities," said Mr. Caro, the author of "The Power Broker," a biography of Robert Moses.
When New York is many more centuries old, Mr. Caro said, "historians looking back on the history of New York will then see it would not have become as great as it became had it not been unified."

Judge's Ruling Could Allow Baby Bells to Expand
A Federal judge in Texas ruled yesterday that major sections of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 are unconstitutional, threatening the system created by Congress to deregulate the $200 billion telecommunications industry.
If the decision by Judge Joe Kendall of the United States District Court in Dallas is upheld, it could eliminate barriers that up until now have prevented regional Bell telephone companies from offering long-distance service. Page A1. 

Moderate Slowdown Seen
The index of leading economic indicators recorded a second consecutive rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in November even as a majority of its components fell, the Conference Board said. In another report, the Chicago Purchasing Management Association said its manufacturing index, a national bellwether, slipped to 58.1 from 59.5 in November. The two reports were consistent with predictions of a moderate slowdown. D2.
 
Gene-Based Cancer Test Approved
The Food and Drug Administration approved the first gene-based test for predicting whether a cancer will return. The test, made by Oncor Inc., looks at how many copies of a particular gene a patient has and uses that information to say whether breast cancer is likely to recur. A10.
 
Bonds End 1997 on High Note
Bond prices rallied on the last day of the year, strengthening prices and leaving yields on the widely followed 30-year Treasury issue near the lowest level in more than four years. The long bond's yield fell to 5.92 percent, down from 5.97 percent Tuesday and substantially lower than its 6.64 percent yield at the end of 1996. D14.
 
Dollar in Year-End Rally
The dollar gained in light currency trading from purchases by traders who expect further dollar gains as Japan and other Asian countries struggle to revive their economies. The dollar settled at 1.7987 marks, up from 1.7894 marks on Tuesday and up 16.7 percent for the year, and at 130.42 yen, up from 130.13 yen and up 13 percent for the year. D11.
 
Coffee and Silver Prices Fall
Coffee futures prices fell on signs that roasters are amply supplied, while silver prices tumbled in thin trading. D11.
 
Airlines Begin New Screening
Airlines nationwide will begin using a computerized screening process today to determine which passengers should have their baggage checked for explosives and whether the passengers who are singled out actually boarded a plane with the bags. The new system has been criticized on the grounds that it will lead to discrimination against members of some religious or ethnic groups. A13.
 
Indonesian Credit Rating Cut
Indonesia's foreign-currency debt rating was cut to junk bond status by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, reflecting the nation's deteriorating financial condition. D4.
 
Nationsbank Plans Florida Job Cuts
Nationsbank says its expects to eliminate more than 6,000 jobs in Florida as it takes over Barnett Banks Inc. Many of the cuts, about 19 percent of the banks' combined work forces, will come through attrition. D4.
 
Quaker Oats in Radioactive Accord
More than 100 former Massachusetts students who ate radioactive oatmeal as unwitting participants in an experiment in the 1940's and 50's will share a $1.85 million settlement from Quaker Oats and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A19.
 
Markets Closed
All financial markets in the United States are closed today for New Year's Day. Most markets overseas are also closed. Tomorrow, the Treasury market and other United States markets will hold shortened sessions, but the stock market will have regular trading hours.

HEADLINE: And for Giuliani's Second Act . . .

 BODY:
I always pass on good advice," Oscar Wilde wrote a century ago in "An Ideal Husband." "It is the only thing to do with it. It is never any use to oneself."
With that in mind, we pass along to Rudolph W. Giuliani this counsel as he begins his second term as Mayor of New York. Sure, it's a lot to ask, but then again, he has four years to do it. We presume. 

Floyd H. Flake, minister of Allen African Methodist Episcopalian Church in Queens.
New York, like most other urban centers in the United States, approaches the next millennium with a list of critical needs that must be addressed -- crime, poverty, social decay, race relations, poor education and economic stagnation.
New solutions, however, must not follow the pattern of the last 30 years, where government support was the primary vehicle for change. The future will depend largely on job creation in inner-city neighborhoods. The inner city must be transformed into a stable community providing opportunities to those coming off of welfare. There must also be major investments in all forms of education, whether public, private or parochial, to assure that there is a competent work force for the future.

Stefanie Syman, co-founder of the on-line magazine Feed.
The Mayor should outlaw the phrase "Silicon Alley," however handy it may be to describe the sundry Web site developers and digital publishers based in New York City. The phrase implies that Manhattan's young industry could grow up to be just like Silicon Valley, land of chips and million-dollar stock options. But the name has given rise to expectations that contravene reality. Few, if any, of the New York companies have reached profitability in 18 months. None make silicon chips. By exacting penalties for use of the phrase, Mayor Giuliani might temper outsized hopes for this new industry. If he introduces a viable alternative, he may even receive a plaque somewhere on Broadway.

Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, husband-and-wife comedy team.
Thanks to Mayor Giuliani's personal dynamism, New York is once again visitor-friendly. The challenge now is to become neighborhood-friendly. New York could be the first city to create a program that celebrates neighborhood history. The city could sponsor events with historians and performers, who educate and entertain. That would allow us to cross into each other's backyards so we can better understand our different cultures.

Lisa Schiffren, former speechwriter for Vice President Dan Quayle.
Now that the Mayor has been safely re-elected, he should abolish rent regulation. There is no single policy change that would have as quick, long-lasting and positive an effect on the city's quality of life. Builders would build more housing; rents would come down; the grubbiness that characterizes great swaths of the Upper West Side would be polished away; tax-paying families would be less financially stretched if they didn't have to subsidize those who can't afford to live here. Doing this would also correct the unfortunate impression that he values political muscle too highly, and political principle too little.

Charles B. Rangel, Democratic member of Congress.
The Mayor should try to be a nicer person. New Yorkers really want to be fond of the Mayor, and he has to give them an opportunity to do that.

Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission.
Because history says New York's economy is likely to contract sometime during the next four years, I hope the Giuliani administration prudently invests any budget surplus generated by the past year's economic growth. And because great cities need free and open political systems, I hope the Mayor forsakes his efforts to silence civic organizations that sometimes criticize his policies.

George Stephanopoulos, former senior adviser to President Clinton and visiting professor at Columbia.
The headline "Studies Show That New York Has Greatest Income Gap" should be taped to Mayor Giuliani's desk. His mission statement for the next term? Make New York a middle-class city again. Recent studies show that in New York State, the top 20 percent earned nearly 20 times more than the bottom 20 percent -- a wider disparity than anywhere else in the country.
Global trade, the decline of manufacturing and new technology all play a part in New York's dilemma. The Mayor can't single-handedly stop these trends, but he can prevent further reductions in low-income assistance programs, insist on strong job training and placement for welfare recipients, and put more resources into the public schools.
Even more important is the Mayor's broader opportunity. He should lead a national campaign to reverse the income gap in the United States. As a Republican who has made New York a safer place for the middle class to live, he can now focus on making all American cities places where the middle class can make a living.

Alanna Heiss, director, P.S. 1, Contemporary Art Center, Queens.
 The firm beat of Rudy's inner heart
 supports new outerborough art.
 Our hope for 1998?
 His heartbeat does not syncopate.

William J. Bratton, former Police Commissioner.
The New York City turnaround does not have to be temporary. What Mayor Giuliani has learned is that for 30 years, we may have had it all wrong. Crime and disorder are not necessarily the result of social deterioration; rather, they were among the principal causes of the city's decline.
Mr. Giuliani has the historic opportunity to prove once and for all that this most diverse and complex of American cities can effectively address crime, drugs, education and racial tension. Continued optimistic political leadership and community policing can make the dramatic changes of the 90's a reality in the next century.

Hugh Fink, a comedian and writer for "Saturday Night Live."
Mayor Giuliani claims credit for improving the quality of life. The quality of life on the Upper West Side, however, is rapidly deteriorating -- not because of crime or noise, but because of something more terrifying: the increasing number of babies in strollers. I can't even buy a Cohiba Siglo at the local cigar bar without being harassed by them. The Chinese Government's one-baby-per-household policy should be applied to all couples residing near Columbus Avenue. Or at least the Mayor should provide a baby path, to be shared with Rollerbladers.
Also, the Mayor should continue with his apparent push to make sure there is at least one Banana Republic on every street corner. I will certainly rest easier knowing that at any given moment I'm within walking distance of a ribbed V-neck sweater. Unless, of course, I get mowed down by a baby stroller first.
 
Lyn Pentecost, executive director of the Lower East Side Girls Club.
The day before Thanksgiving, a 15-year-old girl was pushed/fell/ jumped from the roof of the housing project across the street from my office because a crack deal went bad/she owed someone money/she was depressed about her life. No one knew the exact details.
Just another senseless tragedy on Avenue D. This one hit particularly close to home because the dead girl was the cousin of two girls who attend my after-school program. These two, 10 and 12 years old, are so bright, so eager, so ready to embrace life. Yet statistics -- school test scores, teen-age pregnancy rates, drug use, family violence -- tell me they are at risk. And the time to intervene is now, before they stick their toes into the turbulent waters of adolescence.
To the Mayor and every other adult in New York City who wonders why so many teen-agers are so destructive to themselves and others -- particularly when we have so many programs for teen-agers -- I can only say: too little, too late. Safely navigating adolescence is a learned skill. Every New Yorker should take time to help a pre-adolescent find his or her path.
 
Ned Regan, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
Mayor Giuliani should take advantage of the first months of his new term, when citizens and civil servants are open to change, to focus his strong management skills on reforming inefficiencies in the city bureaucracy. Work rules and regulations, in place through collective bargaining or legislative acts, are seemingly impervious to frontal attacks. But they become vulnerable if the Mayor sits down with shop stewards and City Council members to decide which rules neither help workers nor improve the quality of life for the people of the city, and then works to eliminate them. American businesses have become the envy of the world as efficient producers of goods and services. Now it's the government's turn.

Donald Trump, real estate developer.
Fighting crime, educating our children, lowering taxes and helping to create a productive workplace are all elements that should be pursued by Mayor Giuliani. Keeping the Yankees, bringing back the Jets, working with the Mets on a new stadium in Queens and perhaps bringing the Olympics to New York are also worthy goals.

Mitchell L. Moss, director, Taub Urban Research Center at New York University.
New York City cannot afford to enter the 21st century with antiquated land use and economic development policies. Our zoning regulations separate work and housing, despite the fact that many individuals prefer to live and work in the same building. With self-employment and small businesses on the rise, flexible living arrangements will be as important as skyscrapers were in the early 20th century. Furthermore, now that New York is a safe city, we need to make it an affordable place to live as well. The Mayor should stimulate housing construction in lower Manhattan and on the waterfronts of Queens and Brooklyn so that the middle class doesn't move to the suburbs.

Geoffrey Canada, president of the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families.
With crime down, the stock market up and New York reclaiming its position as tourist capital of the world, New York City should rediscover its children. We could give three gifts: health care for the more than 300,000 children in the city without it, child care for all the families that need it, and a safe place for every child to be after school.

Marcella Ross, founder of the Romanian Information and Referral Center, in Queens.
As a Romanian New Yorker, I have worked with newly arrived immigrants from Romania and other East European countries for the past decade. Many of them are educated and have marketable skills and professions. However, because of language and cultural barriers, many have trouble gaining housing, education and employment. We need to do better in engaging new arrivals and helping them negotiate the system. This will give them the chance to become independent and self-sufficient.

Bella S. Abzug, former Democratic Congresswoman.
Mayor Giuliani should remember that bullying and belligerence do not equal leadership. You can't be a kinder, gentler or better Mayor -- much less help those left out of New York's economic boom -- without toning down the macho posturing. Cross-dressing isn't convincing enough. Besides, who wears full makeup and formal dress without a hat?

Gabe Abelson, head monologue writer, "Late Show With David Letterman."
If you decide to run for President, Mr. Mayor, just remember: It's not easy to run in heels.

HEADLINE: Sandra W. Meyer Dies at 60; Pioneer Marketing Executive

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY

 BODY:
Sandra W. Meyer, a pioneering marketing executive who was part of the inspiration for the long-running Broadway drama "The Sisters Rosensweig," died on Tuesday at New York University Hospital. She was 60 and the cause of death was breast cancer, her family said.
Mrs. Meyer held senior-level executive positions at some of the nation's largest and best-known companies at a time when women worked mainly in the administrative ranks. 
 She became the first woman product-group manager at the General Foods Corporation, in 1969; the first woman president of a division of the American Express Company, in 1980, and the first woman senior officer to run corporate affairs at Citicorp, in 1989.
Mrs. Meyer, who lived in New York, was known as a brilliant marketer and strategic thinker. At General Foods, which merged with Kraft Foods in 1995, she ran marketing campaigns for some of the biggest brands, including Maxwell House coffee. She joined American Express in 1976 as head of worldwide marketing for the credit card and was later promoted to president of the communications division.
At Citicorp, as senior officer for corporate affairs and a member of the company's senior management team, Mrs. Meyer was widely credited with restoring the reputation of the banking company after it had gone through a financial crisis. In 1993, Mrs. Meyer left the position Citicorp created for her to become a senior partner at the Clark & Weinstock management consulting firm, a position she held until her death.
Mrs. Meyer had also been a managing director of Russell Reynolds Associates, a corporate search firm.
Her life and work were part of the inspiration for the Broadway play "The Sisters Rosensweig," which was written by her sister, Wendy Wasserstein.
The play revolves around Sara Rosensweig, a twice-divorced Jewish-American banker who is visited on her 54th birthday by her two sisters. The middle one, Gorgeous, the group leader of the Beth El Sisterhood of Newton, Mass., is ostensibly a happily married mother of four who is trying to start a career as a radio talk-show host. The youngest, Pheni, is an international travel writer who also struggles to write serious books and fights with the man she loves -- a bisexual theater director.
Mrs. Meyer served on several corporate boards, including Anchor Hocking and Horizons International Foods. She was managing director of the Metropolitan Opera Association and a member of the board of trustees of the Metropolitan Opera Guild. She was also one of the founding members of the Committee of 200, a group of the most senior executive women in the country.
Mrs. Meyer graduated cum laude from Syracuse University with a bachelor's degree in history.
In addition to her sister, Wendy Wasserstein, of New York, Mrs. Meyer is survived by two daughters; Jenifer Schweitzer, of New York and Samantha Schweitzer, of San Francisco; another sister, Georgette Levis, of Manchester, Vt.; a brother, Bruce Wasserstein, of New York, and her parents, Lola and Morris Wasserstein, of New York.

HEADLINE: A Night the World Comes to the Crossroads of the World

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Bill Grant had New Year's Eve choreographed to the smallest detail.
Eight months ago, he booked a room at the Hotel Edison for himself and his girlfriend, Mary Smith, for the New Year's holiday. It was to be her first trip to New York City. Yesterday afternoon, he escorted her to Central Park for a hansom carriage ride -- and a marriage proposal. And last night, he took her to Times Square -- to usher in 1998 with 500,000 screaming, happy strangers before the eyes of the world. 
 "It's been unbelievable," said the soon-to-be Mrs. Grant, who, like her fiance, is 24 and from Columbia, S.C. "I don't want this to stop. This is a suspension of reality."
Suspension, indeed. A collapsed building just a block away? Falling bricks on Madison Avenue? Pedestrian barriers on Fifth Avenue? Nordic temperatures and a wind chill factor of up to 15 degrees below zero? Bah!
For many people, only one thing mattered, said Darryl Terranova, who had just arrived from a suburb of Buffalo named Holland.
"It's New Year's Eve, and we've got to be in New York City," said Mr. Terranova, 22, who with his brother, Travis, and some other hometown friends was en route to the All-Star Cafe in Times Square for some pre-ball-dropping carousing. "The other 364 days, we're in Holland -- the town, not the country."
There were many people like the brothers Terranova, who descended on Times Square last night to bid adieu to 1997 and welcome 1998. But this year, perhaps more than in years past, many of the revelers were out-of-towners visiting New York for the first time, encouraged by a booming economy and a burnished image of the city -- and Times Square -- as a safer, cleaner, almost Disneyfied kind of place.
As in the last several years, security was tight, with Seventh Avenue and Broadway closed to traffic from 57th to 39th Streets. The New York City Police Department (the department would not say how many officers) appeared to be in full force to maintain order, and 4,600 barricades were in place. As in years past, those people who said they had theater tickets or dinner reservations had to prove it to police officers.
At one point, revelers mingling at the intersection of Ninth Avenue and 42d Street blocked four of five lanes of traffic, prompting a cacophony of car honks and kazoos. But the police soon imposed order, and some visitors appreciated the effort.
"Everyone back home said we'd be mugged and robbed, but people have been friendly so far," said Emily Shipe, 18, who arrived yesterday morning from Industry, Pa.
It was Ms. Shipe's first trip to New York, and she and three friends from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, freshmen all, had staked out a spot near 44th Street -- at 1 P.M. "We want to get on TV," she said. "We want to be on Dick Clark."
"It's an awesome experience," said Dimitri Vladimirov, who was taking in the scene at Times Square with three friends from the University of California at Davis. "You've got to do this at least once in your life."
At least once in your life: The Dobbs family of Bethpage, Tenn., repeated that phrase as they waited patiently behind a police barricade on Seventh Avenue. It was, Debbie Dobbs said, the first time that any of her party of six had come to New York. In previous years, they had been scared off by the city's reputation; this year, she said: "We just took a chance and said, 'Why not? We have to do it once.' "
Mrs. Dobbs said her family was having a wonderful time. But it was chillier than they had expected, so two of her sons, Cory, 21, and Brian, who will be 25 tomorrow, scurried to buy some long johns. Temperatures dipped to 16 degrees by midnight, with the wind-chill factor in the concrete canyons of Times Square making it feel like 15 degrees below zero.
"I've got one word for you," said Lauren Olicker, 20, of Wilmington, Del., who -- surprise, surprise -- was also making her maiden trip to New York. "Layers."
Ms. Olicker arrived in the city shortly after noon yesterday, having taken the train with her friend Wayne Matthews. Everyone on the train, she said, was in a celebratory mood. But one person did not make it to Times Square: he had already started his own private drinking party and was so drunk that the conductor forced him to get off at Trenton.
It was a message that the police hoped would not be lost on the revelers who did make it to Times Square. They reiterated their policy that anyone caught drinking in public would have their drink confiscated and be issued a summons.
Early this morning, the police said they had not finished tallying the number of arrests or incidents. But police officers in Times Square said there were several arrests, and eyewitnesses reported seeing at least two people removed from the scene in ambulances.
For some New Yorkers, Times Square was a place to avoid. Frank Scutaro, a marketing manager at a pharmaceutical company who lives on the Upper East Side, said he would be spending the evening with perhaps a dozen friends in Chelsea.
"This year, a lot of people had a good and busy year," he said. "There was a lot of energy, and business has been great. Maybe people are like, 'I can get the crowds anytime I want and I should take a day off to veg out and just relax.' "
Indeed, for some, the New Year's Eve celebrations were just the finale of a good year. Louise Hardy and Vincent Derrick of Holcombe, England, had originally planned to visit New York -- first-timers, too -- to celebrate Christmas. But then they decided to get married, and invited their friends Phil and Rebecca Southern to witness the ceremony.
So yesterday afternoon, they were married in their suite at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, and planned to attend the hotel's Grand Ballroom Gala to dance to the songs of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.

HEADLINE: Judiciary Report: Congress Is Prodded

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the 1997 Year-end Report on the Federal Judiciary by William H. Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States: 
 As I review the state of the judiciary this year and compare it with the 11 previous years I have served as Chief Justice, I am impressed by the degree to which our relations with Congress have dominated 1997. Congressional responses and initiatives on judicial issues ranging from funding to salaries, and from Federal jurisdiction to judicial vacancies, all have had a significant influence on the judiciary over the past year.
The results have been mixed, which is scarcely surprising, and therefore we will face some of the same challenges in 1998 that confronted us in 1997. Despite the work that remains to be done, I am encouraged by the judiciary's ability to perform its essential role in our constitutional structure of Government. . . .
I first would like to express my gratitude to Congress for its financial support of the judiciary. In a time of scarce resources, Congress responded favorably to the careful financial plan adopted by the executive committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States. These moneys will be used wisely and economically. The judiciary supports fully the national goal of eliminating the budget deficit and has instituted a formal process to identify and implement initiatives to reduce or avoid costs. . . .
In general, Congress has declined to eliminate the disparity between resources and workload in the Federal judiciary by an expansion of the number of judges. There have been instances, however, in which Congress wisely has acted to reduce this disparity by enacting laws that in effect decrease the number of potential filings in Federal court. In 1996, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which streamlined habeas corpus procedures for both state and Federal prisoners, and the Prison Litigation Reform Act (P.L.R.A.), which did the same for prisoners' civil rights actions. . . .
With limited degree of hindsight available to us -- and keeping in mind that there are many variables that could affect the future rate of prisoner filings in Federal court -- the Effective Death Penalty Act and P.L.R.A. appear to be promising examples of how Congress can reduce the disparity between resources and workload in the Federal judiciary without endangering its distinctive character.
Unfortunately, Congress's effort to enact legislation of this type have been sporadic and inconsistent. I therefore call on Congress to consider legislative proposals that would reduce the jurisdiction of Federal courts. For many years, diversity of citizenship cases have been identified as one such area in which Congress could enact some very useful reforms.
Should Congress, conversely, consider expanding the jurisdiction of the Federal judiciary, it should do so cautiously and only after it has considered all the alternatives and the incremental impact the increase will have on both the need for additional judicial resources and the traditional role of the Federal judiciary.
If Federal jurisdiction remains at its current level -- or, worse, increases -- judicial vacancies will aggravate the problem of too few judges and too much work. Currently, 82 of the 846 Article III judicial offices in the Federal judiciary -- almost 1 out of every 10 -- are vacant. Twenty-six of the vacancies have been in existence for 18 months or longer and on that basis constitute what are called 'judicial emergencies.' In the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the percentage of vacancies is particularly troubling, with over one-third of its seats empty.
Judicial vacancies can contribute to a backlog of cases, undue delays in civil cases, and stopgap measures to shift judicial personnel where they are most needed. Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the Federal judiciary. Fortunately for the judiciary, a dependable corps of senior judges has contributed significantly to easing the impact of unfilled judgeships.
The institutions that have the constitutionally assigned powers of nominating and confirming judicial nominees bear some of the responsibility for the current situation, but structural aspects of the appointment process also contribute to the existing high level of vacancies. For example, a larger judiciary increases the average number of retirements per year and the corresponding number of nominees. The additional burdens placed on the appointment process by such an increase may slow it down.
An appointment process that might work well to fill the vacancies of the 700-member judiciary might struggle with a judiciary of 800 or 850 members. Accordingly, increasing the size of the Federal judiciary so that it can handle expanded workloads might have the unintended effect of increasing the vacancy rate, perhaps leaving unaffected the gap between resources and workload that motivated the initial increase in the number of judges. This ironic result strongly supports the common-sense conclusion that, in this country, a bigger Federal judiciary is not necessarily a part of a solution for every public-policy question.
Whatever the size of the Federal judiciary, the President should nominate candidates with reasonable promptness, and the Senate should act within a reasonable time to confirm or reject them. Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed during 1994.
The Senate is, of course, very much a part of the appointment process for any Article III judge. One nominated by the President is not "appointed" until confirmed by the Senate. The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote for him up or vote him down. In the latter case, the President can then send up another nominee.

HEADLINE: The Year of Living Smugly

 BODY:
Perhaps the most striking thing about 1997 was its power to divert. The robust economy, the continued decline in crime and the blessed respite from terrorist violence on home soil gave the nation an opportunity to focus on intensely personal news events with little overarching import -- the death of Princess Diana, the "nanny" trial and the birth of American septuplets.
It seemed, in many senses, the best of times -- even the prosperous, placid 1950's had been overshadowed by the cold war. Now, the United States is the planet's only remaining superpower. Its most ambitious hopes for furthering Middle Eastern peace or smoothing China's emergence as an economic and political power may not have been realized, but 1997 was still a year marked by uneasy peace in places where the mere absence of armed conflict must be counted as achievement. At home, the stock market rose more than 20 percent for the third straight year, and it was no surprise that Wall Street traders ended 1997 by releasing balloons in honor of the new horde of millionaires the market had created. 
 But balloons eventually pop, and the very fact that the news seemed so relentlessly positive was a bit unnerving. If the economy in 1997 was as good as it gets, did that mean that 1998 was bound to be worse? The end-of-the-year financial chaos in Asia, still threatening the world's 11th-largest economy in South Korea, seemed to some an unsettling omen of grimmer times to come.
Every glowing statistic had a second, sobering face. Crime was down, but more police officers were dying in the line of duty -- 156 in 1997, compared with 116 the year before -- and experts said one of the reasons was more powerful weaponry on the streets. In New York City, the epicenter of the war on crime, spectacular new brutality cases put a pall over all the Police Department's genuine accomplishments. The economic boom produced little benefit for the poor. Welfare rolls plummeted, but thousands of disabled children lost their Federal benefits, and many hard-working legal immigrants were forced into the soup lines after losing their food stamps. In Washington, Congress patted itself on the back for balancing the budget for the first time in 30 years, rigorously avoiding all the evidence that it was the surging economy rather than the lawmakers' self-discipline that did the trick. Congress's overall public image continued to be abysmal, largely because of its contemptuous disinterest in reforming the campaign finance system. The Justice Department's failure to act on strong evidence of illegality in the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign did nothing for public confidence either. But the controversy turned Vice President Al Gore's drive for the 2000 Presidential nomination from what looked like a sure thing to a question mark.
The President, for his part, could point to high popularity in the polls, but the substantive record was mixed. He reacted angrily to charges that he had become a caretaker chief executive, coasting toward retirement on a surging economy, the Dwight Eisenhower of the baby boomers. He could point to some real achievements, particularly in extending health coverage to more poor children. But his loss of the fast-track legislation -- postwar America's most serious renunciation of its historic trade leadership -- was a blow. Many of Mr. Clinton's friends predicted a rebound in 1998. Some speculated that he has simply been suffering from midlife golf obsession or, more likely, the funk that plagues many affectionate parents when their only child leaves the nest. While Mr. Clinton has over half his term to go, 1998 will be the year that determines whether he will be remembered for anything more positive than ending the welfare safety net.
Most Americans would be happy just to see the next 12 months bring more of the same. Our wish is more ambitious. May continued prosperity inspire the nation and its leaders with more generosity toward the people who have no reason to send up balloons in honor of their financial fortune. Americans face enormous challenges in improving opportunity for poor children, in protecting the least able from the full brunt of an unforgiving marketplace. Instead of being a waiting room for the new millennium, 1998 could launch a spectacular, compassionate finale for the epoch.

Announcing The Arrival Of the Airport

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
IN the good old days, Newark Interna tional Airport was How to put it? -- "How about rinky-dink?" Amy Miller said. "That's what I used to say."
Ms. Miller, a psychology student at Rutgers, was feeling greatly nostalgic for those rinky-dink days as she waited for her boyfriend's arrival on a Continental Airlines flight from Jacksonville, Fla. She was slumped like a sack of laundry on a window ledge in Terminal C, braced against the New Year's Eve crowds. Travelers were slumped similarly all around her, overpacked and unfit to bear their loads. The lines at the Continental ticket counters were thick and messy, people were whining to beleaguered baggage handlers and two babies were screaming as if the world were coming to an end. 
 "I used to love this airport," said Ms. Miller, who lives in Westfield, N.J. That's a 20-minute drive that took twice as long with yesterday's traffic. "I remember when there were no lines," she said. "No waiting. Just in and out."
It wasn't so long ago. Newark used to be the sleeper airport, the one where you could get in, get out and take off without feeling as though reaching the plane was a trip in itself. A pre-ticketed traveler from, say, Hoboken, could leave the house an hour before the flight, get to the airport in a half hour, tops, and sashay to the gate for boarding with time left to buy a Snapple.
Then came the terrific economy, Continental's tremendous expansion and a wide-bodied monorail that makes going from Point A to Point B feel like a ride in the World's Fair. Now, Newark airport is no longer a local secret, the one thing New Jersey travelers could lord over New Yorkers. Now, the same traveler from Hoboken has to do what New Yorkers have had to do for years -- leave a couple of hours before the flight just in case there's traffic, which there usually is, and in time to secure the seat in case the airline overbooks the flight, which it often does.
"Newark is huge," Ms. Miller said. "Just say it's gotten too huge."
How huge is it? Port Authority officials project that the airport, the fastest-growing airport in the region, will set a record for its number of passengers in 1997, with 30.8 million. That's up from 29.1 million in 1996, 26.6 million in 1995. The day after Christmas, for the first time ever, all the airport's parking lots, from the hourly to the daily to the remote long-term lots that require a bus ride to the terminals, were full. That's over 15,000 parking spaces, all taken. The scurry for spaces backed up traffic around the airport for hours.
"We attribute that, at least in part, to the coinciding of Christmas and Hanukkah," said Bill Cahill, an authority spokesman.
Port Authority officials, perhaps anxious to appease Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who has complained that the agency has favored Newark over New York, took pains to point out that Newark's growth has not come at the expense of Kennedy and La Guardia airports.
ALL three airports are experiencing a healthy growth," said Robert Kelly, the Port Authority's director of aviation. He said Kennedy International Airport was also expected to set a record for passengers in 1997, with 31.3 million, making Kennedy and Newark about neck and neck. "We've got a great economy and it's making it great for air travel," he said.
The Port Authority, he added, is hoping that the Federal Aviation Administration will announce its approval in the next few weeks for an elaborate plan to ease congestion at Kennedy airport that should prove as attractive as the monorail at Newark (which is also being expanded).
Mr. Kelly said that Newark's passengers come from New Jersey while New Yorkers still go to Kennedy and La Guardia. But anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise.
Scores of yellow cabs with New York plates drop off passengers at Newark airport every day. There were dozens of the cabs at Terminal C alone yesterday, suggesting that at least some of the New Yorkers who have been complaining about all the tourists in Times Square are making their late holiday escape over the Hudson.
Sandrine Betances and Kevin Mitchell, plopping out of a yellow cab with two carry-on bags for a New Year's Eve trip to Boston, were two of them. Yes, they said, they had abandoned Kennedy about a year ago.
"We live on the Upper West Side, so it's actually faster to take a cab across the bridge than it is to take it across town to go to Kennedy," Ms. Betances said.
"Jerseyites probably don't want New Yorkers coming here, right?" Mr. Mitchell said. "Well, turnabout's fair play."

HEADLINE: Cable Giants Aren't to Blame for Rising Prices

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Behind Your Soaring Cable Rates" (editorial, Dec. 29) is flawed. Congress has forced cable operators to raise their rates through the "must carry" law. That law, which you supported (editorial, April 2), requires cable to surrender channels to local broadcasters. Thus pre-empted from competing for further advertising revenue, cable raises its rates. 
 In lamenting the dearth of satellite broadcasters, "wireless" cable operators and telephone companies, you ignore fundamental economics. Satellites will never reach anyone who has no south/southwest "look angle," as in most multiple-unit dwellings. Wireless has little channel capacity, and telephone companies prefer to expand into local or long distance rather than invest heavily in cable replanting.
As for your suggestion that the Federal Communications Commission force cable to bundle sports channels separately, what would you say if the Government required your sports section to be sold separately, to let nonsports fans get your paper more cheaply?

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Rise At Year's End; '98 Promising

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The bond market ended 1997 on a high note yesterday, strengthening prices and leaving the yield on the most widely followed United States Goverment security near the lowest level in more than four years.
Traders said the outlook for further bond market gains in 1998 remained favorable. 
 The 30-year benchmark Treasury bond increased 19/32 to a price of 102 21/32 in an abbreviated New Year's Eve session. . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction to price and is a barometer of interest rate trends, fell to 5.92 percent from 5.97 percent on Tuesday.
Yesterday's yield was near the 5.87 percent low for the year reached Dec. 23, which was the lowest since October 1993. It was also sharply below the 6.64 percent at the end of 1996. The high yield this year for the 30-year bond was 7.17 percent, reached April 14.
Traders were emboldened to buy bonds yesterday partly because of economic data that continued to suggest that economic growth is slowing and inflation remains benign. The December Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, a bellwether of a nationwide report on domestic manufacturing to be released Friday, fell to 58.1 compared with 60.5 in November. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators for November showed a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent, the same rate of gain as in October.
Dave Shabelman, a market analyst at Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said the Chicago purchasing index for the entire fourth quarter was well below third-quarter readings and "modestly below average readings for the year."
Mr. Shabelman said the broader index from the National Association of Purchasing Management is expected to drop as well and "fall in line with this healthy, but moderating trend."
David A. Levy, director of forecasting for the Jerome Levy Economics Institute in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said that despite the ample evidence of economic strength going into the new year, he foresees a slowdown and lower inflation in 1998.
"Businesses, households and government are approaching 1998 almost bursting with confidence," Mr. Levy said. "However, it is not wise to admire the future through a rear-view mirror. The economy does carry impressive momentum into 1998, but it will encounter several hindrances and perhaps financial landmines."
He said the dollar's strength, as well as weakened overseas demand, could depress American corporate earnings.
In other bond market news, the Treasury announced that it planned to auction $8 billion of 10-year inflation-indexed notes on Jan. 8.

HEADLINE: $319.5 Billion in Securities Offerings Sets a Record

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL

 BODY:
Wall Street completed a record year for underwriting financial securities with a turbulent but robust fourth quarter. The securities industry raised $319.5 billion in American stock and bond offerings despite the qualms caused by the spreading financial crisis in Asia.
The volume of securities issued in American financial markets during the three months ended yesterday represents a 22 percent increase from the $261.7 billion raised through stock and bond offerings in the final three months of 1996. But it was a decline of 14 percent from the levels for the three months ended Sept. 30, when underwritings raised $371.8 billion before significant credit problems in Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea emerged. 
 During the last three months, Merrill Lynch & Company retained its position as the leading manager of new United States securities issues with a 16.7 percent market share, followed by Salomon Smith Barney Inc., a unit of Travelers Group Inc.; Goldman, Sachs & Company; Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company and Lehman Brothers.
The record amount of company mergers in the quarter, which were concentrated in the telecommunications, banking and investment industries, helped buoy the market for securities offerings. During the three months ended yesterday, there were $336.9 billion of mergers and acquisitions, according to the Securities Data Company of Newark, up sharply from $162 billion in the period a year earlier. During the year, mergers totaling $919 billion were announced in the United States, an increase of almost 50 percent from 1996, when mergers totaling $626 billion were announced.
"It was a very robust quarter even with the onslaught of the Asian flu," said James Birle, a managing director in equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch.
The challenge of the Asian crisis may even have helped the biggest firms, Mr. Birle said. "After Oct. 27, the ability to distribute securities really mattered," he said, adding that firms like his, which have the ability to distribute securities to both individual and corporate customers worldwide, were able to "really differentiate themselves," from their domestic competitors because of their broader reach.
But firms without big global businesses also pronounced themselves pleased with business in the last three months. "It was a good quarter for us," said Daniel J. Schaub, senior vice president and director of corporate finance at A. G. Edwards & Company in St. Louis, but he added that business had slowed down earlier than usual. "It appeared institutions locked their profits in early," and took off for a slightly longer vacation than usual, he said.
The healthy market for stock and bond offerings, Mr. Schaub said, continued to be driven by "a lot of consolidation in industries," by low interest rates and by the buoyant equity markets. "We have had an economy that has been very robust," he said, "and it has been very pleasant to people. Consumer confidence is at record levels, people feel good about the economy."
Those with the most international business seemed to see more of the volatility. "It's been an incredibly volatile quarter," said John Massad, the head of debt syndication at J. P. Morgan & Company. "There was a strong market tone going into the quarter, then we had the trigger from Asia, and almost a complete reversal of the market's tone. Investors almost stepped away from the market completely."
Jeffrey Chandler, managing director and head of Merrill Lynch's global debt business, said, "It turned from a seller's market in credit markets to a buyer's market after the Asian meltdown." The Asian crisis, he added, had increased interest margins for debt issues and had also led to a greater spread between the rates paid by high-quality borrowers and others. "The Asian crisis also caused the postponement of quite a number of deals," he said. "That delayed volume will re-emerge."
The Asian crisis certainly cooled the market for issues from emerging economies.
"We saw the bond we issued in September for the Korean Development Bank, a four-year issue that was issued at 99.7, trade as low as the low 60's in mid-December," said Mr. Massad at J. P. Morgan, "but since then it has recovered today to roughly 80 percent in terms of dollar price. That's a measure of the volatility we have had."
The year as a whole though set a record. "It is a year when corporations, like consumers, were taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance debt and to issue equity securities," said Richard J. Peterson, a spokesman for Securities Data. Companies issued about 47 percent more debt in 1997 than they did in 1996, he added.
"One thing that helped make it a record year," Mr. Birle said, "was the number of billion-dollar-plus transactions," including several enormous privatizations, like that of France Telecom, and big capital raisings for companies like Fleet Financial, Household International, Teleport Communications and Hewlett-Packard.
What kept the markets so robust, Mr. Birle said, was "the continued flow of funds into the equity markets from mutual funds, asset-allocation adjustments, the continued cross-border flows of capital" and "the vast number of privatizations."
The securities' industry's disclosed fees for underwritings, however, declined slightly despite the record volume. The industry's disclosed fees totaled $8.4 billion for 1997 compared with $9.3 billion in 1996, according to Securities Data. That was partly because of a decline in the volume of initial public offerings, which are among the most profitable offerings for Wall Street firms. Such offerings totaled $42.6 billion in 1997 compared with $48.99 billion in 1996.
As for the future, Wall Street is betting that securities markets will continue to become more international and that the skills honed in the American securities industry will become more valuable in foreign markets as overseas nations deregulate their securities industries.
"The Wall Street mantra has been global for a while, but this year it truly was global," Mr. Chandler of Merrill Lynch said, "with European Monetary Union coming, and Japan's big bang, we expect that trend to continue. The deregulation of global markets should allow a lot more cross-border financings."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up vs. Yen and Mark, Capping Strong '97 Showing

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar jumped to a three-and-a-half-month high against the German mark and rose against the Japanese yen yesterday, capping a year in which the dollar thrived on the strength of America's economy.
The dollar gained in light trading from last-minute purchases by traders who expect further dollar gains as Japan and other Asian countries struggle to revive their economies. 
 Traders normally try to diversify their holdings to start a new year, but the dollar has too much momentum going into 1998, said Sean Bovenizer, head of foreign exchange at Norddeutsche Landesbank.
"We'll push onwards in the first hours and maybe first days of trading in the new year," Mr. Bovenizer said.
The mark suffered as traders continued a selloff to rid themselves of holdings that built up in a flight from Asian currencies in the autumn.
European currencies traditionally do well at year-end, Mr. Bovenizer said, "and we haven't seen that trend at all in the last week."
The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 1.7987 marks, up from 1.7894 late Tuesday, rising to its highest level since reaching 1.7990 on Sept. 10. The dollar settled at 130.42 yen, up from 130.13.
The dollar finished at a two-and-a-half-month high of 1.4625 Swiss francs, up from 1.4543. It rose to more than a three-month high of 6.0230 French francs from 5.9865 and reached a two-week high against the British pound, which settled at $1.6517, down from $1.6552. Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, suggested that British economic growth would slow in 1998.
For the year, the dollar finished 16.7 percent higher against the mark after scaling back from an eight-and-a-half-year high of 1.8815 on Aug. 6. Traders preferred America's stronger economic growth in 1997 and worried about the stability of Europe's planned common currency, which is scheduled to appear in 1999 and would supplant the mark as Europe's dominant currency.
Against the yen, the dollar ended the year 12.5 percent higher, though slightly below a five-and-a-half-year high of 130.78 on Dec. 16, as dealers fled from Japan's shaky financial markets and low interest rates. Against the pound, the dollar ended the year 2.7 percent higher.

HEADLINE: Data Suggest Another Year Of Expansion

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
The uninterrupted economic expansion that began with the end of the Persian Gulf war -- already the second-longest in peacetime this century -- is almost certain to reach its seventh anniversary in early spring, analysts said today in assessing the final batch of statistics published in 1997.
"The economy will grow at a good pace, but slower," said Paul W. Boltz, chief economist at T. Rowe Price, a leading mutual fund management company in Baltimore. He predicted total output would climb 2.9 percent in 1998, substantially slower than the estimated 3.8 percent for the year just completed. 
 Many analysts had called the 1997 rate unsustainably robust. They said the two reports released today were more consistent with predictions of a moderate slowdown.
The Conference Board's leading index, intended to foretell turning points in the economy, posted a second consecutive rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in November even as a majority of its components fell.
Chicago-area purchasing managers -- corporate officials who buy everything from fax paper to heavy machinery -- reported a modest slowing of a regional manufacturing index for December, to a still-strong 58.1 from November's 59.5. The Chicago purchasing index is widely viewed as a bellwether of a broader index to be released Friday by the National Association of Purchasing Management.
"The economic fundamentals such as subdued inflation, low long-term interest rates, strong job growth and solid income gains will allow the economy to continue growing next year, albeit at a less spectacular pace," Robert Barr, deputy chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said in a year-end statement.
The chamber's poll projected that the Mountain states would post the fastest growth, at 3.8 percent,
Although their estimates vary, economists agree that Asian currency and economic problems constitute the chief unknown in the 1998 outlook. They contend that exports will fall, cheaper imports will repress inflation and there will be big losers and big winners among American companies. The magnitudes, however, are mainly guesswork.
"The big question mark for 1998 is the possible impact of the shocks abroad on domestic business and consumer behavior," said John Youngdahl, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. But he pointed to an economy now operating at a high level with what he called "a lot of financial underpinning" for continued solid expansion.
About two-thirds of the rise in the Leading Index over the last three months was accounted for by a jump in the M-2 money supply, which includes money market funds and short-term deposits as well as currency and checking accounts.
For December, the biggest positive factor was a surge in new orders to factories for nonmilitary capital goods. Money supply growth was second, followed by an expansion of the average work week and slower deliveries by industrial suppliers.
The most significant of the negative forces was a rise for the month in first-time claims for unemployment insurance. The others were fewer building permits, lower factory orders for consumer goods, a decline in stock prices, a further narrowing of the difference between short-term and 10-year interest rates and a slight decline in still-high consumer expectations.
The expectations component comes from the University of Michigan's survey for November, not the Conference Board's survey that on Tuesday showed a very sharp increase for December.
"The leading indicators point to a continuation of the expansion through at least the early part of 1998," the Conference Board said of its report today.
Companion indexes of coincident and lagging indicators each climbed five-tenths of 1 percent in November. The coincident index is composed of indicators that usually move at the same time as the economy at large. The lagging index, which includes the prime rate and the cost of consumer services, moves after a delay.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Helping Hand Replaces Hands-Off Role in Asia

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Financial crises that threaten to melt down countries by the fistful are becoming a standard feature of the global economy. And as they occur, the governments of the big industrial countries find themselves dragged into the role of rescuing a market system that in theory at least is supposed to cure itself.
What the international response to the Asian crisis makes clear is how far governments have moved away from the dominant view of the Reagan and Thatcher years: that intervention hinders rather than helps in the marketplace. 
 "The idea that governments can just stand aside does not work; the costs are too great," said Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a research group. "The new view is that you cannot tell private parties you won't bail them out and they have to suffer the consequences of the marketplace."
That approach is evident in Asia. The acute debt-repayment problems of Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and others emerged barely six months ago, and already the United States and other big nations have committed more than $100 billion to bail them out, mainly through the International Monetary Fund.
Compare that with Latin America in 1981, when Mexico defaulted on tens of billions of dollars in debt, and Brazil, Argentina and other countries followed suit. In that troubled period, it took eight years before the United States Government intervened directly. The circumstances were different, of course, but out of that Latin American crisis a new role for governments in international financial crises began to evolve, shaped along the way by the savings and loan debacle in the United States in the late 1980's and the Mexican peso devaluation and debt crisis of 1994 and 1995.
A key tenet of the new approach is quick response -- offering bailout money almost immediately, usually in the form of loans channeled through the I.M.F. "We did that in Mexico in 1995," said Stanley Fischer, the I.M.F.'s deputy managing director, "and within two years that money was repaid and Mexico was on the move again."
The international environment was radically different in the Latin America of 1981. Syndicates of American banks were the big lenders. The borrowers were Latin American governments, not the private sector. And Walter Wriston's view of the world held sway. Sovereign governments do not default, Mr. Wriston said flatly, and he was chairman of Citicorp, the biggest lender. The loans flowed out without great regard for the high cost of repayment.
American banks often made new loans to finance repayment of the old ones or at least the substantial interest due on those loans. And when the defaults unexpectedly came, the banks agreed to new loans to get the Latin American governments to agree to new repayment schedules.
Writing off a substantial portion of the more than $200 billion in Latin American debt was viewed, at first, as unthinkable, a disaster for the banks. But over the years, the banks gradually did just that. When they finally acknowledged that the Latin American debt was uncollectible in its entirety, the Bush Administration stepped in -- the first government intervention in the unfolding drama.
"The initial reaction was that the only way to contain the Latin debt crisis was to deny that it existed," said Anna Schwartz, an economist at the National Bureau for Economic Research. "Just loan more money to maintain the fiction that these were performing loans. And this went on until 1987, when Citibank took the lead in facing the truth."
Mr. Bush's Treasury Secretary, Nicholas Brady, then offered what came to be known as Brady bonds. If the banks and the Latin American governments would agree to payments of, say, 50 cents of each dollar still owed, then the Bush Administration would guarantee such settlements by selling Treasury securities to the debtors equal to the discounted amounts the debtor countries had agreed to pay. The securities guaranteed repayment over a period of years, and so far the arrangement has worked.
But until the Brady solution, lending for new projects to many Latin American countries dried up and economic growth slowed, hurting American exports to the region.
The quick-response tactic so evident in the Asian crisis reflects a desire to keep those economies humming, which strengthens that of the United States, too. But even before Asia, two other debt crises, one domestic and one international, drew the American Government into an interventionist role, using public money to bail out investors.
The first, in the late 1980's, was purely domestic, the failure of hundreds of savings and loan associations that had lent huge sums heedlessly, mainly for real estate projects that failed to generate enough income to repay the loans. The Government, using Federal deposit insurance and additional taxpayer money, reimbursed all the depositors, closed the most damaged institutions and seized hundreds of billions in property that had been put up as collateral for the bad loans. Over the years, the Government sold the property to reimburse itself, and in the end, the net loss came to about $150 billion in taxpayer dollars, a huge sum but a relatively small proportion of an $8 trillion economy.
"The trick in all this is to stabilize the situation quickly," said Robert Glauber, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who played a big role in the savings and loan bailout as an official in the Bush Administration.
The Mexican crisis two years ago gave the Clinton Administration similar confidence in quick government action. A sudden and big peso devaluation scared off American lenders who had bought Mexican notes and bonds that paid double-digit interest in the mistaken confidence that devaluation would not wipe out their earnings. Once the I.M.F. and the Administration put in place more than $43 billion in bailout loans, American lenders renewed their lending. Mexican workers paid a price in frozen wages and higher unemployment, but Mexico repaid the bailout money.
"Because what President Clinton did was right, we have avoided far greater difficulties," Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Treasury Secretary and an architect of the bailout, told Congress two years ago, justifying what was at the time an unusually aggressive intervention by the Government in a financial crisis. "The right lessons are being learned."
The Asian crisis, set off by similar devaluations, is different in several respects, particularly from the Latin American crisis. While that lending was mainly by American banks to governments, the Asian loans came more from Japanese and European banks, with American lenders in third place. And the loans were not to governments but to private borrowers like real estate speculators and manufacturers.
Most important, the Latin economies could not generate enough income in the 1980's to repay their debt. They had to negotiate debt reductions incorporated in the Brady bonds. But the more powerful Asian economies, particularly that of South Korea, are considered capable of generating enough income for full repayment as long as the debt is spread out so that $34 billion -- 22 percent of the total owed abroad -- does not have to be repaid by next December. The I.M.F.'s bailout is intended largely to assure repayment of these loans.
"Korea has made it very clear in the current negotiations with its lenders that it has no intention of not paying," Mr. Fischer of the I.M.F. said. "It wants to get the short-term loans lengthened. And once that happens, there is a very good chance of everything being worked out without any interruption in payment."

HEADLINE: Holiday Sales Varying Less Among Regions

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
While the holiday shopping season usually means strong sales in one area of the country and terrible disappointments in others, this Christmas was oddly consistent from region to region, new figures show, reflecting in part a strong national economy.
For general merchandise retailers, sales at stores open at least one year -- known in the industry as same-store sales -- are not expected to rise sharply this year. Still, retailing experts say that areas of great strength and profound weakness were not nearly as evident this year as in seasons past, which economists say is unusual. 
"There hasn't been a year when regional differences have been so low since 1984," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, based in West Chester, Pa., which has kept holiday selling data since 1970.
Mr. Zandi said he expected the difference among the percentage changes in sales from region to region this Christmas would average only about 1.75 percentage points, below the 25-year average of 3.3 percentage points and just slightly higher than 1984, the last time regional sales were so undistinguishable at 1.54 percentage points. "You are hard pressed to find a time when regional economies look so much like each other," he said.
For example, Visa USA said that the average rise among credit card sales between Thanksgiving and last Sunday was 16 percent from a year earlier, and the only area of the country that came in more than two percentage points higher or lower than that figure was the Great Lakes region, where charges rose 13 percent.
At the same time Telecheck Services, the check acceptance company, found that sales rose 2.2 percent this season, and the only two regions that differed greatly from that average was the Southwest, where the company said check writing fell two-tenths of 1 percent, and the Southeast, where check writing rose 4.6 percent from 1996.
Tactical Retail Solutions, a retail consulting firm, said holiday sales rose 2.8 percent this Christmas but that it found only two places in the country where changes in sales stood out significantly: Phoenix enjoyed sales gains closer to 7.9 percent, while Galveston, Tex., had a gain of only nine-tenths of 1 percent.
"It is unusual to find so many regions of the country doing so well," Mr. Zandi said. "And that is reflected in relatively healthy sales gains."
Indeed consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, a New York business research group, is at its highest in three decades, and national unemployment fell to 4.6 percent in November, the lowest level since 1973.
Most analysts think that same-stores sales for major retailers will rise around 3 percent, which will not make merchants happy because they are used to strong economies offering up bigger sales gains.
But such gains are a result of low inflation, which is strongly reflected in prices of general retail merchandise, and the fact that there are still far too many retail stores for the number of shoppers in this country.
"I think you can see that pattern that like politics all retail is local," said Isaac Lagnado, president of Tactical Retail Solutions, "and things are pretty much equal these days."
Regions that last year had yet to catch up to the low unemployment rates and high consumer confidence figures of the rest of the country stepped up this season, while areas where growth was tremendous last year calmed down a bit, helping to smooth these shopping patterns.
Consider the Northeast. Visa said that shoppers spent $7.8 billion with their credit cards this season, an 18 percent increase for that region from the previous year. Telecheck recorded a 2.2 percent sales gain in the Northeast, while last year sales in the region rose a mere eight-tenths of 1 percent, dragging behind an overall 5.7 percent rise nationally.
Visa's numbers are probably a more reliable indicator of the retail life in the Northeast, where consumers are more prone to paying with plastic than zippig off a check.
"My guess is that the Northeast gains reflect the fact the Christmas was good for high-income households," Mr. Zandi said. "And the Northeast is the wealthiest region in the country. And the Boston and New York corridor benefited from financial service and markets and a booming high-tech sector in Boston, which is doing fabulously."
Conversely, Telecheck found that sales in the West rose 1.4 percent compared with last year, when they grew 5.9 percent. "As we listen to the different retailers," said Jay Meltzer, director of Johnson Redbook Services, which compiles retail data, "they are saying that California has been good but not as good."

HEADLINE: Another Year Of the Bull; Dow Up 22%

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
When the closing bell sounded yesterday afternoon, it signaled the end of a spectacular year on Wall Street -- the first time the Dow Jones industrial average had ever registered three consecutive superb years in its 100-year history.
By almost every measure, 1997 was a year for the record books. If winning on Wall Street is really about exceeding expectations, what investor, small or large, could complain about the year just passed? 
 All the major stock market indexes showed strong returns, adding $2.6 trillion worth of wealth to the market. Even with a dip of 7.72 points yesterday, the Dow average closed at 7,908.25 -- leaving the index with a gain of 22.6 percent on the year.
It was the first time the Dow had ever gained 20 percent or more for three consecutive years. Put another way, if an investor had placed $10,000 into the Dow industrial stocks at the end of 1994, that investment would be worth $20,620 today.
Few had thought such a gain was possible. The consensus on Wall Street at the end of 1996 was that the stock market might rise only slightly, or even fall sharply into a bear market in 1997, as had happened before after two great years.
"In the last century, there has never been a case where the market has done well three years in a row," said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. "So most people went into 1997 with that bit of lore on their minds."
In 1927, for example, the Dow rose 27.7 percent and in 1928 it rose 47.7 percent, followed by the crash of 1929 that left the Dow with an 18.7 percent decline. In 1985, the Dow gained 27.7 percent and in 1986 it gained 22.6 percent, then came the October 1987 crash, which left the Dow only 2.3 percent higher for the year.
In percentage terms, the last three-year period's cumulative gain of 106 percent is the second-best ever for the Dow average. The best was 1933-35, when it recorded a cumulative gain of 140 percent. With the 1997 gain, however, the Dow average has risen for a record seven consecutive years, racking up a gain of more than 300 percent in a decade.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- a broader measure of large stocks -- did even better than the Dow average in 1997, gaining 31 percent. The Wilshire 5000, a measure of the entire universe of United States stocks, rose 29 percent.
Among the main reasons: the economy grew robustly, unemployment fell to just 4.6 percent and corporate earnings grew by nearly 12 percent, but inflation fell to the lowest level in a generation -- advancing at an annualized rate of just 1.8 percent in November.
Economists and Wall Street analysts call this the "goldilocks economy" -- not too hot, not too cold, just right. Some also call it nirvana, or the best of all possible worlds.
"Two years ago it would have been inconceivable to talk about a 4.6 unemployment rate and a declining rate of inflation," said Elizabeth J. Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear Stearns. "But the single biggest positive surprise was the budget deficit going away."
The shrinking deficit meant the Treasury issued fewer bonds to finance the Government's needs. As a result bond prices rose and yields dropped, making stocks more attractive.
Indeed, investors on Main Street continue to believe stocks are the best of all possible investments. For the second consecutive year, they poured more than $200 billion into stock mutual funds, by far the best two years in history.
"The power is in the flow of funds," said Steven Leuthold, head of the Leuthold Group, a research and money management firm. "The key is whether the public continues to believe in the stock market."
How likely is it that investors will have another spectacular year? Not very likely, many analysts say, while noting that they used a similar line last year.
But while some feared that raging inflation would dismantle the stock market in 1997, many now believe the financial crisis in Asia will hurt corporate profits and perhaps create a deflationary environment in 1998.
"The earnings estimates for the first time in many years are going to have to be revised down," Ms. Mackay of Bear Stearns said. "The Asia issue may linger."
Charles Hill, director of research at First Call Inc., which tracks corporate earnings, already notes a sharp downward revision in fourth-quarter figures. In September, analysts expected a 13 percent gain; now they expect 8 percent.
Few, however, are predicting a bear market. The consensus for 1998 seems to be moderation after three great years.
Abby Joseph Cohen at Goldman, Sachs, one of the most widely followed stock strategists, says investors ought to expect more modest corporate profits next year, and equally modest stock gains.
But Ms. Cohen, whose buy recommendations after the market plunged Oct. 27 are credited with helping the bounce back Oct. 28, said she does not see an Asia crisis toppling the bull market.
"We have incorporated lower numbers in our profits and we still come up with a bullish posture," she said. "Asia will not be as dismal as many expect."
Mr. Wien at Morgan Stanley says the Dow could reach 9,000 early in 1998, but then inflation and wage pressures may catch up with the market and finally halt its streak.
"Interest rates will rise," he said, "and we'll find Asia isn't a big deal and the economy is a bit too strong."
The Asia crisis, however, remains an underlying nerve. It is one reason the stock market slowed in the second half of the year.
Although no one knows the Asia impact, expectations are clearly tempered. In fact, Barton Biggs, a global strategist at Morgan Stanley, says that the Asian crisis could foretell a far worse future for stocks.
"If this has been a year of moonlight and roses," he wrote recently, "next year I expect is going to be sackcloth and ashes. In other words, the huge brutal hug of a bear market will squeeze some."
But one strategist who expects another year of roses is Laszlo Birinyi, who heads his own research firm. Mr. Birinyi, who accurately predicted that the Dow average would reach 8,000 in 1997, and then close slightly below that level, said that in 1998 the Dow could reach 10,000.
"We think the market will have a good year, to the chagrin of everyone," he said. "Sentiment has historically been a good indicator, and we're seeing a lot of net buying, even when prices slip."
Despite all the good cheer about stocks, in 1997 about 90 percent of money managers trailed far behind the S.& P. 500, a traditional measuring stick, which means that people who invested in index funds that mimic the S.& P. 500 did much better than those who asked an expert to handle their investments.
Few could have lost by selecting stocks in the S.& P. 500. Among the nation's 500 largest companies, about 4 out of 5 stocks rose, and nearly 300 had gains exceeding 20 percent.
Out were stocks that invested in metals, paper products, chemicals, tobacco and gas exploration -- companies that helped build America. In were technology, telecommunication, banking, retail and financial services stocks -- companies that say they are rushing into the future.
Big-company stocks once again bested smaller-company issues, but there was much more parity this year as even the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 20 percent.
The best big stock of the year: Dell Computer, up 216 percent, on surging market share in personal computer sales. The worst: Echo Bay Mines, down 63 percent, a gold producer trying to get along in a world that no longer seems to value gold.

HEADLINE: S.A.T. Has the Power

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Eugene Garcia (Op-Ed, Dec. 26) says that by the mid-1980's the University of California was placing equal weight on Scholastic Assessment Test scores and grade point averages. However, the majority of applicants have G.P.A.'s in a narrow range (3.5 to 3.8), so that most of the variation among applicants is determined by S.A.T. scores. Thus, even if the S.A.T.'s role were diminished, it would still dominate admissions decisions. 
 Mr. Garcia correctly notes that women have higher college G.P.A.'s despite their lower S.A.T. scores than men. But this is not useful evidence in evaluating the predictive value of S.A.T. scores. Men score higher than women only on the math section, and as this would predict, fewer women pursue majors that have a math emphasis. Since these majors have not had the grade inflation of education and the humanities, in which women disproportionately major, it is not surprising that the college grade point averages of women are higher than those of men.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Metropolis: Glimpses Of the First 100 Years

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
Happy birthday to us. New York, New York, is a century old as of yesterday. On New Year's Day 1898, after decades of negotiating, infighting and deal making, as well as some fairly close votes in both general elections and the State Assembly, "The Greater New York City," as it was initially called, came into being.
It was created by uniting under a single government New York City (which consisted of Manhattan and the Bronx), Brooklyn, Queens, and Richmond (also known as Staten Island). The vote was closest in Brooklyn, a thriving city in its own right, and the country's third largest, where one of the biggest motivations seems to have been gaining access to Manhattan's water supply and other utilities. 
 Some parts of the city, notably Manhattan, have benefited quite a bit more than others. The consolidation, or annexation, continues to be lamented in many quarters, particularly on Staten Island, where in 1993 voters approved a nonbinding referendum to make the borough an independent city.
Over the next year, New York's first century will be observed in different ways around the city. Sometime this spring, the Brooklyn Historical Society plans a dramatic presentation about the consolidation, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music will have a play-reading series devoted to 20th-century works set in Brooklyn, starting with "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."
At the moment, several exhibitions inspired by or coinciding with the centennial are on view in Manhattan, with others arriving soon. The current shows range from displays of historic documents and photographs concerning the unification, at the Museum of the City of New York, to a show about the lighted signs of Times Square, at the New-York Historical Society, as well as several other related displays at both institutions.
Downtown, there are three exhibitions of photographs of New York -- at the Parsons School of Design, the Howard Greenberg Gallery and Gallery 292 -- that span several decades of photojournalism and the city's street life.
It would be stretching things to say that these exhibitions, taken as a whole, come close to doing the life and history of New York justice, or that they account for much of the art, architecture or literature that it has inspired or nourished. Still, one is grateful for their vivid, informative glimpses of both the city's past and its present, and they supplement one another in unexpected ways.
 
Museum of the City Of New York
On this occasion, the Museum of the City of New York, which is celebrating its own 75th anniversary, is living up to its name big time. It has spiffed up its famous toy collection and filled itself nearly to the brim with temporary exhibitions. A visit can take more than half a day.
The centerpiece is "The New Metropolis: A Century of Greater New York, 1898-1998," which tells the story of the consolidation and illuminates important moments in the years since. This show is overburdened with glossy text panels and somewhat short on visually striking material, which ranges from vintage photographs to political cartoons to campaign buttons, and its layout is confusing. But if you begin with the excellent documentary film at the show's center, things make much more sense.
Together, film and exhibition outline an elaborate tale of the different entities and how they became one, revealing the political machinations, the power brokers and the economic conditions that drove events. One can learn such specifics as the populations and total area of the five boroughs in 1898, or consider the thick volume titled "The Charter of Greater New York." More poetically, a copper-lined bathtub symbolizes the advent of indoor plumbing in Manhattan in the 1880's, while a rugged barrel and ship's wheel represent the busy harbor, the running of which was another impetus for consolidation.
In the art column, there's Abraham Walkowitz's 1913 Cubistic charcoal of dancing (or collapsing) Manhattan skyscrapers; Joseph Pennell's nocturne of lower Manhattan, and Paul Manship's model for the seal of the new city. Photographs document the growth of the Manhattan skyline, as, in different ways, do souvenirs of specific skyscrapers, like the mug decorated with the Flatiron Building.
Less cheerful developments are also referred to, as in a display of petitions, handbills and protest postcards by which the Crotona Park Tenants Committee opposed, unsuccessfully, the razing of their neighborhood to make way for the Cross-Bronx Expressway. There are photographs of the master builder Robert Moses, who refused to consider a less devastating alternative route. And the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the demise of Ebbets Field is once again documented, and mourned.
"New York From Above: An Aerial View," a second exhibition at the museum, has a higher ratio of art to information. It begins with a smattering of 19th-century panoramic depictions of the city, most notably John Bachmann's "Bird's-Eye View on Manhattan Island and Its Environs Taken From the South," of 1859. This tinted lithograph has "fish-eye lens" perspective that distorts the city into a globe: confirmation for those who think New York is not just the center of the world, but is, in fact, the world.
The main galleries of "Aerial View" contain the work of Spelman Evans Downer, a 43-year-old contemporary artist who lives in Jersey City and is fascinated by the cartographical New York, his main subject for nearly a decade. He replicates, or more accurately expands upon, existing maps to a highly refined degree, drawing in and texturing wet oil paint to indicate roads, buildings, topography and foliage with a skill that even cartographers, a famously picky bunch, might respect.
In red lines on expanses of pale green, Mr. Downer accounts for all the expressways in and around New York City. In various color combinations, including white on white, he give Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island paintings of their own and portrays Central Park in grisaille. Elsewhere, he turns comparative, juxtaposing painted versions of the city map of 1898 with that of 1998. An especially dramatic effort juxtaposes maps of the northern Harlem River before and after it was manipulated, showing in white, pink and ringing blue how the river lost its serpentine curves and Manhattan lost Marble Hill, the only Manhattan neighborhood that is actually in the Bronx.
Mr. Downer's paintings may not do everything you want art to do, but the best of them fuse beauty and fact with dazzling efficiency.
Additional exhibitions and displays await viewers with stamina. "A Dream Well Planned: The Empire State Building" follows the building, once the world's tallest, from the drawing board to its present incarnation, and finally divulges the symbolism of the various color combinations that light its crown during the year -- all of them.
"Revisiting the Scene: New Evidence, New Discoveries," a new permanent display of 19th- and 20th-century paintings of New York, contains several little gems, among them, "View From the Queensboro Bridge After a Snow on St. Patrick's Day," painted in 1910 by Sebastian Cruset, whose studio was in one of the finials of the bridge. And return visits should be planned for "Bridging New York," an exhibition opening on Jan. 31 that will bring together all kinds of images, from paintings to postcards, of some of the city's 2,027 bridges.
 
New-York Historical Society
"Signs and Wonders: The Spectacular Lights of Times Square," the main event at the New-York Historical Society, is almost the inverse of "The New Metropolis." It examines a single subject, in this case an under-appreciated commercial art form, but stirs up all sorts of local history in the process. Vintage photographs convey the progressing complication and beauty of the signs themselves, starting with the 1917 Wrigley spearmint gum spectacular, with its lacy fountains, peacocks and 16 "spearmen."
The foundation of the early spectaculars was the clear light bulb, soon overtaken by colored lights, flashing lights and the neon tube, whose flexibility led to animated signs like the one that showed a kitten tumbling around with a ball of thread, demonstrating that Corticelli thread "does not knot." Theater marquees are joined by movie marquees, their lighted signs custom-made for each new movie. Flamboyant advertisements for liquor, cigarettes and ladies' underwear are joined by those for film and cameras and the dramatic patterns possible with computer programming of lights. Coca-Cola, though, is a constant.
Along the way, the exhibition traces the development of advertising; the ebb and flow of the area's businesses; the birth of the Municipal Art Society, which opposed the signs, and the rise, fall and Disneyfication of Times Square.
This exhibition is not without its text panels, but the reading is worth it. Having absorbed all this information, one can always visit the real show already in progress, 20 blocks to the south.
Two other displays here also focus on Times Square. "The Deuce" presents Andreas Feininger's gritty photographs of the area in the 1970's, during its heyday as a sex district. The pictures are so dense with signs they often look like collages. "Times Square Then and Now" documents architectural progress with photographic comparisons, showing how specific buildings in the area have been demolished and replaced, altered or left to decay. It should not be surprising that the "after" is rarely better.
Two other shows circle back to "The New Metropolis." "To Hell With Reform: The Race to Become Mayor of Greater New York" reviews the platforms and campaign literature of the four men who competed in the first election, in 1897, to be the mayor of all New York. "Before Central Park: The Life and Death of Seneca Village" documents the fate of a small, but thriving community that was destroyed to make way for Central Park, one of the earliest examples of urban renewal in the city. On May 1, the Society will open "A Century Together: Creating and Recreating Greater New York," an exhibition that will examine the see-sawing of power between the city's central government and its constituent communities.
 
SoHo Galleries
"1930's New York" at the Howard Greenberg Gallery in SoHo, brings together impressive groups of work by photographers famous and less well known: Berenice Abbott, Joseph Kaplan, Sol Prom and Liborio Justo. It is a study in the power, both reportorial and abstract, of black-and-white photography, as demonstrated by four very different sensibilities. Abbott's rigorous images concentrate on the city's architecture and geometry: the forms of its building and the spaces they define, the pervasive grids of windows, the vanishing points of its endless streets. Kaplan lets in more of the human presence, but keeps his distance, shooting men on the street from above, like Rodchenko, or children playing in the snow in Central Park from such a distance that they become animated hieroglyphics. Mr. Prom is the humanist of the group, moving close to individuals of all kinds: Bowery bums, a shoeshine boy, six beautiful young women on a bench. And the ecumenical Mr. Justo is all over the place in both his forms and his sympathies, photographing people rushing to work from odd angles, a protest march in Union Square or the looming facade of Rockefeller Center.
Next door to Greenberg, Gallery 292 has mounted a small, but vivid show of vintage photographs taken in the late 1940's by Rebecca Lepkoff. Judging from these 20 images, Ms. Lepkoff seems to have been equally drawn to the city's people and its architecture.
She photographs well-dressed professionals in "Early Morning Rush Hour," the heated action of a stickball game in "Lower East Side" and a cool basilica of space defined by the legs of the El. But her real subject may be light itself, splintered and rearranged by New York's buildings, shading a scene with gentle grays or turning figures into dramatic silhouettes.

"Living for the City: 20 Years of New York Street Photography" at the Parsons School of Design brings us up to the present. Spend much time in this densely installed exhibition of work by 17 photographers, and you may begin to feel the city closing in on you, exciting and oppressive at the same time. You will also know that street photography is alive and well.
Nearly every photographer here acts as a tour guide of a different subculture. Geoffrey Biddle photographs the rough-and-ready youths of Alphabet City. A. Roy Greer attends to the West Village, concentrating on gay men; Sylvia Plachy patrols the perimeters, as in a silhouetted image of bench-sitters on the Brighton Beach boardwalk.
Richard Sandler, curator of the exhibition, and Arlene Gottfried prowl the subways, while, above ground, Steven Hirsch finds a reluctant subject in a man with a fistful of snakes. In his wittily titled "Hats and Hats Not" series, Jules Allen traces headgear through all kinds of life styles and economic strata. And Sid Kaplan and Jeff Mermelstein stick, quite literally, to the streets. Mr. Kaplan records the ongoing competition between cobblestones and asphalt. (His work looks like a Robert Smithson.) Mr. Mermelstein photographs a pigeon standing, wounded in the beak, at shocked attention on a curb, your average New Yorker, bloodied perhaps, but unbowed.

HEADLINE: Financial Services Consolidate, but Regulation Is Still Fragmented

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
In April, Bankers Trust, the nation's seventh-largest bank, agreed to buy Alex. Brown & Sons, a securities firm. That deal initiated a buying spree on Wall Street, culminating in the announcement in September that Travelers Group was buying Salomon Brothers Inc., adding more clout in bond trading and investment banking to an already flourishing combination of brokerage and insurance businesses.
Those combinations worry some lawmakers, who note that the current regulatory structure for financial services was devised when securities firms were securities firms, insurers sold insurance and banks acted like banks. As a lowering of the financial services industry's traditional legal walls and competition for the consumer's dollar give rise to ever-bigger financial supermarkets, concern is rising about safeguards for investors and the financial system. 
 For many experts, the trend cries out for a corresponding consolidation of the regulatory structure, with the creation of a new umbrella organization that looks at financial services companies comprehensively rather than bit by bit.
Historically, financial services have been regulated category by category. Brokerage houses have been the domain of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Banks have been looked over by the Federal Reserve and several other agencies. And insurance companies have been monitored by state regulators.
But increasingly, these businesses are coming under one roof, blurring the lines. In March, banks were permitted to expand further into the securities business, and a month later Bankers Trust announced that it was buying Alex. Brown, a major regional stock brokerage firm based in Baltimore. Following that deal, BankAmerica agreed to buy Robertson Stephens, and Nationsbank agreed to acquire Montgomery Securities.
The linkups could also go the other way. Several big financial companies, including Travelers and Merrill Lynch, have expressed interest in owning commercial banks. And these companies continue to spread further around the world in their quest for greater revenues.
"The concern is that somehow one of these institutions might run into difficulties and that the individual regulators won't see it coming," said Bert Ely, a Washington financial consultant. "You have to look at the corporation in its entirety to see how well it is managing its overall risk. Do the various risks magnify each other or neutralize each other? At what point does the balance tip?"
Consumer groups are concerned, too, as financial companies increasingly intermingle banking, securities and insurance offerings. Money market mutual funds, for example, provide investment returns similar to savings accounts, yet they are regulated as securities and sold through both banks and brokerage firms. Yet in contrast to bank savings accounts, the money market funds sold at banks are not covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; neither are other securities now being sold by banks.
Groups like Consumers Union say banks do not always explain the distinctions and the risks. Consumers Union is campaigning for more complete disclosure by banks and to require securities and insurance to be offered at different counters from traditional banking services.
Consumer interests are also cited by supporters of comprehensive oversight of financial services, though there is no consensus on how best to proceed. Regulators do not want to cede authority to a superpower and no industry wants another layer of regulation. Travelers, for example, favors the status quo of having "each relevant regulator regulate that part of the business," said Mary McDermott, a company spokeswoman.
Some proponents of umbrella supervision envision a kind of college of cardinals made up of the heads of the current regulatory bodies. But many see that as cumbersome and, instead, favor endowing one agency -- the Federal Reserve Board, say, or the Treasury Department or the S.E.C. -- with superior powers. But the extent of those powers has been a fundamental sticking point.
Some, including Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, argue that an umbrella supervisor should not actually regulate -- or have greater authority than the individual regulators -- but should try to coordinate oversight and encourage sharing of information. Others, including Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, contend that for an umbrella supervisor to have any effectiveness, one of the current regulators, probably the Fed, must be given some degree of authority over companies and other regulators.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, sees his organization as a natural for greater powers. His argument grows out of the idea that the Fed already has overriding authority over bank holding companies, like the new Bankers Trust-Alex. Brown combination, though the S.E.C. still monitors the company's securities business.
Mr. Greenspan's view encompasses the widespread belief that when Congress eventually permits bank-securities-insurance combinations, the organizing structure will be the bank holding company. The House Banking and Commerce committees came close to a compromise in November, but decided, as the session ended, to continue negotiations early this year. In an expanded bank holding company, the thinking goes, the Fed would need oversight of the securities and insurance operations to carry out its role of insuring the financial health of federally insured banks.
For his part, Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the S.E.C., contends that the agency would be the logical umbrella supervisor in financial conglomerates dominated by securities business.
That suggests that in a situation in which insurance is the main business, an insurance regulator would have the paramount role. But just how that might work is unclear because insurance is regulated state by state and it is difficult to envision Federal regulators becoming subordinate to state authority.
The securities and the insurance industries fiercely oppose umbrella regulation. Securities firms want to avoid what they regard as the more intrusive style of regulation of the Fed. And the insurers are concerned that broader regulation will lead to increased -- and they say unfair -- competition from banks and securities firms. The insurers have already lost some ground to the banks since the Comptroller of the Currency ruled in 1990 that banks could create and sell annuities and the Supreme Court, in 1995, agreed.
Many financial experts argue that insurance regulation is the weakest link in the system. Generally, the state insurance regulators have tiny staffs and tiny budgets compared with the enormous companies they oversee. Moreover, there is a clubby relationship between many regulators and the industry. Regulators are often from the industry and often return to insurance jobs after a stint in government. Some career regulatory employees look forward to a few lucrative years with an insurance company after retiring from government work, with the proviso that they not immediately deal with regulatory matters.
Neil D. Levin, New York's top insurance regulator and a newcomer to the field, takes a critical view of the system. Mr. Levin, a former investment banker who was appointed Superintendent of Insurance last February after serving as Commissioner of Banking, says that unless the state-by-state system of insurance regulation becomes much more "effective, efficient and coordinated," the creation of a Federal insurance regulator "is going to start to look pretty compelling."
Charles W. Quackenbush, the elected Insurance Commissioner of California, said at a recent insurance industry conference in New York that particularly with the increased blending of banking and insurance, it is "inevitable that the Federal Government will expand its role in the regulation of insurance."
Some critics argue that umbrella supervision would do little more than add another layer of bureaucracy. "These are complex businesses and it is not clear that an umbrella regulator would have any idea of what he was looking at," said Gilbert Schwartz, a Washington banking lawyer who advises the American Council on Life Insurance.
Others, like Lawrence J. White, an economics professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University and a former member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, argue that a super-regulator with ultimate authority might stifle some of the independence of the present regulators and "end up having some degree of monopoly power."
For Mr. White, umbrella regulation means redundancy. "If you're worried about the bank lending too much to the insurance company, that's something the bank regulators have plenty of power to deal with," he said. "If you're worried about the insurance company lending too much and putting the insurance claimants at risk, the insurance guys have the powers to deal with that."
As the debate continues, financial experts say there are signs of compromise that could, indeed, lead to the creation of an overarching supervisor of financial conglomerates. But even the strongest proponents say it is likely to have modest powers.
"What is appropriate," Mr. Leach said from his House banking office in Washington, "is certain protection of shareholders, for public treasuries and the economy at large. You don't ever want to establish a hubristic super-regulator."

GRAPHIC: Charts: "MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS"
The consolidation of the nation's financial services industries is epitomized by the growth of the Travelers Group. The company now known as Travelers has its roots in a troubled consumer loan company called Commercial Credit, which the Wall Street veteran Sanford I. Weill bought in 1986. In 1988, Commercial Credit bought Primerica, which owned Smith Barney, and took the Primerica name. During 1992 and 1993, Primerica acquired Travelers, then an insurer, and, again, adopted the acquired company's name. In 1997, Travelers made its biggest acquisition yet, adding Salomon, one of Wall Street's biggest firms, and joined it with Smith Barney.
 
"HIGHLIGHTS"
1986 -- Commercial Credit is spun off from the Control Data Corp.
1987 -- American Can changes its name to Primerica and buys Smith Barney in its transformation from industrial to services businesses.
1988 -- Commercial Credit acquires Primerica and takes its name for the parent company.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Climb in Australia

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Friday, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Australian bonds rose in the first trading session of 1998, amid optimism that cooling Asian economies will take the heat off domestic growth, and keep any risk of accelerating inflation at bay.
"The bond market will do well" from Asia's financial turmoil, said Anthony Robson, chief fixed-interest trader at Westpac Bank in Sydney. 
 Asia, and the effect it is seen having on demand for Australian exports, "is going to be the dampening spot for our economy," he said.
The benchmark October 2007 Government bonds added $6.04 Australian ($4 United States) today for each $1,000 Australian ($650 United States) face value. The yield fell 7basis points, to 5.98 percent.
The gains in Australian bonds were underpinned by a report in the United States this week that suggested that the American economy was growing with little inflation.
Even as Australian growth picks up -- aided by a jump in retail spending during summer vacations and more people finding full-time employment -- price increases by Australian producers and retailers are seen as restrained.
Helping to bolster optimism that inflation will be subdued were comments this week by the investor George Soros, who said the world was on the brink of international deflation as a result of the economic turmoil in Asia.
"What started out as a minor imbalance has become a much bigger one that threatens to engulf not only international credit but international trade," said Mr. Soros, chairman of Soros Fund Management and the primary investment adviser to Quantum Fund, in an article in The Financial Times on Wednesday.
Investors viewed Mr. Soros's comments as bullish for bonds.

Ruble Is Streamlined, Trimmed Down by 3 Zeros

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 1

 BODY:
This is not the way Lena Usikova planned to usher in the new year. Clutching a fistful of dollars she had rescued from a hiding place in her three-room apartment, the bleary-eyed schoolteacher pawed the fresh snow as she waited for her grocery store to open for business.
"I don't know which rubles to use," she wailed, crossing her gray eyes in disgust. "The old ones are bad, but could the new ones possibly be any better? I'm using dollars. At least you can't go wrong with them." 
 Actually, you can. But given Russia's bitter history with new bills, shaky banks, and anything having to do with money, who can blame her? At midnight, mostly for reasons of convenience and national self-esteem, Russia lopped three zeros from all its rubles. A subway fare that cost 2,000 rubles on New Year's Eve now costs just 2. An American dollar, which on Wednesday bought 5,960 rubles, won't even buy six today.
This is the third time in less than a decade that the Russian Government has tried to revise its battered currency. Past results have been grim. This cosmetic change, announced last August, is essentially psychological. There is nothing radical, surprising or scary about it. Old rubles will be accepted along with the new ones for a year, and as a way to keep everyone calm, the pictures on the new bills have hardly changed at all.
But when it comes to cash, Russian history has a nasty way of repeating itself. And there has never been a ruble reform that didn't end up punishing the people who least deserve it. In 1991, the waning Soviet Government of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev decided to change all 50- and 100-ruble notes to reduce the money supply. People had three days to exchange their money. Panic whipped through the country, there was a rush on the banks, and those who held onto their old money saw it turn overnight into meaningless strips of colorful paper. A similar reform in 1993, when Mr. Yeltsin withdrew all Soviet-era rubles, was almost as painful.
Federal banking officials say nothing so drastic is possible this time. And they note that although a stampede was widely expected in 1995 when new 100-dollar bills -- the single most important monetary instrument in Russia -- were introduced by the United States, the shift was relatively painless.
But that does not mean this one will be. Long lines at banks and currency exchanges have again become common, and in the last two weeks, banking officials say, Russians converted twice as many rubles to dollars as they did in the previous two. Most consumers will hold onto those dollars until sometime next week, just in case their worst fears are once again confirmed. That means many people will have paid a commission to take their money out of the bank and a commission to exchange it, and beginning today there is a new 2 percent tax on money converted from dollars to rubles. The safe bet on the almighty dollar will cost most people about 7 percent of the money they are trying to hoard.
"We understand that to battle fears that have built up in Russian people who have lived through 75 years of very unpleasant currency reforms is hard," said Irina Yasina, the chief spokeswoman for the Russian Central Bank, which has mounted an exceptionally detailed and patient public relations campaign in an attempt to convince people that this time there is nothing to fear from change.
"We continually assure people that nothing bad will happen," she continued. "But we know that only our actions on Jan. 1, 2, 3 and beyond can prove that there are no hidden tricks or traps."
At the urging of economic advisers who said that currency reform would increase the confidence of investors while making most Russians feel better about their money, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced the change last summer at a time when the economy looked as if it was finally about to emerge from years of deep depression. With the annual inflation rate having fallen from more than 1,000 percent in 1992 to under 14 percent today, the new currency was to have been the signature symbol of better times.
But the second half of 1997 brought a new round of bad economic news for Russia: tax revenues became so anemic that the International Monetary Fund decided -- for a while -- to suspend loan payments. The crisis in Asian economic markets hurt Russia badly because many skittish investors reacted by pulling out of all emerging markets. Predictions of economic catastrophe -- absolutely common here from all sides of the political spectrum -- began to take on the ring of truth.
As with most economic issues in Russia today, public opinion polls suggest that young people are far more open to the changes than their parents. More than three-quarters of people under 40 interviewed in one recent poll suggested that the change would mean nothing to them. For those over 60, who trust the Government less than anyone else and have been hurt most by the harsh pace of reform, the percentages were nearly reversed.
"We've been tricked so many times, I just don't feel like I can trust it," said 73-year-old Tatyana Sergeyeva, a pensioner and first-grade teacher, who continues to teach despite having long passed the age when she can retire. Viktor Birikov, 46, an engineer, said that he couldn't care less about the new bills. "It'll just be three zeros less," he said. "It's the same bills with the same pictures and the same color, just three less zeros. "
There may be more to it than that. The good news is that 3.6 rubles seems to most shoppers like a better price for a loaf of bread than 3,600. People are likely to have more respect for the currency as a result. The bad news, already evident on the street -- where official prices must be posted in old and new rubles -- is that price rises are almost certainly going to be one result of the change.
"If I am charging 96,000 rubles for an item I may decide to charge 100 rubles in the new system," said the proprietor of a new computer store in downtown Moscow. "I don't think most people would notice the difference."
Asked if he really thought that people would fail to notice an immediate 4 percent price rise, he laughed.
"I think people are going to have enough on their minds just dividing the prices," he said."

HEADLINE: Some Lush Vineyards, but No Yield

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia

 BODY:
Back in 1993, it looked like a perfect opportunity: a marriage between Napa Valley vintners and an ancient wine-making industry that had recently been liberated from Communism and the former Soviet Union.
The group of eager investors included Eric Wente, a top executive of the Wente Brothers winery in Livermore, Calif., and George P. Shultz, the former Secretary of State. The group invested about $1.5 million in a privatized winery here called Sameba. Mr. Shultz, who was strictly a passive investor, even clinked glasses here in a celebratory toast with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister who is now President of Georgia. 
 The appeal was obvious. Thanks to a warm climate and rich soil, this former Soviet republic has been producing wines for nearly 5,000 years. The hillside villages and vineyards look as though they would fit better in the lush Tuscany region of Italy than in Central Asia. Sweet or dry, red or white, Georgian wines enjoy a special cachet in Russia and much of Central Europe. While not in a league with the fine vintages of France or California, they can be competitive internationally in a moderate price range, the investors believed.
But today the joint venture bears witness to the difficulties of transforming a former Communist hinterland into an American-style business opportunity. A string of American managers here have variously quit or been dismissed; the last one left after the Georgian partners threatened to literally throw him out of their offices. Discouraged and disillusioned, the American investors do not expect to see any return on their money.
"They don't answer our telephone calls or our faxes anymore," Mr. Wente said in a telephone interview. "It became increasingly obvious to us that their agenda was not to build a company but to preserve a life style."
The experience is hardly unusual. Six years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia and former Soviet republics like Georgia have rushed to embrace capitalism and Western investors. But as often as not, companies have balked at conventional Western business practices and slipped back toward the habits of cronyism and self-dealing that pervaded the old system.
Western investors know this, at least in principle. But the allure of a historic turnaround opportunity can be irresistible, and there have been few sweeter turnaround possibilities in the former Soviet Union than Georgia's wine industry. From Warsaw to Moscow and even among some Western aficionados, the wines here are beloved for their warmth, variety and character. Indeed, bottlers from places like Moldavia and parts of Russia routinely try to pass off their wines as "Georgian."
Vintners here have their own distinctive approach to fermenting: the grapes along with their skins and some of the stems are fermented together in giant clay casks and later separated out.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia's wine industry seemed to have nowhere to go but up. Government mismanagement had left most wineries with antiquated bottling and pressing plants. The industry's traditional markets in Russia and Central Europe had been devastated by economic depression. Georgia was itself bogged down in several civil wars. To people like Mr. Wente, new equipment and modern marketing could go a long way.
To be sure, some Westerners have thrived here. The Dutch wine bottler Royal Cooymans has teamed up with entrepreneurs in Telavi, a town northeast of Tbilisi, in a successful joint venture with local entrepreneurs called Georgia Wine and Spirits. The Dutch company has overhauled most of the wine-making process, imported all the supplies for bottling and increased marketing efforts. Sales have doubled from 1.5 million bottles in 1996, at a wholesale price of roughly $3 a bottle, to 3.2 million bottles in 1997.
But for the Americans who bought into Sameba, things have not gone so well. The company remains in full production, based in a vine-covered villa here in the Georgian capital. But the Americans say they ran into conflicts with their Georgian partners from the first moment, and those problems were only made worse by Georgia's struggles with civil war and economic turmoil. It did not help that a founder of the company killed himself after having seen his two sons killed -- one in a gangland vendetta.
The Georgians insist they still relish their partnership with the Americans, but that they simply can not get "competent" American managers.
"It was one thing to go into a joint venture and put money in, but something quite different to work here and come to these burdens here every day," said Zourab Tkemaladze, Sameba's general director, in an interview at company headquarters.
Under the original deal, the American investors formed an organization called Georgia Wines that acquired a 50 percent stake in the Sameba Company. Mr. Tkemaladze, 53, had been part of the company's original management and had helped turn it into a private corporation.
The Americans invested $1.5 million over the next several years, while the Georgians contributed their existing stocks of wine along with their equipment. The Americans, who received three out of five seats on the company's board for the first few years, were entitled to install American managers.
The Americans were able to exercise effective control, and conflicts began almost immediately. They complained that they could not make sense of the Georgians' accounting. Some objected strenuously to Georgian plans for hiring workers at nearly slave-labor wages of $10 a month. And the local managers found themselves worn down by a place where telephones did not work, corruption was still rampant and basic supplies were often impossible to secure.
Hughes Ryan, a wine maker from St. Helena, Calif., who was hired to manage the precise wine formulation, said he got into regular arguments over just what the company was putting in its bottles. Mr. Ryan suspected that much of the wine was from old stocks of substandard produce, and complained that the company's books made it impossible to figure out exactly what the company was selling. He was dismissed two years ago.
"They never really adopted the Napa Valley attitude, which is that bad wines hurt everybody," said Mr. Ryan, who is back in California now but is about to start a new wine company in Georgia.
Mr. Tkemaladze said he dismissed Mr. Ryan because he was "not very qualified." A barrel-chested man who wore a bright blue sport shirt during a recent interview, Mr. Tkemaladze said he remained grateful to the American investors for their support at a crucial time and was still "optimistic" about hiring another American manager.
"Our partners came despite civil war in Abkhazia and Ossetia, and despite a big crime problem in Georgia," he said. "How can I say anything but wonderful words about people that came in at that time and were willing to help us?"
Meanwhile, the American investors have lost control. Though they theoretically still own 50 percent of the Georgian joint venture, their agreement stipulated that the Georgians would get a majority of seats on the company's management board after the first few years. Even if the Americans had stayed in Georgia to vote, they would be outvoted every time.
Mr. Wente is chalking up the venture to experience. "The wines have great possibility, because you can grow some very good grapes there," Mr. Wente said. "But there are a lot of cultural differences. If I were going to go back there, I would want majority control."

Hand on Bible And Eyes On the Prize

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
NEW YORK had all its lame ducks in a row yesterday.
"The Full Monty" aside, it was hard to remember the last time anyone had seen so many able-bodied people gathered together with minds focused on possible new lines of work. It wasn't a situation that city officials talked much about yesterday, not in public anyway. Yet it may well have been the most intriguing aspect of a numbingly cold Inauguration Day. 
 Thanks to term limits, New Yorkers were graced -- a word used here ironically, in case you didn't catch it -- with a constellation of elected leaders whose attention was wandering even as they swore on Bibles to fill their present offices with unswerving devotion.
The City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, is looking to run for mayor in 2001, when the coast will be clear because Rudolph W. Giuliani must move out of Gracie Mansion. The City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who will take the oath for his final term next week, plans to run for governor this year. The Public Advocate, Mark Green, has his eye once more on the United States Senate. And Mr. Giuliani? He has not actually said he is seeking higher office, but you don't hear Sherman-like denials from him, either.
Not to be impertinent, but is anyone around here committed 100 percent to his job? Is this what New Yorkers thought they were buying when they endorsed a limit of two terms (with the meter starting in 1994) on major officeholders, including the entire City Council?
Now comes the test of whether the voters were wise or, as some suspect, they bought a popular but dubious nostrum for all that ails government.
"I don't think this is a good situation," said William B. Eimicke, who runs a program on politics and public policy at Columbia University. "It encourages grandstanding. It focuses them on their new ambitions. They're appealing now to a broader constituency than the one that elected them, and that makes them not fully responsive to the people who elected them."
Mr. Eimicke was referring to all the ambitious souls at City Hall, but inevitably the public's gaze was, is and will remain on the Mayor. If he runs for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's seat or seeks a spot on the Republican national ticket in 2000, it will be interesting to see how he broadens his appeal beyond New York without sacrificing the interests of this city, which, for all his feel-good "Capital of the World" proclamations, remains decidedly unloved in many parts of the country.
It was Mr. Giuliani's show yesterday, of course, although a few New Yorkers may remember the day more as the 100th anniversary of the consolidated city, and others, with eyes glued to their pocketbooks, as the day they started getting 11 subway and bus rides for the price of 10 -- possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn't taken credit for.
There certainly were few good things that he didn't take credit for in his inaugural address and no mistakes that he felt obliged to acknowledge. He will never be known as Mayor Culpa.
BUT inaugurations are usually like that, and Mr. Giuliani was entitled to a free shave on his big day, even from someone who would quarrel with his boast to fellow New Yorkers yesterday that "you and I have changed the direction of the city more than in any four-year period in history." (Crime was already going down and the economy bouncing back when he was elected in 1993. By contrast, Edward I. Koch, the last mayor to be inaugurated for a second time, had reinvigorated a city that was supine in finances and spirit when he took office in 1978.)
You might think that Mr. Giuliani, as an avowed enemy of old-school politics, would use his lame-duck status to advantage. This is the moment, for example, to fill his cabinet with Manhattan Institute types, people who would privatize hospitals, reorder municipal finances, turn over social services to nonprofit institutions and try breaking the grip of strangulating union rules. For all the improvements in city life that the Mayor can claim, reinventing local government is not one of them.
"Reform has to take place within the limits of the Mayor's personality and governing style," said Fred Siegel, an urban-affairs specialist and history professor at Cooper Union.
In other words, if he really wants to shrink government, one thing Mr. Giuliani must do is yield a measure of power to others. Some find it hard to see how that will happen on the watch of a l'etat-c'est-moi incumbent.

HEADLINE: Energy for a Power Source;
Coal May Become A Better Choice

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: GILLETTE, Wyo.

 BODY:
Amid the rolling hills of northeastern Wyoming, a towering five-story plant is using heat and pressure to turn the low-grade coal that abounds here in the 9,700-square-mile Powder River Basin into high-quality fuel -- and, in the process, make that coal less a hazard to the environment.
The $60 million experiment by KFx Inc., a small company that has received help and money from some giants of the energy industry, is in the forefront of a broad effort to extend the life span of one of the world's first, most widely used fuels. 
 In the debates over pollution and global warming, coal has been labeled a prime villain. Coal has long been under assault as a leading contributor to smog and acid rain. And it could be dealt a severe blow if the proposals to cut carbon dioxide emissions made at the recent talks on global warming in Kyoto, Japan, are eventually adopted.
Even in the face of all that, though, some in the coal industry remain decidedly bullish. Coal, they argue, is too deeply entrenched to allow any quick, drastic changes. After all, coal-fired plants produce fully 57 percent of this nation's electricity.
And on the pollution front, coal is rapidly cleaning up its act. Many plants have been upgraded with expensive pollution controls, and new processes -- like those KFx is using -- promise to cut pollution further. And part of the process has the potential to cut carbon dioxide as well.
In other words, the world may be stuck with coal at least for a while, but that may not be the disaster it might appear.
Many utilities regard coal plants as their crown jewels. As the cheapest, most reliable source of electricity, these plants, which now often run far below capacity, are expected to play a sizable role in bringing rates down as the industry deregulates.
Coal-fired plants could, in theory, be converted to use some other fuel, but that would be prohibitively expensive. The Edison Electric Institute, which represents most of the nation's investor-owned utilities, has estimated that it would cost close to $30 billion to convert coal plants to use natural gas, which produces less pollution and carbon dioxide.
Cleaner fuels, like natural gas, will surely make inroads, but even if utilities are forced to stop using coal, it is doubtful that enough natural gas could be brought into production to displace coal in the near future.
In addition, any big shift would cost tens of thousands of jobs, a possibility that seems remote any time soon, considering the political influence of the highly unionized coal industry. Britain learned this lesson recently, putting a halt to issuing new permits for natural-gas-fired plants, whose construction was surging, while it determines the impact on its battered coal industry.
In developing countries, coal's future seems even more solid. Coal is expected to merely hold its own in the United States, with the Energy Department predicting 1 percent annual growth through 2015. But China and India, knowing that their own coal is cheap and plentiful enough to last for centuries, plan to build hundreds of coal-fired plants.
In the developing world, the Energy Department predicts, coal use will rise about 3.3 percent a year though 2015, nearly doubling the 2.2 billion tons those nations burned in 1995.
"Coal is going to be used especially by countries that have lots of it," said Robert H. Gentile, an Assistant Energy Secretary in the Bush Administration and now an executive with KFx.
Nations like China, India and Pakistan argued in Kyoto that they should not have their coal use limited because it represents the cheapest way to supply their rapidly growing demand for energy.
They want nations like the United States, which has just 4 percent of the world's population but produces about a fifth of its carbon dioxide, to take the first steps to cut emissions.
Under the Kyoto agreement, industrialized nations would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions 5.2 percent below 1990 levels. The United States would be required to cut them 7 percent from 2008 through 2012.
To be sure, the coal and utility industries do not have their heads in the sand. They fully understand that concern over global warming is bound to intensify.
That is why KFx and similar ventures are trying to go beyond cutting pollution to try to address concerns on global warming.
After some setbacks, KFx restarted its plant several weeks ago, taking coal from the local mines here and heating it to about 725 degrees under intense pressure to remove almost all the water. This process upgrades the coal, enabling utilities to burn about half as much to get the same amount of electricity -- and cut pollution and carbon dioxide emissions in the process.
The plant, built at a cost of $40 million, is expected to process 500,000 tons a year of this coal, which the company calls K-fuel.
The effort is the brainchild of a group of entrepreneurs led by Ted Venners and his brother John. After making a small fortune in Powder River Basin coal in the 1970's, they decided to risk everything and invest $20 million in the 1980's in this process, developed by an inventor named Edward Koppelman.
Mr. Koppelman, who also developed the mechanism that de-ices airplanes, found after years of trial and error that by careful control of time, heat and pressure, the efficiency of coal could be increased.
The Venners stand to profit handsomely if their gamble pays off -- if, that is, they can convince utilities in the East and Midwest that they can cut pollution and carbon dioxide and increase plant efficiency by paying top dollar for KFx's upgraded coal.
KFx's coal matches the quality of the higher-grade coal mined in the East. But the higher-sulfur Eastern coal, which has a considerably greater energy output in terms of B.T.U.'s, sells for $18 to $25 a ton, while Powder River Basin coal sells for as little as $3. After KFx processes it, it hopes to sell its fuel for as much as the Eastern coal.
The KFx process, though, reduces nitrogen oxides by about half and sulfur by up to 20 percent, making it attractive to utilities, which are under pressure to cut these emissions. Powder River Basin coal is already a low-sulfur coal, but the KFx process reduces the sulfur even more, making it far cleaner than Eastern coal.
It can also have an impact, though a more limited one, on global warming. The process has the potential to cut carbon dioxide emissions by about 6 percent, even allowing for the coal used to create the upgraded fuel, since less coal is needed to produce the same amount of energy.
The initial investors in KFx persuaded the Thermo Ecotek Corporation, a unit of Thermo Electron, a Waltham, Mass., company that specializes in bringing new technology to market, to invest $60 million.
Also, the Kennecott Energy and Coal Company, a unit of the RTZ-CRA Group of Britain that has become a leading producer of coal, spending about $1 billion since 1990 to buy up reserves in the United States, has provided technical aid.
Kennecott will also help finance the building of plants using the KFx process if it proves viable.
Customers are starting to appear. American Electric Power, a big coal-burning utility that serves 2.9 million customers in seven states in the East and Midwest, has committed itself to buy 167,000 tons a year from KFx.
For American Electric, that is a drop in the coal bucket. As the nation's largest purchaser of coal, it buys about 58 million tons annually. Of that, about 10 million tons is lower-grade coal from the Powder River Basin and other mines in the West, and it wants to see if it would be economical to use the KFx fuel and to what extent it would cut pollution and carbon dioxide.
Even if controls are put on carbon dioxide, said Charles A. Ebotino Jr., the utility's senior vice president for fuel supply, "coal is going to be a large piece of the action."
At the KFx plant, things did not start off smoothly. A fire a year ago forced it to shut for repairs. An error by an engineer led to months of further delay and added cost.
The Venners, however, remain undaunted, convinced that the utility and coal industries will have to try out new technology.
"It's going to be a mixed bag of solutions," said Ted Venners, KFx's chairman. KFx's method for cleaning up coal before it is burned is only one of four basic approaches.
One process now becoming widespread is to suspend crushed coal on a jet of air and mix it with limestone; this cuts emissions of sulfur dioxide, which contributes to acid rain. This method also means the fuel burns more efficiently, reducing overall emissions.
The most common approach, though, is to treat the emissions after the coal is burned with expensive scrubbers to cut down on sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions.
There have also been efforts at coal gasification, in which coal is turned into a gas similar to natural gas. This gas is then used to run power plants. So far, however, the output of electricity is very small. Such approaches should increasingly come into play as utilities do all they can to keep their coal-fired capacity.
Just a few miles from the KFx plant is the Wyodak power plant, a prime example of why utilities are reluctant to phase out coal.
About 90 tons of coal, extracted from a strip mine next to the plant, are burned hourly to produce some of the nation's cheapest electricity.
The coal, often selling for less than $3 a ton and easily mined by huge power shovels, is expected to remain the backbone of many of the nation's power plants for decades to come.
The Wyodak plant is one of many owned by Pacificorp, a huge utility in Portland, Ore., that transmits power throughout the Northwest.
Pacificorp has $4.6 billion invested in its coal-fired plants. They produce power at an average of about 1.5 cents a kilowatt hour, one of the lowest levels in the nation.
"We work very hard to keep our costs low," said William Edmonds, a regional affairs administrator for the utility. "We operate our coal-fired plants at high capacity."
With deregulation opening major markets like California to competition, Pacificorp has geared up to be a big supplier of low-cost power. And coal is a vital part of its strategy.
It is such powerful forces that give Ted Venners the will to persevere in an industry that some perceive as on the way to extinction.
Driving his big Chevrolet truck along the highway on the way to the plant, he pointed to the rolling hills and said: "There's enough coal there for 200 to 300 years. It's so cheap to take it out of the ground."

HEADLINE: For Clinton Health Care Planner, a New Drubbing

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 1

 BODY:
For more than two years, Ira C. Magaziner had managed to keep his head down.
Once a favorite target of Republicans, a symbol of White House overreaching and arrogance for his role in drafting an ultimately failed national health care plan, Mr. Magaziner, as gaunt, rumpled and intense as ever, had been laboring in studied obscurity, devising the Clinton Administration's approach to regulating the Internet. 
 The health care plan he once proposed would have remade one-seventh of the nation's economy. But in his second, quieter life in the White House, he championed industry self-regulation, urging President Clinton to let the Internet alone.
Then, two weeks ago, Mr. Magaziner's telephone rang at his home in Washington and plunged him back into the health care morass. How, a reporter wanted to know, did he respond to a Federal judge's ruling that less than two months into the Administration's first term, he submitted a dishonest affidavit about the health care planning?
Mr. Magaziner had thought that a United States attorney's inquiry into that matter had exonerated him more than two years ago.
"He was right on the verge of emerging as someone who was a serious player on a serious issue," one sympathetic White House official said of Mr. Magaziner's work on Internet policy, "and this thing was a blind-side tackle."
But his many critics outside the Administration were less surprised to see his health care work catch up with him. John E. Berthoud, president of the National Taxpayers Union, noted that the health care debate helped produce the Republican landslide in 1994 and changed Mr. Clinton's approach to governing and campaigning. So "it's not surprising," Mr. Berthoud said, "that there should be prolonged and profound effects on Ira Magaziner" as well.
Mr. Clinton is standing by Mr. Magaziner, who attended Oxford with him as a Rhodes scholar and participated with him over New Year's at Renaissance Weekend, in Hilton Head, S.C., the earnest annual gathering of policy makers, scholars and their groupies. (Mr. Magaziner helped lead a panel discussion there on "the 'wired' society.")
In a statement issued through an aide on Wednesday, the President said: "I've known Ira for 30 years. He's a good man. And he's doing a good job."
Mr. Magaziner, 50 years old, quiet and austere, stands out among the backslapping politicians at the White House. He rarely attends meetings of the senior staff these days, and when he does he almost never speaks. But within the White House he is seen as having done well with the Internet project, despite the shadow of the health care debacle.
"He continues to labor very quietly and very nonobtrusively," one official said, "so much so that there are times that he seems like Banquo's ghost, drifting back and forth."
Mr. Magaziner, senior adviser to the President for policy development, says that he offered to resign after the health care plan failed in 1994 but that Mr. Clinton asked him to stay. He went to work identifying ways to increase American exports, even as the lawsuit that would lead to the damaging judicial ruling two weeks ago began taking more of his time. Within the White House, he is seen as having been protected in particular by Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom he served as right-hand man in the health care effort.
He says he has been pleased with the reception given his work since health care.
"The health care thing, I obviously took a battering," he said. But with the Internet project, he continued, "I've been able to build a lot of positive relationships -- positive, even, news accounts and so on."
"And till this thing came on," he said of the judge's ruling, "I was feeling pretty good about the things I was able to do."
The case that produced that ruling is evocative of the heady early days of the Administration, when Mr. Clinton dreamed of creating more sweeping Government programs than he has sought since. Along with the First Lady, Mr. Magaziner was at the center, feverishly assembling a team of hundreds to expand Federal regulation of health care.
The project was an extraordinary opportunity for a self-assured policy disciple like Mr. Magaziner, who as a college student had persuaded Brown University to change its curriculum radically and as a business consultant had tried to convert Rhode Island, his home state, into a laboratory for his theories on industrial policy.
Mr. Magaziner and Mrs. Clinton tried to conduct their team's deliberations in secret, maintaining that confidentiality was the only way to keep the plan from being picked apart by interest groups before it was even completed. But that effort contributed to an appearance of high-handedness. One group sued the Government, arguing that because not all participants were Government employees, Federal law required that meetings of the health care planners be open to the public.
It was in response to that suit that Mr. Magaziner, on March 3, 1993, submitted his 13-page affidavit, a dense description of the Administration's planning stuffed with references to bodies like "the infrastructure/integrated health plans cluster." The affidavit described the role of outside consultants in that planning but, in what proved a fateful sentence, said, "Only Federal Government employees serve as members of the interdepartmental working group."
In December 1994, after discovery proceedings had produced numerous White House documents detailing the health care planning process, the judge, Royce C. Lamberth, called Mr. Magaziner's statement "misleading, at best." Judge Lamberth asked Federal prosecutors to investigate whether Mr. Magaziner had committed perjury or criminal contempt of court.
The resulting six-month inquiry was led by Eric H. Holder Jr., then a United States attorney and now Deputy Attorney General. In an 18-page filing with the court in August 1995, Mr. Holder wrote that he had found "no significant evidence" that Mr. Magaziner's declaration "was factually false, much less that it was willfully and intentionally so." He also said the contested sentence about the membership of the working group was not significant either to the Government's defense or to a related ruling that Judge Lamberth had issued earlier.
Mr. Holder criticized sloppy White House paperwork that, he said, had failed to document that people from the private sector had become Government employees to contribute to the health care project. And he was scathingly critical of White House lawyers, saying their failures had included not explaining how the health care planning system had changed after Mr. Magaziner's statement.
In a recent interview, Mr. Magaziner defended himself by noting pointedly that he was not a lawyer and saying he had relied on White House and Justice Department lawyers in creating the health care task force and in drafting his affidavit. That defense may pose problems for the lawyers who assisted him, notably Beth Nolan, a former deputy White House counsel who is awaiting Senate confirmation to head the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
Mr. Magaziner and other White House officials say they assumed that his legal troubles were over with Mr. Holder's filing. But on Dec. 18, Judge Lamberth weighed in for what he called "hopefully the final time," to determine penalties and attorneys' fees sought by the plaintiffs.
Where Mr. Holder had seen fuzzy language and sloppy paperwork, Judge Lamberth saw a deliberate effort by high-level Administration officials to deceive the court.
The judge called Mr. Magaziner's testimony "dishonest," but he was far more upset by what came later.
"The most outrageous conduct by the Government in this case is what happened when it never corrected or updated the Magaziner declaration," he wrote, declaring that the Government should be "accountable when its officials run amok."
Mr. Holder and Judge Lamberth had previously disagreed about the substance of Mr. Holder's filing. In a letter to the judge on Aug. 30, 1995, which was was supplied to a reporter by the White House, Mr. Holder wrote that on reviewing some of the court's comments about the investigation's results, he "became concerned" that he had not been clear enough. He repeated his findings, among them that there was no significant evidence that Mr. Magaziner had lied.
Although Judge Lamberth's broadside of Dec. 18 was directed at several officials, critics of the Administration have so far focused on Mr. Magaziner, arguing that he, and not taxpayers, should pay the penalty of $285,864.78 that the judge imposed on the Government. (The Justice Department is considering an appeal.)
Mr. Magaziner seems to regard the case as Lamberth v. Magaziner.
"I've been controversial in my life for my political views, that's fine, that's, you know, democracy," Mr. Magaziner said, speaking in staccato bursts. "But nobody, even opponents in the things I did before, ever questioned my integrity."
"And to have this judge come back and do this with no evidence," he said, makes him "livid."
Apparently embarrassed by the heat of his remarks, he added: "That's why I'm probably being too passionate. So I apologize. But this is just wrong."

HEADLINE: Detroit Braces for the Rerun Of a Divisive Murder Trial

BYLINE: By JACK LESSENBERRY 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 1

 BODY:
Nearly five years ago, residents of Detroit were deeply divided by a highly publicized, racially charged trial in which two white police officers were accused of beating a black drug user to death.
The authorities here worried about the outcome and braced themselves for the possibility of riots like those that swept Los Angeles in April and early May 1992 after four white policemen were acquitted on all but one count in the beating of Rodney G. King, a black motorist, in March 1991; the beating was videotaped and shown on television newscasts. More than 50 people were killed and 2,000 injured in the weeklong riots. 
 But in August 1993, after months of testimony, the Detroit police officers, Walter Budzyn, 51, and Larry Nevers, 57, were found guilty of second-degree murder in the slaying of Malice Green, a 35-year-old unemployed steel worker, on Nov. 5, 1992. The officers were sentenced to long prison terms, and Detroit's streets remained calm.
Now the authorities here may face it all again. New trials have been ordered for both men. On Tuesday, Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff of Federal District Court in Detroit overturned the verdict in the Nevers case, saying prejudicial pretrial publicity and errors during the proceedings, like allowing jurors to see the film "Malcolm X," which opens with video footage of the beating of Mr. King, prevented Mr. Nevers from getting a fair trial.
Five months ago, the Michigan Supreme Court similarly overturned the verdict against Mr. Budzyn, also citing the "Malcolm X" movie, along with the fact that information had been leaked to the jury stating that officials in Detroit, where a race riot in July 1967 left 43 people dead, were preparing for new disturbances if the former policeman was acquitted.
The court upheld the conviction of Mr. Nevers, however, on the ground that the evidence against him, unlike that against Mr. Budzyn, was overwhelming; Mr. Nevers had admitted striking Mr. Green, who died after being hit on the head with a heavy metal flashlight.
"I look forward to complete vindication," Mr. Nevers told reporters when he arrived at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on New Year's Eve for a reunion with his wife, Nancy, and daughter, Kelly. "I certainly look forward to a new trial if that's what it is going to be."
Asked if he might plead to a lesser crime, Mr. Nevers replied: "I'll never take a plea bargain, never. I might plead guilty to assault and battery, but that's it."
Today the Wayne County prosecutor, John O'Hair, said "absolutely not" when asked whether an assault-and-battery plea would satisfy him.
"The position of the prosecutor's office hasn't changed a bit," Mr. O'Hair said. "In this vast world of litigation, there are some cases that just have to be tried, and these fall into that category."
The prosecutor said he would meet with his staff to discuss appealing Judge Zatkoff's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati. If that fails, he said, he will press for a new trial for Mr. Nevers.
Mr. O'Hair also said he would vigorously contest the claim that the former policemen "couldn't get a fair trial in Wayne County."
Mr. Budzyn's new trial is to begin on Feb. 10. Although both men were tried together before separate juries in 1993, that is not likely this time, Mr. O'Hair said.
Judge Zatkoff said the 1993 trial should have been moved from Detroit because of the highly charged and prejudicial atmosphere. Indeed, Coleman A. Young, then Mayor of Detroit, said on television that Mr. Green "was literally murdered by the police." Mr. Young, Detroit's first black Mayor, granted a $5.25 million settlement for Mr. Green's family and dismissed the two policemen before any legal proceeding began.
Defending those actions, he said: "I was in no hurry to win back the riot championship of the world from Los Angeles. My charge was to convince the people of Detroit that I was on their side."
Despite the four and a half years that has elapsed since the first trial, the case still has a polarizing effect on Detroit, where nearly 80 percent of the city's one million residents are black and 90 percent of those who live in the city's suburbs are white.
A mostly suburban group, the Budzyn and Nevers Support Team, raised money for the former officers' appeals and tried unsuccessfully to defeat Mr. O'Hair for re-election in 1996 for prosecuting the case against the two men.
But in front of the boarded-up hair salon near where Mr. Green died, on Warren Avenue a few blocks from downtown Detroit, flowers are often placed before a chalk mural of the dead man.
On Wednesday, when news spread that Mr. Nevers was being released, dozens of people, some carrying signs, gathered at the site despite freezing weather and icy winds. "A Man Is Dead," one sign said. "Where Is the Justice?" asked another.

South Korea Over a Hurdle To Stabilize Weak Economy
South Korea has cleared a crucial hurdle in its effort to stabilize its battered economy, paying off or extending a large portion of debt it owes foreign banks. 
 Still , the situation continues to look grim. The Government has asked citizens to donate any gold that they possess, like jewelry, to help the nation resolve the debt crisis. And in a New Year's address, President-elect Kim Dae Jung warned his people of "many unimaginable hardships" this year. Page A1.
 
New Russian Rubles Create Havoc
For the third time in less than a decade, the Russians have tried to revise their battered currency. Russia lopped three zeroes from all its rubles, creating a little confusion and new prices. A subway fare that cost 2,000 rubles on New Year's Eve now costs just 2. An American dollar, which on Wednesday bought 5,960 rubles, will not even buy 6 today. A4.
 
A Wine Venture Yields Little
A group of Napa Valley vintners invested $1.5 million in a Georgian Republic winery five years ago. Now they are discouraged and disillusioned, and do not expect to see any return on their capital. After the collapse of the Soviet Union it seemed that Georgia's wine industry had nowhere to go but up because Georgian wines enjoy a special cachet in Russia and much of Central Europe. But the Americans ran into conflicts with their partners. D2.
 
A Lackluster Fourth Quarter
The fourth quarter of 1997 will long be remembered for the decline in Southeast Asian markets and currencies. The yen fell 14.7 percent, but that still made it one of the best performers. Thailand kicked off the action, and ended the quarter with a 44.4 percent drop in the baht; Malaysia's ringgit declined 33.8 percent, and South Korea's won fell 42 percent. Stock markets in Europe and North America did not react to the turmoil in Asia until it reached Hong Kong in late October. Exchanges plummeted Oct. 27, rebounding the next day. Market Place. D3.
 
Product Samples Come Home
Marketers of packaged goods have always delivered samples directly to mailboxes of potential customers. But now they are selecting whose mailbox gets that product by identifying households by age or size or buying habits or wealth. Advertising. D4.
 
Exchange Fights Heart Attacks
The stress on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange as well as the poor diet, lack of exercise and frenetic jobs have caused many heart attacks. A defibrillator to revive victims is now on the exchange floor. D2.
 
Mortgage Rates Rise This Week
The rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose this week to an average 7.03 percent from 6.99 percent. The rate on 15-year mortgages rose to an average 6.61 percent. D3.
 
U.S. Markets Reopen
Financial markets in the United States will reopen today after being closed yesterday for New Year's Day. The New York Stock Exchange will observe a regular schedule, but the Treasury market and other United States markets will hold shortened sessions. Most overseas markets were closed yesterday and will remain closed today.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION OF RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI: THE AGENDA;
A Replay Of Themes That Won An Election

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Standing coatless at a turning point in his mayoralty yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani chose to take a customary path into his second term, reiterating the very issues that have proven so useful in propelling him to national prominence over the last four years.
Those who were elated with his first-term success at reducing crime, cutting taxes and moving people off welfare are likely to feel just as strongly about his second term, judging from the themes he chose to emphasize in his inaugural address. Those who were looking for firm indications that he would build on his popularity and move beyond the issues so closely identified with him may well be disappointed: the speech contained few details that would indicate a broadening of the mayoral agenda. 
 The Mayor said nothing new on issues that have long bedeviled him, such as education, housing and unemployment. He said the city's welfare centers would soon be known as "job centers," but did not explain how that would help the city to move welfare recipients into real work at a time when the Federal Government is requiring the city to slash its assistance rolls even further. There was no talk of government innovation or worker productivity.
With the city and the nation watching, he made a clear political decision to play to his strengths, providing plenty of words and one remarkable action about fighting crime. In the only major new initiative in the speech, he announced plans to hire an additional 1,600 police officers, bringing the size of the force to an unprecedented 40,000 at the very moment when crime is at its lowest point in decades. He acknowledged that action might seem counterintuitive to some people, but made it clear that law enforcement would remain his top priority.
"First and foremost as our city enters the 21st century, we have to build on what has worked for us, and what has turned us around," he said. "We have to continue to make this city safe and improve its quality of life."
New directions and fresh programs may yet emerge in subsequent speeches later this month; the Mayor has lately been carrying around what he says is a list of 62 undisclosed initiatives. By using his most carefully scrutinized address to focus on the familiar, he sent an unmistakable message to the city and to voters outside the five boroughs who may one day find him on their ballots: these are the themes that brought him to power, they worked and he has no intention of abandoning them now.
"Stay the course, don't change your style," said Peter J. Powers, the former First Deputy Mayor, explaining his old friend's thinking. "There are people who criticize his style, people who applaud it, but at the end of the day, it has produced results, and he has got to be what he is."
In the final weeks of his re-election campaign last year, Mr. Giuliani had begun talking about a broader vision, fully acknowledging what many black and Hispanic leaders had been telling him for years: his successes were not reaching the entire city and had in fact bypassed many communities. In his victory speech on election night, he said his second term would be dedicated to making sure that improvements reach everyone, including those so far left behind. He seemed to be saying that he wanted a legacy more expansive than just reducing crime.
He touched briefly on that goal yesterday, but did not emphasize it or provide details. Instead, he concentrated on the idea of changing the city not just for a few years, but in the long run.
Cristyne F. Lategano, the Mayor's communications director, said he believes that the cumulative effect of his policies is to "liberate" New Yorkers from government dependency and other ills. "He's made so much progress, and now he's showing the courage to go in for the really big win," she said. "It's not just the battle, but for the whole war, really making things permanent."
In a city that routinely takes the wrecking ball to the stone monuments of its past, it is hard to imagine that any political agenda will truly remain a permanent fixture of New York. But as Mr. Giuliani demonstrated yesterday, the agenda is very likely to remain the permanent foundation of his career.

HEADLINE: Comfort vs. Style in Town Clash on Porches

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: WILSON, N.C., Dec. 30

 BODY:
All Deborah Thompson really has is time, and a place to spend it.
She lives in a tiny house in a part of town where the paint peels and the corner store still sells coal by the sack, and the funeral home is the nicest structure around. She does not have a social calendar, cable television, or a car. 
 What she has is a front porch that catches the weak winter sunlight just right, and an old chrome and vinyl couch where she can relax and watch life spin by, or at least as much of life as she can see from the corner of Carroll and Vance Streets.
"I watch the cars go by, and I say 'Hey,' " Ms. Thompson said, taking a rest from raking the dormant grass in her front yard. "I sit there to keep from sitting in the house. It gets lonely in the house."
She finds it hard to believe that, soon, that could be against the law here in Wilson, an image-conscious tobacco and factory town of 40,000 people located less than an hour east of Raleigh. It is not the porch that may be declared illegal, only her choice of furniture.
In what many people here see as a clash of the classes and an assault on the amiable rhythms of Southern life, the City of Wilson is expected sometime early this year to ban old sofas and other indoor furniture from porches and yards. Southern historians see that proposed ban as an attack on a tradition that predates Naugahyde.
For generations, some Southerners, unwilling to throw away a perfectly usable piece of furniture just because of a few rips or stains, have made room for new couches and chairs by dragging the old ones outside. Like some old dog that can no longer hunt, the yellow plaid loveseats and sagging Barcaloungers live out a few, last years on the porch.
Often, the people who carry on this tradition cannot afford wicker or other fancy outdoor "patio" furniture, furniture favored by the gentility.
"This must be the ultimate yuppiefication of the South, to ban porch furniture," said Dan Carter, professor of Southern history at Emory University in Atlanta.
While such a move may make a neighborhood more cosmetically presentable, removing such traditions can perhaps, Professor Carter believes, help destroy one, by hampering the way people in a community interact.
As in most such confrontations between the classes, the poor people are expected to lose.
"This is not junk," the 33-year-old Ms. Thompson said, pointing to her sofa. But the idea that the sight of it would offend anyone does not seem to anger her nearly so much as it puzzles her.
It is the same on Viola Street, where Elizabeth Best sat reading a book in her overstuffed chair, and on Oak Street, where Carlos Andrades stood near some old furniture watching his nephews play in the yard, and on Woodard Avenue, where William Riggins shared his porch with a crippled recliner. People here say they will comply with the ordinance if it passes -- no one wants to have to pay a fine over a 20-year-old La-Z-Boy -- but they see it as one more instance of the rich and powerful telling the powerless how to live their lives.
"They don't want to drive by it," Moses Scriven said as he tried to get a reluctant chain saw to crank over on Vance Street. "We don't have the power that the people with money have. It's aggravating, but there's nothing to be done about it."
"They've been trying to make Wilson a model community," Mr. Scriven said, even if that means "stopping us from enjoying what little bit we have. They can afford to buy something for their porches."
City officials in Wilson, including the town's Planning Director, Jim Bradshaw, have emphasized that the porch ordinance is just part of a series of new housing measures intended to improve the overall quality of life in the town, and they deny that it is a battle between the classes.
"This is not one side telling the other what to do," Mr. Bradshaw said. "At least I don't see it that way."
The proposed ban on indoor furniture outdoors is "just another tool to bring about improvements to the neighborhood," he said, "whether it's an abandoned vehicle or indoor furniture all over the yard. They all contribute to the blight of the neighborhood."
Blacks and whites alike support the ordinance, he said, including some people who live in the neighborhoods -- mostly black people and Hispanic migrant workers -- most affected by the proposed ban.
But poorer residents here, the ones with the indoor furniture on their porches, say that the ordinance would not affect upper middle class people, that wealthier blacks support the move but that poorer ones just want to be left alone.
It all began last spring, when the Wilson Appearance Commission, an interracial panel, recommended that the indoor furniture, prone to get water-logged and moldy when rain blows in under the eaves, amounted to a public nuisance.
It was also suggested that the furniture represented a health hazard, giving rats and fleas a place to breed.
"There could be some family health problems from the weatherization of the couch," said Mr. Bradshaw, who is admittedly sensitive to the attention his town's proposed ban on the furniture has drawn.
Others here echo his explanation of why the indoor furniture must go, and these are the people who make up the committees that will consider the proposal before it becomes law.
"People who say I want to keep my couch are looking at it from a very narrow perspective," said Sarah Rasino, a member of the Wilson Appearance Committee and a cosmetologist at Redken Laboratory. "Those become weather-beaten, and I don't think there's anything pretty about that."
But to other people here, the ban flies in the face of common sense. In others, it pricks their pride.
"Why are they messing with poor black folks around here?" Mr. Andrades asked. "Why don't they deal with the real issues?"
That is what Mr. Carter, the Emory professor, is wondering.
"There's nothing more inviting than an old front seat from a 1957 Chevrolet sitting on a front porch," he said, and while he laughed as he said it, he was not kidding about the symbolism that such things hold down here.
"I think people have totally gone berserk," he said. "Think about all the things we need to be concerned about: 50 million people with no health insurance and 30 percent of minority children in this country living in poverty, and what are we concerned about? We're concerned about banning porch furniture."
Wilson is conscious of its image, but in that it is little different from most towns.
Travelers coming into town from the east, from the flat, muddy tobacco fields dotted with tumble-down drying sheds, are greeted by a sign welcoming them to "Wilson, a community committed to educational excellence, economic growth and cultural fulfillment." A sign just down the road announces the Carl B. Renfro Bridge, even though all it crosses is railroad tracks. Most small towns do not name their overpasses.
On Raleigh Road, the main drag coming into town, the road is lined here and there with beautiful, towering homes, with red brick and massive white columns.
But just a few blocks away, Mexican migrant workers live in houses that are little better than shacks, and elderly black women heat houses with coal-burning stoves.
It is in neighborhoods like these where the people use indoor furniture in their outdoor lives.
"My grandma has me drag her big chair out every weekend," so she can visit with passers-by, said Mr. Scriven, who drives a fork-lift in a tobacco warehouse. On Sunday night, he drags the chair back in again. His grandma does not visit much during the week.
It is much easier to disappear inside, to music or videos, if there is not a soft place to sit outside, people here said. It is more important to the poor, because, as entertainment goes, it is about as cheap as it gets. Talking does not cost anything.
City officials in Wilson have made it clear that they are not banning porches, only indoor furniture on them. But for people here, and elsewhere in the South, the furniture is part of that culture.
"I hate to make it sound like banning porch sofas is going to be an act of community destruction," Professor Carter said, "but I think it's totally consistent with it. That is, that people who would propose such a thing have no sense that this is something worth keeping or valuable at all. I'm making this sound like social science. It's not. It's just friends and neighbors."
What it all boils down to, in Wilson, is that there are two distinct Souths, two distinct ideas of what is tradition, what is not.
To Ms. Rasino, there is "nothing Southern" about a ratty sofa, water-logged and leaking cotton ticking.
To Ms. Thompson, "it's how I get to know people in my neighborhood."
John Shelton Reed, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, says it is the sitting, not what one is sitting on, that makes it a Southern thing.
"I've got a sister in northern Vermont, and if the weather allowed it, I'm sure her neighbors would" sit on their porches, visiting, Professor Reed said. "But there's not much point in it, in Vermont."
But Mr. Carter sees the indoor furniture as a part of the South's past that, however tasteless it might seem to some, is still superior to the rigid gentrification that seems to be its future. Houses in new, planned communities are being built with porches, to promote that sense of community, but custom, zoning and the simple fact that those new houses will be occupied by more affluent people will probably mean that only wicker and other tasteful outdoor furniture will be used.
Meanwhile, Southern towns and cities continue to be eaten up with garish neon strip developments.
"I find nothing more depressing than to ride down one of the strip streets with thousands of neon signs," Mr. Carter said. "I think that is ugliness on a mass scale. I have much less objection to individual, idiosyncratic 'tastelessness.' "
Ms. Thompson knows her vinyl couch is not beautiful, but nor, as she said, is it junk. It is only a place to sit on the warm days and wave at cars.

HEADLINE: Hurdles Ahead for South Korea

 BODY:
Two events this week may help South Korea climb out of its financial hole. Large private banks in the United States, Europe and Japan agreed to let Korean banks and business firms postpone repayment of their overseas loans. These banks might even agree to extend new loans. If the agreement holds, it will ease South Korea's repayment burden, thereby eliminating an immediate threat of default.
Separately, the South Korean Parliament agreed to stiffen oversight of its banking sector in line with conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a $57 billion bailout. The vote reassures foreign investors that internal politics will not scuttle the fund-led bailout. 
 These events do not guarantee South Korea that it can avoid default or escape serious recession. But finally, some of the news from South Korea is good.
The decision by the large banks to roll over short-term loans was hardly altruistic. They knew full well that had they collectively demanded repayment, South Korea would have run out of dollars and defaulted -- imposing huge losses on them and, in the bargain, freezing South Korea out of international capital markets. But by giving South Korea the time to recover, they can expect to retrieve most, if not all, of their original investment.
Three hurdles remain in South Korea's way. Some small overseas banks are refusing to join in the deal negotiated by the large banks. The small banks are threatening to grab their money while, they hope, their larger peers are stuck propping up shaky Korean borrowers. If this continues, the agreement could unravel. Western governments will need to pressure all banks to go along. Meanwhile, the large overseas banks are pressuring the Korean Government to take responsibility for repaying the foreign loans to its private sector. This is a bad idea that would bury Seoul in debt that could take decades to repay. The large banks have enough incentive to roll over their loans without government guarantees. Besides, Korean acquiescence would send a destructive signal to foreign investors that Seoul stands ready to bail them out of reckless loans.
The final hurdle is the fund-imposed bailout. Its conditions clamp down hard on the economy and threaten to shove it into recession. The fund's terms need to be eased. The bailout agreement was supposed to reassure foreign investors that their Korean loans would be secure. But who wants to invest in an economy that is headed for the tank? So far individual investors continue to withdraw their money, the exchange rate continues to plummet, domestic banks refuse to make loans and unemployment has begun to take off.
The monetary fund says that its program will only slow economic growth, from about 6 percent a year to under 3 percent. But fund estimates have seriously erred in Argentina, Bulgaria and, most recently, Thailand. The fund promises to remain vigilant and renegotiate terms if the Korean economy needs resuscitation. That is a promise that the United States and South Korea's other trading partners ought to make sure it fulfills.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
It was a quartarius horribilis for Asian stocks but a wash in America and Europe.

BYLINE: By Patrick J. Lyons 

 BODY:
What do Pacific Rim investors and New York Giants football fans have in common? They both should have headed for the parking lot after the third quarter.
 Or maybe skipped the game entirely this year. While the North American and European exchanges ran up big leads in the first three quarters (as did the Giants on Saturday), Asian stocks were flat or sliding all year. 
Then came the horrific fourth quarter. Japan's decline of only 14.7 percent in yen terms through Dec. 30 made it one of the Asian league leaders, while some Southeast Asian markets were losing from a fifth to nearly half their value. (And the Giants lost their playoff game.)
 Most of the damage was done by currency crises that swept the region, imperiling creditworthiness and undermining investor confidence.
 Beginning in Thailand and then ricocheting through Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea, speculators bet that overextended national treasuries and highly leveraged banking sectors would be unable to withstand runs on currencies pegged to the dollar or kept within a limited band.
 Hong Kong managed to hold its own against the speculators and keep its currency peg intact, but its stock market was sent wildly gyrating with each new day's headlines and finished the year off by nearly a third from Sept. 30 levels.
 Simultaneous sharp falls in exchange rates and stock prices became a double whammy for foreign investors in Pacific Rim stocks. In dollar terms, more than half the value of Indonesian, Korean and Thai stocks was wiped out in the quarter, and Malaysian stocks did little better.
 Stock markets in Europe and North America showed little reaction to the Asian turmoil until it reached Hong Kong in late October, and then woke up with a start. Exchanges around the world plummeted on Oct. 27, only to rebound the next day. In the industrialized West, most stock markets regained by the end of the year nearly all the ground lost in the October plunge, but developing countries were rarely so lucky. Some, like Brazil, were plagued by fears that they were next on the currency speculators' hit lists and were whipsawed by events in Asia to the end of the year.
 American stocks posted a modest gain on the quarter, as did stocks in several major European markets measured in local currency. Others saw small losses, and nearly all were off in dollar terms.
 Results for smaller European markets varied from weakness in Sweden and Finland, which were hurt by Asian turmoil, to continued strength in Russia and Turkey, where investor enthusiasm has been buoyant all year.

HEADLINE: Call Us Unpredictable

BYLINE: By Carol Tavris; Carol Tavris is a social psychologist and the author of "The Mismeasure of Woman."

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Not long ago, while momentarily suffering from end-of-century fever, I agreed to give a talk on "sex and gender in the next millennium." Of course the assignment was preposterous, considering how dramatically the rules of sexuality have changed in this century alone.
Who, in 1897, could have predicted Dennis Rodman, Madonna, sex-chat rooms on the Internet, muscled women running marathons and ponytailed men changing diapers? Who could have predicted the pill, cloning, the gay rights movement, legions of women entering business, politics and the military, and legions of Christian men marching on Washington, promising to be faithful and also to wash the dishes? 
 Nowadays it's hard to make predictions for the next year, let alone for the next 1,000. Most turn out flat wrong because we extrapolate the future from the way things are now, unable to imagine the event or discovery that will change the world.
At the end of the last century, for instance, city planners in New York predicted that traffic would soon come to a standstill. There would be far too many horses, and too many tons of horse manure, for anyone to be able to move. Throughout history, many experts who should have known better have likewise succumbed to the temptation to predict.
In 1895, Lord Kelvin, president of the Royal Society in England, said, "Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible."
In 1929, Irving Fisher, professor of economics at Yale, said, "Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau."
In 1958, Thomas J. Watson, the chairman of I.B.M., said, "I think there is a world market for about five computers."
And my all-time favorite: In 1899, Charles H. Duell, Commissioner of the Federal Office of Patents, proposed that the office be closed, on the ground that "everything that can be invented has been invented."
Predictably, predictions haven't improved over time. According to the Skeptical Inquirers annual review of New Year's predictions by psychics, 1997 was supposed to be the year that Mick Jagger became a member of Parliament, Congress suspended the baseball season after a brawl left dozens of people dead or wounded, Hillary Clinton got pregnant again, and Rush Limbaugh became a liberal Democrat after talking with Barbra Streisand.
Considering these dud forecasts, I sometimes think the only thing anyone can predict with confidence is that human beings will continue making predictions, because we are a naturally anxious and insecure species that wants to know what the future holds.
Today, especially, the world seems to be spinning out of control. How are we supposed to fight the impersonal corporate decisions that affect our daily lives, when we can't even cope with the those infernal voice-mail menus? No wonder so many people seek to restore a sense of control over life by reaching for the simplified explanations and forecasts provided by demagogues, gurus, psychics and pseudoscientists.
Even sophisticated urbanites are not immune. Last year, an article in Smithsonian magazine reported that hundreds of New Yorkers and other "urban New Agers" were using dowsing rods to decide "everything from stock market buys to whether they should respond to an ad in the 'Personals.' " If New Yorkers are dowsing for stocks and dates, we can be sure that anxiety about money and love is up (and scientific literacy is down).
Pseudoscientific predictions are more appealing than the sober predictions of science for two reasons. First, pseudoscientists speak in the reassuring tones of certainty: This will happen. Scientists speak in the annoying language of probability: It is likely that this will happen.
Most scientific predictions apply to groups or trends, not individuals or specific events. Thus, scientists can predict with great accuracy that smoking will increase the likelihood of earlier death, but they cannot predict that any given smoker will get lung cancer. But most individuals want to know what, specifically, will happen to them. Science can't say.
Second, pseudoscientific predictions are appealing because they are based on intuition, faith, compelling anecdote or individual experience. That makes them as unreliable as guessing, although they seem accessible, personal and dramatic. Scientists rely on statistical probabilities derived from objective evidence. That makes their predictions often highly accurate, although they seem tentative, remote and encumbered with qualifications.
Of course, it's harmless and fun to make silly predictions at the end of every year. But the larger question -- on what basis should we make predictions for ourselves and believe those made by others? -- is serious, because it affects so many decisions, big and small, that we make about our lives.
Perhaps the major difference between scientists and pseudoscientists is that the former know what they can't predict, whereas the latter will predict anything you ask them to. On that note, care to join me in making any predictions about sex and gender in the next millennium?

HEADLINE: Prof. Richard Allen Lester, 89, Expert in Wage and Labor Issues

 BODY:
Richard Allen Lester, an economist who specialized in wage and labor issues, and a dean of the faculty, emeritus, at Princeton University, died on Tuesday at his home in Hightstown, N.J. He was 89.
Professor Lester is known for his basic research in wage determination and minimum wages in the 1940's. One early theory, called the "range theory of wages," offered an alternative to the prevailing view that workers in similar jobs were paid the same wages. Professor Lester said that one implication of his theory was that because wages were indeterminate an increase in the minimum wage would not necessarily result in reduced employment. 
 Professor Lester also studied the labor movement, unemployment and employment discrimination. His textbooks include the "Economics of Labor" (1941) and "Labor and Industrial Relations" (1951).
During World War II, Professor Lester served on the National War Labor Board and the War Manpower Commission and in the Office of the Secretary of War. His role as Government adviser and mediator continued throughout his career. He was an arbitrator, under the Railway Labor Act, of labor disputes involving the locomotive engineers' union in 1954 and 1961.
Professor Lester advised the Kennedy Administration on employment, wage and labor issues, and served on several Federal and state advisory boards.
Professor Lester earned a bachelor's degree at Yale University in 1929 and his Ph.D. in economics in 1936 at Princeton University. He taught at the University of Washington and Duke University before returning to Princeton in 1945. Starting in 1948, he served several terms as chairman of the economics department; from 1966 to 1968, he was an associate dean and the director of the graduate program at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton.
In 1969, he became dean of the faculty, where he worked to attract women and minority candidates to the faculty. He retired in 1974, when he was named dean emeritus.
Professor Lester is survived by his wife, Doris N., of Hightstown; two daughters, Margaret L. Wing of Mendham, N.J. and Harriet L. Tarver of Atlanta; a son, Robert A., of Charlottesville, Va.; a brother, John W., of Hamburg, N.Y., and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Portfolio Manager Quits a Russian Fund, Best Performer in 1997

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The best-performing mutual fund of 1997, the Lexington Troika Dialog Russia fund, has lost one of its two lead portfolio managers, signaling further turmoil at the Moscow-based company that oversees the popular fund.
Nancy Herring, who began managing the $140 million fund in late 1996, resigned on Thursday because of what she called a contractual dispute, conflicts of interest among members of the portfolio management team and her own discomfort at the new owner's plans for Troika Dialog, the brokerage and asset management company that guides the fund's investment portfolio. 
 Ms. Herring, previously chief investment officer for Troika Dialog, is the third senior executive to resign since the Bank of Moscow agreed to buy the company in October. Peter Derby, chairman, founder and majority owner of Troika Dialog, resigned after selling his interest in the company to the Bank of Moscow, whose majority owner is the Moscow municipal government. The same month, Sergei Zenkin resigned as head of investment banking to join Merrill Lynch as its director of investment banking in Moscow.
The latest defection could create uncertainty in the United States for Lexington Troika's shareholders and for the Lexington Management Company, the Saddle Brook, N.J., company that helps to manage the fund and that oversees its marketing to American investors. The Lexington Troika fund has been one of the few bright spots recently among Lexington's lineup of about 15 stock and bond mutual funds.
Lawrence Kantor, a managing director at Lexington, said yesterday that Ms. Herring was "part of a team" that oversaw the fund's portfolio. Because "other members of the team continue to be in place," he said, the fund's operations should not be affected by her resignation.
But fund analysts say that specialists in emerging markets like Russia can often be hard to replace.
The Lexington Troika fund gained 67.4 percent last year, making it the top performer among the 4,700 mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. for the tables that appear in The New York Times. Most of those gains were compiled in last year's first three quarters, during which the fund produced a total return for investors of more than 130 percent.
In the final three months of 1997, however, as emerging markets weakened around the world in the wake of the Asian currency crisis, the Lexington Troika fund lost nearly one-quarter of its value. And because two-thirds of the fund's investors bought their shares in the third quarter, after the fund compiled its gains, most of the fund's shareholders have lost money on their investments despite the fund's stellar record.
In an interview from Buenos Aires, where she was vacationing, Ms. Herring said she was unable to reach agreement on an employment contract with Troika Dialog after the brokerage firm's new management made "changes unacceptable to me" in the makeup of the firm's executive committee. In addition, Ms. Herring said, she had "ongoing concerns" about potential conflicts of interest at the firm.
Specifically, she said, "difficult issues of conflicts of interest" were created by Gavin Rankin, who, in addition to being listed in the fund's prospectus as co-lead manager of the Lexington Troika fund, served as director of research for the Troika Dialog brokerage firm.
As co-manager of the fund's portfolio, Mr. Rankin would be partly responsible for choosing investments for the fund, while as research director for the brokerage firm, he was responsible for recommending investments for brokerage clients. Those roles could come into conflict if the fund's investment decisions overlapped with those of the brokerage firm's big clients.
Mr. Rankin gave up the brokerage job last month, according to a supplement to the fund's prospectus filed on Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ms. Herring said the potential conflict of the two roles had led her for most of last year to try to limit Mr. Rankin's involvement in choosing investments for the portfolio. Recently, however, Mr. Rankin has taken a more active role in the fund, while still working for the brokerage firm.
Changes have apparently been afoot at the fund for some months, although shareholders would have been hard pressed to realize it. The fund's most recent prospectus, filed with the S.E.C. in May, lists Ms. Herring and Mr. Rankin each as a "lead manager" of the fund, but a proxy statement filed in November gives only Mr. Rankin that title, naming Ms. Herring as one of two "other members of the portfolio management team."
In addition, the proxy statement lists Richard M. Hisey, a managing director at Lexington, as "portfolio strategist" for the fund; previously, he had been an adviser on Russian affairs to the fund's directors.
Ms. Herring said she was unaware of the changes in her title contained in the proxy statement. She added that she was primarily responsible for the fund's performance last year. "I made all of the decisions on the fund," she said. "The likelihood that any of the others knew even 20 percent of what was in the fund is in question. Their only interaction with the management of the portfolio was retrospective -- my catching them up on what I was doing and what things were likely to be like going forward."
Mr. Kantor, of Lexington, disagreed. "Nancy did a good job, but I don't think any one person was responsible for the success of the fund," he said. In addition, he said any potential conflicts of interest were resolved when Mr. Rankin gave up the brokerage position. Mr. Rankin could not be reached; Troika Dialog's offices in Moscow were closed for the year-end holiday.
Tricia O. Rothschild, international funds editor for Morningstar Mutual Funds, a publication of the Chicago fund-tracking company, said that investors should take note when any of the primary managers of an emerging markets fund resigns.
"The company can't go out and easily find another manager who has a lot of experience following equities in Russia," Ms. Rothschild said. It is worth noting, however, she added, that in young markets like Russia, "broad market movements often play more of a role than individual stock picks" by a portfolio manager.

HEADLINE: Crisis in Asia and Rail Delays Hurt Manufacturing in December

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TEMPE, Ariz., Jan. 2

 BODY:
Manufacturing activity slowed in December as the economic crisis in Asia and rail traffic delays in the United States hurt orders and production, a report released today showed.
The report, compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Management, said that the industry group's main index declined to 52.5 last month, the lowest reading since January 1997, from 54.4 in November. Analysts had expected the index to decline during December, but only to a level of about 54. 
 A reading of 50 or more indicates that manufacturing is expanding.
As 1997 ended, manufacturers were wary about the economic outlook and concerned about "weakening in new orders, the strength in the dollar, Asian demand and railroad delays," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the association's survey committee and an executive of the Sonoco Products Company, which makes packaging products.
Slowing economies in Asia are curbing demand for exports from the United States. At the same time, the dollar's strength against Asian currencies, and other currencies, has made American products more expensive in terms of those currencies.
In this country, problems continue to plague the nation's largest freight railroad, the Union Pacific Corporation. Last Tuesday, Union Pacific said that delivery delays lengthened for a second consecutive week as crew shortages offset efforts to resolve a six-month freight logjam.
Delays on the line are the worst in more than 25 years, costing retailers, manufacturers, mines and agricultural shippers more than $100 million a month, according to recent testimony before a Government panel.
Today's report also said that the association's price index fell to 50.3 in December from 51.9 during November, indicating that inflation remained under control.

HEADLINE: Dollar Is Broadly Higher; Asia Fears Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose to its best level against the Japanese yen in more than five and a half years yesterday and ended sharply higher in other foreign-exchange dealings, strengthening on the first trading day of 1998 amid fears over Asian economies.
"The dollar is being sought across the board," said Stephen Flanagan, chief dealer at Erste Bank. 
 The dollar also rose to a nearly four-month high against the German mark and reached a two-week high against the British pound.
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar traded at 132.55 yen, up from 130.42 yen, its highest level since May 1992. Financial markets in the United States were closed on Thursday for New Year's Day. The dollar sold for 1.8043 marks, up from 1.7987 marks, the highest settlement price since Sept. 9. It rose against the pound, which fetched $1.6440, down from $1.6517 on Wednesday.
Weaker Asian currencies fell further, and the growing problems of the Asians -- which are important Japanese trading partners -- added to the market's already deep worry about Japan's prospects for reviving its economy. "The yen is continuing to gain a confidence problem," Mr. Flanagan said.
Dealings were thin as Japanese financial markets were closed for a holiday, Exchange Day, and trading rooms in Europe and New York remained lightly staffed. But dealers said the dollar was likely to quickly move higher even when markets returned to a full pace on Monday.
The dollar's strength against the mark and other European currencies partly reflected lingering worries about the planned European common currency.
Traders said the dollar also retained some momentum from comments on Wednesday by the president of Germany's central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, that seemed to dim prospects for higher European interest rates before the the single currency is instituted in a year. Higher rates tend to increase the demand for a currency.

HEADLINE: How a Marxist Hotbed Eased Right;
Recalling New York's Intellectual Life as Contact Sport

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK; David Margolick is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair.

 BODY:
"I became radical because I thought I had good reason to become radical. I became liberal because I thought I had good reason to become liberal. And then I became conservative because I thought I had good reason to be conservative. It seems to me perfectly natural."
That is how Irving Kristol describes his ideological odyssey, one that took him from the left-wing hothouse of City College of New York in the late 1930's to the center of the Reagan revolution four decades later. Three other Jewish sons of New York's poorest neighborhoods and City College, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell and Irving Howe, took similar journeys at the same time on the same ideological subway from left to right, though each hopped off well before Mr. Kristol did. The stories of these four men, of the extraordinary intellectual milieu they occupied and how they evolved within it, all while looking over their shoulders at one another, are told in Joseph Dorman's documentary, "Arguing the World." The film opens Wednesday at the Film Forum, 19 stops south on the IRT Broadway local from their alma mater. 
 All four men were the products of a vanished intellectual era in New York, a time when ideas were debated ferociously, when politics was more than a spectator sport, when what happened in Madrid or Moscow reverberated around Union Square and the Upper West Side. Their careers encompassed and were shaped by the epochal events of their generation: World War II, the McCarthy era, the student protests of the 1960's, Vietnam, the Reagan era. Three of them evolved from fringe leftists to centrist or right-wing figures; through their scholarly work and in magazines like The New Leader, Commentary, Dissent and The Public Interest, all remained vitally interested in what governments can and cannot do, should and should not be.
Fellow film buffs warned Mr. Dorman that most documentaries about ideas are deadly. Even Mr. Howe, who died in 1993, had his doubts. "How could a film about us possibly be of any interest to anyone?" he asked during the shooting. Watching these men at their word processors is, in fact, not very exciting, but recalling their intellectual interactions with one another and what was happening around them -- how their theories coincided or collided with reality -- is. So is the novelty of their bygone world, along with their intelligence, charm and occasional contrition. "There were so many ideas to cover that the film constantly threatened to fly out of control," said Mr. Dorman, who has produced several previous documentaries for public television. The welfare state, Marxism and Stalinism, and the useful and destructive forms of social action were the leitmotifs of their lives.
"Arguing the World" opens with newsreel clips from City College circa 1936. Against the backdrop of the school's familiar Gothic castles (fabricated, appropriately enough, from schist dug up during the construction of the nearby subway) are hoards of earnest-looking, dark-haired and bespectacled young men in jackets and ties milling, laughing, talking, eating, hamming it up, waving banners. "Schools, Not Battleships," states one. "Down With Imperialist War," proclaims another. On the soundtrack is the simulated hum of intense conversation plus nerve-jangling modernist music signaling what Mr. Howe described as the "atmosphere of perfervid, overly heated, overly excited intellectuality" that then characterized the campus.
 
The Excitement Was in the Cafeteria
 For the most part, education at City College took place not in class but in the cafeteria, more specifically in particular corners of the cafeteria, where students, self-divided by ethnicity and politics, ate brown-bag lunches and argued endlessly about politics and everything else. "It became a kind of heder," said Mr. Bell, referring to Jewish religious schools built around disputation. Shaped by poverty and economic calamity, hungering to escape their claustrophobic ghettos but retaining Jewish notions of justice, having little sense of themselves as Americans, the four young men were drawn to left-wing ideology. They were divided only over whose Marxist vision held out the prospect of the most glorious future.
Some, including the four men portrayed in the film, frequented what was known as Alcove 1, the domain of radical leftists disillusioned with Stalin's Soviet Union: Trotskyists, Lovestonites, socialists. The far more heavily populated Alcove 2 next door belonged to card-carrying Communists and fellow travelers. "Someone made the wisecrack that the only place where the fight between Stalin and Trotsky could be conducted freely was in New York City," recalled Mr. Howe. In fact, the two groups loathed each other and rarely interacted; the divide was literary as well as political. "We prided ourselves on reading Joyce and Thomas Mann and Proust -- maybe not completely, but at least dipping in -- whereas they were reading palookas like Howard Fast," Mr. Howe said.
World War II made such distinctions irrelevant, at least for a time. It also helped transform all of the men into Americans, which in turn helped transform their ideas and politics. Two of them, Mr. Howe and Mr. Kristol, became soldiers, exposing them to the world beyond the five boroughs. "I was a New York Jewish kid," Mr. Kristol recalled. "I didn't know anything about America. I didn't know anything about most ordinary people." They, along with Mr. Bell and Mr. Glazer, saw a new side of the United States; a country that fought Fascism was one to which they could truly belong.
The process of assimilation only accelerated after the war, when they began to enjoy the fruits of American capitalism. Suddenly, miraculously (at least to him), Mr. Kristol could afford to own a car, get married and move into Manhattan ("The City," as it was then known) rather than live with his in-laws. Of the four, only Mr. Howe remained an unreconstructed leftist. The others moved right, particularly as the Soviets occupied Eastern Europe and more about Stalin's atrocities became known.
 
Tough Choices And Consequences
 Their thoughts, bandied about in the soirees of Partisan Review, were lofty, but they sometimes involved tough choices and tougher consequences that are rarely seen today. During the McCarthy era, when political demagogues and opportunists championed a more primitive version of the anti-Communism they had long espoused, Mr. Kristol, Mr. Bell and Mr. Glazer were forced to weigh competing principles: their hatred and fear of Soviet Communism and their professed civil libertarianism. More often than not, the former concerns prevailed: they said little when fellow leftists lost their jobs, fled the country or worse.
Nearly 50 years later, Mr. Kristol, still convinced that these liberals merely paid the price for their naivete, is unapologetic. "I referred to McCarthy as a vulgar demagogue," he said. "I thought that was enough." Mr. Bell contends that when Congressional investigators asked the writers, artists and academics they had summoned before them whether they had ever been Communists, they should have fessed up rather than fudged. For Mr. Glazer, it isn't so easy. Throughout "Arguing the World" he is an ebullient spirit, laughing easily amid his memories. But asked about the McCarthy era, he pauses, shakes his head slowly and bites his lower lip. "Even at the time and also in retrospect we never managed to figure out a good position, one that was respectable and moral and responsive to all the complicated issues raised," he says in an affecting moment. "I still don't think we have one."
Former radicals are forever being faulted for selling out, for abandoning their principles, for ceasing to remain radical enough. That is what Mr. Howe, in the mid-1950's, accused his colleagues of doing, forsaking their principles for an uncritical patriotism and conformity. "I lived in the same building with Irving Howe; talk about conformism," countered Mr. Kristol, whose omnipresent cigarette seems as dated as his one-time Marxism. "What was I conforming to? To what? I could never get an answer to that question."
In fact, in their time and place, these men may not have been very radical at all. Among the Jewish students at City College in the 1930's, Republicans were rarer than passenger pigeons; Karl Marx would have gotten far more votes than Alf Landon or Wendell Willkie. Rarely did these men venture beyond the world of ideas. Their notion of direct action seems to have consisted of cutting class; when they took to the streets, it was usually to head to a bookstore. Barely 20 years later, immersed in their cerebral lives, seeing universities as sacred sanctuaries, strikingly forgetful of their own romantic student days, they had little tolerance for the more strident protests of the next generation.
 
Dancing Activists, Armchair Liberals
 As moderate as the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley, Calif., came to seem (its leaders wore coats and ties to protests and did Israeli folk dancing while occupying the school's administration building) and as legitimate as its grievances were (until then, political protests on campus had been banned), Mr. Glazer, then a member of the Berkeley faculty, still condemns what he called their "enthusiastic and euphoric rejection of forms and norms." To Jackie Goldberg, then a student activist, now a member of the Los Angeles City Council, Mr. Glazer and his ilk were control freaks. "The liberalism they espoused was an armchair intellectual liberalism," she told Mr. Dorman. To them, "protesting" was sending a letter to a Congressman.
A few years later, Mr. Bell, teaching at Columbia, tried to negotiate with the students who had shut down the university. When that failed and the police came in, he walked home to Riverside Drive -- and cried. Mr. Howe, editor of Dissent, remained spiritually closest to the new crop of protesters. But a summit meeting off Central Park West between Dissent editors and the leaders of Students for a Democratic Society, led by Tom Hayden, proved disastrous. "They didn't appear to be doing anything," Mr. Hayden recalls. To Mr. Howe, meanwhile, Mr. Hayden conjured up the very figure he'd most loathed. "We could see the commissar in him, and that put us off," he says.
 
Speaking in Sadness, Speaking With Glee
 In The Public Interest and in their own academic work, Mr. Glazer, Mr. Bell and Mr. Kristol outlined their skepticism about the Great Society and liberal government in general. But still resolved to make a flawed philosophy work better, Mr. Glazer and Mr. Bell speak with sadness in the film; Mr. Kristol, who was a member of the Young People's Socialist League, speaks with glee. In the end, Mr. Glazer and Mr. Bell remained Democrats; Mr. Kristol enlisted with Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, championed the religious right, condemned liberalism and embraced the free market. To his critics, he had come full circle, abandoning one orthodoxy for another.
"The fact that we were together 50 years ago doesn't stir the faintest touch of sentiment in me," Mr. Howe said of Mr. Kristol. "I wish him well personally -- a long life with many political failures, I hope." For his part, Mr. Kristol boasts of never having read Dissent. "It didn't exist on my horizon," he said. But as Mr. Dorman spoke to him, he spotted Mr. Howe's "World of Our Fathers" on Mr. Kristol's bookshelf. The intellectual and emotional crosscurrents between the four men are deep and complex; that no two of them are ever seen together in the film is, one suspects, not simply a matter of logistics.
And yet for all their philosophical differences, for all their great successes, there is a kind of wistfulness in reflecting on this lost era. Even when he chastises Mr. Kristol, Mr. Howe has an impish, almost affectionate grin. The very evident enjoyment with which all the men recall their lives among "New York intellectuals," betrays how much they all shared, how much the world they loved has largely disappeared, how sorely they miss it. And how nothing seems poised to take its place.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rally After Bonds Rise Sharply

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, bolstered by a rally in the bond market.
The rally in bonds was set off by a report showing restrained growth in United States manufacturing activity last month. The prospect for continued mild inflation and low borrowing costs emphasized the fundamentals that have fueled the stock market's strong three-year rally. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.79 points yesterday, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 7,965.04, bringing its gain for the week to 285.73 points, or 3.7 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 4.61, or five-tenths of 1 percent, to 975.04, and gained 4.1 percent for the week.
Trading slumped below recent levels as many investors took the day off following the New Year's holiday. The lack of buyers and sellers made for a volatile day that saw the Dow rally 45 points early on, fall 30 points and then take off again. About 367 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, below the three-month average of 559 million shares.
Shares of AT&T dropped 2 1/2, to 58 13/16, shaving 10 points from the Dow. On Wednesday, a Federal judge in Texas struck down parts of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that hindered the regional Bell telephone companies from offering long-distance phone service to customers in their region. Some investors said AT&T was poised to fall, given its 53 percent return in 1997.
"If the judge's ruling stands, it lets the Baby Bells provide long-distance services, and that's the last thing AT&T needs," said Jim Benning, a trader at BT Brokerage. "Those companies would be strong competitors to AT&T."
The regional Bell telephone companies gained after the ruling. BellSouth rose 7/16, to 56 3/4; Ameritech jumped 1 3/8, to 81 7/8; SBC Communications rose 1 11/16, to 74 15/16, and U S West Communications Group rose 1, to 46 1/8.
Shares of other long-distance providers fell. MCI Communications dropped 1/8, to 42 11/16; Worldcom slid 5/16, to 29 15/16, and the Sprint Corporation fell 5/8, to 58.
"This is the first salvo; it's not a Supreme Court decision," said Bill Bane, head of sales trading at Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, Ark. "This is not the end of the story."
Late yesterday, AT&T, MCI, Sprint and others jointly asked the Texas court to delay the decision from taking effect, an AT&T spokesman said. The United States Government is expected to make the same request on Monday.
Computer stocks rose, sending the Nasdaq composite index up 11.18, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,581.53. Investors snapped up shares of companies whose stocks have been battered in recent months.
Compaq rose 3 1/8, to 59 5/8; Hewlett-Packard jumped 2 3/16, to 64 9/16; Dell Computer climbed 1 3/4, to 85 3/4, and Apple Computer increased 3 1/8, to 16 1/4.

HEADLINE: Kia Motor Opens 11 Ohio Dealerships

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Jan. 2

 BODY:
A South Korean auto maker hopes that opening 11 Ohio dealerships will help pull the company out of its financial difficulties.
The Kia Motor Corporation, battered in recent months by slow sales and an uncertain national economy, is opening six dealerships in the Cleveland area and five others around the state this week. 
 It is the second Korean auto maker to announce plans to enter the Cleveland market. On Dec. 19, the Daewoo Motor Corporation said it would open a factory-direct store this summer in Cleveland.
Kia is concentrating on the Midwest and other American markets because of slipping sales in South Korea and the weakness of the South Korean currency.
In October, the South Korean Government announced it was placing Kia under court receivership, assuming majority ownership through a state-controlled bank and installing a temporary new management team.
Kia has more than 320 dealerships in 32 states.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Rise Sharply On Prediction Of Slowdown

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose sharply on expectations of slower growth yesterday, after a manufacturing survey suggested that Asia's financial crisis was beginning to drag on the United States economy.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 14/32, to 104 8/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.82 percent, from 5.92 percent on Wednesday. But the gains came on light volume, a day after the market was closed for New Year's Day. 
 Bonds rallied yesterday after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its manufacturing index declined to 52.5 in December -- the lowest reading since January 1997 -- from 54.4 the month before as slowing growth in Asia and railroad snarls hurt orders and production. The association's prices-paid index, an inflation gauge, also declined.
The purchasing managers' report, some analysts said, provided some early evidence that the economy may be losing steam.
"The early stages of the Asia effect are beginning to show," said Patrick Dimick, bond strategist at UBS Securities. "It's favorable for the bond market."
Also helping bonds yesterday was the dollar's climb to a five-and-a-half-year high against the yen. A strengthening dollar increases the allure of United States bonds by increasing the returns overseas investors receive once the proceeds are converted into their own currencies.
Yet not everyone is sanguine about the inflation outlook, or convinced bonds will keep rallying.
"If you believe they will patch up this situation in Asia, the long bond could back up 40 basis points from here," said Ken Woods, who manages about $350 million for Asset Preservation Advisors in Atlanta, referring to the yield on the 30-year bond. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
With interest rates at their lowest levels in four years, activity is expected to pick up in the corporate market.
"With rates as low as they are, companies should start marching in" to the corporate bond market, said Glenn Davis, who helps manage $1 billion in fixed-income securities at Boston Partners Asset Management.
Century Telephone Enterprises Inc. is preparing to sell $1 billion of bonds after investor presentations Jan. 7 to Jan. 12 in what appears to be the year's first major corporate bond sale.

Asian and Rail Problems Slow U.S. Industry's Pace
American manufacturing growth slowed in December, reflecting the impact of Asia's economic crisis and railroad bottlenecks in this country, the executives who do the buying for the nation's factories said yesterday in a widely followed monthly survey. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management's main index, derived from survey results, fell to 52.5 last month, from 54.4 in November and the weakest reading since January 1997. Page D5.
 
Treasury bonds rallied and yields dropped on the purchasing managers' report, which the market viewed as a sign that inflation will remain benign because of slowing economic growth. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue fell to 5.82 percent, a new four-year low, from 5.92 percent Wednesday. Financial markets were closed Thursday for New Year's Day. D15.
 
Stocks rose, bolstered by the bond market's advance. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 56.79 points, to 7,965.04, for a weekly gain of 285.73 points, or 3.7 percent. D5.
 
Foreigners to Buy Korean Banks
The South Korean Government said it would acquire the nation's two biggest insolvent commercial banks next month and sell them to foreign investors. The plan is part of a promise by South Korea to open financial businesses to outside ownership in return for billions of dollars in emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund. D3.
 
The dollar strengthened to its best level against the Japanese yen in more than five and a half years and ended sharply higher in other foreign-exchange dealings on fears about Asian finances and economies. D4.
 
The Malaysian ringgit plunged to a record low and the Indonesian rupiah neared a record low in a major selloff of Asian currencies. D3.
 
As Asian economies slump and more people miss loan payments, work is expanding for local debt collectors. D3.
 
AT&T Shares Fall on Ruling
Shares of AT&T and other long-distance companies fell after a Federal judge struck down provisions of the Telecommunications Act that kept the regional Bell companies out of the long-distance market. The F.C.C. said it would appeal the ruling, and the long- distance companies, as expected, filed a motion to stay the ruling. D3.
 
Indy 500 of the Showroom
The biggest automotive race of the year was held nationwide last month, but which car won will remain unknown until Wednesday, when auto makers report final 1997 sales. The results will determine whether Toyota's Camry or Honda's Accord, sharing the lead through November, can claim the title of America's best-selling car, a coveted marketing distinction that lasts for an entire year. The five-time champion Ford Taurus, shown above, will get bumped to third place. D2.
 
Optimism Bolsters Apple Stock
Shares of Apple Computer rose 24 percent on optimism that the troubled computer company might shock the market with some good news next week at the MacWorld Expo in San Francisco. At the last such exposition of Apple technology in August the company surprised the industry by announcing a surprise alliance with Microsoft, its longtime nemesis in personal-computer software. D11.
 
Energy Prices Fall
Energy prices dropped in the commodity markets yesterday on predictions of warmer weather in the Northeast and Midwest, the biggest consumers of heating fuel. Natural gas for February delivery fell 11.1 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.153 a thousand cubic feet. D11.
 
Pledge on Czech Economy

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;
South Korea to Take Over and Sell 2 Big Insolvent Banks

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 2

 BODY:
The South Korean Government will acquire the nation's two biggest insolvent commercial banks next month and sell them to foreign investors, under a plan announced today aimed at helping satisfy a promise to open financial businesses to outsiders.
The institutions to be taken over, Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank, were overloaded with bad debts and effectively collapsed in recent weeks, contributing to the financial crisis that has devastated the value of both South Korea's currency and stock market, caused a wave of bankruptcies and raised the fear of default on tens of billions of dollars in foreign loans. 
 Korea First recorded $2.67 billion in unrecoverable debt; Seoul Bank had $2.14 billion.
Under a plan disclosed by the Finance and Economy Ministry today, the Government will take a controlling interest in the banks early in February by sinking the equivalent of $738 million into each before putting them up for sale.
South Korean news media said today that Citibank, a Citicorp unit, had expressed interest in buying at least part of Korea First, and that Chase Manhattan was considering an investment in Seoul Bank.
Citibank has repeatedly denied any interest in either bank. Chase officials in New York declined to comment.
As part of South Korea's efforts to meet requirements imposed by the International Monetary Fund, which agreed last month to provide as much as $57 billion in loans to prevent default, the Government is opening tightly controlled financial institutions to foreign investment. As of Dec. 20, South Korea's foreign debt totaled $153 billion, most of it in short-term loans.
Deputy Finance Minister Chung Duk Soo reiterated earlier this week that Seoul would comply with I.M.F. conditions by introducing more disclosure requirements for financial institutions and doing whatever was necessary to revamp ailing banks.
Big banks in the United States, Japan and Europe have agreed to a reprieve for South Korean banks on more than $10 billion in short-term debt, effectively reducing the danger of default at least for a few weeks.
Yet some smaller foreign banks have been unwilling to extend loans. Though South Korea owes much less to these smaller banks, their resistance is complicating international efforts to arrange a moratorium on loan repayment.
Smaller banks may ultimately join the effort, but their apparent willingness to pull their money out of the country or to take losses rather than participate in the effort demonstrates some of the hurdles still facing the architects of the South Korean bailout.
There were some reports today that the I.M.F. might delay disbursement of $2 billion to South Korea beyond a Jan. 8 target date unless it saw more progress in debt restructuring talks among banks. But fund officials in Washington discounted the reports.
Representatives of major banks met today at Chase's New York headquarters to talk about Korea. No details were disclosed.
Negotiating even the preliminary steps to resolve the crisis involves delicate talks with hundreds of banks that have lent various amounts.
The Government has already paid off $1.5 billion of Korea First Bank's bad loans and $1.2 billion of Seoul Bank's unrecovered debt, or slightly more than half in each case. Finance Ministry officials have said that they plan to fully repay the two banks' liabilities before selling them.
The needs of South Korean workers remain an important sticking point. When Parliament here passed a package of laws last week aimed at easing restrictions on foreign investment, a notable exception was any agreement on the scope and mechanics of dismissing employees of Korean financial institutions that are put up for sale.
So while many companies here now look like bargains to foreign buyers, particularly with the steep drop in the currency and stock prices in recent weeks, militant labor unions remain a consideration. Early Saturday, the currency, the won, was quoted at 1,600 to the dollar in spot trading. Korean stocks rose 9.18 points, or 2.4 percent, to 385.46, in a half-day Saturday session.
One of the significant changes will allow foreign banks to open retail branches in South Korea this year. But it will likely be far more cost-effective to take over an existing bank that already operates a large network of branches than to open new branches. Bankers have said that a foreign takeover of a South Korean bank could assume the form of a joint venture with a local conglomerate.
For South Korea, one of the few positive consequences of a depreciated currency is the way it makes exports cheap overseas, while making imports much more expensive.
That was reflected in trade figures reported today, showing that the country accrued a $2.32 billion surplus in December. With the currency dropping so sharply, imports tumbled 24.7 percent, to a value of $10.24 billion, while exports increased 2.8 percent, to $12.56 billion.
For all of 1997, South Korea's exports increased 5.3 percent, to $136.6 billion, while imports decreased 3.8 percent, to $144.6 billion -- an $8 billion trade deficit, compared with a $20.6 billion deficit in 1996.

HEADLINE: Suspense Is Rising in Israel Over Impasse on the Budget

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Israel shut down for the weekend today in high suspense over whether Foreign Minister David Levy, who has threatened to resign from Israeli governments eight times in the past, would finally make good on his vow this time.
There was no indication today that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had made any progress in satisfying Mr. Levy's demands for more spending on social programs in the 1998 budget, or even that any talks had been held between aides to the two men. As he has in his past crises, Mr. Levy returned to his home city near the Sea of Galilee and refused to make any comment. 
 The new crisis forced Mr. Netanyahu to postpone a vote on the budget until Monday, when Israel will also learn whether Mr. Levy is to go or stay -- and if he goes, whether the Government will go with him.
Israeli television reported that the Government had been in touch with Dennis B. Ross, the special United States mediator for the Middle East, to see if he would postpone a visit scheduled to begin on Monday. According to the report, Washington declined.
The Clinton Administration has pressed Mr. Netanyahu to come up with concrete ideas to revive the negotiating process with the Palestinians, including a specific proposal for a further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. Mr. Ross is to prepare the way for Mr. Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to hold separate meetings with President Clinton this month and, if possible, to agree on resuming their negotiations.
Mr. Netanyahu has already delayed making a commitment several times, often because of the incessant crises in his Government. But the television report indicated that Washington was not prepared to agree to another extension.
Israeli television also reported that Ehud Barak, the leader of the opposition Labor Party, had contacted Mr. Levy with the offer of a senior post in a future Labor government if Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Government fell. Neither Mr. Barak nor Mr. Levy confirmed the report, but it fed speculation that the Foreign Minister might have a stronger incentive to quit the Government and thus raise the likelihood of early elections.
The withdrawal of Mr. Levy's five-member Gesher faction would not be enough by itself to bring down Mr. Netanyahu's coalition, which controls 66 of the 120 seats in Parliament. But the consensus among politicians was that its withdrawal would quickly prompt some other small parties to follow suit.
Mr. Netanyahu, for one, appeared to take the threat seriously. His aides were quoted as saying that if the choice was between Mr. Levy and Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman, who was said to be resisting making any more concessions on the budget, he would stay with Mr. Levy.
Mr. Levy and Mr. Netanyahu have a long history of rivalry and even enmity, including a time when they both worked in the Foreign Ministry but did not speak to each other. Mr. Neeman, by contrast, is a close associate of the Prime Minister. But Mr. Neeman is not a politician and has no constituency of his own, while Mr. Levy, a Jew of Moroccan origin, has a sizable following among poor Jews of North African descent.
The latest crisis followed furious haggling in the coalition over the 1998 budget, during which religious and ethnic parties managed to exact a long list of expensive concessions for their pet projects. On the other hand, social programs for which Mr. Levy had been promised money in July got nothing.
At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Levy waved the written promises Mr. Netanyahu had made him in July, declaring that he would vote against the budget and quit the Government. Mr. Levy's demands include benefits for the unemployed, help for poor cities and rundown areas, a longer school day, more housing for lower-income families and support for needy students.
Although Mr. Netanyahu publicly announced a delay in the budget vote in order to meet Mr. Levy's demands, Israeli newspapers said there was considerable anger in the Prime Minister's office toward Mr. Levy. Many officials privately regard Mr. Levy as a vain man whose resignation threats are staged not for his purported causes but to help his image.
The rivalry between the two politicians dates back to years when Mr. Netanyahu was a rising star in the last Likud Government and often overshadowed Mr. Levy in public. In a well-known incident, Mr. Netanyahu accused his rival of threatening to make public a videotape that showed him in an adulterous affair. Mr. Levy angrily denied the accusation.
Since Mr. Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister in May 1996, Mr. Levy has threatened six times to resign, most recently after the bungled assassination of a Hamas official in Jordan. In addition to low funding for social programs, he has been frustrated by his exclusion from key security deliberations and contacts with Palestinians, as well as the halt of the peace negotiations, for which he largely blames Mr. Netanyahu.
For many Israelis, the sight of their Government locked in yet another crisis -- moreover one centered not on national security but on a battle for tax money -- was clearly disheartening.
In a Gallup poll commissioned by the newspaper Maariv, 45 percent of those questioned thought new elections were the best way out of the current political situation, and 30 percent wanted a "national unity" government with Labor. Only 23 percent wanted the current Government to continue. The poll also showed that if elections were held today, 41 percent would vote for Mr. Barak, 33 percent for Mr. Netanyahu.
Most press commentaries were heavy with disdain.
Yoel Marcus wrote in Haaretz, "It is not only the coalition partners who have lost all shame: the Prime Minister himself, who is willing to pay any price to stay in office, has as well."

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, a Delicate Industry Unravels

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: GUTTENBERG, N.J.

 BODY:
Behind a nondescript facade on a quiet street here, huge looms with thousands of needles are noisily working their magic in rhythm, transforming rolls of plain fabric into delicate designs that will one day adorn a fancy nightgown, frilly underwear or a little girl's party dress.
Punctuating the dance are the quick movements of a nimble-fingered worker known as a "watcher," who jumps in when a skein of yarn snaps, rethreading the needle and marking the problem spot with tape, even as the machine continues to pulsate. 
 Most of the looms in the small embroidery factory owned by Deerbrook Fabrics are choreographed by "punchings" -- rolls of paper cards dotted with holes like those of a player piano. But Deerbrook recently added a $750,000 electronic loom that is far more efficient. While other companies have balked at such a huge investment, Ed Parseghian, the president of Deerbrook, said he had no choice: "If I don't do this, I'm not going to survive."
These have been troubled times for the once-flourishing embroidery business in Hudson and Bergen Counties. More embroidery is produced here than in any other region in the nation, but the business is rapidly shrinking, raising concerns that it will eventually succumb to the same forces that have killed off other manufacturing trades in the area. In the last 15 years, New Jersey's share of the domestic market for embroidery has declined to 70 percent from 90 percent, according to a 1996 report by the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken.
Foreign and domestic competition and the more austere fashion trends of recent years have driven a number of family-owned companies out of business. While some manufacturers take heart from recent signs that embellishment is returning to women's apparel, many others are so demoralized that they have ignored offers of state aid to help them modernize their operations. "People don't have the appetite to put more money into the business," said Stanley Kotkin, the president of Dako Lace, a 41-year-old company in West New York.
Cy Thanikarry, the director of the New Jersey division of economic development, acknowledged that the industry had been slow to grab the life preserver extended by the state. "I am disappointed because I still believe that this industry has tremendous potential," he said.
Founded more than a century ago by Swiss immigrants seeking proximity to New York City's garment factories, the embroidery industry in northeastern New Jersey has provided work for successive waves of new arrivals. Around the turn of the century, hand-operated looms were replaced by automated machines, which were soon imported on a large scale, turning hundreds of Swiss, Austrian and German immigrants into manufacturers.
In recent decades, most of the workers -- including those who start out on the lowest rung as "shuttlers," loading bobbins of yarn into boat-shaped shuttles -- have come from Spanish-speaking countries.
Northeastern New Jersey was well suited to the industry because the 40,000-pound machines could be anchored in the bedrock of the Palisades to keep the needles from vibrating. Most of the looms are programmed by punchings, with the arrangement of the holes determining whether the fabric is to be transformed into, say, so-called Venise lace, in which the background fabric will later be burned away, or eyelet embroidery with tiny holes, or a loosely stitched embroidered panel that will be used to decorate a bra.
Today, some of the punchings on the old machines have been replaced by computer disks, but Deerbrook is the only manufacturer in the region with the latest electronic Schiffli machine, named for the shuttles, which look like small boats, or "Schiffli," in the Swiss-German dialect. "I never thought I'd work with computers," said Hernan Orihuela, a Deerbrook foreman who has worked for the company for more than two decades, as he demonstrated how easily he could adjust a design with a few strokes on the keyboard. "It's a big jump up the hill."
In its survey of northern New Jersey's $300 million-a-year embroidery business, the Stevens Institute counted 400 companies employing more than 3,500 people, mostly in small factories with two or three antiquated machines. Since 1980, however, as many as 150 other companies have shut down, said I. Leonard Seiler, the executive director of the Schiffli Association, the industry's trade group.
"These are first-generation-immigrant jobs that pay good money," said Silvio Laccetti, a Stevens professor who helped write the study. An experienced worker can make more than $30,000 in base pay, the survey said.
But over the last decade, union membership has dwindled to about 670 from 1,300, said Luis Lozada, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 211T, which merged with the textile workers' union in 1995.
Maria Rios, a union member who is originally from Colombia, has worked as a mender for K.R. Embroidery Company in West New York for 23 years. These days, however, business is "very, very slow," she said, sitting at the sewing machine she uses to repair the damage that occurs when a thread snaps. "Before, I worked 60 or 72 hours a week. Now I work 20 hours." Because she puts in fewer than 120 hours a month, she no longer qualifies for health insurance, she said.
Mrs. Rios's boss, Kenneth Ryan, who has operated his company since 1964, said it is almost impossible to compete against third world countries, where workers in government-subsidized factories often earn less in a month than American workers make in a week. Labor costs and taxes are also lower in Southern states, and factories there have more up-to-date equipment.
"This has been a very difficult time, pricewise," Mr. Ryan said. "We haven't increased prices in four or five years. We absorbed the increases trying to compete."
Victor Kotkin, Stanley's brother, said he could no longer compete with companies in Mexico that were benefiting from the North American Free Trade Agreement -- in one case, selling an item to California customers "cheaper than we could make it." After finding himself more than $200,000 behind at the end of 1996, he sold R. and J. Embroidery Company, the Fairview business he started 18 years ago, and went to work for the company in Union that bought it.
"It was very traumatic in the family," he said. "I'd been looking forward to retiring in the next 10 or 15 years, but at age 54, I'm starting over."
Mario DeLuca is still in business, but he had only enough business in 1997 to keep the two Schiffli looms at his Germaine Embroidery factory in Union City running for 19 weeks. "I go there in the morning," he said. "I check my fax machine. I collect my mail, and at the end of the month I pay the electric bill. And that's that." Mr. DeLuca, who is 70, said he would gladly sell his machines if he could get $50,000 apiece for them -- about one-third of what he said they are worth.
After the Stevens report recommended several steps to stop further hemorrhaging in the industry, the state began a program to help embroidery companies secure low-cost loans to expand and upgrade their equipment. So far, though, only about 15 companies have applied for assistance, and only 2 have received it, said Nicole Esposito, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.
The future is so shaky, Mr. Ryan said, that companies like his are unwilling to make a substantial investment, even at nominal interest rates. "How long would it take to recapture the investment?" he said.
Mr. Thanikarry, of the state's economic development division, said the industry had also turned a cold shoulder to a variety of programs that the state offered -- from help with setting up internships for fashion students to establishing a model plant where small companies could band together to take advantage of technological advances and economies of scale.
Some manufacturers said they were wary of interference from the state. "They said, 'We'll send business school graduates to tell you how to run your business,' " said Terri Baran-Carlson, the president of Carlson Embroidery, of Fairview. "What do they know about lace?"
One company that did take advantage of the state's willingness to help was Carolace, a leading producer of lace and embroidery, with factories in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and West New York. Bernie Mann, who recently handed over daily operations of the 47-year-old company to his two sons, said it took only three months for Carolace to obtain a $2.1 million low-interest loan. The company is using the money to improve communications among its various plants, increase sales to fabric stores and replace some of the 100,000 punchings in its library with computer disks.
To some of the younger embroidery manufacturers, the lackluster response to the state's program reflects a horse-and-buggy mentality that is holding the industry back. "They were waiting for the state to come in with wheelbarrows to dump money in our account," said Larry Severini, 41, the president of United Embroidery, one of the state's largest Schiffli companies.
In any case, the prospect of state aid may have come too late for many companies, said Stuart M. Schrenzel, the president of a third-generation company, Shuttle-Tex, based in West New York.
Citing a type of stretchy lace that his company recently developed, Mr. Schrenzel predicted that innovation would be the key to whether a company survives. "If you're not coming up with new stuff," he said, "those are the companies that are going down."

HEADLINE: MEDICAL RESEARCH TO GET MORE MONEY FROM GOVERNMENT

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
In his new budget, President Clinton plans to seek a substantial increase in Federal spending on biomedical research, and members of Congress from both parties say they are virtually certain to approve an even bigger increase.
Science and politics point to the same conclusion. When Congress reconvenes this month, lawmakers will be seeking more money for the National Institutes of Health because they believe that researchers can exploit promising scientific opportunities like new advances in cancer treatment. They also believe that such investments will be popular with voters in an election year. 
 "We are in a golden age of discovery, one unique in human history," said Dr. Richard D. Klausner, director of the National Cancer Institute, expressing the view of many scientists and lawmakers.
Even before Mr. Clinton formally sends his budget request to Capitol Hill early next month, N.I.H. officials have told Congress that the Federal Government must increase its support of biomedical research because managed-care companies, with their emphasis on the bottom line, have reduced the amount of money available to conduct clinical trials of promising treatments. In the past, academic health centers used surplus revenue from patient care to supplement the money they received from the Government, but such surpluses are drying up.
The budget of the health institutes has doubled in the last decade, to $13.6 billion this year. Nonetheless, lawmakers of both parties say they intend to accelerate the increases, and they talk seriously about trying to double the budget of the N.I.H. in five years. That would require annual increases averaging 15 percent, far more than the latest increase of 7.1 percent, from 1997 to 1998.
Anne Thomas, a spokeswoman for the National Institutes of Health, said N.I.H. officials had begun internal discussions so they could answer questions from Congress about how they would use a big infusion of Federal money. In setting priorities, Ms. Thomas said, the agency's director, Dr. Harold E. Varmus, is asking, "Where are the scientific opportunities, and what are the public health needs?"
The Senate voted 98 to 0 last year to endorse the goal of doubling the agency's budget in five years, but did not say where the money should come from.
Two influential Republicans, Representative John Edward Porter of Illinois and Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said they were determined to find the money. They are chairmen of the Appropriations subcommittees responsible for health care spending.
In an interview, Mr. Porter said that he had discussed the question at length with Speaker Newt Gingrich, and that Mr. Gingrich "supports doubling the N.I.H. budget in five years, within the overall context of a balanced budget." At a forum on health issues in Smyrna, Ga., in November, Mr. Gingrich said he wanted to double spending on biological research.
Mr. Porter said the Clinton had sought rather modest increases for the health institutes in recent years, knowing that Congress would provide more money than he requested. "That is not honest budgeting," Mr. Porter said.
Republican senators, including Connie Mack of Florida and Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, said they would join Democrats like Tom Harkin of Iowa and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts in seeking big budget increases for the health institutes. Some Republicans were skeptical about such spending after they took control of Congress in 1995, but they have since been persuaded that biomedical research is an engine of economic growth, with many commercial uses for biotechnology, agriculture and the drug industry.
Senator Kennedy has proposed using money from new tobacco taxes to finance medical research, an idea that seems to be gaining favor on Capitol Hill.
In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Clinton sounded a theme that White House officials said would show up in his State of the Union Message late this month. "I do believe that in scientific terms, the last 50 years will be seen as an age of physics and an age of space exploration," Mr. Clinton said. "I think the next 50 years will very likely be characterized predominantly as an age of biology and the exploration of the human organism, especially with the completion of the human genome project, which I think will literally explode what we know about how to deal with health issues."
A major goal of the genome project is to understand and decipher the human genetic code, identifying genes responsible for particular diseases.
Vice President Al Gore has been a strong supporter of high-technology projects at the health institutes. He has joined Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in seeking an increase of $1 billion for the agency in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1, and Administration officials said today that Mr. Clinton had agreed to that amount.
Patients' groups concerned about specific diseases, doctors and medical schools are forming a coalition to lobby for a 100 percent increase in the institutes' budget over the next five years. Terry L. Lierman, president of Capitol Associates, a lobbying concern, said today: "We plan a grass-roots campaign inside and outside the Beltway. It will be run the same way Northrop Grumman lobbies for the B-2 bomber."
Members of Congress said they would look to N.I.H. officials, rather than to the White House, for guidance as they decide this year on the appropriate level of spending for biomedical research. Dr. Klausner, the director of the National Cancer Institute, recently sent Congress a blueprint for spending $3.19 billion in the next fiscal year, up from the $2.55 billion provided to the cancer institute this year.
"Knowledge about the fundamental nature of cancer is exploding," Dr. Klausner said.
The budget request, reflecting the professional judgment of Government scientists, includes these proposals:
*The number of cancer research and treatment centers around the country should be increased to 70, from the current 57.
*The Government should authorize "a fivefold increase over the next five years in the number of people participating" in clinical trials of new techniques for the prevention and treatment of cancer. At present, 300,000 people participate in such studies. The goal is "to insure that all people who wish to participate in a clinical trial are able to do so," Dr. Klausner said.
*Congress should provide an additional sum of $40 million next year so the Government can finance the top 40 percent of applications for research. The cancer institute says it now awards grants to the top 25 percent. (Applications are evaluated by panels of experts, through a competitive process of peer review.)
In appealing to Congress for more money, Dr. Klausner said the growth of managed care and other changes in the health care industry posed "a very real danger for the continuation of cancer research and our continued progress against cancer." Health maintenance organizations and other insurers are increasingly reluctant to pay even the costs of routine care for patients in early clinical trials, he said.
The cancer institute is seeking $60 million next year to subsidize the salaries of 600 scientists at the 57 cancer centers, so they will have more time for research.
Lawmakers said they would seriously consider such requests. "What we are doing today, making scavengers and beggars of the best in biomedical research, is just simply wrong," Senator D'Amato said.
Mr. Harkin, who wants to establish a Government trust fund for medical research, said: "Of the $1 trillion spent on health care in America every year, a paltry 2 percent is spent on research. The United States has spent more on Pentagon research and development in the last four years than we have on medical research since the turn of the century."

HEADLINE: An Infrastructure Summit

 BODY:
Perhaps inspired by the holidays, regional politicians have been promising us gifts in the form of discounts and tax cuts. Joseph Bruno, the New York State Senate majority leader, made the latest offer when he suggested devoting a chunk of Albany's $2 billion surplus to tax cuts. Unfortunately, this seasonal generosity tends to emphasize current gratification at the expense of long-range needs. Chief among these needs, and essential to the New York metropolitan area's economic future, are smart, well-aimed investments in infrastructure -- its schools, roads and mass transit.
Let us be the first to stipulate that the phrase "infrastructure investment" lacks the cachet of "tax cut." But the obvious shortcomings of the region's basic systems, particularly the overburdened road and rail networks, ought to be on every politician's lips as the millennium approaches. The current officials surely do not want to be known as the crowd that stiffed public needs and stunted employment and revenues in the decades ahead. 
 The stress is everywhere. West of the Hudson River, for example, New Jersey Transit is mulling whether to double-deck some of its trains to speed moving commuters to their New York City jobs. Come 2006, about 388,000 students will fill a New York City high school system that today accommodates 311,000. Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew's call for year-round school to relieve overcrowding, even if ratified by Albany, cannot solve it. Meanwhile, decay has kept the two subway tracks on the Manhattan Bridge's south side unused since 1990, lengthening the N train ride. Service will not be restored until repair work is done, sometime after the millennium. In Fairfield County, Conn., riding the Metro-North trains to and from Grand Central Terminal may be easy enough. Negotiating the Stamford station and reaching one's car is almost impossible.
This is, in short, a regional problem requiring a regional response. The three Governors and New York City's Mayor should pledge to develop a consensus list of major projects that are in the region's economic interest. They should also call for infrastructure summit talks that yield fast-track projects and innovative regional financing.
White papers for such a summit conference will be available soon. Early in the new year, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will release their Access to the Core study on how to add and extend rapid-transit lines. At least one published report says that the study will recommend a $3.5 billion project encompassing a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River and a tunnel between Penn Station and Grand Central. One obvious benefit of this plan would be to increase access to the city's East Side for New Jersey commuters and make the West Side more accessible to commuters from Westchester County and Connecticut.
Later, the M.T.A. will issue a study for a Second Avenue subway and other options for ending overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue line. New York State is to issue a study on replacing the decrepit Gowanus Expressway, and in late 1998 the Port Authority will release its study on where to dredge, dig a tunnel and build a cargo-handling port.
Each study should be required reading for leaders and citizens alike. The studies could also form the basic text for a meeting of leaders throughout the region to pick those projects that offer the best hope of leaping colonial-era political boundaries and building a transportation system that serves the entire region. Such a meeting would be a wise investment in the future of the metropolis.

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES; Brent Staples writes editorials on politics and culture for The New York Times.

 BODY:
With welfare reform and the budget deficit defused as issues, public education is shaping up as the next point of contention between Democrats and Republicans. The debate will require fancy footwork, given that educational financing and policy are local matters in which the Federal Government plays only a minuscule role. The shift will be especially awkward for Republicans, who have generally viewed "local control" as the be-all and end-all and have denounced even enlightened Federal initiatives as preludes to a Government takeover.
 Hints of change were evident in the last Congress, when the Republican leadership generated several school choice proposals, all of which failed, though not before exposing the most retrograde features of the Democratic party line on education. The most controversial proposal set aside $7 million to pay 2,000 private and parochial school scholarships for children trapped in the abysmal schools of Washington. 
 As a dysfunctional city run by Democrats, Washington is a frequent target for Republicans who wish to embarrass the opposition and grandstand for the folks back home. But the horrendous failure of Washington's schools made the city a legitimate target for the voucher plan. The severity of the problem came through in a recent report from the financial control board overseeing city affairs. The report, titled "Children in Crisis," said that the city had failed "in virtually every area and for every grade level. . .to provide our children with a quality education and a safe environment in which to learn."
 The study described a system that was mired in graft and violence and had failed to determine basic information, like how many people it employed or how many children it served. Nearly 80 percent of students could not read at even the basic level -- almost twice the national figure. The longer these children remained in the system, the worse they performed. The school system's chief academic officer, Arlene Ackerman, recently described the process as "educational genocide."
 The same Republicans who had sworn by "local control" sounded like activist liberals, saying that vouchers would allow at least some of Washington's children to go on to college rather than jail. Democrats who had made careers as champions of the poor opposed the plan, arguing that a solution that did not save every child was unacceptable. The Democrats got the worst of the exchange. They seemed more interested in preserving the public school monopoly than in saving at least some children's lives.
 During the debate, an African-American father in the District spoke for millions of others, saying he didn't care if relief came from "Democrats, Republicans or chickens," just as long as it helped his child. The comment conveys the potency of the voucher issue among African-Americans, who are overwhelmingly confined to the country's worst schools and favor vouchers in far greater numbers than do whites.
 The G.O.P. hopes to exploit African-American discontent by portraying itself as an advocate of choice for the poor and by casting the Clinton Administration and the teachers' unions as part of the horrendous status quo. Given these politics, the expansion of programs that offer private education at public expense is inevitable, if only in inner cities, where letting the poorest students flee to private schools is the only moral thing to do.
 But despite its popularity as a political tool, the voucher strategy amounts to no more than tinkering at the margins of an enormous problem. Among the millions of children trapped in inner-city schools, not even 10 percent could find private school placements if they were given vouchers tomorrow. One survey in Washington found that the city's private and parochial schools would have trouble absorbing even 2,000 voucher students, in part because the proposed scholarships fell far short of tuition costs.
 If Congress wants to improve American schools, it will need to wade into issues like school construction, teacher training and, most crucially, national standards establishing what children need to know and when. If Congress bypasses these issues -- and history suggests that it will -- the coming debate will consist mainly of noise and empty irrelevancies.
 The voucher idea originated 40 years ago with the free-market economist Milton Friedman. Mr. Friedman argued that students should be permitted to transfer from failing public schools to successful private schools, taking public dollars with them. This strategy, he predicted, would force the worst schools to close and mediocre ones to shape up. His critics countered that a voucher system would skim off the brightest students, promote white flight and leave inner-city schools black, poor and bereft of a viable tax base. This happened, anyway -- not through vouchers, but through middle-class flight brought on by worsening schools.
 Mr. Friedman's proposal died shortly after birth, but was recently resurrected in the form of scholarships aimed at the poorest of the poor. Three-fifths of the states have choice programs that allow movement among public schools; several others are considering plans that would allow low-income families to escape the worst inner-city schools for private schools and -- if the courts allow -- parochial schools as well. The Congressional plan was modeled on publicly funded voucher programs in Milwaukee and Cleveland. The two programs, which have fewer than 5,000 students between them, have come under heavy attack from the educational establishment. The record shows in grim detail how difficult it isto break a public-school monopoly.
 That the Milwaukee program has survived is something of a miracle. The scholarships are limited to $3,000 -- less than half what the public schools spend per pupil -- insuring that many students would enroll in schools that lacked financial stability. The schools were forced to accept children at random, to insure that there would be no skimming for the best and brightest. Enrollment was limited to 1.5 percent of the student body, making certain that thousands of children would remain in failing schools that graduate almost no one. Yet, despite the obstacles, recent studies have shown measurable improvements in test scores for students who were lucky enough to get the vouchers.
 The Cleveland program was just as penuriously financed, but somewhat better organized. Unlike the Milwaukee program, it allowed families to choose not only private but also parochial schools, thus greatly expanding the options. The program now includes 3,000 children, who receive up to $2,500 each and attend 55 private and parochial schools. A recent study by the Harvard Program on Educational Policy and Governance examined test scores for about one-fifth of the voucher students and found that since leaving public schools, most had made measureable gains in English and dramatic gains in math.
 Critics argued that private schools would reject the poorest and most difficult students. But of the children who use the voucher program in Cleveland, 75 percent are poor and two-thirds are black. Critics also suggested that poor parents would be incapable of choosing private schools and would do so on irrational grounds. The Cleveland parents, however, were as rational as they come. About 85 percent said they took part in the voucher program for academic reasons, with close to 80 percentciting safety as an additional concern. The Harvard studyrt found that two-thirds of the voucherparents were "very satisfied" with the academic quality of the school, compared to fewer than 30 percent of the parents of students who remained in public schools.
 Teachers' unions and other groups challenged Cleveland's program on constitutional grounds, arguing that it violated the separation of church and state. But this is a thin reed, growing thinner all the time. An Ohio state judge rejected this argument, allowing the program to continue, pending rulings in a higher court. In an intriguing decision, the Ohio judge, Lisa L. Sadler, found that the voucher scholarships were not subsidizing religion. On the contrary, the judge seemed to argue that the voucher students were no different from college students who are allowed by law to use Federal grants and scholarships at religious colleges.
 Enemies of the Cleveland program can expect little solace from the United States Supreme Court, which has signaled in several cases its readiness to weaken church-state barriers in education. The most recent signal was Agostini v. Felton, in which New York City was permitted to deliver Federally mandated remedial services to children on parochial school grounds instead of in trailers just off parochial school property.
 The teachers' unions are understandably worried. But in carrying the fight, some union activists are advancing disturbing and even sinister arguments about inner-city children. The most common is that vouchers should be disallowed because they benefit the few while leaving out the many. The unions also argue that data showing improvement among the voucher students has been cooked and can't possibly be real. In essence, these critics are making a claim that no parent would accept: that orderly, well run private schools can't possibly be better than horrendously run public schools. Taken to their logical conclusions, these arguments assert that inner-city schools are doing the best they can with what they are given. What this means is that the teachers' unions have lower expectations for African-American children than for whites.
 Inner-city parents are caught between cynical Republicans, who use them to bludgeon Democrats, and cynical Democrats, who patronize them and sacrifice their children to the vagaries of politics. But surveys and focus groups show quite clearly that African-Americans want out of the decrepit and unsafe city schools.
 Recent survey data from David Bositis of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research organization devoted to black issues, show that African-Americans have a dimmer view by far of public education than whites. A solid majority of whites view their schools as either good or excellent, but only about a third of African-Americans and 40 percent of Latinos are satisfied with their schools.
 Nearly 80 percent of blacks and more than 85 percent of Latinos say the Government spends too little on education, as opposed to about 60 percent of whites. Whites are evenly split on the issue of whether to issue vouchers for use in public, private and parochial schools. But African-Americans and Latinos are overwhelmingly in favor of such a system. Among African-Americans ages 26 to 35, 86.5 percent favor vouchers. In addition, Mr. Bositis's studies show that black support for vouchers jumped by about 19 percent in a single year, from 1996 to 1997. These numbers spell trouble for the Democrats, who have been trying to persuade African-Americans to keep the faith with schools that destroy their children's futures.
 The same Congressmen who stood tall for a voucher program that would have reached only 2,000 children in Washington cowered when it came to reform that would have benefited every school child in the country. The issue in the last Congress was the Clinton plan for a voluntary national test that would allow parents to know exactly where their children stood with respect to state, national and even world standards.
 The current patchwork of tests includes vague scoring statements that allow school districts to obscure how badly they are doing. The only way to clarify things is through clear, standards-based tests that permit local, national and international comparisons. Congress lacked the courage even for this. Republicans argued that a national test would erode local authority and lead to a Government takeover of the schools. Black and Hispanic Democrats complained that such a test would further stigmatize minority students, who would inevitably perform worse than whites.
 What really scared Congress was the prospect that parents would find out exactly where their schools stood -- and hold lawmakers and school officials accountable as never before.
 On the whole, American schools are far better than most critics wish to admit, particularly at the high end, where they easily rival the best that Japan and Western Europe have to offer. The problems lies at the low end, with inner-city schools at the bottom of the heap. The obvious thing to do is to apply standards used at the very best schools to all of the rest, while providing the resources and roadmaps to make the new standards achievable. But having balked at a national test, Congress seems to have no appetite for going where no American has gone before.
 American education was hobbled from the start by the twin presumptions that mediocrity is acceptable and that excellence is available only to the privileged few. The story of how this happened can be found in the philosopher Richard Hofstadter's book "Anti-Intellectualism in American Life" (Alfred A. Knopf), which won the Pulitizer Prize in 1964. In the mid-1890's, a prestigious national task force called The Committee of Ten called for a strong academic curriculum for all high school students -- whether or not they planned to attend college.
 The Ten decried the "feeble and scrappy" courses offered in American schools and advocated a rigorous regime that included four years each of foreign language, English and literature, three to four years of science and math, and two to four years of history. The committee said that a strong academic curriculum was especially important for students not bound for college, to prepare them to participate knowledgably in democracy.
 If all this sounds familiar, it's because it is. In 1983, the National Commission on Excellence in Education sounded the same themes in its report, "A Nation at Risk," which warned against a "rising tide of mediocrity" and pointed out that American children were losing ground compared with their peers in Europe and Japan. Echoing The Ten, "A Nation at Risk" insisted on extensive education in English, math, science, social studies and computer science -- for every high schooler, regardless of background or vocational interest.
 The national standards movement that grew out of that report started in the right direction, but was burned up during the culture wars, when the subject of standards become highly politicized.
 Things are pretty much where The Ten left them in 1894. Back then, bureaucrats subverted the committee's plan, arguing that it was too demanding and that rigor would be lost on the poor and especially women, who were destined to be housewives, anyway. Science and math became "industrial arts" and "household science." The result was a tracking system that sorted students in terms of "ability groups" that were often proxies for race, gender or class. Mr. Hofstadter called this the most antidemocratic moment in the history of American education. The Boston University educator Paul Gagnon decribes the process as triage for the masses, noting that 80 percent of the population is consigned to the nonacademic scrap heap by junior high school. As a consequence, a disadvantaged child has a better chance at a rigorous education in Paris, Copenhagen or Tokyo than in New York, Chicago or Cleveland.
 West Germany and Scandinavia have much to teach us, as do Singapore, South Korea and especially Japan, whose schools are ranked in international studies as the best in the world. But even if Americans copied Japanese techniques, the view of human potential that makes them work would be far more difficult to acquire. Japanese push their children to achieve because they see excellence as the product of hard work. Americans tacitly accept failure because they view it as the product of diminished "native intelligence."
 Voucher programs and charter schools are logical parts of a broad educational mix. But in terms of what ails us nationally, they are no more than pop guns deployed against a battle ship. At the barest mininmum, Americans need to reach a national concensus about standards -- and about what children need to learn and when they need to learn it. A Congress that fears even voluntary national testing is unlikely to embark on so politically charged a mission in the absence of strong, bipartisan leadership. Unless that leadership arises very soon, the debate on school reform will be sound and fury, signifying nothing.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE & MONEY;
A Free Bachelor's. No Kidding.

BYLINE: By Sally Johnson; Sally Johnson is a writer and editor who lives in Vermont.

 BODY:
This academic year, the price of college again rose faster than inflation. Tuition was up 5 percent, double the inflation rate. It now averages $13,000 annually at private institutions, where a four-year bachelor's degree averages upwards of $52,000.
 But little known to many students is a handful of colleges that charge no tuition. 
 Some have hefty endowments that cover all student costs. Others are military academies subsidized by the Federal Government. And still others depend on a creative mix of student work and subsidies to make ends meet.
 Cooper Union in New York City, a mecca for aspiring artists, architects and engineers, and Berea College in Berea, Ky., founded to educate the poorest children of Appalachia, are the granddaddies of tuition-free education; both started before the Civil War.
 One of the most unusual is Deep Springs College, a two-year institution nestled in a remote valley of eastern California, near the Nevada border. There, an elite group of 26 young men with sky-high SAT scores spend two years before transferring to elite institutions like Harvard, Yale and Stanford.
 Its alumni include James Olin, the former United States Representative from Virginia; Robert Sproull, president of the University of Rochester, and Vernon Penner and Edwin Cronk, former United States ambassadors.
 Still other free colleges are vocational institutions like Webb Institute in Glen Cove, N.Y., which trains maritime engineers. It pays for itself with income from a hefty endowment.
 At the nation's military academies, the average cost of educating a student -- about $250,000 -- comes from the taxpayers. Selective institutions with demanding physical requirements, the academies -- the Naval Academy at Annapolis, the United States Military Academy (West Point) and the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs -- accept only about 14 percent of the 9,000 to 13,000 students who apply annually.
 Here are profiles of free institutions.
 
Cooper Union
 Although the shorthand description for many schools like Cooper Union may be "tuition-free," administrators like to use the terms "tuition-paid" or "full-tuition scholarship" colleges.
 "We use that term to correct the misapprehension that educating these students doesn't cost anything," said Patrick Keefe, a spokesman for the college in lower Manhattan, which comprises the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture, the Albert Nerken School of Engineering and the School of Art. "It actually costs quite a lot. After 10 years, I still can't believe we manage to pull this off."
 Peter Cooper, one of New York City's most famous entrepreneurs, was a self-educated man who made fortunes in glue, ironworks, railroads and, finally, Jell-O. In 1859, he founded the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art at the top of the Bowery, chosen for the symbolism of its nexus between the wealthy residents of Astor Place and the impoverished residents of the Lower East Side. Cooper Union remains relatively small, with 900 students.
 "The college was set up for the working class and the immigrants of New York, and it still reflects the changing demographics of the city," Mr. Keefe said.
 Cooper Union's financing, said Robert Hawks, vice president of development, is a combination of income from the Union's $170 million endowment, donations and income from the farmland once owned by the Cooper family under what is now the Chrysler Building. The annual operating budget is $25 million, 30 percent of which is covered by the endowment. The dean of admissions, Richard Bory, said application requirements vary among the three schools. All require the SAT, although there is no set minimum score. Art school applicants must submit a portfolio and complete a home test of six or seven projects to be done within a month. Architecture school applicants also take a home test and are assessed on academic performance. The engineering school is the most rigorous, applying a formula that takes into account high school grade point average, SAT (the average combined score for the engineering school is 1400 out of a possible 1600) and the Science SAT II.
 Cooper Union, 30 Cooper Square, New York, N.Y. 10003, (212) 353-4120, admissions@cooper.edu.
 
Deep Springs College
 The college, founded in 1917 by L.L. Nunn, a Colorado mining and hydroelectric power baron who wanted to educate "promising young men," is limited to 26 students, whose average combined SAT score is 1500.
 Students at the college, which is still all male, spend nearly half their time working on its 300-head Hereford cattle ranch, cutting alfalfa for hay, tending dairy cows or vegetable gardens, in addition to taking two or three courses a semester. Last spring, the offerings ranged from math and science to classes with provocative titles like "Shakespeare and Identity in Early Modern Culture" and "Imperialism and Its Relationship to European Culture."
 When Deep Spring students are not studying or working, they are running the college. Two students sit on the 12-member board of trustees; as a group, they consult on the hiring and firing of faculty and administrators and design the curriculum from proposals offered by the faculty.
 When the young men have finished their two years, most transfer to the nation's most prestigious colleges and universities.
 "L.L. Nunn wanted to found a college that would prepare people for lives of service," said Jackson Newell, a Deep Springs alumnus who returned as president of the college more than two years ago. Like many alumni, he is proud of the range and depth of life and work experience the college affords.
"The students here are washing dishes, milking cows, running the library, delivering the mail, fixing the vehicles, even designing the new student residence," he said. "If they were forced to pay and work, it might be difficult. This way, nobody can get lost or feel unneeded. Falling down on the job has immediate consequences." Students are evaluated on the basis of their work and their academic performance.
 The annual operating budget is $800,000, Dr. Newell said, a third of which is contributed by alumni and friends. Income from the $7 million endowment makes up another third, with the remainder coming from a combination of the ranch operation and foundation grants.
 The admissions process is rigorous. In 1996, 214 applicants submitted seven essays apiece, and 40 finalists spent three days at the college in groups of three or four, attending classes and working on the ranch. At the end of the process, which included extensive interviews and an assessment of how well the applicants fit into the college community, 14 students were admitted.

Berea College
 Founded in 1855 by abolitionists who wished to create a racially integrated, coeducational institution, the college, in Berea, Ky., was intended to be accessible to the poorest but most capable students of Appalachia. Berea still puts an income ceiling on all applicants.
 This follows from a "self-conscious decision to make Berea a one-class institution," said Dr. Larry Shinn, the college president. "Many schools are successful at bringing in a wide variety of socio-economic groups, but that creates a different culture. It's a major part of our mission to educate service-oriented leaders for Appalachia and beyond."
 At Berea, the income ceiling for a family of four is $44,000, but the average family income is only $17,500. No one pays tuition, but students who can afford to pay for room and board are asked to do so; others use their Federal Pell grants for that purpose.
 Each of Berea's 1,500 students must work in the noncredit labor program for a minimum of 10 hours a week; labor can include jobs from waiting tables at the college-owned Boone Tavern in downtown Berea or making the homespun brooms that are sold in the college crafts shop.
 Berea applicants are asked to take either the SAT (the college requires a minimum verbal score of 430) or the American College Test (for which the minimum English score is 17).
 Most freshmen score between 20 and 30 on the ACT, while the average combined SAT score is 1090. The college's endowment is $500 million, or nearly $300,000 a student, making Berea 16th in the country in endowment per student. The figure is behind Princeton's $700,000 a student or Harvard's $500,000, but Berea manages frugally so it is able to make ends meet without charging tuition.

College of the Ozarks
 Founded in the same spirit as Berea, the college began in 1906 as an elementary boarding school founded by James Forsythe, a Presbyterian minister who was moved by the plight of rural children who couldn't make the round trip to Point Lookout, Mo., in one day. By the 1950's, the school had become a junior college. In 1963, it became the four-year College of the Ozarks.
 Today, 90 percent of the slots in the freshman class are reserved for students who meet Federal income guidelines, determined by their eligibility for Pell grants. (The remaining 10 percent of the seats go to children of alumni and friends of the college, as well as particularly outstanding students.)
 The college has 1,500 undergraduates. Students pay $2,200 a year for room and board.
 "They can either pay the room and board fee up front," said a spokeswoman, Camille Howell. "Or they can work it off during the summer. Many of them work in the tourist industry in Branson, which is a mecca for country-music lovers."
 Although the college has a liberal-arts core curriculum, some of the most popular offerings include education, aviation science (there is a nearby airport) and agriculture, because of the college-owned dairy and beef farm on campus. The college reviews applicants' high-school transcripts and scores on the ACT (which most applicants take) or the SAT. The average ACT score for freshmen is 21.
 The school's endowment is $157 million, which is augmented by annual fund raising and many bequests, as well as alumni donations.

Webb Institute
 After Princeton, Webb Institute in Glen Cove, N.Y., is the richest institution in the country in terms of endowment per student. Its location on the coastline of Long Island is well suited to the institution's mission, to train marine designers.
 The college was founded in 1889 by William Webb, a shipbuilding magnate who wanted to make the United States maritime industry competitive with European shipbuilders. He provided an endowment at the time of $9 million; it is now $53 million. The undergraduate program has 86 students who study naval architecture and marine engineering.
 "Webb saw that the next generation of shipbuilders would be working in iron and steel, and that it would take more than an apprenticeship to train them," said Bill Murray, a spokesman. "We graduate design engineers involved in the full spectrum of the marine industry, everything from America's Cup yachts and recreational vessels to tug boats, barges, container and cargo ships and off-shore platform design."
 Webb Institute's endowment is $600,000 a student. There is no tuition, but students pay $6,050 for room and board each year. Half of the annual $3.3 million operating budget is met by endowment income, with the remainder from friends, parents, alumni, grants and miscellaneous sources, including film producers who have used the waterfront mansion that houses the institute for location shooting. Webb's recent Hollywood appearances include "Batman Forever" and the forthcoming "Great Expectations."
 The institute looks for students with a demonstrated interest in engineering. Minimum SAT scores are 500 verbal and 650 math. From 70 to 100 annual applicants, the institute selects 30 to 35 finalists, who are all interviewed by the president before a freshman class of 22 to 25 is selected.

Military Academies
 The three military academies financed by the Defense Department offer not only a tuition-free education but also a monthly salary ($558) and free medical and dental care. The quid pro quo is a minimum of five year's service in the United States armed forces.
 Entry requirements for all three include a physical fitness test, a medical examination and either the SAT or the ACT, as well as an official nomination from a member of the applicant's state Congressional delegation.
 
United States Military Academy
 West Point was founded in 1802 when Thomas Jefferson was President, and some aspects of campus life now remain nearly as Spartan as they must have been then: dormitory rooms with two single beds, two wooden desks, two dressers and no added amenities. Training at the academy runs from physical to academic; discipline comes first, last and foremost. For those who qualify, however, admission at the United States Military Academy means an instant career path and access to an influential alumni network.
 The academy insists there is no minimum SAT scores required for admission; however, the average combined SAT score is 1300.

United States Air Force Academy
 Established in Colorado Springs, in the foothills of the Rockies, in 1954, the Air Force Academy enrolls 4,000. The freshman class is 1,200, 12 percent of whom are women. Freshmen undergo a six-week basic training program before the academic year begins.
 Academy graduates receive both a bachelor of science degree in one of 30 majors and a reserve commission as a second lieutenant in the Air Force. In addition to academic subjects, all cadets are required to take courses in the fundamentals of flight and navigation; they must also study either parachuting or soaring. A flight screening program is required of aspiring pilots.
 The minimum scores required for admission are 580 verbal and 560 math on the SAT, or 25 on the math and science parts of the ACT and 24 on the English and reading tests.

United States Naval Academy
 The academy, founded in 1845, lies between the south bank of the Severn River and downtown Annapolis. Amid the tree-lined brick walks and French Renaissance architecture, the newest facilities include the Nimitz Library, with half a million volumes; the Rickover Hall engineering complex, and the Hendrix Oceanography Laboratory.
 Courses are taught by a mixed faculty of 600 civilian and military instructors, with majors offered in 18 subject areas. In addition, naval cadets are trained in seamanship and navigation tactics, naval engineering, naval weapons and military law. They spend part of each summer training at naval bases and on board ships in the United States fleet.
 Annapolis admissions officers favor students with a strong high school backgrounds in math and science. An academy spokesman said that most students accepted for admission have scored above 22 in English and 26 in math on the ACT or 530 verbal and 600 math on the SAT.

When Mothers Work
 Loving Our Children
 Without Sacrificing Our Selves.
 By Joan K. Peters.
 251 pp. Reading, Mass.:
 Addison-Wesley. $24. 
 Having a baby changes a woman forever. We accept this truth almost reflexively. We believe that it's wonderful and fulfilling -- a fine thing for a woman to take her place as the chief parent in the child-centered family we believe is optimal for mothers, fathers, children, nation. That's the paradigm. No matter what a woman's professional or personal life before she becomes a mother, from now on she will strive to be the ultimate authority and caregiver, the bedrock of domestic life, the loving disciplinarian on whom everyone relies.
But is it good that motherhood should be so transforming? Is it inevitable? "When Mothers Work," Joan K. Peters's passionate and convincing study of American parenting, says it is not. Her smart, clear look at contemporary mothers' lives reveals an entrenched, lopsided and dysfunctional system in which "most women make more than the necessary changes when they have children," while "most men make none." And nobody -- not even men, according to Peters -- benefits.
As a culture, we tend to make conscience of duty. Child rearing has to be done, and mothers, our society assumes, are highly motivated to care for their children. Ergo, women should be the primary caregivers in the home. Peters, a journalist and novelist, says that this syllogism is wrong on all counts: a dangerous myth that damages children almost as much as it imprisons women. Not only does Peters suggest that mom-as-linchpin-of-family "may be among the least sensible child-rearing arrangements civilization has come up with thus far," she also argues that mothers "should work outside the home. If they do not, they cannot preserve their identities or raise children" who are both independent and family-oriented. But, as Peters adds, "women can do so successfully only if men take half the responsibility for child care."
Peters's insistence on the importance of mothers retaining full involvement in their lives outside the home is her most original contribution to the large, contradictory and tendentious literature of late-20th-century parenting. We "have created the kind of motherhood," Peters writes, "that threatens mothers and children alike and still leaves fathers out of the loop." The "austere maternal ideal," she observes, of the "ever-present, always responsive" mother -- a phrase coined by the psychologist and child-rearing guru Penelope Leach, for whom Peters has considerable scorn -- makes us reluctant to examine "why we give up so much when we become mothers" or to ask why the most highly motivated, loving mothers often engage in a kind of zealous "overparenting" that actually "takes away from children's self-importance, from their ability to take responsibility for their own happiness." In our culture, Peters contends, "better our own families fail than the myth" of the superiority of mothering to parenting shared with fathers and "othermothers," her term for the constellation of relatives, friends and paid caregivers who can help parents raise their children.
"When Mothers Work" doesn't just blame men for women's troubles. Change to a more equitable and satisfying system, Peters maintains, must start with mothers themselves. From this, she argues, will flow what our society really needs: more respect for parents, more flexible and family-friendly workplaces, and happier, healthier children. She offers a convincing argument for dethroning children from their regal position in the family and for giving everyone shared responsibility for the emotional and logistical economy of the home. In short, we should create family setups in which everyone participates and different parenting styles can overlap -- not baffling children but enriching their awareness of the lovely variety of supportive and warm relationships that nurture and serve their parents as well as themselves.
But no one, according to Peters, is more attached to the old way of doing things than the stressed-out, exhausted mother. "It is easier for men to take on the nurturing of children than for women to give up some of it," she says. "The greatest emotional challenge for women is to allow men to nurture children in their own manner, not simply as assistants to mothers." Why is it so hard for mothers to give up the role of the sole essential parent? Because, Peters argues, at every level of society -- from women's own mothers to the courts -- cultural attitudes make it difficult for women to express any ambivalence toward parenting. "Telling the truth about mothering -- when it does not refer to the oneness and bliss -- means breaking the rules."
When children are unhappy, pick fights with their classmates or have trouble learning to read, people tend to assume that mothers are at fault. They are the ones who invariably end up assuming responsibility for slapping together lunch sandwiches; they are the ones whom the school nurses call and who rush to the school; who typically get up at 2 A.M. to provide comfort to their children. Our knowledge that most mothers will get the job done no matter what has led society to believe that it's right that they do -- despite abundant evidence, cited by Peters, that fathers can nurture wonderfully, if differently from their wives, and that children thrive so long as they develop loving attachments to adults.
Peters isn't suggesting that mothers should refuse to extend themselves for their children's well-being: parenthood has always required sacrifice. Time, sleep and peace of mind -- not to mention dinners at restaurants and nights at the movies -- get sidelined, at least for a while, when a baby enters the family. Everyone knows that, and no one wants children to suffer. They don't have to: in Peters's practically delineated egalitarian society, everyone wins, provided that child rearing is truly shared.
What's more, this new structure can "bolster the parts of the self that society and our families may not have supported," like "female independence and male nurturing." Although women can demand that business be more responsive to mothers' needs -- by providing on-site child care or flexible working hours -- more systematic change will occur, Peters says, once men "take on their fair share of domestic responsibility and therefore feel the same pressure that women do to find humane work."
When 50-50 division of labor is agreed upon before there are children on the scene, and such a plan is adopted unreservedly, even fathers who feel unprepared for active parenting will rise to the occasion, Peters promises. As equal partners with their spouses, they'll give their lucky kids the benefit of two parents -- as opposed to the "1i that most mother-reared children have."
The first step toward this inviting future is enormous and scary: women have to accept men as equal parents. This may be the hardest task of all. When it comes to self-sacrifice, mothers from Dr. Leach to Mrs. Portnoy believe that "not only do mothers gladly give up their lives for their children, but that their children's happiness requires that sacrifice." For a mother to examine that sacrifice closely and, perhaps, to decide not to make it, is a frightening but ultimately liberating prospect. Peters's own husband, she says, is a good parent partly because he's free of this terror: "He is not afraid of being a
'bad mother.' "
Peters makes a point that is interesting and true -- and that should have been self-evident eons ago: that responsible adults who are happy and fulfilled themselves make better parents than isolated, frustrated ones. Child rearing today, she writes, is an unsatisfying, unworkable system and serves the needs of no one. What she proposes in its place is brilliant and radical: a kind of unified field theory of successful parenting. Our children's happiness and wholeness, women's fulfillment and the creation of a more sensitive, supportive and dependable society and government -- all rely, in Peters's view, on fathers becoming equal partners with mothers in the parenting process. It's as simple -- and as complicated -- as that.
"We no longer have a problem that has no name," she declares. "Most women know exactly what the problem is: men have to do half the child care, and schools should be better, work more humane and child care subsidized." But before any of these far-off developments can be realized, we have to learn "how to be different parents." Peters's book is an excellent place to start.

 BODY:

PROSPECT: The Journey of an Artist
By Anne Truitt. Penguin, $12.95.
Now in her 70's, a successful sculptor examines her life, analyzing the joy she finds in creation and the vulnerability she still feels when she exhibits her work. In 1996 our reviewer, Rebecca Pepper Sinkler, said that this memoir "suggests meaning where meaning is not apparent -- as in ordinary life -- and so teaches us as much about ourselves as about its author."
 
SELECTED POEMS, 1947-1995
By Allen Ginsberg. Harper Perennial, $18.
This volume, which was published only six months before the poet's death last spring, includes, as he wrote, "what I deem most honest, most penetrant of my writing." It runs the gamut from early rhyming poems to angry reflections on recent American politics and culture. Reviewing Ginsberg's "Collected Poems" in these pages in 1984, Lewis Hyde wrote that young poets may find in Ginsberg's work "the instruments by which to enter the tradition that seeks to free what Whitman called 'howls restrain'd by decorum.' " For an evocative portrait of the poet in the 1960's, there is ALLEN GINSBERG IN AMERICA, by Jane Kramer (Fromm, $14.95), now restored to print with a new introduction by the author. It is "written with affectionate sympathy," Kenneth Rexroth said here in 1969.
 
ANDORRA
By Peter Cameron. Plume, $12.95.
The Andorra of this novel is as much an imaginary country as a real one, the refuge of the narrator, Alexander Fox, from a dark past. "Cameron steers us through . . . Alex's story with an unfaltering hand," Margot Livesey wrote in the Book Review in 1996.
 
WHEN WORK DISAPPEARS:
The World of the New Urban Poor
By William Julius Wilson. Vintage, $13.
The author argues that it is joblessness, not racism, that is most responsible for the dependence on welfare in America's ghettos. Low-paying but dependable factory jobs for unskilled workers have steadily disappeared as the United States economy has become both more global and more high-tech. In 1996 our reviewer, Sean Wilentz, said that Wilson "successfully refutes conservative cliches about the poor as lazy parasites." A changing system is also the culprit in THE END OF AFFLUENCE: The Causes and Consequences of America's Economic Dilemma, by Jeffrey Madrick (Random House, $12). From 1973 to 1993, the author observes, American economic growth slowed as flexible production replaced mass production and as Europe and Japan grew more competitive. Madrick's book "is important for economists, but accessible to general readers," Louis Uchitelle said here in 1995.
 
THE CATTLE KILLING
By John Edgar Wideman.
Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
This novel centers on a historical incident: the epidemic of yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793, when race and class partly determined who died and who lived. Narrated in disparate vignettes and dreamlike episodes by a young black minister, the book is like "a rug of shimmering but also perplexing suggestiveness," Sven Birkerts wrote in these pages in 1996.
 
EDOUARD MANET: Rebel in a Frock Coat
By Beth Archer Brombert.
University of Chicago, $19.95.
Excoriated for paintings deemed immoral and obscene, Manet rejected the art of his day yet was also determined to be accepted by both salon critics and bourgeois society. This portrait of his contradictory life is an "engrossing, smartly written biography," James R. Mellow said in the Book Review in 1996.
 
PIG
By Andrew Cowan. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $12.
The narrator, a 15-year-old working-class English boy, takes on a project that seems doomed to failure: to save the abandoned cottage, vegetable garden and aging sow that belonged to his grandparents. In 1996 our reviewer, James Saynor, called the novel "as strange and surprising, in its way, as 'The Catcher in the Rye.' "
 
PIANO PIECES
By Russell Sherman.
North Point/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12.
A renowned pianist and self-confessed curmudgeon, the author discusses classical music (which he loves) and contemporary culture (which he hates) in a series of essays. Writing in The New York Times in 1996, Edward Rothstein said the book "gives further insight into what makes his art distinctive."
 
SANTA EVITA
By Tomas Eloy Martinez. Translated by Helen Lane. Vintage International, $14.
Eva Peron was the mistress of self-invention, creating an image her followers loved. In this novel Martinez, who grew up under the Peron regime, treats "Evita's life and death . . . with a dazzling array of literary devices," Nicolas Shumway said here in 1996.
 
HUMPTY DUMPTY: An Oval
By Damon Knight. Tor/Tom Doherty, $13.95.
The narrator has been shot in the head, and the bullet seems to have rent reality as well as his skull. "Funny and disturbing," this novel "invites comparison to the most accomplished works of Philip K. Dick," Gerald Jonas said here in 1996. Laurel Graeber

HEADLINE: ART;
Korean Art, Inventive, Intricate, Meticulous.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
IN recent years Koreans, artists and dealers alike, have been making very visible inroads into the American art world.
Unlike the art of some other Asian cultures, that from Korea has no obvious uniting feature, except that it is reliably inventive, intricate and meticulous. These qualities are reflected in the elaborate and entertaining work by 10 artists who live and work mainly in Korea that Zina Davis has orchestrated at the Joseloff Gallery, at the University of Hartford in West Hartford. 
 The show, "Ancient Traditions/ New Forms," grew out of a conversation between Ms. Davis and Tai Koo Kim, the architect who designed the Joseloff Gallery. Mr. Kim has offices in Hartford and in Seoul, where he designed the National Museum of Contemporary Art, modeled on aspects of a traditional Korean village. The upshot of their talk was that Ms. Davis went to Korea in June to pick her show. She often relied on her own judgment, turning down suggestions. Without knowing what she rejected, this viewer can say that her instincts have served her well.
Another realization is that timing is everything. The planning and opening of the exhibition all happened before the eruption of the monetary crisis that has recently devastated the Korean economy. Nothing this lavish could have been mounted if the show were just opening.
A perennial problem nearer home is that the Joseloff Gallery is a difficult space; it frequently overwhelms the art in it. This time the art fights back. Soon after entering the space, a viewer is assaulted by two waves of pink.
The first is provided by three enormous paintings of lotus flowers by Hong Joo Kim. The lotus is, of course, an important symbol throughout Asia, and Mr. Kim's magnification of it relates it to enlarged Pop Art flowers by American artists like Jack Youngerman and Lowell Nesbitt. Because it is so closely observed, one might also think of Audubon. But their flowers don't have the exalted meaning that the lotus does, and for that reason these flowers -- one a closed bud, the second fully open and symmetrical, and the third on the way to closing again -- are knock-outs.
Mr. Kim's is a natural pink; then comes Suk-Nam Yun's "Pink Room," a blinding sugary pink installation. The main three-dimensional feature is a French period-style settee elevated off the floor by twisted metal spikes attached to the bottoms of the legs; the same menacing prongs also spring from the upholstery. On the settee is a pink plank of wood on which is painted a partial face and at a distance is a rudimentary standing figure. The seated figure is reputedly an image of Ms. Yun's mother who was the inspiration for the work. It is a classic confrontation with psychological underpinnings that aren't difficult to seek, as the spikes amid the sweetness remind the viewer.
Jeong-Hwa Choi has a reputation as a rebel, Ms. Davis says. Even jaded American viewers can admit that there's something audacious about a metallic pyramid structure with 25 plastic pigs' heads mounted in niches on its face; each head is surrounded by plastic fruit and flowers, like ritual offerings. The heads light up in random groups, but Mr. Choi surely doesn't think he's providing enlightenment. Admittedly glorifications of kitsch are old hat, but when choreographed so precisely, they're giddily captivating.
Hyun-Ki Park's ingenious video installation may remind American viewers of Nam June Paik, and the enormous influence his installations, almost all of which incorporated television sets, had on artists in the United States. He proved that video art doesn't have to be boring, and Mr. Park gives a rousing second to that opinion with his electronic mandala projected on the gallery floor. Its theme is tantric yoga, which, in short, holds that sex is the most efficient path to enlightenment. Mr. Park's mandala throbs, with split-second images appearing kaleidoscopically. Snippets of photographed sex acts merge with and separate from religious deities.
These four artists provide the show stoppers. But what makes the exhibition a rounded and satisfying experience is the quieter work surrounding the spectacles.
Ho-Deuk Kim's handsome large-scale ink drawings that evoke water have overtones of traditional calligraphy and the hallowed brush stroke of Abstract Expressionism.
Bien-U Bai's large photograph of a stand of slender trees is amazing because it's all photograph, though enhanced in the darkroom. Some of the thin intensely black forms that run through the composition have the force of those traditionally made with ink and a brush.
Ki-Won Park is an abstract painter represented by dark paintings reminiscent of Barnett Newman. His all-over nuanced color seems to slowly move across three panels.
Hanging across from the lotus triptych is a huge, fragile, almost evanescent copper wire leaf by Kwang-Ho Cheong. It is all a map of veins, with no body to it, ultimately a glorification of emptiness. The opposite of the three lotuses are three giant pears painted on a surface of layers of advertising posters that Jong-Hak Kim ripped from walls. He painted the aggregate black, and then added the fruit as if to domesticate the chaos of the layers of posters. The complex paintings of Yeo-Hyun Kwon couple large areas of abstraction with humble and tender vignettes of family life.
Ms. Davis says that she found no overtly political art on her trip, and the show, for all of its acrobatics, seems to confirm a traditional allegiance to hearth, home, nature and Buddhism.
"Ancient Traditions/New Forms" will reopen on Jan. 6 and continue through Jan. 20 at the Joseloff Gallery at the University of Hartford.

HEADLINE: The Lives They Lived: Leo Rosten;
Talking Tachlis

BYLINE: By Wendy Wasserstein; Wendy Wasserstein is a playwright whose works include "An American Daughter" and "The Heidi Chronicles."

 BODY:
b. 1908 Leo Rosten probably made Seinfeld safe for TV and bagels acceptable on the Delta Shuttle. Although Rosten was primarily a humorist, his larger purpose was to help us understand our social selves.
In our house, Yiddish was the language of the old country, specifically Poland, and therefore the one that the "kinder" didn't understand. My brother Bruce and I sought to decode secret transmissions by signing him up for high-school German. 
 In German class, however, my brother didn't learn exactly what was meant by the "naches" our Aunt Florence got from her son Alan reading the Encyclopedia Britannica. Happily, in his most famous book, "The Joys of Yiddish, Leo Rosten explained that Aunt Florence didn't mean a corn chip with a jalapeno cheese sauce. Those were "nachos." Rather, she meant naches, or "proud pleasure; special joy -- particularly from the achievements of a child." When "The Joys of Yiddish arrived at our house, I was already a freshman at Mount Holyoke College, a place from which a mother could still "shep naches, the active form of pursuing them, but which definitely upped the stakes for a nice Jewish girl marrying a gentile, or "shaygets." Although by that time my parents had fewer friends who could converse in Yiddish, the colloquialisms had become part of all our daily lives.
During the late 60's, when I was threatening to join the Venceremos Brigade to Cuba or, even worse, apply to drama school, my dad would take me aside and say, "Wendy, I want to talk tachlis with you." Thanks to Leo Rosten, I knew my Dad wanted to "get down to brass tacks." Therefore, I would avoid him and shrug: "I won't talk 'topless' to you. Ask your wife!
Leo Rosten was my friend. He would be my fairy godfather in a Catskills nightclub when I couIdn't understand the punch line of a Myron Cohen joke. I imagined him to be a cross between a beaming Yiddish Noah Webster and a gemutlich Samuel Johnson. In truth, Leo Rosten, like the language he defined, was not so easy to catalogue. He had a doctorate in political science from the University of Chicago and did postgraduate study at the London School of Economics. In addition to his book on Yiddish etymology, Rosten wrote several screenplays and one of the first sociological examinations of Hollywood. During the Depression he taught English as a second language, which inspired his classic comic novel, "The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N."
What Leo Rosten accomplished was to make the world of our mothers and fathers accessible not only to us but also to others. His attempts to define "Yinglish" and "Ameridish" were so successful that today Midwestern radio announcers far away from anyone who was ever fluent in Yiddish regularly "kvetch," or complain, about their "mishegoss" and problems. It's not uncommon to overhear a dowager at Tiffany's admit she's looking for that perfect wedding "tchotchke," or knickknack. But what our Yiddish Webster understood was that the language wasn't simply for caricature or for graceful one-liners, but that it was a language that expressed love, great sadness and, most important, all of life's ironic texture.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Unabashedly Continental With Feeling

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY 

 BODY:
RESTAURANTS that have opened in recent years on the Island tend to be narrow, specialized, targeted. They are not Italian anymore but Tuscan, Sardinian or Sicilian. American spots often define themselves as Californian or Southwestern. It is therefore a mild surprise to find that Hugo's, a newly opened restaurant in the Southdown Shopping Center in Huntington, is unabashedly Continental.
The menu has listings in Italian, French and English. New York sirloin, pollo scarpariello and l'assiette de veau au chatelaine all rub shoulders. The keen-eyed may spot a Spanish paella or even notice the restaurant's Argentine connection. 
 Its owner, Hugo Garcia, is from Argentina and proud of it. A logo of tango dancers can be found on the menu, the business card and even etched in a decorative window at the restaurant's entrance. Coffee-table books on Argentina and the tango are artfully arranged in the front window.
No one will be more surprised by Hugo's than patrons of Nina's, the former restaurant at this location. Nina's was a casual, 26-year-old, neighborhood favorite. Hugo's is a formal, white linen spot with draped poof shades, gold-framed mirrors, a spectacular chandelier and vases that hold a single, xotic bloom on each table.
Hugo's prices are at least as upscale as the surroundings. More than half of the meat and fish entrees cost more than $20. Pastas are more reasonable, tagged at $12.95 to $18.95. The most common price for appetizers is $9.95; a couple are $12.95. Soups and salads are a bit more economical. The lobster bisque, a creamy mahogany brew loaded with seafood, is a standout at $5.95.
Mr. Garcia, who is also the maitre d'hotel, lights up the dining room. He is well known in Huntington, having been a waiter for many years at various restaurants. He greets numerous diners as old friends but also makes first-timers feel special. When we admired the chandelier, he offered the manufacturer's brochure. Our enthusiasm for the flavored oil, served with the bread, elicited his mother's recipe (grape seed oil imported from Argentina, chopped parsley and whole garlic cloves).
He also has a generous spirit. On each visit we were offered a complimentary after-dinner drink (as were many tables around us). An appetizer of escargots boasted six shells, each filled with at least two snails bathed in a terrific brandy-herb-garlic butter. When a diner could not extract one of the snails from the shell, Mr. Garcia whisked out a plate of six more.
The sturdy Italian bread is a great accompaniment for those fantastic escargots. Another fine starter was a special of mushrooms filled with a light seafood mixture glazed with cheese. Also special were bruschetta topped with tomatoes and crab.
Less rewarding were a too-vinegary seafood salad, a seafood crepe that was tasty but diminished by the mushy texture of its filling, and clams and oysters Rockefeller that were overloaded with spinach.
The best salad sampled was the classic Caesar. Grilled vegetables with a centerpiece of portobello mushroom was skimpy, and its melted goat cheese topper was crumbly not creamy. Also less than abundant was a composed salad of sliced beets, potatoes, green beans and hard-boiled egg.
Top picks at entree time are the marinated lamb chops in a Madeira wine and porcini mushroom sauce, the impressive veal chop stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto and crowned with shiitake mushrooms, the combination of grilled pork tenderloin and rosemary-scented chicken breast and the velvety filet mignon topped with a dab of Dijon mustard sauce and a sprinkling of pink and green peppercorns.
Also earning high marks were the creamy risotto covered with an avalanche of wild mushrooms and a special of flaky Chilean sea bass in a light broth flavored with tomato.
Skip the penne alla vodka harboring overcooked shrimp, and the lobster tail weighed down by a gummy crab-meat stuffing.
Most of the desserts are made elsewhere but are of good quality. The creamy cheesecake, rich Mississippi mud cake and addictive cappuccino pie with toffee crust were the favorites at our table.
Wines are less expensive than food. There are 75 of them, running from $18 to $215. Most are in the teens, 20's and 30's, including little-seen selections from Argentina, South Africa and Spain. Try the fleshy 1995 Rodney Strong Old Vines zinfandel ($28) with its explosively ripe fruit. The only Long Island wine here is made from local chardonnay grapes in upstate Washingtonville. It is a 1996 Little Cobb Road ($18) that is bold, rich and appley.

HEADLINE: Are H.O.V. Lanes Speeding the Rush-Hour Traffic?

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
THE high occupancy vehicle lanes on the Long Island Expressway can be great when they work and frustrating when they do not, said Gerald S. Schwartz, president of G. S. Schwartz & Company, a public relations business.
"I live in Manhattan but have a home in Quogue and many clients on Long Island," Mr. Schwartz said. "So I am on the Long Island Expressway quite a bit and I use the H.O.V. lane a tremendous amount. 
 Overall, he said, traffic moves faster today than it did 30 years ago, when the expressway was known as the world's largest parking lot. "During the rush hours," Mr. Schwartz added, "traffic moves at a good clip in the H.O.V. lane, traveling at 55 or 60 miles an hour, while traffic to the right does no more than 50."
Business groups, traffic experts and the state agree that the lanes have been beneficial in moving rush-hour traffic, encouraging car pooling and reducing the number of cars on the road.
But drivers who travel in the regular lanes -- one driver in a car -- fail to see much difference, since their lanes remain clogged. And some Long Islanders, among them David E. Lerner of Jericho, president of the investment firm David Lerner Associates in Syosset, object to the use of tax dollars to build restricted lanes.
"The state creates a terrible inconvenience while building these lanes with my tax dollars and then tells me I can't use the road when I drive alone," said Mr. Lerner. "That's wrong from a legal and moral point of view."
He argued that H.O.V. lanes were outdated because they were a brainchild of traffic engineering in 1973. "We're not having an oil crisis where the price of gasoline is forcing people to car pool," Mr. Lerner said. "And they are making the assumption that people on Long Island work in factories that shut down at 4:15, let people wash up and leave.
"We live in a service area that does not run from 9 to 5. If my employees were to run out at 5, I'd have a problem. The service industry does not lend itself to car pooling."
He added: "The vast majority of cars on the road carry one person, and that is what people want."
The lanes, 12 miles in both directions between Exit 49 at Route 112 and Exit 57 at Route 454, opened in May 1994. Only cars with two or more people, as well as buses can use the lanes. Traffic in the lanes has increased 6 percent a year since they opened, in line with expectations, according to Wayne R. Ugolik, director of travel demand management for the Long Island region of the State Transportation Department.
"We have not done any areawide studies," Mr. Ugolik said. "But in surveys of H.O.V.-lane users taken in early 1997 we estimated that at least 10,000 people formed some sort of ride sharing for some of their trips in order to use the H.O.V. lanes. And there were more than 100,000 people in car pools on Long Island already, formed by people who live and work in Nassau and Suffolk.
"National surveys have shown that car pooling as a national trend has gone down since the late 80's. But in areas where there are H.O.V. lanes that trend has been reversed."
Mr. Ugolik said new figures showed that in "peak usage hours there are 1,000 car pools and buses carrying about 2,500 people at the speed limit, compared to 1,900 people carried in a general purpose lane."
"People have a misimpression about the H.O.V. lanes because they do not see as many cars using them and therefore they think they are not popular," he added. "But what is important is the number of people using those lanes. The lanes are managed to make sure cars travel at the speed limit, because if they did not there would be no incentive to car pool."
Because of the perceived success of the H.O.V. lanes, the state is extending them eight miles west, to Exit 40 at Route 25. The state plans to open that section in the summer.
The eastern end of the lanes are planned to be extended 10 miles, to Exit 64 at Route 112, the next year.
"By late 1999 there should be 32 miles of H.O.V. lanes in place, one lane in each direction," Mr. Ugolik said. "By the year 2004 another 10 miles of H.O.V. lanes should be opened between Exits 40 and 30, the interchange with the Cross Island Expressway."
Several legislators from Queens, however, are challenging the plans in court, contending that extending the lanes would create congestion and inconvenience for Queens residents and benefit only Long Islanders.
Mr. Ugolik said Gov. George E. Pataki's decision in October to scrap plans to build an H.O.V. lane on Interstate 287 in Westchester "in no way means H.O.V. lanes aren't successful or warranted in other parts of the state."
Mr. Pataki said people feared that an H.O.V. lane on the Cross Westchester Expressway would have had "negative economic and environmental impacts, while further dividing the community over how to solve its traffic problems."
Mr. Ugolik noted that the Westchester lane would have been reversible, unlike those on the L.I.E., meaning that it would have been more complicated to operate.
The American Automobile Association said a survey conducted a year after the lanes opened had found use "well above acceptable levels," according to an A.A.A. traffic engineer, Mark Kulewicz.
"Our expectation is that it would take a period of time for H.O.V. to build up a head of steam and grow in usage," Mr. Kulewicz said. "We expect -- and there is nothing to make us think otherwise -- that it will carry more and more people as it is accepted and extended east and west. The longer the lane the more attractive it is to potential users and the larger the area it can draw from."
Mr. Kulewicz said he did not foresee further widening of the expressway despite continued building and resulting additional traffic.
"There has been a tremendous population growth on Long Island since the 1960's," he said. "But the roads have not kept up at all. We see H.O.V. as a compromise solution to the traffic nightmare we face on Long Island. We view it as a chance to add capacity, which is clearly mandated because of what cars do to air quality, the quality of life and mobility."
Mr. Kulewicz added that the state was studying introducing H.O.V. lanes on the Southern State and Meadowbrook State Parkways.
A vice president of the Long Island Association, Mitchell H. Pally, said: "We think that when fully completed, they will provide a meaningful alternative and reduce the number of vehicles which would otherwise be on the expressway. When the lanes are extended next year, that will be the real test, because it will give more and more people an opportunity to use them for an extended period of time.
"H.O.V. not only provides a benefit to those who use it, it eases congestion in the general-use lanes. If you just opened the H.O.V. lane to everyone all the time there would be no benefit. We're trying to move people, not vehicles."
Mr. Kulewicz pointed out that H.O.V. lanes were highly popular in other regions. The Katy Freeway in Houston, a city with an extensive H.O.V. network, increased the minimum number of riders, from two to three, because the H.O.V. lanes were becoming congested.
"If we could double the use of the H.O.V. lane on the L.I.E.," he said, "it would do a lot to making a dent in our traffic problem. Looking into a crystal ball, we anticipate that ride sharing will flourish over time."
State and Federal money subsidizes the so-called 110 Clipper, an express bus that begins picking up riders in Selden and drops them off at industrial parks along Route 110 after using the H.O.V. lanes. Suffolk County Transit operates the line from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M. and charges $1.50. There are no monthly or weekly tickets.
"The 38-mile trip takes 50 minutes from start to finish," the county's Director of Transportation Operations, Gerald V. Cronin, said.
The service, which shaves about 15 minutes from a trip without the high-occupancy lanes, started with three passengers in January 1996 and now carries 60 to 70 a day, Mr. Cronin said.
The operation, with subsidies of $500,000 a year, is to continue through at least next year. Extending the H.O.V. lanes could lead to new subsidized bus routes, Mr. Cronin added.
The state, Mr. Ugolik said, could take a year and a half to evaluate the express buses.
Mr. Schwartz, who said he used the H.O.V. lanes frequently, said he was annoyed by drivers who used the lane when they travel alone.
The Transportation Department pays a special group of officers to patrol the lane after their usual shifts. Five officers work during the operating hours, from 6 A.M. to 10 and 3 P.M. to 8. The number of summonses has increased in recent months, after having steadily declined after the first 12 months of operation, according to Lieut. Larry E. Fuller of the Suffolk County police who is in charge of the highway patrol unit on the Long Island Expressway.
"It's hard to pinpoint a cause for the change, because in each 12-month period we assigned a different number of people to patrol the lane," Lieutenant Fuller said. "I feel that people simply comply to a point, and then the numbers pick up again."
The police figures show that the number of accidents in H.O.V. lanes is significantly lower than the other lanes.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
Next Role for Otto Kahn's 126-Room Mansion: a Spa

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: COLD SPRING HILLS

 BODY:
IT is the second largest private residence ever built in the United States. Yet the 109,000-square-foot French chateau-style castle known as Oheka, which stands high on a hill here off Jericho Turnpike, is in so secluded a setting that even many local residents are unaware that it's there. Surrounding it is an enclave of about 300 houses and a 168-acre golf course.
Only the 175,000-square-foot Biltmore House in Asheville, N.C., built by George W. Vanderbilt in 1895 and turned into a thriving museum, surpasses Oheka in size. Now, after years of uncertainty and controversy, this 126-room Long Island landmark, which Otto H. Kahn, a financier and patron of the arts, built in 1917, also has a more hopeful future. 
 Last month, following a public hearing, the five-member Huntington town board voted unanimously in favor of allowing Gary Melius of Carle Place, who holds a 114-year lease on the property, to turn it into a 50-suite luxury health spa. A small portion of the building will be permanently set aside as a history and exhibit area open to the public.
Without that approval, the building, once ravaged by vandals but now partially restored at a cost of $15 million, might have faced the same vandalized fate again because its vast size makes it economically impractical for most uses.
Mr. Melius said $20 million was needed to complete the restoration work. The building also costs $500,000 annually, including $110,000 for taxes, to maintain.
Built of concrete and steel with walls that are 3 to 5 feet thick, the mansion -- designated a landmark in 1991 -- would cost millions to tear down.
Most neighbors -- whose homes were built on land once owned by Mr. Kahn -- supported allowing a commercial enterprise to move into their residential community, although there were dissenters who said it would bring additional traffic and noise.
"To allow Oheka to be vandalized once again was unthinkable," said Karen Friel, the chairwoman of the 197-member Cold Spring Hills Civic Association.
The civic group sent the town board 324 petitions from surrounding homeowners supporting Mr. Melius's commercial-use application. At the public hearing, 18 people spoke against the application.
"It's a very special structure with a unique identity on Long Island as well as in the nation, and it's right in the heart of our neighborhood," Mrs. Friel said. "Of course there were concerns over traffic, but some commercial use had to go there or the building might have been lost."
THE Kahn estate originally consisted of 443 acres, which included a private 18-hole golf course, a farm, a race track and even an airstrip. Only 23 acres remain with the house. The golf course was bought by the private Cold Spring Country Club, and 256 acres were developed for housing.
"It was our mission to save the castle and to ensure that it remains open to the public for generations," said Edward J. Owen, who is president of Friends of Oheka, a group formed two and a half years ago independently of the developer to find ways to save the building.
Mr. Owen, a former assistant town attorney for Huntington, said he was motivated because "the minute I walked in, I fell in love with the place."
In today's dollars, Oheka cost over $100 million to build. "There is no one alive who has the inclination to spend that kind of money on a house, not even Bill Gates" of Microsoft, he added.
He said he and his group helped save the castle by prevailing on the town to pass a historic overlay district ordinance adopted in 1996 that permits owners of historically significant residential properties on 15 or more acres to apply for them to be used commercially.
Two other examples of adaptive re-uses of large residences in Huntington, Coindre Hall in Huntington and the Vanderbilt Museum in Centerport, are publicly owned and must be supported by taxpayers.
"We think we have developed a model solution to problems like Oheka," Mr. Owen said. "You give a private owner the right to engage in a specifically-defined commercial use to generate the kind of funds needed to restore and maintain these exceedingly expensive mansions of a bygone era.
"In exchange, the owner gives public access to at least some portion of the building so that future generations can learn of the life style that occurred in the '20's and '30's."
The town imposed conditions to address some of the concerns surrounding homeowners had, said Frank P. Petrone, who is the Town of Huntington supervisor.
For example, traffic patterns, parking, the number of events that can be held and the use of signs are all spelled out. Casino gambling is forbidden. A recent controversy over fire and safety codes was resolved when Mr. Melius installed a $500,000 sprinkler system.
"Huntington is a very historical town, and we pride ourselves on that," Mr. Petrone said. "And had we not worked with Oheka, the surrounding community certainly would have experienced a real problem."
Under an agreed-upon timetable, Mr. Melius must complete a full restoration of the building by 2005. Weddings and other functions, which have been allowed to take place in the building for the last two years on a temporary basis, can still be held, as can designer showcases, while the restoration is under way.
In a showcase, designers are invited to display their talents in a residential building. They leave behind permanent improvements like fixtures, carpeting and wall, ceiling and floor decorations that are usually worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
SHOWCASES will probably be held at Oheka twice a year over the eight years, with designers decorating portions of the building piecemeal starting on the third floor.
Arlene Travis, who with a partner, Carole Aronson, has been running designer showcases in prominent Long Island houses for 26 years, said Oheka would generate national interest because of its size and scale. Their Greenvale company, Mansions & Millionaires, is among those being considered by Mr. Melius to hold the showcases.
Designers would have to be faithful to the building's history, and at the same time keep the future and end use of the building in mind, Mrs. Travis said.
Designed by the architectural firm of Delano & Aldrich, , the three-story mansion sits on an artificially-created hill 90 feet above sea level.
The formal gardens with their reflecting pools were designed by the Olmsted Brothers, landscape architects for many major Long Island estates and sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, one of the designers of Manhattan's Central Park. After Mr. Kahn's death in 1934 the building was sold to the New York City Department of Sanitation, which used it as a rest home for workers. A subsequent purchaser in 1948 was the Eastern Military Academy, which occupied it until 1978 when the school went bankrupt and moved out.
Mr. Melius bought the castle in 1984 for $1.45 million, sold it in 1989 partly restored to a Japanese businessman for $22.5 million, and in 1993 took back control of the building with a 114-year-lease that was conditioned on getting the health spa approval.
Mr. Melius is a commercial and residential developer, but Oheka has become his passion, he said.
Sitting in the library, which has been restored in impeccable detail, Mr. Melius reminisced about the vandalism, the rats and the general decay of the building he bought in 1984.
It took 300 trailer trucks to carry out debris. Four hundred doors and windows had to be replaced. He set up a shop in the building to replicate the missing paneling, moldings, stair and balcony railings, balustrades and other details that had to be replaced. Of the 39 fireplaces in the building, 38 work, but all except two -- including the one in the library -- lost their mantles because of theft or vandalism.
For the slate tiles needed to restore the roof, the developer went to Rising & Nelson in West Pawlet, Vt., the company that sold the original tiles.
Myths persist that Mr. Kahn kept lions in the basement. The cages people thought they saw were 20-foot wide wind tunnels he had built as a natural air-conditioning system.
Among other major rooms already restored is the 70-foot long ballroom where Enrico Caruso once sang for Mr. Kahn, who was chairman of the board of the Metropolitan Opera. The Olmsted-designed gardens and reflecting pools Mr. Kahn created for his castle once again glitter in splendor.
"It's like a great book, a great painting, a great orchestra with which you fall in love," Mr. Melius said.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Park Hill, Yonkers;
Vintage Homes on a 300-Foot Plateau

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
ONE day while driving up Broadway looking for houses, Steven Green, a Manhattan developer, made a right turn and found a neighborhood in Yonkers he had never seen before. "I don't want to make it sound like karma or something," Mr. Green said, "but I don't know what caused me to turn that way."
What he found after his car climbed the steep hill from Broadway was a neighborhood of stately turn-of-the-century homes on winding streets, sitting on a 300-foot plateau one mile back from the Hudson River. Many houses are on the edge of cliffs and have sweeping views overlooking the rest of the city as it slopes down to the water. 
 In his search, Mr. Green found himself in front of a Gothic Revival mansion that just happened to be for sale. "The sign was halfway off its hinges," Mr. Green recalled. "I sat in my car and called the realtor, who came right over."
Five years later, Mr. Green is now something of a legend in Park Hill, a neighborhood of vintage single-family homes east of Broadway in southwest Yonkers. In addition to buying and restoring one of the neighborhood's premier properties, a 12,000-square-foot 21-room mansion, he has bought several other properties and restored them. As head of Green Realty Management Corporation, he also owns several apartment buildings in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan and two shopping centers in Yonkers.
And he is also known for his parties. "This was the first New Year's I didn't have a party since I moved to Park Hill," he said. "Last year, I had 300 people and flew in the Captain and Tennille from Reno. One other year, I had the Boys Choir of Harlem."
Parties, it seems, are never in short supply at Park Hill. "There are numerous gatherings in people's houses every month," Mr. Green said. "It's amazing." The tight-knit community is host to four chamber music concerts a year, held in different homes. Such events, Mr. Green said, give Park Hill its special character. "It's not traditional suburbia," he said. "Here there's really an opportunity for people to get to know each other."
In the early 1980's the neighborhood began attracting artists, filmmakers and others in the arts interested in the large supply of 19th-century houses at reasonable prices and in living in a progressive, diverse community with easy access to Manhattan.
Richard Haas, the muralist, and his wife, Katherine, were among the early artist residents, moving to the neighborhood in 1980. "At that time, there was an elderly population who were all leaving," Mr. Haas said.
The couple had never intended to move to Yonkers or live outside Manhattan. They were renting a loft when they saw an ad for a five-story house, built in 1896, selling for "less than an ugly loft we were looking at in SoHo," Ms. Haas said.
"It was at a down time for Park Hill," Mr. Haas added. "It didn't have the vitality the neighborhood has today. A lot of the houses were in terrible shape. A tremendous amount of people were bailing out. It was a great time for house hunters."
The Haas's house is built on a sheer cliff. An oval sun room, the centerpiece of the main floor, has a sweeping view of the city and the river. "We fell in love with the house," Mr. Haas said, "but we really had no idea where we were." As if to ground himself, Mr. Haas incorporated images of Yonkers history into the design elements of his home. Over doorways and on his kitchen tiles, he has painted historic Yonkers buildings, many no longer in existence.
Park Hill was developed in 1888 by the American Real Estate Company. In its original advertising, it boasted of the neighborhood's "healthful environment," saying the altitude of 300 feet "insures a salubrious climate and cool nights." The name was first Parkhill, the middle name of Robert P. Getty, a prominent businessman who owned property in the area. Before being subdivided, the hilly rugged land was wilderness characterized by huge rock outcroppings and mature trees. The planners tried to work around and preserve as many natural features as possible.
They also left room for parks and green spaces, including Pelton Field and Sullivan Park, which have ball fields and basketball courts, and the wooded Sutherland Park, which overlooks the Hudson River.
"It's a single-family planned community going back to the turn of the century," said Lee Ellman, Yonkers's director of planning. "The neighborhood is comprised primarily of these imposing turn-of-the-century middle-class houses. Later on some 1950's and 60's raised ranches were put in cheek and jowl next to 1880's shingle-style houses."
Today house prices range from $180,000 for a small three-bedroom home to $750,000 for a six-bedroom Georgian colonial. There are also three co-op complexes, where prices range from $27,000 for a one-bedroom to $65,000 for a three-bedroom.
In its earliest days, Park Hill was a magnet for people in entertainment. The English actor Richard Bennett and his daughters, Joan and Constance, were residents, as was Dennis O'Brien, the corporate counsel for United Artists, who gave parties at his Park Hill house where guests included Charlie Chaplin, George M. Cohan, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. One of Park Hill's main streets is named for the drummer Gene Krupa, who was a longtime resident.
The Park Hill Country Club, established in 1892, was a galvanizing force in the community in those early days. It eventually changed its name to the Racquet Club, and the original building was destroyed by fire in 1962.
It was subsequently replaced by a new building, which still serves as a kind of community center for Park Hill residents. With four clay tennis courts, two swimming pools, four bowling alleys, a clubhouse, ballroom and catering hall, it is a year-round gathering spot open to nonresidents as well. Dues for a family are $1,350 a year.
Despite such amenities, Park Hill retains an urban feel, which is very attractive to many residents. "I still feel like I'm living in Manhattan," said Gini Reticker, an independent filmmaker, who moved to Park Hill from Manhattan three year ago. "It's not some homogeneous suburb. Culturally it's still related to New York City."
Its diversity of housing is matched by its population, said Jane McAfee, a sales agent with Prudential Ragette. "While people think of Park Hill as this artistic community, we also have plumbers and policemen," she said. "The people who look in Park Hill often value that kind of mix."
Also valued is its proximity to Manhattan. Dennis Williams, a member of the Metropolitan Opera chorus, lives with two roommates in a 1939 house in which each bedroom has its own bath. Mr. Williams had been living briefly in the northern Westchester community of Goldens Bridge, but the commute was too long. "I'd heard about Park Hill from a colleague who absolutely loved it," he said. "Now I'm 25 minutes from the Met. And I have a big yard and trees. It's perfect. I can be near the city, and indulge my love of gardening."
Before moving to Park Hill 12 years ago, G. Mac Brown, a movie producer, was on the verge of buying a loft in Manhattan. "Then we discovered my wife was pregnant with our second child and we were going to need more room than we could afford in Manhattan," he said. He and his wife, Cherri, found a 100-year-old, five-bedroom Victorian, with two porches, for $139,000. "It needed $100,000 in repairs," Mr. Brown said. "But the loft we were looking at, with 1,800 square feet, was $225,000 at the time. So we thought this was the better deal."
Mr. Brown said he loves the neighborhood. "We have several gay families, mixed-race households and older couples who have lived here for generations," he said. "It's all these different kinds of people, yet it's a real neighborhood."
ONE downside, Mr. Brown said, is the schools. "When we moved here, we visited the public schools and decided they were not going to be an option for us," he said. "The buildings were rundown and unattractive. It wasn't what we wanted for our kids." His children, Ben, 13, and Nick, 12, attend Riverdale Country Day, a private school; many Park Hill children attend private schools. Money saved from lower house prices and taxes makes private school a viable alternative, Mr. Brown said.
The Yonkers public schools, however, have some local boosters. Ellis E. Cousens, a member of the school board, views the public schools as an asset, not a liability. "There are some outstanding options, like the Montessori and Pearls programs," he said. Both his children attend Pearls, which stands for "Program for Early and Rapid Learners," at the Hawthorne School, less than a mile from Park Hill.
Children must pass a qualifying test for admittance to Pearls, which covers kindergarten through sixth grade, according to Reginald Marra, schools superintendent. "It offers students an enriched core curriculum," Mr. Marra said. "It stresses academics and creative thinking."
Yonkers schools offer magnet programs, meaning parents can select any school in the district if space is available. Two schools are in Park Hill. At one, the Scholastic Academy for Academic Excellence (pre-kindergarten to sixth grade), students wear uniforms and follow a traditional academic curriculum, according to Mr. Marra. There is also the Burroughs Junior High School, for grades 7 and 8, which focuses on environmental science and technology.
"In the next few years, I think people are going to start viewing the Yonkers schools in an entirely different light," Mr. Cousens said. "In some of the schools, the performance of the children is equal to that of PEARLS. We have a new board now, with a higher level of expectation. We're really poised now to make some strides and change people's minds about the schools. And, of course, it will also improve our property values."

The 34,000-square-foot building, completed in 1900, was purchased for $300,000 by Steven Green, owner of Green Realty Management Corporation, who is a Park Hill resident. "There will be duplexes with 13- to 17-foot ceilings and some lofts," Mr. Green said. "We plan to keep the oak floors, the school-type hallways and as much of the original architecture as is economically feasible."
Mr. Green estimates the cost of conversion at about $4.5 million. Rents are expected to range from $875 for a one-bedroom to $1,500 for a two-bedroom with a den. Construction is to start this summer and be completed by late 1999.

Bombs Away! A Story of the Suburbs

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
COLIN McKERNAM, making some extra money working as a land surveyor over his holiday break from Colorado State University, stomped a boot on the frozen mud and turned away from the tripod that held his scope. Just up the hill, a light snow had frosted the trees that still made a natural barrier around the small, cleared plateau where missiles had once been hidden on their launchers, waiting for nuclear doomsday.
"When you're a surveyor, you tend to be aware of the land under your foot," said Mr. McKernam, 23. "When I took this job, they said it was up at an old Nike missile base. I said, 'What's that?' But then I looked up the old plans, and wow, it hit me what this place was once, and what it's becoming now. I really got into the history." 
 It was heartening to run into someone with a sense of the history of this ground, deep in the Ramapo Mountains of northern Bergen County, where expensive new houses are sprouting in the hills. It was interesting, moreover, to encounter it in a young man who grew up at the tail end of the cold war, in a generation that is said to regard history only as what happened in the previous episode of a television show.
"Hey," Mr. McKernam said, chuckling, "isn't is strange that this is how the cold war ended? With all these big new houses going up on some base that was built to keep the Russians from nuking New York City?"
Economics, not warfare or even politics, won the cold war. The decisiveness of its victory can be sensed in the triumphant bellow of capitalism roaring across these rolling hills, where bulldozers carve neat rectangular building lots across land once valued for its strategic location as a nuclear defense installation in the Jersey highlands northwest of Manhattan.
The old Mahwah Nike base was one of more than two dozen missile and radar complexes built in New Jersey in the 1950's, in locations like East Hanover, Livingston, South Plainfield and Wayne, to form a defensive half-circle around New York City. The idea was that the missiles, some armed with nuclear warheads, could be launched from their secluded spots against any Soviet nuclear bomber attack on New York. Forget the fact that the Soviet Union's resorting to long-range airplanes to obliterate New York was not likely, given intercontinental nuclear missiles. Once the military bases had been built, they were lifers that remained staffed and operational till retirement.
When the Nike base in Mahwah was finally abandoned in 1991, suburbia already had established a solid beachhead in the area, which had once been dotted mostly with farms, summer bungalows and the occasional country estate. Just north of the base, on 435 hilly acres that had originally been part of the estate of George Crocker, heir to a railroad fortune, and later became the site of the seminary where the Newark Roman Catholic Archdiocese trained its priests, a development called Rio Vista Estates had already opened, offering new "estate houses" on one- and two-acre lots.
The woods soon reclaimed the adjacent missile site. Just down the hill, vandals ripped into the 24 abandoned two-bedroom ranch houses that had once housed the base's military workers. In 1994, the area's affluent new residents had a scare when the Governmentturned the base over to a group that wanted to use it for low-income housing and a drug-abuse center. But that plan fell through, and the land was sold to a developer who plans to build luxury homes.
Now that Interstate 287 has sliced up into the misty northern hills, affluent suburbanites are pouring in. The clutter and bang of new construction is everywhere.
"It's only about an hour and a quarter by train to New York City for my husband," said Susan Augosto, the administrator of the homeowners' association at Rio Vista, where houses now cost from $650,000 to well over $1 million. The association recently renovated parts of the seminary complex for clubhouse and recreational facilities. The former chapel, with its soaring vaulted ceiling, is now used for parties and other community events.
"It really is beautiful country, the most rural place I've lived in my life," said Mrs. Augosto, who grew up in New England and on Long Island.
A young land surveyor doing his job may well marvel at the fact of missile bases' being beaten into luxury suburbs, as swords might once have been beaten into plowshares. But in the new houses with those magnificent vistas that sweep to the horizon where the lights of the far-off city can be seen twinkling faintly at night, the newer settlers would just as soon not dwell on that.
"Well, let's just say it's a curiosity of history, and leave it at that," Mrs. Augosto said.

HEADLINE: '98, Year of Growth Based on the Past

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
RACING toward the millennium, five successful executives took time to reflect on the past. What does it take to start a business and, more important, what does it take to keep it growing through economic cycles, demographic shifts and changing markets?
The heads of well-established but disparate Westchester companies who have been in business for 25 years or more offer some thoughts. What they have in common is that none of them have remained static. All have survived and prospered by being flexible and adapting to changes in the marketplace.
Martin Berger, chairman, R.M.C. Development Company, Elmsford: 
 Robert Weinberg and I founded the Robert Martin Company in 1959 when we started out as home builders in Westchester. We were fortunate enough to grow our business and rapidly developed over 25 single-family home subdivisions during the 1960's and 70's, 2,000 condominiums during the 70's and 80's, and 5 million square feet of office and industrial space throughout the county in the ensuing years.
We have survived several severe recessions and remained a viable and strong business, which merged a substantial part of our real estate portfolio into a real estate investment trust last January, which is now named Mack-Cali Realty and is one of the largest REIT's in the nation with a cap value of $3.5 billion.
We continue to privately own and operate several apartment houses and shopping centers and a portfolio of undeveloped land, which is being processed mostly for sorely needed residential housing. We are bullish concerning the prospects for the real estate economy in Westchester over the next few years, as our county will follow both Manhattan and Fairfield, where real estate values and office occupancy and rents have soared during the past two years. We are still young at heart, have a seasoned core of professionals retained on staff and have every intention of continuing developmental activities under the Robert Martin flag well into the 21st century.
As for the immediate future, in my opinion the stars are properly aligned for continuous prosperity in the commercial and residential real estate industries in Westchester.
Reasons: The national economy is relatively strong. Interest rates are very moderate showing that inflation is under control. New York City and New York State are in very strong economic condition thanks to the financial services industry that is headquartered in the region. We also have a very popular governor who is business oriented. And the leaders of most Westchester communities are also business oriented.
Abigail Kirsch, founder, Abigail Kirsch Culinary Productions, Tarrytown:
Flashback to 1972. We have just opened a 600-square-foot storefront kitchen in Chappaqua with one employee. Chicken a la king, spinach crepes slathered with cream sauce topped with cheese and strawberries Romanoff with layers of whipped cream are the rage. Cholesterol and calories don't count.
It's the late 70's. We are now in our 6,000-square-foot commissary in Bedford Hills with 40 employees. A menu without beef is unheard of. "Vegetarian" applies only to the one vegetable that enhances the entree. Crepes filled with sweetened whipped cream topped with hot brandy chocolate sauce are a must.
During the opulent 80's and early 90's we are at Tappan Hill, a 25,000-square-foot mansion, with 70 employees. Clients expect a trained, impeccably dressed staff, one that is knowledgeable about wine and food. Requests for our "Dinner by the Bite" grazing menu are constant.
Today, still comfortably ensconced at Tappan Hill, we have a beautiful new venue at the New York Botanical Garden. Our on-location business thrives. Over 100 full-time and several hundred part-time staff are on board. Vegetarian and fish-only menus are popular, as are the tantalizing flavors of Southwestern, Thai and Malaysian cuisines.
I believe the catering industry will grow simply because in the ensuing years virtually every family will be a two-income family and domestic help will all but disappear. Yet family life-cycle events and celebrations will be strong as ever. And people will need to hire caterers for all these occasions. If anything, the catering industry will grow faster than ever."
"We look forward to opening our 30,000-square-foot catering facility -- Pier 60, Chelsea Piers -- in New York in September. It is designed for every type of social and corporate function, seating 1,200 and accommodating more for receptions."
Carl Austin, president, Austin Corporate Properties, White Plains:
We began our company in 1971 in a one-room office with a one-line dial phone, a desk and a coat rack. However, we believed then, and we believe now, that complete market knowledge, total attention to detail and solid personal relationships are the fundamentals in every successful transaction.
We were first selected by Joel Halpern to represent the corporate center that he was developing in Tarrytown. In his words, "I could have had any big New York City broker, but I wanted the undivided attention that a small firm would give." We lived with each other seven days a week, and we'd talk through issues at 2 in the morning. We learned then that total engagement in a client's business leads to success.
While our transactions grew in volume and complexity, we made a decision to remain small in size and to focus exclusively on Westchester.
Our current activities include representing Reckson Associates Realty, a REIT, in their acquisition of Halpern Enterprises' portfolio totaling 935,000 square feet, valued at $83 million, and their acquisition this month of Royal Executive Park, 540,000 square feet, valued at $81 million. We are under contract with Cohen Brothers Realty in their acquisition of the Kraft Foods complex in White Plains totaling 623,000-square feet. We are also completing our leasing campaign for Cigna Investments at the Gateway Building office tower at the White Plains Metro-North Rail Station. Additionally, we represented Centennial Golf Properties in their acquisition of 350 acres for their 27-hole golf course to open in the spring of 1998.
While our brokerage industry has gone through a period of consolidation, creating larger and larger companies covering wider areas, we believe a counter trend is developing. Many highly capable executives of these brokerage giants are splitting off and starting their own market-specific firms. As corporate clients require individual attention, this trend to the smaller specialized companies should continue.
Merritt K. Mitchell, president and owner of Merritt Associates, Larchmont:
Merritt Associates was established in Larchmont in 1930 during the Great Depression by my grandfather, a builder and developer who started it for his daughter, my mother Mabel Merritt Mitchell, in order to give her a business of her own that would generate extra income. It was an unusual position for a woman at that time. Until World War II, the real estate brokerage field was dominated by men.
In the years since my mother started in the business, residential real estate brokerage has seen many changes, both in personalities and service. But the basic aspects of the profession have changed little. Up through the mid-70's real estate brokerage was very provincial. Since then we have seen localization, regionalization, national and worldwide networking, franchising and consolidation, and yet the essence of the industry has not changed. The greatest change, I believe, has been the intensity of the high-tech, high-litigious environment that agencies have had to move in.
As for our agency, we've come a long way in 67 years. We now have offices in Rye, Scarsdale and Greenwich. The company that began with 2 sales persons now has 85 agents and 17 support staff, with voice mail, Websites, E-mail, computerized desktop printing, car phones, beepers, "with full property disclosure" and "agency relationship disclosure" stipulations and licensing requirements -- and so it goes.
Yet our firm and our agents' entrepreneurial spirit and energy remains unchanged in our goal to satisfy both owner and purchaser in all our transactions.
Down the road I think that the fallout from consolidation mergers and independent residential realtors will cease. We are at the top of the peak of that activity. I believe there will be stronger independent real estate concerns, those with a local presence. I think the cycle will repeat itself and local firms with local information on local markets will flourish."
 
Richard N. Pitassey, partner, Bleakley Platt & Schmidt, White Plains:
Our firm was founded in 1937 by William F. Bleakley of Yonkers and Livingston Platt of Rye as a general law practice. Over the decades, we grew steadily along with the county. But during the past 15 years our growth has been dramatic, going from 15 attorneys to more than the 50 we now have on staff, which makes us the largest law firm in the region.
Our use of the latest computer technology has been a major factor. Today all our attorneys and support personnel have immediate access to information at their desks, including computer-assisted research litigation support, document management and production, network faxing, Internet access for search and communications and direct-line transfers to and from clients. The personal computer is becoming the primary research tool. On line is more up to date, more accessible and less expensive than many of the books traditionally maintained in our law library."
The legal profession traditionally lags well behind the business world in applying technology to its own internal management requirements and the wants and needs of its corporate clients. This is particularly true when it comes to communications, both voice and electronic, the information exchange and the all important tasks of cost control, billing and collections. The hardware and software tools necessary for law firms to deal with their clients in the electronic environment with which those clients themselves operate is available: High-speed Internet connections and data transfer, clients/server base billing and accounting systems, some of which provide for electronic building, Intranets, imaging and video. The trick is to get law firm policy makers to focus on the technology issue, understand it sufficiently and be willing to devote the necessary funds. Those that can pull it off stand to reap tremendous advantages over their lower-tech competitors in the form of speed, efficiency, cost saving, and perhaps most important, clients and prospective clients who can see that their attorneys are on the technology ball.

HEADLINE: The Formula for Sun City Moves East and North

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE 

DATELINE: BLUFFTON, S.C.

 BODY:
THE first commercial developments are rising outside the gates of the sprawling Sun City retirement community here, three years after Del Webb Corporation started building its only East Coast venture.
Company executives say the new commercial properties -- a medical center, bank, supermarket and fast-food restaurant -- demonstrate that local investors now consider the venture economically viable. 
 Many had seemed skeptical about whether a large-scale retirement community -- it will eventually have 17,000 residents -- could be carved from the isolated pine barrens 13 miles east of Hilton Head Island, according to Glen McCaskey, a spokesman for Del Webb.
But three years of sales have produced 1,000 buyers -- the 1,000th on Dec. 20 -- and a functioning community where 800 houses are already occupied, tightly packed on lots mostly 77 feet wide by 110 feet deep. Two hundred more houses are in construction. "We are selling about 500 houses a year," Mr. McCaskey said.
Sun City Hilton Head, as the development here is called in an effort to capitalize on the fame of the Hilton Head vacation resort 13 miles away, represents Del Webb's first venture in the East after 40 years of development in Arizona, Nevada and California.
Last month the company announced still another venture in a new region, 45 miles northwest of Chicago in suburban Huntley, Ill., the company's only project in the snowbelt. It will have 4,800 homes, an 18-hole golf course and a recreation complex on 1,800 acres of rural land a mile north of Interstate 90, the company said.
In a survey conducted by Del Webb several years ago, 85 percent of those polled expressed the desire to spend their retirement near their long-time homes. And an American Association of Retired Persons poll of the soon-to-be-retired found that 95 percent had that preference.
"Our research shows there is a growing population who want an active quality life but have consistently demonstrated the desire to retire close to family and friends," said David G. Schreiner, the general manager of the Chicago development, which will be ready for its first occupants in mid-1999. Actual construction will begin with the spring thaw. Company officials say they have heard from several thousand people interested in the Chicago development.
Here in South Carolina, Sun City Hilton Head serves a heretofore untapped market by offering retirement homes in the $130,000 to $170,000 range. At Hilton Head and other South Carolina coastal communities, homes sell for upwards of $200,000.
When the project is completed in 2012, some 17,000 people will live here on 5,600 acres, about a third of which has been set aside for golf courses, nature paths and walking trails. A full-scale recreation complex with indoor and outdoor pools, a fitness center, tennis courts, a social hall and craft center covers some 45 acres in the heart of the complex. Yet to be built are two golf courses and clubhouses, a bowling alley, a 325-seat theater, a 1,000-seat outdoor pavilion and a sports building. Residents tend to stay on the site, which is 13 miles from restaurants and major commercial development, at Hilton Head.
THE University of South Carolina, which will soon begin construction of a branch campus near the development's rear entrance, will conduct its first two courses in the Sun City social hall beginning this month.
When it began operations in 1960, the Del Webb Corporation represented a new concept in retirement living. By offering a full-scale recreation program and limiting ownership to those 55 and older, Del Webb launched what has come to be known as the active-retirement complex.
The company's founder, Del E. Webb, a former co-owner of the New York Yankees, sold 1,300 units in the Phoenix Sun City in the first year, convincing bankers and investors of the viability of the concept.
At about the same time, Mr. Webb's company was also developing corporate facilities and residential subdivisions in Oak Brook, Ill., in partnership with Paul Butler. McDonald's Corporation, Xerox and RCA all have corporate headquarters there now. Oak Brook is 35 miles southeast of the Sun City site.
The company is playing up its ties to the Chicago area as it begins marketing the new development. In addition, the company reports that some 11,000 Illinois residents have bought Sun City homes in other areas, the company's second highest market. California is first.
"Chicago residents love Chicago and don't want to leave," Mr. Schneider said, referring to company research. But, new retirees say they will move to a more rural area to escape crime and traffic. They preferred the area northwest of Chicago over Wisconsin and Michigan, the survey showed.
Here at Sun City Hilton Head, an overwhelming number of buyers are from South Carolina. New York, Pennsylvania, Florida and Georgia also lead the list.
Mr. McCaskey said one of the challenges the company has faced in marketing the property has been the long distances prospects must travel to see the resort. In other areas, prospects generally travel an hour or two and spend about three days getting the feel of the property. Here, prospective buyers usually spend almost a week. Though most arrivals drive from home, the development is also seeking buyers from afar. The two nearest airports are 13 miles away, the municipal field at Hilton Head and Savannah International Airport.
The development's look has been tailored to suit the area, with clapboard homes -- ranging in size from 1,000 to 2,900 square feet -- sporting muted colors, porches and steep roofs. In the West, most of the homes are stucco with tiled roofs.
WHERE 90 percent of Southern Californians recognize the name Del Webb, here it was virtually unknown. Its method of operation was new as well. The company does not sell individual lots as most developers do. It sells the entire package, allowing the owner to select carpet, wallpaper and the like from a sales center. When Del Webb has sold between 91 and 93 percent of a certain neighborhood, construction begins, one house at a time, with the workmen making their way down the street.
Ronald and Marcia Garner moved from Cornwall, N.Y., about 50 miles north of New York City, 10 months ago. They clinched their deal over a long weekend after touring several models and making selections from the sales center.
Mr. Garner, who retired as a sales engineer from EE Controls in Hawthorne, N.Y., before moving here, said he liked Sun City because of amenities like the $40 million Town Square, where the fitness and social centers are situated. He and his wife spent about two years looking at retirement areas on the East Coast.
"We were afraid we might move into a community that just has local people and we wouldn't be accepted," said Mr. Garner, who is 63 and lived 35 years in the New York metropolitan area. "Here there are no locals."
Because of that, friends -- and an active social life -- are easier to come by, he said. The South is also a much different place today than he remembers from his time as a young soldier taking basic training at Fort Jackson, about 120 miles west of here near Columbia, S.C.
"We're not living on the edge of civilization or in the Old South," he said.
"The thing we're really selling is lifestyle and theoretically you ought to be able to put it anywhere," said Mr. McCaskey.
That will be the test for the company as it expands its operation into the Chicago area. Taking note of the surge of retirees to come as the so-called baby boomers reach retirement age over the next decade, Del Webb has moved into an aggressive growth program.
It recently announced plans to buy Spruce Creek Golf and Country Club near Ocala, Fla. The purchase represents the company's first foray into the nation's pre-eminent retirement state since it sold Sun City Center near Tampa in 1971 after nine years of disappointing sales.
Only about 300 of the 2,860 homes have been built so far in Spruce Creek. The company said it was buying the company to take advantage of an approved development plan and a knowledgable work force. Del Webb officials said that the company planned additional projects in Florida.

Giant Creatures, Up Close
"Alaska: Spirit of the Wild" has opened at the Imax Theater inside the Maritime Aquarium in South Norwalk. Hungry grizzly bears, swooping eagles, 30-foot blocks of ice catapulting into the sea, caribous stampeding and salmon struggling upstream are some of the scenes that will seem to be within inches of your face. 
The 40-minute film, narrated by Charlton Heston, begins with the creation of what is now Alaska some 18,000 years ago, and the people who migrated from Siberia to settle there. Sea lions and beavers, polar bears and musk ox, wolves and bison fill out the cast.
Screening times are 11 A.M., noon, 1, 2, and 3 P.M. daily, with an extra show at 4 P.M. on Saturday and Sunday, through June 18. Admission is $6.50, with discounts for older people and children. The aquarium is at 10 North Water Street, off Exit 14 or 15 of Interstate 95. The number is (203) 852-0700 for more information.
 
Country Club Satire
Douglas Carter Beane is the author of "The Country Club," now in its first major production at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven.
The play, which is part autobiography of the Wyomissing, Pa., author, runs through Feb. 1 and is a satire on the lives of Pooker, Froggy, Hutch and other of the too-too rich, approaching age 30. They are members of the country club, from which privileged atmosphere they must emerge into the real world.
Mr. Beane's screenplay for "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar" was produced by Steven Spielberg and featured a cast including Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo and Stockard Channing. His "As Bees in Honey Drown" is currently running Off Broadway.
Performances at the Long Wharf are scheduled on Tuesday at 7; Wednesday through Friday at 8; Saturday at 4 and 8:30; Sunday at 2 and 7. Tickets priced from $15 to $39 may be reserved by calling (203) 787-4282.
 
Classes in Signing
Each year the National Theater of the Deaf in Chester holds classes in sign language, taught by Betty Beekman with a touch of humor and theatricality. Students are not necessarily hearing-impaired. In fact, according to Laine Dyer, director of publicity for the theater, "most of the students are not deaf at all. They find signing useful in their jobs."
Scuba divers, for example, sign under water to each other, teachers want the skill for use with hearing-impaired students, maitre d's and waitstaff in restaurants, shopkeepers and church personnel find it a great advantage in dealing with deaf or partially deaf customers or parishioners.
There are four levels from beginner to conversational, advanced and total immersion or silent. Each class lasts for six weeks, once a week for two hours, and costs $60 plus a $15 text. Beginning sessions start on Saturday from 9 to 11 A.M. The remaining levels, all held on weekday evenings from 7 to 9, begin on Jan. 13, April 14 and April 30.
The number for more information or to register is (860) 526-4971.
 
Assessing the Economy
Rae D. Rosen, senior economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, will be the speaker at a breakfast on Thursday from 7:45 to 9:45 at the Holiday Inn in Stamford.
Ms. Rosen will talk about the international financial situation and its implications, the national economy and, in line with her work in financial research and analysis for the tristate region, she will discuss the area's economy.
Reservations (at $45) may be obtained by calling (203) 359-3220.
 
Dolls, Old and New
Children's toys, dolls and doll houses from the mid-19th century to the 1970's have been gathered by the Wilton Historical Society for an exhibition through January at its newly restored Betts-Sturges-Blackmar House at 224 Danbury Road (Route 7) in Wilton.
America's first commercially made doll, patented by its maker circa 1858, dolls of the 1940's and 50's, china- and bisque-headed dolls from England, France and Germany, an Italian felt doll, a rag doll and high-fashion doll are among those on display.
Large imported English so-called Baby Houses, American commercially made and homemade doll houses and their furnishings, plus the toy-sized laundry machines, old-fashioned stoves and household appliances are also exhibited.
Boys were expected to be the breadwinners, assuming responsibilities outside the home -- learning to be builders with Lincoln Logs and Erector sets, railroad engineers or perhaps owners, with elaborate electric train layouts, truck drivers, soldiers and astronauts.
In addition to its nostalgia factor, the exhibition illustrates the changes that have taken place in the way we regard sex roles. The exhibit may be seen on Tuesday through Thursday from 10 to 4, and Sunday from 1 to 4. Admission is by $2 donation. The number for more information is (203) 762-7257.
 
Ready for Camping
Whether the substantial increase to 25 million recreational vehicles on the road indicates a concurrent increase in camping is hard to determine, but the 16th Annual Northeast Recreational Vehicle and Camping Show will have all the latest equipment for a stay in the wild, the nearest trailer park, or Aunt Nellie's driveway. It will spread over 70,000 square feet of the Hartford Civic Center on Friday from noon to 9, Saturday from 10 to 9 and next Sunday from 10 to 5.
A complete line of conveyances ranging from luxurious motor homes to pop-up campers will be on display, along with camping supplies, accessories and tips on vehicle maintenance. Free seminars, scheduled throughout the weekend, will include the dispensing of advice by travel experts on some of the 16,000 camp sites across the United States, the best routes to take, and which ones are for short or long vacations.
Admission is $7, $3.50 for children from 7 through 12 years old. The number for more information is (860) 529-2123.
 
Ready for Fishing
People ready for spring and the fishing season may get an early start at the seventh Annual Fly-Fishing Show of the Hammonasset Chapter of Trout Unlimited. It will take place on Saturday from 10 to 5 at the Elks Club, 142 Seaside Avenue, in Westbrook.
The accouterments of freshwater and saltwater fishing found along Connecticut's shoreline will be featured in dealer displays, demonstrations of fly-tying, raffle items and informal talks.
Among the speakers will be Ed Mitchell, an authority on saltwater technique and tackle, and Gary Evans, a Montana guide who will give an appraisal of trout fishing in the West. A slide presentation prepared by George Terpenning, titled "Fishing Through My Memories," will be narrated live by his daughter Lisa Terpenning.
Admission is $5, free to children under 16 accompanied by an adult. The number for more information is (203) 245-2654. ELEANOR CHARLES

New Tax Laws for the New Year

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
New Jersey smokers can add another incentive to their list of reasons for resolving to quit this year: money.
The tobacco tax doubled on New Year's Day, to 80 cents a pack of cigarettes, raising the price to about $2.50 a pack at most outlets. Cigar and pipe smokers, tobacco chewers and snuff users will also pay more. 
 The new tax is expected to bring in $200 million for the state, but Governor Whitman said she was not concerned about economists' forecasts that the higher tax would hurt sales.
"If a higher tax on cigarettes keeps people, particularly children, from smoking, that in itself is very good news for the state of New Jersey," Mrs. Whitman said.
The tax increase is the main new component of a five-year, $2.7 billion program to provide state money to hospitals and to provide subsidized health insurance for the poor. Hospitals need the money to treat people who have no insurance and to offset high-cost Medicaid cases.
Two other new laws also took on effect New Year's Day: an auto insurance package that is far weaker than Governor Whitman's original proposal, and a new energy tax structure that is eventually expected to lower consumers' electric and gas bills.
The auto insurance bill promises, but does not guarantee, small savings for New Jersey drivers, who pay the nation's highest average auto insurance rates.
The law eliminates a system that allows insurers automatic, inflation-driven rate increases each July 1. Only insurers that prove they need the higher rates will now be able to have them approved by the insurance commissioner.
It also eliminates surcharges that had been assessed for even minor traffic infractions. Those will be replaced by a tiered rating system. The bill also includes tougher anti-fraud components, makes it harder for insurers to drop good drivers and forces insurers to do more business in cities.
The new energy tax law repeals the 13 percent gross receipts utilities tax that monopolies like Public Service Electric & Gas have been paying and passing on to consumers on their electric bills.
That is replaced with a 6 percent sales tax, a 1 percent corporate tax that can be passed through to consumers and a new 6 percent transitional tax that is to be phased out by 2003. Consumers end up paying the same 13 percent at first, but that is to drop to 7 percent when the transitional tax phases out.
The new tax structure is linked to a deregulation plan that will give consumers the freedom to choose suppliers of electricity and gas, beginning in phases later this year. National power generators like Enron Corporation and Southern will begin advertising for customers, just as competing telephone companies now pitch their long-distance and regional calling services.
The law puts utilities like PSE&G on the same tax footing as other private businesses, paying a 6 percent sales tax on sales plus an income tax on corporate profits.
As the transitional tax is phased out, utility tax revenue is expected to decline from $1.2 billion to as little as $800 million by 2002. Municipal governments shared in the old utilities tax revenue, so lawmakers dedicated $740 million of the new sales tax to towns, and that figure rises to $755 million by 2002.
As a result, the state government, which in 1997 took about $430 million from utilities tax revenues, could see that dwindle to around $50 million for the first year of the next governor's term.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/The Henry Hudson Hotel, 353 West 57th Street;
From Women's Clubhouse to WNET to $75 a Night

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
LAST year the hotelier Ian Schrager announced plans to fix up the old Henry Hudson Hotel, at 353 West 57th Street -- but not too much. He says he wants to charge only $75 a night.
The big, boxy 24-story building is a peculiar presence on West 57th Street, within hailing distance of tenements and old industrial buildings. But things were meant to be so different, for the 1929 building was intended to complement a new Metropolitan Opera House across the street, and to serve as a club where professional women could network their way to success in the business world. 
 To Anne Morgan goes most of the credit for what was built as the American Woman's Association. The daughter of the financier J. Pierpont Morgan, she used her huge inheritance to advance causes of social justice among her crowd of socially advantaged women. In 1903 she was among the founders of the Colony Club, the pre-eminent women's club in New York, and in 1909 she brought striking women's garment workers to be heard by the membership.
Her interest in the position of the working woman took various forms and by 1921 evolved into the American Woman's Association. She brought in moneyed members of both sexes, people like Felix Warburg, Marshall Field, Ruth Baker Pratt and Anne Vanderbilt -- with whom Miss Morgan had been among the pioneer settlers of the colony of luxurious town houses on Sutton Place at East 57th Street.
In 1924 the American Woman's Association announced plans for a $4 million clubhouse on West 23d Street to serve as a residence for working women. At that time the group estimated that 700,000 women held salaried jobs in New York City, with 50,000 of those in managerial or executive positions. Their architect was Benjamin Wistar Morris, who had close ties to the Morgan family. The group took several years to raise the money.
In 1925 the financier Otto Kahn bought a large site east of Ninth Avenue from 56th to 57th Streets to serve as a new location for the Metropolitan Opera House, then struggling with its 1883 building at 39th and Broadway. The next year the American Woman's Association, which by that time had 5,000 members, decided to sell its 23d Street site and build across from the projected opera house on a plot running from 57th to 58th Street.
In a 1927 interview in The Saturday Evening Post, Miss Morgan, who never married, outlined her ideas about the prospects for urban women. Women were at a temporary disadvantage in the business world, she said, because they had been insulated from the rough and tumble that characterized men's upbringing. At the moment there were no women who could head a great corporation, but "in time there will be plenty of such women -- it requires only evolution," she said.
She called the American Woman's Association "a training school for leadership, a mental exchange" where women "can hear what other women are doing." The organization had 61 doctors, 16 lawyers, 939 teachers, a bacteriologist, a tug dispatcher and workers in many other fields. But Miss Morgan said that not everyone was eligible, only the woman "with ambition, pluck and energy, which will push her up and up in her profession."
Kahn had been working with the flamboyant architect Joseph Urban, but soon also retained Morris -- the new opera and hotel would have established an architectural dialogue across the street. But in October 1927, as the American Woman's Association broke ground for its new building, the opera boxholders decided to seek a more central site. (They did not find one until Lincoln Center opened in the 1960's.)
In early 1928, with the clubhouse project under way, a split developed in the women's group -- Gertrude Robinson Smith, president for 17 years, resigned in a dispute with Miss Morgan, her longtime friend. Miss Smith later said that a Morgan-Vanderbilt clique was trying to remake the association along elitist lines. Miss Morgan assumed direct control over the organization, which she held until 1943. She died in 1952.
In May 1928 the cornerstone was laid, with a box containing plans of buildings, newspapers, coins and other memorabilia, and predictions of the future of the feminist movement. The box was intended to be opened in 1978 -- but was not.
Completed in 1929, the new clubhouse had 1,250 rooms, along with a swimming pool, gym, meeting rooms, a restaurant, music rooms and wide terraces on the upper setbacks. Although the sleeping rooms had 128 color combinations, the exterior was bare and boxy, rising up among the aging brownstones of West 57th Street like a grain elevator in the Nebraska prairie grasses. The building was "admirably simple," The New Yorker wrote, "almost factory-like."
THE magazine Survey called the new building "a symbol of the new day that the business woman sees breaking along her horizon," and others also thought the sun was rising on West 57th Street --developers filed plans for two hotels of 30 and 45 stories just east of the association's building. Their plans did not go ahead, although the huge Parc Vendome apartment complex went up on the old opera site in 1930.
By the opening, 500 rooms in the American Woman's Association Clubhouse had been taken, and the clubhouse almost made it through the Great Depression. But in 1941, with bankruptcy proceedings under way, the association gave up and the clubhouse was converted to the Henry Hudson Hotel, for both men and women. At the hotel's opening, Hannie Davidson, an 11-year-old Dutch girl, smashed a bottle of Dutch milk against the doorway.
In 1946 the United Nations Security Council met at the hotel, but otherwise it continued as a rather lonely high-rise outpost on far West 57th Street that was better known as the headquarters of WNET, the local public television station, which owned the second through ninth floors and uses the 58th Street side as its entrance. The television station had shared ownership with St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which owned the 11th through 24th floors, and Irving Schatz, who owns the stores, the 10th floor and the penthouse, which he uses for his office.
Last year Mr. Schrager bought out both St. Luke's and WNET, and he has leased the 10th floor from Mr. Schatz. Mr. Schrager, who redid the old Royalton Hotel on West 44th Street and the Paramount on West 46th, said he was "in the business of buying dumpy old fleabags and improving them." In the Henry Hudson he sees a location "right in the middle of everything," surrounded by new buildings on Eighth and Ninth Avenues and close to midtown.
He said that he wanted "a modern Y.M.C.A., provocative and original -- like an urban spa" -- and that he would work with his regular architect, Philippe Starck, known for his striking modern designs. Because WNET will not leave until later this year for new space on West 33d Street, Mr. Schrager expects to open the hotel in the year 2000, combining many of the original small rooms to make about 700 suites.
Two suites, redone as samples, have been economically but neatly repainted and refurnished and offer sweeping views north to Lincoln Center and southwest across the Hudson and New Jersey.
As for the American Woman's Association, it withered and was defunct by 1980, and its cornerstone -- with its predictions for the future -- sits undisturbed.

HEADLINE: Us vs. Them;
Is There a Deer Problem of a People Problem?

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
IT was dusk. The maroon station wagon slammed to a halt just as a deer came sailing across the road in a leap that took it from the woods on the left toward the field and barn across Wyckoff Road in Monmouth County. The leap was just short. The deer's hooves shattered the passenger window.
After a moment of stunned silence, the driver, Roseann Trezza, grabbed her cellular telephone and called for help -- for the deer. 
 "He was just trying to survive," said Ms. Trezza, who happens to be the assistant director of the New Jersey Humane Society. She had just picked up a colleague at the society's Tinton Falls shelter when the collision occurred a few weeks ago. "We've taken over their habitat; we've moved in on them everywhere. Their living space is smaller and smaller each year. They come out at night because they can't come out at any other time. They're just looking for food and shelter."
By the turn of the century, aggressive hunting had almost eradicated the white-tailed deer in New Jersey. Alarmed state officials began a nine-year restocking program that now seems to have worked all too well: from Passaic and Sussex Counties down to Salem, deer are everywhere.
Exactly how many is a matter of debate. Bob Lund, who manages the deer project for the Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, says there are about 150,000, based on information gathered during hunting season.
John Rigolizzo Jr., the president of the New Jersey Farm Bureau, practically snorts at that. "Some days, it seems like I see that many myself," he said, adding that New Jersey farms lost "upwards of $30 million" to deer annually in corn, hay, soybeans, apple trees, string beans, strawberries, pumpkins and other crops from a total harvest worth about $860 million. The estimate of 150,000, he said, "is no longer a believable number to me."
John Grande, director of the Snyder Research Farm at Rutgers University, is mailing out 16-page questionnaires to 4,000 farmers this week, hoping to end up with firm numbers for both deer and damage.
Other indicators: Hunting, which accounted for the deaths of 11,021 deer in 1972, brought down 56,704 in 1996 and is expected to exceed that for 1997. Collisions with automobiles are up, particularly during the fall rut, or mating season, and during these winter months of the hunting season. About a month ago, an amorous deer ran across the Garden State Parkway in Ocean Township and ended up causing a 12-car pileup. Miraculously, the deer was the only fatality.
John Dourgarian, a spokesman at the state Department of Transportation, says it had 11,000 deer carcasses picked up from roadsides in 1996 at a cost of $220,000. Steve Firello, who manages two of a small chain of auto body shops in Somerset and Hunterdon Counties, said he saw up to 10 cars a week with deer damage, which he figures to be 30 or 40 percent more than last year. Bruce Klein, a manager at Karl Mey's Collision and Paint Center in Mercer County, said the shop averaged 6 to 10 cars a week that had tangled with deer. And there are at least 5 a week requiring repairs costing $300 to $4,000, at Baker Pontiac's body shop, in Montgomery Township, on the border of Princeton Township, said Tom Mullane, an assistant to the manager.
Last week, one of those cars was his. He was at the intersection of Camp Meeting Road and Skillman when a deer ran in front of him. "Poor little thing," he said facetiously. "I felt like bringing it back to life so I could kill him again."
As the nation's most densely populated state (7.7 million human inhabitants over its 7,500 square miles, according to the 1990 census), New Jersey is simply ahead of, not different from, other states, said Barbara Lawrence, the head of New Jersey Future, a nonprofit organization that monitors growth. "When Kenneth Gibson was Mayor of Newark," Ms. Lawrence noted, "he said, 'Wherever the nation's cities are going, Newark is getting there first.' Well, with suburban development patterns, you can say that about New Jersey."
 
Once Upon a Time, Every Deer Was Bambi
Here, the denial is over. The deer problem has moved to the next phase: bitter debate.
Increase hunting? To groups like the Humane Society, deer shouldn't be hunted in the first place. Lee Bernstein, the society's director in Newark, said: "I have no objection to hunting if the deer is armed and can shoot back. That's hunting. The way we have it is slaughter."
The activity has no lack of defenders. They include, of course, hunters, as well as homeowners sick of having their tulips eaten, environmentalists who object to excessive deer foraging that ruins habitats for other species like songbirds, and epidemiologists who worry about deer ticks carrying Lyme disease or the possibility that deer might spread tuberculosis to cattle. In the face of such concerns, the storybook fondness for Bambi appears to be diminishing, at least in some quarters.
"Once, deer used to be considered a beautiful sight," said Mr. Grande, the Rutgers researcher. "But not anymore, not by the people hitting them with their cars." And Mr. Lund says that in his 30 years on the job, he's seen people go from the attitude "I wouldn't harm a hair on a deer's head" to "get that blankety-blank out of my yard!"
The Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife says that hunting is, so far, more effective and economical than any other deer-control method, and that it is far more humane than letting nature do the job, through starvation and disease. "If you're morally opposed to deer hunting, then don't hunt," said Ms. Predl, senior wildlife biologist at the division. But people who love wildlife should remember, she and others said, that it is hunters, by paying fees and buying licenses to the tune of $5 million a year, who are financing the state's wildlife management.
There are other moral comebacks, too. Anyone who eats meat, Mr. Lund said, should realize that a cow spends its whole life "waiting, unknowingly, for the day it'll get slaughtered." And, he said, "at least the deer hunter is doing his own dirty work."
The Humane Society and other deer advocates prefer a two-pronged plan: administering contraceptives to does, and altering land-use patterns to limit development in rural areas. Both are much more easily said than done. Dan Ferrigno, who directs the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife's deer project in southern New Jersey, said that birth control delivered by dart was completely unsuited to free-roaming populations, because the does need repeat doses. It's a little like trying to give women birth-control pills by tossing them into the crowds at the Short Hills Mall.
Even relatively small, stable populations are difficult to treat. At Frelinghuysen Arboretum in Morris Township, the Humane Society is sponsoring a pilot contraceptive project on a herd of about 20 animals. Park personnel have abandoned the darts in favor of wrestling individual deer to the ground to inoculate them, The Record of Bergen County reported last week.
Ms. Lawrence, executive director of New Jersey Future, said the group, which includes business people and environmentalists, was established 10 years ago to encourage municipalities to adhere to guidelines offered in the state regional plan adopted in 1986. That plan, which is strictly advisory, suggests a balance of preservation of natural systems and resources and compact residential and commercial development.
"It puts us in the awkward position of being in the middle," Ms. Lawrence said. "We believe in economic development, but it matters where those jobs are. And the place for deer is shrinking."
If there is a single point of agreement in the deer debates, it is that humans and their doings are at the bottom of it. Open space is disappearing in New Jersey at the rate of about 10,000 acres, or 16 square miles, a year, Ms. Lawrence said. "One of the things we're concerned with," she said, "is that the very reason people move to the places they move is they love the countryside. But just by moving there, they thereby degrade the very reason they moved there."
The Department of Environmental Protection is now compiling a comprehensive map of land use in the state. Until it is finished, Ms. Lawrence said, the best sense of the problem is "what people get when they look out their window."
What they see is obvious. Mr. Mullane, reflecting on the deer he hit, said: "Twenty years ago, you could shoot a cannon down 206 without hitting anybody. Now you can't even make a left turn."
Asked about the deer problem, Mr. Lund responded, "You mean the people problem?" Then he laughed, but only a little.
"We created this," he said. "More and more people are developing land in what used to be natural habitat, and then you wonder why the deer are eating your shrubs. Some species have disappeared. Some have prospered on what we've left them." Those include Canada geese, groundhogs, rabbits, skunks, and raccoons. But none have flourished more than deer.
In a sense, what they are adapting to is a geographical expression of the modern economy. Shopping malls and condominiums encroached on open spaces in the 70's and 80's. Now office parks and warehouse stores are rising all over the state, as are single-family houses on municipally zoned four- or five-acre tracts.
Spacious estates and woodsy office parks may be lovely places for humans to work and live. But they are also popular resorts for deer: hunter-free zones in which landscaping and horticulture provide privacy and a smorgasbord of high-quality food.
In the history of the world, deer may never have had it so good. Ms. Predl, the Fish, Game and Wildlife biologist, said they evolved over the last 36 million years from artiodactyls, an order of even-toed mammals with compartmentalized stomachs, making them distant cousins of the unlamented cow. When the European settlers arrived in the New World, deer were probably not plentiful in the forested Northeast, Ms. Predl said.
Heavy forest is not the ideal environment for deer; they prefer forest interspersed with plains. Or farms. Once agriculture turned the Northeast's virgin forest into exactly that, the deer boomed, prompting excessive hunting. When the 20th century began, there were almost no deer left in the state. New Jersey responded by banning deer hunting in 1902. Deer were brought in to rural areas from local preserves and from Michigan, Virginia and Pennsylvania starting in 1904 and ending in 1913.
By 1912, farmers were already reporting crop damage. In 1917, the state began issuing special permits to farmers, allowing them to kill deer on their property. The program continues: last year, 509 one-month permits were issued to farmers.
Mr. Rigolizzo said deer did more damage than other wildlife. "A raccoon will take an ear of corn and eat it, and maybe eat four or five," he said. "But deer are famous for walking along at night, picking something out, taking a bite, and walking on, taking another bite. They can really ruin you."
 
Hunt Them Down? It's Not That Simple
Unpalatable as it may be to many people, is hunting the answer? Surprisingly, even those who defend it can no longer simply say yes.
Hunting returned to the state in 1909, with an act of the General Assembly. That first hunting season was every Wednesday in November, and it was firmly restricted. Hunters could be fined $100 -- about three months' income at the time -- if they killed a deer out of season, or killed an antlerless deer, meaning a doe or a fawn. Today's hunting regulations are far more complex. New Jersey has 67 deer management zones in its 21 counties, and the state Fish and Game Council designs a hunting season for each one, authorizing specific time frames for shotguns, crossbows, muzzle-loaders and other weapons. To reduce the herd most effectively, killing of antlerless deer is encouraged; for every one brought in, a hunter receives a bonus tag permitting another deer to be bagged. The only problem is that many hunters have been trained since birth to never shoot does.
While there are no official national comparisons to draw on, hunters and game experts say that New Jersey's season is one of the most liberal in the Northeast; Mr. Lund of Fish, Game and Wildlife says it is the most liberal in all of the Eastern United States.
So why is there still a problem? Because, said Ms. Predl, the hunters can't get at the deer in those four-acre backyards and in those corporate parks. "You could have deer hunting 365 days a year," she said, "and if you can't get in there, you're still going to have a deer problem."
And deer, which don't seem to understand automobiles at all, do seem to grasp the hunting season. "The first day, you see them," Mr. Rigolizzo said. "After that, it's like they all went to Florida."
Some hunting opponents believe that killing deer only results in a biological response in the herd to produce more deer. Ms. Trezza, at the Humane Society, said she believes the hunting season is deliberately planned to increase the total number of deer, so hunters will have more game. Officials of the Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife say that is absolutely untrue.
However, it is true that the division is trying new ways to bring hunters in contact with deer populations. This year, for the first time, High Point Park was opened to hunters. Monmouth Battlefield was opened to hunters a few years ago.
There is a controlled hunting program at Lewis Morris Park, in Morristown, and another at the Watchung Reservation, in Union County, which has resulted in the donation of more than 5,000 pounds of venison to the Community Food Bank of New Jersey.
Daniel Bernier, the chief of park operations in Union, said, "The general public has been very accepting."
They may have to be. And that may be the precedent New Jersey sets for a nation likely to become inundated with deer.
As Ms. Lawrence said, "You think its bad now? Wait, just wait."

Chart: "Counting"
There are 150,000 deer in New Jersey, according to the Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife. That estimate is based mostly on extrapolations from the age and gender of deer killed during hunting season.
 
Estimates by county are expected to be less reliable in areas where hunting is largely restricted or nonexistent, like Bergen, Essex and Union.
 
However, in counties where hunting is widespread, the estimates are more reliable, the wildlife division says. These 10 counties have the biggest deer population, based on state estimates.
 
HUNTERDON -- 25,000.
SUSSEX -- 18,500
WARREN -- 18,300
MORRIS -- 12,700
BURLINGTON -- 12,600
SOMERSET -- 9,700
SALEM -- 7,600
MONMOUTH -- 7,600
ATLANTIC -- 7,000
CUMBERLAND -- 6,400 (pg. 9)
 
Graph: "Body Count"
New Jersey's deer-hunting records show a huge increase in hunting, as well as in the popularity of alternative hunting methods. Bow hunting is the most common method after shooting with firearms. And old-fashioned muzzle-loaders (remember Daniel Boone?) accounted for 9,580 deer last year. Graph shows number of deer killed by shotgun, by bow and arrow, and by muzzle-loaders/others during 1972, 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1996.

HEADLINE: With Space Tight, Outdated Factories Find New Roles

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
AFTER languishing on the sidelines as the wallflowers of the real estate industry, outmoded industrial buildings, vacant for years, are being pursued by investors and developers who are profiting by dressing them up and dancing them around again.
A shortage of office space in the New York suburban region and a scarcity of the sort of inexpensive research and manufacturing space needed by start-up companies have made developers take a second look at scores of dowdy manufacturing buildings and the relatively small sums it takes to buy, rehabilitate and rent them, real-estate specialists say. 
 Among the old factories being recycled in the New York area are the 1.2-million-square-foot former General Motors ball bearing plant in Connecticut, where Firestone Building Products and other manufacturers are renting space. A former silver-plating plant in New Jersey has been sold for conversion to first class office space, and an old boiler factory in Irvington, N.Y., has been redeveloped with sufficient chic to lure a Manhattan dress designer out of the garment district.
"We went through five years of distressed times when nobody was interested in industrial buildings," said Jeffrey Dunne, senior vice president in the Stamford office of CB Commercial, a national real estate company with offices in Connecticut, Westchester and New Jersey. "In an area with a strong office market, they get converted," he said, adding the caveat that "if they are out in the middle of nowhere, zoning may prohibit conversion, and sometimes it's better to knock them down."
Developers say the re-use of sturdy skeletons and foundations in these buildings keeps costs below those of new construction, even with extensive renovations, and takes about half the time required to erect a new building. The high ceilings, clerestory windows and skylights are desirable for small manufacturers, and they offer esthetic value to office tenants.
Profit is the dominant incentive for rehabilitation, but there may also be a desire to preserve historic architecture. Sales are sometimes hampered by an obligation to clean up contamination that resulted from industrial pollution.
Size, location and proximity to cities help to determine the type of re-use. Big companies like General Motors, Litton Industries, Fafnir Bearing Company and Grumman Aircraft required enormous buildings, and generated the kind of noise and pollution that were best relegated to sparsely populated areas. Many of the buildings erected by these companies during and after World War II are still standing. Older factory buildings, many of them nearer to New York City, have been propelled into obsolescence by residential, retail and office development pushing deeper and deeper into their territory.
William E. Greiner, president of Greiner-Maltz Company, commercial and industrial realtors in Woodbury, N.Y., said, "When the value of an existing property plus alteration costs equals a good return on the investment, it pays to upgrade to a higher economic use."
"Republic Aviation on Route 110 is a classic example," he said. "Since World War II, their frontage has been updated to retail outlets. There may have been several turnovers of the property, but eventually it became a highway outlet operation, salvaging as much of the floor, columns, roof, walls as possible, but adding a new facade, landscaping, and instead of industrial rent that would have been $3.50, it's $15 a foot."
Another Long Island example is a former Grumman property, a 25-year-old, 270,000-square-foot former warehouse on Route 110 in Melville now occupied by Olympus America. It contains the company's sleek headquarters, office and data center, scientific products group, 750-seat cafeteria and a retail store for Olympus cameras.
"We gutted it and reconfigured the interior to accommodate a consolidation of 3 or 4 Olympus locations and 11 of its departments," said Scott Spector, principal of the Spector Group, an architectural firm in North Hills, N.Y., hired to design the renovation. "Recycling old industrial buildings is 20 percent of our work now," he said. "It was a very minor part just a few years ago."
One kind of conversion being replicated in suburban complexes throughout the region involves the preservation of factories for use as studios for designers and artists. Overlooking the water in Irvington, N.Y., is a project nicknamed SoHo on the Hudson. Some 45 small companies consisting of architects, graphic artists, toy designers, advertising companies and others have taken space in what was once the 220,000-square-foot Lord & Burnham Greenhouse, Heating and Boiler Systems Company on Bridge Street.
"We changed the zoning from industrial to commercial and live-work loft studios," said Michael Lyons, a co-developer with William Thompson, owners since 1995. "We have a love for these turn-of-the-century buildings and we believe there is a market for preserving and converting them into creative environments." About 30,000 square feet are still available.
Eileen Fisher, a women's sportswear designer, moved her design and administrative divisions from 5,000 square feet in the Manhattan garment district to 12,000 square feet at SoHo on the Hudson for quality of life reasons, said Gerri Maslanka, chief operating officer of the Eileen Fisher company. "We expanded to 17,000 feet," she said, "and now we are negotiating for another 10,000 feet."
Convenient to rail transportation for commuting employees, the new offices have 31-foot ceilings, a mezzanine, skylights and"stunning views of the river," Ms. Maslanka said, "and we love the ambience."
At the other end of the size-location spectrum, two New York developers, Harold Fetner and David Swersky, bought the 1.25-million-square-foot former General Motors Delco Moraine ball bearings plant on 182 acres in Bristol, Conn., last August. The building had been vacant since 1994, and is, according to the developers, the largest one-story manufacturing plant in New England. Its price was $5.5 million, down from $10 million in 1994.
The new owners, calling themselves the S. F. Bristol Company, are raising 200,000 square feet of the roof, in part to accommodate their first tenant: Firestone Building Products Company, which is consolidating its Springfield, Mass., insulation plant and its North Branford, Conn., plant into 400,000 square feet of the Bristol building at a rent of $3.75 a foot. The division of the remaining footage allows for spaces as small as 5,000 square feet.
The behemoths of Connecticut's smokestack past, scattered through its central corridor, will never again be the economic engine of the state, but they are benefiting from the surge of interest in industrial plants.
"Activity has finally come to Connecticut," said Nicholas Morizio, president of Colliers, Dow & Condon, commercial realtors in Hartford. "We're the tail of the dog, because our economy is just starting to get out of the doldrums. These buildings, abandoned by manufacturers moving to the Far East, Mexico, wherever, are available, and people are buying them."
Far from urban centers and containing enormous amounts of space, they cannot hope to participate in upscale office and retail conversions, but they are attracting investors and developers who refit them for light industrial and research tenants.
More than half a dozen companies involved in fiber optics, aquaculture research, computer services, microbrewery and other pursuits are in various buildings of the 1.2-million-square-foot complex of the former American Thread Company in Windham, Conn. Now owned by the Windham Mills Development Company, a private, nonprofit agency financed by state grants and loans, the property is being redeveloped as a technology, telecommunications and business training center with ties to the University of Connecticut.
Stuart Lichter, a Bronx-born, Los Angeles-based real estate operator, recently bought two major Connecticut buildings. His firm, S. L. Equities, has redeveloped 20 million square feet of large old industrial buildings across the country. In September, he bought the 582,000-square-foot former Litton Industries complex in New Britain for $1.5 million. In October, he purchased the 660,000-square-foot former Fafnir Company plant in Newington for $4 million, and has contracted to buy the 535,000-square-foot former First Brands Building in East Hartford for an undisclosed sum.
"Not a lot of people make a career out of recycling old industrial buildings," Mr. Lichter said. "My principal competition is local preservation groups or local people on a deal-by-deal basis. We only take the largest buildings, spend several million on renovating them, and in Connecticut, rent them for $2 a foot and up."
"There are always companies closing down," Mr. Lichter said, "in good times less than other times. We're in good times now and still finding them. Big companies are downsizing and a lot of small ones are growing and taking their place."
Keith Dee, president of Estec Corporation, moved into 43,000 square feet at Mr. Lichter's New Britain complex from a 9,000-square-foot location in Chester, Conn. "We are planning to expand into another 20,000 feet," said Mr. Dee, whose company remanufactures 10- to 50-year-old machines for the aerospace industry. "We needed more space and could find very little in manufacturing space anywhere in the state. Our rent here is 70 percent less than Chester; below market." Because the factory is in an area designated by the state as an enterprise zone, he said, his company also receives benefits. Such benefits, for areas designated as needing economic stimulus, include savings on state taxes and grants for hiring employees who live within the enterprise zone.
In designated towns, Connecticut gives property tax abatements of up to 80 percent for up to 10 years, depending on how much is spent on renovating or constructing industrial and commercial buildings. Towns regard the zones as "a short-term reduction in revenues," said Keith Chapman, Newington's tax assessor, "against the real potential for growth."
AS office rents go up and concessions such as periods of free rent disappear, "People are looking for opportunities with an economic upside," said David Simpson, senior vice president in CB Commercial's office in Teaneck, N.J.
"Since 1992 we've done about 3 million square feet of turnaround renovations," said Gene Diaz, senior vice president at Gale & Wentworth, developers in Florham Park, N.J. One current project, in New Providence, N.J., is the conversion into luxury offices of a 33-year-old former Prudential distribution center of 220,000 square feet on 14 acres. "We are converting the loading docks into an atrium entranceway, resurfacing the brick exterior, demolishing 50,000 square feet to meet parking requirements, installing a marble floor and wood-paneled walls," Mr. Diaz said. "We have office leases pending at $22 a foot. That's about $3 below market."
Even at the low rent, after paying $7 million for the building and an estimated $4 million on renovations, there is still enough profit built in, he said. The neighborhood, at Spring Street at Central Avenue, had been industrial but shifted to mixed use, and now, Mr. Diaz says, "office conversions will keep going."
A former 1960's Insilco silver-plating plant on 11 acres in Clifton, N.J., bought by BASF in the 80's, is one of three New Jersey industrial buildings to be acquired in recent months by Reckson Associates Realty Corporation. Its size will be reduced from 205,000 to 180,000 square feet to accommodate 4 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet.
"We bought it in April for around $4 million and renovations will be many times that," said Mark Schaevitz, senior vice president at Reckson's West Orange office. "Two hundred fifty thousand cars a day pass it on the Garden State Parkway at the junction of Route 3, which begins at the Lincoln Tunnel," Mr. Schaevitz said. "Visibility and access for commuters is highly desirable, and we have it in spades." Asking rents will be $23 a foot, compared with industrial rents of $7 or $8 a foot.
The New York Times's 581,000-square-foot former printing plant in Carlstadt, N.J., was sold last year to Security Capital Industrial Trust, a real estate investment trust with buildings containing 100 million square feet in the United States and Europe. "We reduced it to 460,000 square feet and will spend up to $4 million on renovations for warehousing," said Michael Nachamkin, vice president and marketing officer for the trust.
While sales and conversions have been brisk for old factories, a major deterrent has been industrial pollution and the tangle of litigation and possible financial losses that can accompany cleanup efforts. Following a Federal court battle in which the town of Sleepy Hollow in Westchester tried to get G.M. to clean up its 75-year-old automotive plant, the company volunteered to return the site to pristine condition after demolition by 1999, said Sleepy Hollow's Mayor, Sean Tracy.
ANTIQUATED and unadaptable, closed since 1995, the property was rezoned from industrial to residential and commercial in line with G.M.'s proposal for redeveloping the site with housing, retail, public access to the riverfront and linkage with the Hudson Valley Greenway System. Mayor Tracy said a plan for 1,900 costly homes in the community of 8,200 people was solidly opposed at a public hearing. The Mayor added: "They say they will have a new concept to present early in 1998 aimed for construction in 2000. I'll believe it when I see it."
A contaminated 28-acre riverfront tract that Anaconda had occupied for a century in Hastings-on-Hudson has gone through a succession of owners since the 70's, but remains polluted. Theodore Kheel, president of the Earth Pledge Foundation, a nonprofit agency that hopes to develop housing, a theater and restaurant on the site, said that its current owners, Alpers Holding USA and Harbor at Hastings, are mired in litigation against each other over money.
Anxious to rid themselves of the property, they are unable to do so, because the contamination by Anaconda must be cleaned up by Atlantic Richfield, a former owner assigned to the task by the Federal Department of Conservation. Atlantic Richfield has made no move toward a cleanup, Mr. Kheel said.
It took 12 years and $21 million for the 316,000-square-foot, 37-acre Singer Sewing Machine plant in Bridgewater Township, N.J., to rid itself of contamination from pollution. "Only $5 million was recovered in the sale," said Paul D. Cohen, executive vice president for SBWE, a real estate brokerage in Edison. "ATS Wood Products bought it and has it on the market for retail, because it's in an area that is developing with shopping malls."
"It's a scary, high risk business," Mr. Lichter said. "These buildings are huge. Lots of space to rent, lots of money to lose waiting to fill them."

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A survey released last month by state labor officials begins to answer the question of whether new jobs being created in New Jersey are good ones, or whether they're low-paying jobs that offer few benefits.
The study said jobs with the fastest projected percentage growth from 1994 to 2005 tended to be higher-paying positions, including computer programmers (with wages averaging $26.59 an hour), computer engineers ($24.37) and securities and financial sales representatives ($25.67). 
 But the salary picture is less bright when viewed in terms of the actual number of jobs that analysts expect will be added to the economy, according to the report, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the state Department of Labor.
Jobs accounting for the greatest projected employment increase included seven occupations that all paid less than $10 an hour: nursing aides, waiters and waitresses, home health aides, janitors, salespeople, cashiers and guards,
The three highest-paying jobs on this list were systems analysts ($26.59), marketing and sales supervisors ($19.81) and nurses ($22.46).
The study on earnings was released the same month the Federal Government reported New Jersey's jobless rate was the lowest in more than seven years. The rate fell from 5.2 percent in October to 4.9 percent in November, when New Jersey employers added 8,500 jobs to the economy.
Most of the new jobs gained in November were in service industries, which posted 6,800 new jobs. Business services rose by 2,200 because of a 2,600-job increase in temporary help and employment agencies. Health care added 1,200 jobs, split about equally between hospitals and other health services. Factories added 1,500 jobs in November.
There were 4,156,700 people working in New Jersey in November. That includes commuters who work in New Jersey but live elsewhere.

Out of Work and Out of Luck? She Will Help

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD

 BODY:
SHE has seen them coming in from Bennett Road looking stunned, knowing that they have lost jobs through downsizing or plant closings, and she has seen them cry at how losing work led to the breakup of a marriage or the loss of a house, and it has touched her.
And because it touched her, Ann F. McNierney -- who comes out of Our Lady of Refuge Parish in the Bronx, a Roman Catholic education and work experience in teaching, school administration and business -- has worked that much harder, colleagues say. With almost a religious zeal, she tries to make sure her clients get back to work, and back to finding that self-respect and self-confidence that has been so shaken. 
 She has only one small cubicle in the employment service office of the State Department of Labor here. But the people who come to her for job counseling find a refuge and the concern a mother might give her children as she helps them get the training they need for a new start.
And they in turn send letters of appreciation to the office, singling her out for thanks, using words like consideration, concern and guidance. "She is really a credit to your Work Force program," one woman wrote. Another wrote, "Ms. McNierney's attitude was such a refreshing and unexpected change."
Such comments help explain why she holds the title of Counselor of the Year from the State Labor Department.
"She produces just about twice what other people working in the program produce," says Ellen Yedwab, her supervisor. "It's amazing. She counsels twice the number of people, gets them into the program and brings them through it successfully."
Ms. McNierney, who joined the Department of Labor as a counselor in early 1993, works in the Work Force Development Partnership, a state-financed vocational training program that allows experienced workers who have been laid off to get the skills they need to return to the workplace.
She assesses their situations, tries to console them, gives them a packet listing training programs in vocational schools and two-year and four-year colleges, and encourages them to research at least three of the programs before deciding which is best. Then the state provides tuition grants directly to the schools.
Work Force was created in 1992, at a time when unemployment in New Jersey was high as many companies were folding, merging or downsizing. The program was recently extended because even today, with unemployment dropping to 4.9 percent in November -- the first time in seven years it has gone below 5 percent -- there is still a sense of anxiety as downsizing continues and technology changes the face of business and industry. Even those who have been getting technological training don't always feel they are as well off as before and fear they could lose their jobs again.
"I saw people not only lose their jobs, but lose their houses, lose their families," Ms. McNierney says in her soft-spoken manner. "We're dealing with a lot more than just training and work. We're working with individuals who react in different ways to their unemployment, people who have worked 23 to 25 years with the same company, single parents, people whose husbands are dead who have to support families or support themselves, O.K.? A tremendous amount of counseling."
One woman, who lived alone and craved company after she lost her job as a receptionist, often went to do a load of wash at the laundromat just to be with someone.
Another woman broke down in tears as Ms. McNierney interviewed her.
"And I said: 'What's the matter? What's the problem?' She said: 'I have to get up in the morning. I have to get dressed. I have to go to work. I can't cope with being home. I just cant.'
"So we put her into a training program, and she came in the first or second day of training and said: 'I love it. Thank you. Thank you so much. I have something to do every day.' And she got another job as soon as she finished training."
She adds: "We saw several people from Pan Am who not only lost their jobs, but the pension plan they had counted on. And you know, they were 50 to 55 years old; they had children in college. So there was a great deal of counseling as well."
PATRICIA A. REED, manager of employment services in Jersey City, who was Ms. McNierney's supervisor, was so impressed with her work that last year she nominated her for Counselor of the Year.
In the letter, Ms. Reed said Ms. McNierney assumed the workload of a counselor who was on a six-month leave of absence and came in early and worked through lunch hour to handle it. Ms. Reed also noted that through Ms. McNierney's years of experience in education and business, she had researched all the services available to clients and built up her own network of people and organizations to refer them to.
Ms. McNierney also served as acting supervisor in Ms. Reed's absence, but when she was encouraged to become a supervisor, she declined.
"She wants to spend all her time helping the clients," Ms. Reed said. "Have you heard about all the thank-you letters she gets? I've never seen anything like that with any other counselor. She goes out of her way for every person. She listens to what they're saying. She's very calming."
Ann Fitzpatrick was born and bred in the Fordham section of the Bronx. Her father, an immigrant from Ireland, was a New York City firefighter. She won a four-year scholarship from the department's Holy Name Society to attend Holy Cross Academy in Manhattan, where she grew attached to the Sisters of Charity, and went on to attend a college operated by the order, Mount Saint Vincent in Riverdale. There she took courses emphasizing commerce and education.
After working full time as a secretary to the technical director of the Borden Company and part time as a teacher in secretarial schools, she received her master's degree in education several years later from Fordham University, where she focused on guidance and counseling.
She married a young man she met on a blind date, Edward McNierney, moved to Maywood in Bergen County and, after staying home to rear their five children, went back to work as dean of the Taylor Business Institute in Paramus, where she developed curriculums, like programs for medical and legal secretaries.
She then spent five years as director of guidance in the Fairview school system. She joined the State Department of Education in 1982 as a supervisor of student services and special education for a vocational education program in Newark called the Center for Occupational Education, Experimentation and Demonstration. At the center in Newark, she set up a career program for students, including many with physical and mental disabilities, in 23 different vocational training areas.
Despite its success in helping so many students find their way in the world, the program was eliminated in June 1992.
"I was terribly disappointed," she said. "It was devastating, and I spent a lot of time with the parents of handicapped children trying to save it."
And, for the first time, she was without a job herself.
ONE of the major changes she has seen in the five years in her present job is the growth of the computer and the constant need to upgrade computer skills.
"I've had had advertising managers come in, six-figure salaries; they lost their jobs because they don't have the graphics skills," she says. "I find once they have graphic design skills, they get a job right away."
She adds, "The same way with draftsmen, engineers. I've had people with master's in engineering, and they don't have the latest computer skill.
"We have a lot of clerks, secretaries laid off because they don't have computer skills, even though they have a solid work history and are people-oriented. They've had good evaluations, some of them huge salaries."
Often people take jobs at lower salaries than they were earning before, and she advises them early on to be realistic in salary expectations. In fields like electronics, however, after training, her clients often will make more money in new jobs.
In the end, she says, her job is about meeting people. "It's not just the paperwork or getting people into training," she says, "but helping solve people's problems, helping to reduce their stress."
Aside from the good she does on her job, she and her husband, who retired as project manager for tenant planning and design at the World Trade Center after the 1993 bombing killed several of his colleagues, volunteer their time to feed and shelter the homeless at Holy Trinity Church in Hackensack and a family shelter in the former St. Cecilia's High School in Englewood. She also served on the Maywood Board of Education from 1976 to 1980, the last year as president.
Of these acts, she explains, "I need to help people."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Mack-Cali Realty Corporation;
From Two Family Firms, a 'Super-Regional REIT'

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
NOT long ago they were family-run New Jersey real estate companies that competed head to head in the suburban office market in the northern part of the state.
Now, in a move that underscores the growing public ownership of real estate, the Cali Realty Corporation of Cranford, which became a real estate investment trust in 1994, has merged with the Mack Company of Rochelle Park. 
 The $1.2 billion transaction, announced in August and closed last month, involved the sale of 9.2 million square feet of offices. It elevates Mack-Cali Realty Corporation to one of the largest office real estate investment trusts in the country, with 22 million square feet in 187 buildings and assets of $3.5 billion. REIT's are entities that invest in real estate, paying most of their earnings as dividends to shareholders.
Mack-Cali's holdings also include the Patriot American Office Group, a building owner in Texas and Arizona. "Spreading its wings could buffer the company from the vagaries of one market and make it more appealing for other private companies to join," said David Csontos, a managing director at the Saddle Brook office of the Insignia/Edward S. Gordon national brokerage company.
Most of the space Mack-Cali owns is in markets from suburban Philadelphia to Fairfield County, Conn. and half is in New Jersey. It controls 8 percent of the space in the state's 11-county northern and central market and 20 percent of Class A offices, which with an 8.3 percent vacancy rate is the tightest segment. The average asking rent for such space was $24.43 a square foot as of the third quarter of 1997, up from $22.74 in 1996, said Cushman & Wakefield, another national brokerage.
Thomas A. Rizk. chief executive officer of Mack-Cali, said the company's goal is to become "the dominant super-regional REIT in the Northeast" and said the merger "gives us beachheads in the Southwest."
Mack-Cali is a force to be reckoned with, but its share of the state's 140 million square feet of offices is too small to influence rents marketwide, said David Bernhaut of the Financial Services Group at Cushman & Wakefield. But, he said, it could affect rents in submarkets where it predominates.
The company faces increased competition. In the last year, Reckson Associates Realty Corporation of Melville, N.Y., a public REIT, and Wellsford Commercial Properties Trust, a private REIT in Chatham, N.J., entered the scene. National REIT's, including Crescent Real Estate Equities of Dallas, are also trying to gain a foothold in New Jersey, which is fertile ground for building sales because of the availability of capital, a tight market and a lack of construction. In the year just ended, 12.1 million square feet of space, valued at $1.1 billion, was sold or was under contract to be sold. Last year, $900 millionworth of properties was sold, Cushman & Wakefield said.
The rise in so-called equity real estate trusts in New Jersey mirrors that in the rest of the country. In 1996 there were 166 such REIT's, up from 86 in 1991, said the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, a trade group in Washington.
Their growth has raised concerns. "There is too much money chasing far too few quality properties, which will lead to higher prices and lower returns," said David T. Houston of Colliers Houston & Company, a brokerage in Teaneck. "If the upside for REIT's is based on the continued escalation of rents, how much farther can rents go up?"
Mr. Bernhaut said the bidding competition has forced up prices for Class A properties in the state to $150 to $175 a square foot. Several deals were over $200 a square foot, he said, which is above the $180 a square foot needed to make new construction possible.
What the presence of REIT's will mean when the next economic downturn comes is still unclear. But some industry executives like Douglas H. Haynes, president of Alexander Summer, a brokerage in Paramus, say that the liquidity provided by REIT's will smooth the real estate cycle, and that the discipline of the stock market will prevent the kind of lending that fueled the mid-80's building boom.
Becoming a REIT has benefited Cali, founded as a development company in 1949 by two brothers, John and Angelo Cali, and their friend Edward Leshowitz. When it went public in 1994 it had 13 buildings with 2.2 million feet of space. Since then, Mr. Rizk has led the company's growth, including the acquisition last January of the Robert Martin Company, a leading office developer in Westchester County, and now the merger with the Mack Company.
Mr. Rizk shrugged off the competition. With the Mack company incorporated, "we have over 100 years of development and real estate experience, and between our size, tenant base and network of relationships, we feel we have a big competitive advantage," he said.
ANOTHER advantage, many said, is the bankable name of William Mack, who, with his brothers, Earle, Fred and David, are the third generation to run the family company founded at the turn of the century. William Mack is known on Wall Street as a savvy investor from his involvement as a partner in the Apollo Fund, which buys underperforming properties worldwide.
Joining a REIT benefits private developers, who pay no capital gains taxes when they swap their buildings and land for REIT partnership units. Investors are only taxed when the partnership units are converted to REIT shares.
For Mack, which was attracted to the favorable tax treatments as well as the access to capital a REIT provides, the merger "presents us with enormous opportunities," said William Mack, who is director and chairman of the executive committee at Mack-Cali. His family has an 18 percent equity stake in the new company.
Mitchell Hersh, chief operating officer at Mack and now president and chief operating officer at Mack-Cali, said a REIT "was the logical way to continue to grow our company."
"Since our companies share many things in common," he said, "joining with Cali was a natural fit."
Mack-Cali's merger is fueled by a sense that investors will reward size and diversity. A bigger company, said Louis W. Taylor, senior real estate analyst at Prudential Securities, can command lower borrowing rates, funnel more money into acquisitions and reduce administrative costs.
With the ability to raise $1 billion, Mack-Cali intends to continue to grow in New Jersey, particularly in major submarkets where the company is underrepresented, Mr. Rizk said. One is the Princeton Route 1 corridor, where the company is reported to have purchased a 159,000-square-foot building and is said to be vying for Carnegie Center, a 1.8-million-square-foot office park with land for another 2.2 million feet in West Windsor. Another is Morris County, where Mack-Cali is reported to be a top contender for the Prudential Business Campus, a 875,357-square-foot office center with land for 1.4 million more feet of space, straddling Parsippany and East Hanover. Mr. Rizk declined to comment on either the Princeton Route 1 reports or the status of the Prudential Business campus negotiations.
Mr. Bernhaut of Cushman & Wakefield said that as the supply of so-called trophy properties in New Jersey shrinks, he expects REIT's to go after Class B properties and eventually to start to develop new office buildings.
Mr. Hersh, however, said Mack-Cali would pursue its growth through the acquisition of family real estate companies and properties in other regional markets and the Southwest as well as residential and build-to-suit development in New Jersey. As a result of the merger, the company has enough land in New Jersey alone to do seven million square feet of development, more that half of it along the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City.
"The Northeast is not yet ready for significant speculative development," Mr. Hersh said, adding that the company, because of its expanded tenant base, will seize opportunities to build for specific tenants.
One property for which the company will be seeking development possibilities is the Harborside Financial Center on the waterfront in Jersey City, which Cali purchased last year. It includes 1.9 million square feet of existing office space, land to develop 4.1 million more feet of offices and two piers. The piers are zoned for residential or mixed uses, including a hotel. On the north pier Mack-Cali envisions the development of 200 to 300 low- rise residences; on the south pier a hotel of about 200 to 300 rooms. In terms of a development schedule, Mr. Hersh said: "I would not rule out starting development on one or both of the piers in 1998."

HEADLINE: AT THE SHORE;
A Singular Elephant That May Be in Danger of Extinction

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
For more than a century, Lucy the Elephant, the enormous beachfront pachyderm in Margate City, has withstood storms, neglect, commercial development and the threat of the wrecking ball to become a popular seashore landmark.
Now, it is at risk again. The Save Lucy Committee, once a popular charity among Atlantic City casinos, civic groups and local beachgoers, has seen donations dwindle since it won a $305,190 matching grant from the New Jersey Historic Trust in 1995 to complete renovations. Previous contributions, mostly from casinos, helped the committee match one-third of that amount. It must raise the remaining $200,000 by September or lose the rest of the grant. 
 Such a loss would not threaten Lucy with extinction, said Josephine Harron, the committee's president. Margate City pays the structure's utility bills, and operating expenses are covered by admission fees, profits from the gift shop, an annual crafts show and summer rental fees for a snack bar.
"But it would leave us with an unfinished building, which in itself would be vulnerable to any kind of problem we can imagine," Ms. Harron said. "The problems we've been having in the last 20 years have all been with things we couldn't imagine, from interior rust and corrosion to humidity, insect infestations and the rotting of the wooden structural supports. We'd get the funding to fix one thing and find a dozen other things in worse shape.
"Now, if any other major problem comes up, it will force us to close, and even if nothing major happened, we'd still have nothing to pay for even the simplest repairs. One big storm, and we're out of business."
In the past, Ms. Harron said, the committee could depend on contributions from the casinos, which also promoted Lucy as a tourist attraction for gamblers and convention visitors with families. Those contributions ended last year, she said.
Michael DiLeva, community affairs director for Harrah's Atlantic City, confirmed that Harrah's, which had previously contributed money from its video arcade to the committee, was "not going to do anything to help Lucy out."
"We were able to provide a lot of support for a while," he said. "But there are other organizations, like the United Way, the Community Food Bank and the Atlantic City Rescue Mission, that need help."
Ms. Herron said she was also turned down by the Casino Reinvestment and Development Authority, the state agency that channels casino profits into civic improvements.
The authority's director, James Kennedy, said: "We got their application, but there hasn't been a compelling need to deal with it. When you're criticized for not building enough low-income housing, it's real hard to do an elephant."
Margaret Westfield, the architect who has supervised Lucy's restoration since 1992 and helped write the committee's Historic Trust grant application, speculated that the real problem might be "that we've tried to stay as far out of politics as we can."
"It's possible that because Lucy is in Margate, which doesn't have the urban problems that Atlantic City has, the C.R.D.A. can think we're not that important," she said. "But if you look in Lucy's guest book or spend time in the gift shop, you'll see that people from all over world come to New Jersey just to see Lucy."
She admitted that the Save Lucy Committee had not done an economic impact study to establish exactly how much tourist money Lucy brought to the state.
That assumption was one of the factors that won Lucy two matching grants from the Historic Trust, the first in 1992, for $182,390; the second in 1995. The Historic Trust's chairman, Donald Sanderson, said his organization stayed "absolutely removed from politics" in awarding grants.
Yet a key criterion is the grant recipient's ability to match the funds. "The match is absolutely critical," Mr. Sanderson said. "Grants are not awarded if the the funding to match them isn't in place. It's clear that there have been some drastic changes in Lucy's status in the last two years. Whatever the casinos were doing for her back then was certainly taken into account."
If the Save Lucy Committee fails to raise $200,000 by September, "that money disappears for good," Mr. Sanderson said. "They can't reapply for more because the trust has no money left and there isn't a state bond issue awaiting approval that would give us more."
Ms. Harron said she was embarrassed to see her organization put in a competitive relationship with other charities. "There's no question that people who can't get enough to eat, or don't have a roof over their heads, need as much help as they can get," she said. "Saving lives and saving a landmark is not the same thing.
"But to go from being something that the casinos were proud to support, to absolutely nothing in two years, is something I just cannot understand."
At 74, she added, she is "not too proud to beg."
"I've done it before," she said. "I'll do it again."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT/MUTUAL FUNDS;
Niche Providers Out of the Shadow of Megamanagers

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
AT a time when big Wall Street houses are acquiring smaller rivals to build the critical mass they believe is needed to compete, two highly regarded managers have chosen to follow the David model, not the Goliath.
In August 1996, two months after Merrill Lynch acquired Hotchkis & Wiley, Tad Rivelle and Laird Landmann, principals and co-directors of fixed income at Hotchkis, left to form Metropolitan West Asset Management in Los Angeles. 
 Their philosophy is that niche providers of investment management services can better serve clients than megamanagers can. Their clients seem to agree.
They are now managing $1.8 billion for institutional clients including the Mayo Foundation of Rochester, Minn.; the Keyspan Energy Corporation, the holding company for Brooklyn Union Gas, and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer of Collegeville, Pa. This flies in the face of a prediction by Goldman, Sachs last year that 20 or so companies, each with more than $150 billion of assets, would dominate the money-management industry by the end of the century.
What is more, at the end of March 1997, Metropolitan West established two no-load, fixed-income mutual funds: the Low Duration fund, which invests in short-term securities, and the Total Return fund, which holds longer-term securities. They have attracted nearly $100 million in assets even though they are too new to be rated by Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking firm in Chicago. But no wonder. Managing similar funds at Hotchkis, the two men had stellar records, and their new funds are now outperforming both the Hotchkis funds and the indexes. Both funds invest in a variety of debt securities including Treasuries, investment-grade corporates, money-market instruments and asset-backed securities.
As of Tuesday, the Total Return fund, net of fees, was yielding 11.7 percent, compared with 10.1 percent for the similar Hotchkis fund and 10.0 percent for the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, while the Low Duration fund was yielding 6.8 percent, compared with 6.3 percent for the similar Hotchkis fund and 5.8 percent for the Merrill Lynch 1- to 3-Year Treasury index.
"Mr. Rivelle's funds are off to a great start because he carried over his philosophy to the new funds," said Alice Lowenstein, fixed-income editor at Morningstar Mutual Funds, the Morningstar newsletter.
She added that she would recommend the funds mainly because the managers concentrated on strategies that add value to a bond fund, like buying undervalued securities or focusing on the less expensive areas of the fixed-income market. They also minimize bets on interest rates, which can avoid the potential for a big misstep. "The past performance records of the managers speak for themselves," she said.
In 1994, when the bond market had one of its worst years ever, no fixed-income mutual fund manager did better than Mr. Rivelle. His Low Duration fund at Hotchkis was the country's No. 1 performer, rising 5.18 percent when competing finds were down an average of 3.3 percent.
This record was one of the factors that made Hotchkis attractive to Merrill. Though the two new Metropolitan funds, of course, are not clones of the Hotchkis portfolios, they have similar investment styles.
"Metropolitan West Asset Management's fixed-income philosophy has been designed with the goal of consistently outperforming a client's benchmark while maintaining low volatility," Mr. Landmann said.
He added that such outperformance was gained through measured application of five "value-added" strategies:
* Maintaining the average maturity of securities within the fund. Mr. Landmann said that because managing interest-rate risk is a cornerstone of their philosophy, Metropolitan does not buy bonds with maturities that raise or lower the portfolio's average duration by more than a year.
* Managing yield curve, which means including a mix of maturities that are appropriate for each portfolio.
* Using all sectors of the bond market and other fixed-income instruments, like corporate and mortgage-backed securities.
* Looking for undervalued securities.
* Using buying and selling strategies that involve more securities firms to get the best possible price.
By applying this discipline, the two have succeeded with funds they started at what many would call a bad time -- six days after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, pushing bond prices lower. Talk of further Fed action was heard most of last year, but the Fed did not tighten again, and bond prices have rallied, sending the yield on the long bond to less than 6 percent, from 7 percent.
"We don't have any special skills in predicting the direction of interest rates or whether corporate bonds will do better than mortgage bonds," Mr. Rivelle said, "but we recognize the connection between rates and the business cycle."
Each quarter, in discussions with members of their fixed-income team, they review that cycle and economic and market developments. From this review, major themes are identified as the keys to what drives the economy and the Federal Reserve, Mr. Rivelle and Mr. Landmann said.
ALTHOUGH relatively young, the two have been in the investment business long enough to have acquired impressive credentials.
Mr. Rivelle, 36, received a bachelor's degree in physics from Yale University, a master's degree in applied mathematics from the University of Southern California and an M.B.A. from U.C.L.A. He has 11 years of investment experience, especially in mortgage-backed and corporate securities. Before joining Hotchkis & Wiley, he was portfolio manager and a vice president at the Pacific Investment Management Company (Pimco), and before that he was involved in developing asset-allocation investment models at Scudder, Stevens & Clark.
Mr. Landmann, 34, received a bachelor's degree in economics with honors from Dartmouth College and an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. At Hotchkis & Wiley, he obtained experience in futures, options and corporate securities, and like Mr. Rivelle was a portfolio manager and vice president of Pimco. Before that, he was a derivatives specialist with Morgan Stanley's fixed-income division, where he learned hedging strategies.

Still High on Low-Flying Technology Stocks

BYLINE: By MARCIA VICKERS 

 BODY:
TECHNOLOGY is in a slump. Wall Street has been getting nervous about the sector, and it has been hit hard by the Asian crisis. But Michael Murphy, long a fan of the field, is as high on it as ever.
Mr. Murphy, founder and editor of the California Technology Stock Letter and author of "Every Investor's Guide to High-Tech Stocks and Mutual Funds" (Broadway Books, $27.50), to be published this week, contends that technology's recent troubles are due to misconceptions, not fundamentals. 
 From his offices in Half Moon Bay, Calif., Mr. Murphy, 56, argues that most investors are seriously underweighted in technology, which is the main sector in what he calls the "new economy," and seriously overweighted in the venerable corporations of the "old economy." Indeed, rather than allocate assets only according to stocks, bonds and so forth, Mr. Murphy would also do so by "new economy" holdings and "old economy" holdings.
Recently, Mr. Murphy, who manages individual portfolios and three mutual funds that specialize in technology, discussed how to do research in this complex field, how to pick winners and how to limit the industry's high risks.
Q. The technology sector finished 1997 down nearly 14 percent from its yearly high. Do you think that presents an opportunity?
A. Yes. I take very seriously what's going on in the Far East, but I think Wall Street's got it backward. The companies that are hurt the most are those that depend on consumer sales there -- soft-drink companies, tennis shoe companies, airlines. The effect on technology is rather limited. Yet that's been one of the groups that's been devastated by Wall Street.
Q. Why?
A. Wall Street looks and says: "Gee, there are problems in the Far East. Who does business in the Far East? Let's sell their stock." A lot of semiconductor companies, for example, make chips here, ship them to the Far East to be assembled and then they come back into the United States and are put into computer or communication systems.
But why would it hurt these semiconductor companies to have these countries' currencies collapse? After all, production costs are lowered.
Of course, semiconductor equipment companies do sell a lot to Korean and Japanese semiconductor manufacturers. But think for a second about how you would get yourself out of this mess if you were in one of these countries. You would not build ships and automobiles and tennis shoes. That's where the excesses are. Instead, you'd focus on businesses with double-digit growth. That's basically technology; there's nothing else growing that fast.
Q. So there must be other factors at play in the technology slump?
A. I think it's all psychology at this point. For example, there was a fear that personal-computer sales would not grow at all in the December quarter, that they'd be flat versus last year. That fear was expressed in a lot of Wall Street reports.
Well, it's now clear that we're going to be up 15 percent in terms of dollars, 18 percent in terms of units, in the quarter, just like in every other quarter in 1997. And for 1998, the lowest forecast I've seen is 13 1/2 percent. So I think it's a great time to be buying these stocks.
Q. How fast is the technology sector growing?
A. About 20 percent a year, right now. And because it's been doing that for a while, it's up to about 15 percent of the total economy.
Q. You've said that Wall Street is sometimes lazy when it comes to covering technology. Why is that?
A. More than 90 percent of analysts are still covering the old economies, either the old mass-production economy, which is where most of the big, comfortable corporate names are, or the even older industrial economy. The reason -- I'm a little cynical, I guess -- is that Wall Street puts its research where the investment banking fees are going to be. And most technology companies are like Microsoft: They do one public offering, once. They don't do secondary offerings. They don't raise a lot of capital. They may occasionally do an acquisition, but not many; a lot of the growth is internal.
As a result, there are a lot of technology companies out there, even with market capitalizations of $100 million to $200 million, that have very little or no coverage.
Q. Then how should the average investor get technology information?
A. These are the best of times for the average investor on that score. Because they don't get coverage from Wall Street, most of these companies now have Web sites where their public-relations firms have written a corporate overview that gives you a lot of the basic facts. All the press releases and the numbers will also be there. The companies have really helpful investor-relations people, too.
The reason for all this help is that technology companies really want individual stockholders. They feel too exposed when their stock is 70 or 80 percent held by institutions and all those institutions are listening only to two analysts. You know, one of them might wake up in the morning a little grumpy and there goes the stock price, down 30 percent.
Q. How do you define technology enterprises?
A. The key differentiator for technology companies is that they spend a lot of money on research and development. We like to see them spend at least 7 percent of annual revenues on R & D. The reason R & D is important is that by creating new products a company helps create its own demand. Nobody knew they had to be on the Internet five years ago. But now it is available and now people believe they have to be on it.
Q. How can you tell if R & D money is being wasted?
A. There are a couple of ways. The first is the common-sense test. Here's a wonderful example. Some years ago, a company was working on doing electrocardiograms of dogs over the telephone. This thing had a $60 million marketing capitalization when it went public, and they'd only done about seven tests. In this system, you called up and gave them your Visa card and they sent you a couple of little rubber cups and you put one over the phone and one over the dog and dialed a special number. I mean, there was a product and they were spending a lot of money on it, but it was just stupid.
Second, if the company is spending a significant amount of money on R & D, ask the investor-relations person, "What percentage of your revenues come from products you've introduced in the last three years?" That number ought to be about 50 percent. If not, then you've got a legitimate question to ask.
This is I.B.M.'s problem. It spends more on R & D than anybody else -- about $6 billion a year -- and yet far less than half of its revenues come from new products.
Q. Explain growth flow -- your method for picking technology stocks.
A. Growth flow is similar to cash flow, a concept people are used to. Cash flow is earnings plus depreciation, and the reason you care about it is that both earnings and depreciation belong to the shareholders.
In an old-economy company, there is a lot of depreciation. But most technology companies don't have a lot. What they do have that would be an expense, but is really an investment for shareholders, is R & D.
So if you add earnings per share to R & D per share you get growth flow. And the advantage of it is that the ratio of stock price to growth flow will tip you off that a stock is cheap before the price-earnings ratio will. And you'll have enough time to go in there, see if they're doing all that R & D on something of interest to you, if the management is able and so on. Later, when the R & D results in new products and the new products result in an increase in earnings, Wall Street will pile on because, of course, they only look at earnings.
Q. What are some good growth-flow companies?
A. LSI Logic is a semiconductor company that has had earnings of about $1.15 a share for the last 12 months. The R & D per share is $1.30 -- they actually spend more on R & D per share than they're reporting in earnings. The management could slash the R & D and report much better earnings, and Wall Street would undoubtedly run the stock from where it is today, which is about a little over $20, up to $30.
But that would be a very short-term thing to do. Instead, LSI Logic will invest the money, produce new products and drive up earnings. The stock's going not only to $30, but to $40 or $45. We actually have a target of $50 for that stock.
Many other companies that are dominant in their niches are spending more or almost more on R & D than they report in earnings. They include Credence Systems, which makes semiconductor testers; Adobe Systems, the software company, and Diamond Multimedia, which makes add-on boards for graphics and modems for computers.
Q. How can investors avoid the dogs out there?
A. There are a couple of ways. You can just say: "Look, I don't have enough time to do this full time. I'm just going to focus on the very best companies -- the Microsofts and Cisco Systems and Oracles and Intels." But instead of buying them at whatever P-E they are and getting killed on the stock price, buy them only when they're down. Of that list of maybe 100 or 120 companies that qualify as great growth-flow technology companies, it's amazing how many of them will have a time when they get cheap because they maybe missed a quarter's earnings by 2 cents a share or Wall Street gets worried about Korea or whatever.
Q. If you own a technology stock, how low should it go before you bail out?
A. Well, you can say: "I'm a long-term investor. As long as the growth-flow numbers look attractive, I'm staying." Or use a mechanical approach and say, "If this stock goes down 20 percent, I'm going to exit on the theory that somebody knows something I don't know or something was wrong with my analysis." I wouldn't use 15 percent; I think it's too tight in a technology company. Then wait until the stock bottoms and, once it starts to lift, go back in it if you still want to be involved.
Q. Do you have any advice for investors who like technology stocks but find them too volatile?
A. There are a couple of things you can do. Instead of owning tech stocks, you could own tech mutual funds. That would spread the risk somewhat. Or you can buy technology convertible bonds. Convertibles have about half the risk of the underlying common stock and they give you about 85 percent of the return that the stock will give you.
Third, don't buy all the same types of stocks. If the first stock you buy is in semiconductor equipment, maybe the next should be in software. And if those first two are roughly in the electronics area, maybe the third should be biotech. When I started following these stocks in 1970, it was the mainframe computer business and they pretty much all moved together. Now, there's much diversity.
Q. Are you particularly bullish or bearish on any sector?
A. The area we're most bullish on is semiconductor equipment, just because the stocks have been hit so hard. We're bullish on biotechnology, too, because it is finally at the point where a lot of products are being approved. Through 1994, three biotech products a year, on average, were approved. In 1995, it jumped to six. In 1996, there were 13; in 1997, almost 30. In 1998, it will be 50.
We're not terribly bearish on any sectors, but we are most negative on the Internet infrastructure software companies -- even though we're big believers in the Internet in general. Most infrastructure companies, which make the browsers and servers and fire walls, are not making money yet. It's a very competitive area, too, with every graduate student in computer science wanting to be the next Marc Andreessen and start the next Netscape.
Q. How should the average investor get started in technology?
A. Put some money into a biotech fund, a broad-based tech fund and then maybe some into a specialty fund that's done well, say one of the software funds or telecommunications funds. If you only want mutual funds and not individual stocks, that's fine. The big driver for future rates of return is what percentage of your assets you put into this area.
Think of it as asset allocation. People think now in terms of stocks and bonds and cash and maybe real estate or foreign stocks. I think you really have to think of it in terms of old-economy and new-economy stocks, bonds, cash and so forth. And make a decision on what percentage of your assets is going to be in these new-economy stocks. The last change like this was in the early 1900's. The people who earned the really high returns recognized that a new economy was under way and shifted assets into that area.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Managers Wanted: Will Train. Start Immed. Bonu$.

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
WHEN Clint Prescott lost his job managing a country club in Oregon in July, he was exasperated. Even after 25 years in the private club industry, he was not about to hunt for another job at a member-owned club where, he said, internal politics could again put his job in jeopardy. "I wanted one or two bosses, not 500," he said.
Besides interviewing for management jobs, Mr. Prescott also checked in with Robert William James & Associates, a temporary-placement company in Bend, Ore. "I was looking to be placed with a client," Mr. Prescott, 44, said. Instead, he got a permanent job, hired by Robert William James itself as a headhunter trainee. 
 The firm had been searching long and hard to fill the slot and had rejected 100 applicants. Upon hiring Mr. Prescott, it pledged to give him on-the-job training to convert his country-club hiring talent to recruiting for management-hungry resorts and restaurants.
"We made a conscious decision that we would have to train someone to get the best quality for the price," said Scott Pillar, managing director of Robert William James, a franchise of Express Personnel Services in Oklahoma City. Because the labor market is tight, recruiters are especially precious, and experienced ones are unavailable, said Mr. Pillar, who had been the sole recruiter at the 11-person company.
General managers in professional sports use a familiar strategy in times of weak player drafts: pick the best athlete available, regardless of position. These days, that tactic is spreading -- increasingly, applicants like Mr. Prescott find that they can take advantage of some employers' willingness to train new people rather than recruit for a perfect match.
In fact, the tight labor market is creating many advantageous job-hopping opportunities for workers who want a career change but cannot forgo a paycheck to return to school for more training. Once-choosy employers are using incentives like on-the-job education to lure applicants.
The labor shortage is also rewarding workers with freshly minted technology skills, even if the workers are short on hard-knocks experience. They, too, are being welcomed by employers who once barred the door with the mantra "experienced only need apply."
"It's a great time to be a worker because there is opportunity out there," said Alice E. Snell, an analyst for Kennedy Information in Fitzwilliam, N.H., which publishes an annual directory of temporary-placement companies. "In a robust job market, you can think about which road you want to take." The jobless rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, the lowest since October 1973.
Among the most willing to blaze trails in this regard are middle managers and senior executives, sobered by corporate downsizing but now experts at self-promotion, Ms. Snell said. "One thing downsizing did was teach a whole set of people new skills, and more important, an attitude about being responsible for their careers," she added.
Many workers in such situations have used the temporary placement market, where workers generally receive free training. Temps make up 2.3 million workers, or 1.9 percent of the work force.
"As long as an individual has strong basic skills -- they're able to communicate effectively, think on their feet -- they can transition into a different career path," said Mr. Pillar, who recruited two such switch-hitters last year.
Besides Mr. Prescott, he found Derrick McFarland, a 30-year-old former Navy aircraft technician who was hired as a power-plant engineer in training by the Central Oregon Irrigation District in Bend.
"We couldn't find anyone who fit for a year," said Ron S. Nelson, the district's manager, who expects to invest $50,000 in tuition to train Mr. McFarland in hydraulic, electrical and mechanical skills.
Frank E. Curran, a recruiter for Tech Specialists, a division of Office Specialists Inc. in Waltham, Mass., said the shortage of skilled workers was forcing new flexibility on employers. "Before, they may have wanted 10 out of 10 skills," he said. "Now, people are willing to take you with 7 of 10."
What employers prize is often not in the job description. "I found out I had more to offer than I thought," said Lucia G. O'Reilly, 46, of Warwick, R.I., who began looking for part-time work in September through Office Specialists that would allow her time to paint. In 1996, she left a full-time job as beverage director for a restaurant. "Things I had not given much weight to -- like proofreading and editing -- were really valuable," she said.
The tight labor market also forces employers to consider extras like signing bonuses and flexible schedules. The employers' plight is a gift to workers not looking for permanent jobs, like retirees, students, artists and some professionals.
Both Mr. Curran and Gordon J. Bingham, senior vice president of marketing for Olsten Staffing Services, based in Melville, N.Y., say the stigma once attached to job-hopping has been erased and that some professionals see it as a cure for job obsolescence.
This notion is supported in an Olsten study, which found that 30 percent of temps preferred the flexibility or skill-sharpening challenges of short-term projects to the security of a traditional employer, Mr. Bingham said. The down side of this trend, Ms. O'Reilly said, is that temps typically lack autonomy and authority on the job. And health coverage and other benefits, if available at all, must come on the agency's terms, not from the company employing them.
Kelly Services also encounters the trend with its Kelly Scientific Resources unit. Its scientists-for-hire are often refugees from shrinking industries who find that their talents translate into growing fields like biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. They prize assignments that help them polish and develop skills. "If you're not providing an avenue for these professionals to stay current, they won't stay with you," said Rolf E. Kleiner, senior vice president for Kelly Scientific Resources.
Isabel Cooper of Arlington Heights, Ill., represents another part of the same trend: people who are inexperienced in their new line of work, but not totally without training. Ms. Cooper quit her 10-year hospital job as a genetic laboratory technologist after putting herself through seven months and $5,000 of night school at DePaul University to study computer programming. She is one of 10 graduates of the certificate program hired by Interim Services Inc., a temporary placement company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Ms. Cooper, 36, was expected to earn $10,000 more in 1997 than in 1996. In a different job market, though, her lack of experience might have put her at the bottom of a list.
"There's a lot of work you can do that's not rocket science," said Ms. Cooper, who is helping to build a data warehouse for First Card, a unit of the First Chicago Corporation.
Cynthia E. Cross, president of Parker Services Inc., which finds temporary workers for high-technology and professional businesses in Seattle, said professionals familiar with the most-used software programs could easily detour into technology. "Even people who are gainfully employed are taking this as an opportunity," she said. "People are willing to move for better pay and stock options."
PARKER SERVICES accelerates the process by providing free software training to its temps.
Michael D. Caprara is a believer. A former bank-lending officer, Mr. Caprara, 38, said his early efforts to get a technology-related job failed because prospective employers would not consider his at-home computer dabbling as usable experience.
He took tutoring at Parker Services in September and received high test scores that brought him his pick of offers. He chose the fast-rising Innova Corporation, which makes wireless microwave networks.
Innova offered Mr. Caprara a permanent spot after he spent two weeks in the company's purchasing and engineering departments.
"If you don't have education or experience, you don't get the job," Mr. Caprara said. "They look at job experience, not hobbies."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Some Inadvertent Tosses Out the Fiscal Window

BYLINE: By JOE QUEENAN; The writer is a freelancer based in Tarrytown, N.Y.

 BODY:
F. Scott Fitzgerald: You know, Hem, the rich are different.
Ernest Hemingway: You're right. The rich don't tie up significant amounts of their capital in season tickets to the New York Jets, thereby giving the team's owner, Leon Hess, what amounts to a gigantic, interest-free loan each year. 
THE cornerstone of any successful investment philosophy is finding a way to minimize the amount of money that is sitting in the bank earning almost nothing, and putting the rest of the cash to work. But a fast review of virtually any household's budget will reveal that significant amounts of money are routinely forked over to other parties in an endless series of interest-free loans.
Some of these loans are unavoidable, some can be justified by convenience and some generate savings of their own down the road. Nevertheless, a substantial number of these interest-free loans are just plain dumb.
One of the most obvious examples of an inadvertent interest-free loan that makes no sense is letting your broker hold your stock in "street name," meaning in the name of the broker, and then lend it out. The more stock you have, the bigger the loan. The brokerage house, already earning significant amounts in commissions on your trades, earns additional commissions by putting your stock to work. You earn nothing from this arrangement.
Ideally, your philosophy vis-a-vis your stock certificates should be the same as your philosophy vis-a-vis your kids: If somebody wants to borrow them, let them pay for the privilege. But that's not the way Wall Street works.
A more proletarian example of an interest-free loan given at the individual's expense is any form of prepaid mass transit pass or token that doesn't offer a discount. If you buy a month's worth of undiscounted fares on the first of every month, for example, you are literally giving the transit authority 12 interest-free loans that may amount to hundreds of dollars over the course of the year.
The problem here is that the alternative to buying a pass is to simply buy a token each time you need one. This, of course, is incredibly annoying. Economists would probably argue that this kind of interest-free loan makes sense because the time not spent waiting in line for tokens can be put to better use. Like waiting on the platform for a smelly, crowded, overdue train while reading about Kathie Lee Gifford.
Subscription tickets to the opera, the concert hall or the theater or season tickets to any major sporting event are an even better example of interest-free loans. Tickets to these events are rarely discounted, and in some cases the payment for individual events is made as much as nine months in advance. It may, however, be a worthy trade-off if tickets included in the series -- perhaps to a Midori concert -- would otherwise be unavailable.
The most infuriating form of interest-free loan occurs when the local hockey team makes you buy tickets for several rounds of playoff games even though everyone knows they're going to get massacred by the first opponent they face.
The second-most infuriating thing is when the management then makes you come to the stadium in person to pick up your refund. The team, meanwhile, has been using your hard-earned money to acquire more fat, washed-up prima donnas from Flin Flon, Manitoba, or Thunder Bay, Ontario, who will insure that the next year your team will make an even earlier exit from the playoffs. Which, in turn, will make you feel even more foolish about the interest-free loan you're going to give the owners next year.
Magazine subscriptions are another mechanism for coughing up interest-free loans. But here, there is an upside. When you subscribe to a magazine years in advance, it is true that you are asked to fork over your money long before you receive the product. On the other hand, you usually end up paying less for the product than you would if you had bought a one-year subscription and a lot less than you would have paid at the newsstand.
But there is also a downside. In the case of a magazine like Forbes, writing a check for a three-year subscription is a way of giving its millionaire publisher, Malcolm Forbes Jr., an interest-free loan for years. Mr. Forbes can then use this money to employ additional journalists who will, in the fullness of time, write caustic articles chastising readers for investing their money unwisely. This will make you feel silly. If you don't want to appear silly, stick with that long-term subscription to Details.
Many common commercial transactions ultimately turn into short-term loans. Advance purchases of airplane tickets fall into this category. And then there are traveler's checks, particularly those that are unused for long periods. Unused traveler's checks can be an even bigger waste of a precious resource -- your money -- than unused cash sitting in your wallet, if you paid a 1 percent commission to get them. (Of course, cash itself can be wasted if you had to pay a service charge for using an automated-teller machine.)
The more carefully you examine your personal finances, the more you come to realize how much of your money is tied up in interest-free loans. If you own real estate, you probably have a nice heap of cash sitting in an escrow account somewhere earning little or no interest, at least for the first few years of the mortgage.
If you use an E-Z Pass to avoid waiting in lines while crossing bridges in the New York metropolitan area, you are, in effect, awarding the Port Authority a monthly interest-free loan.
If you belong to a record club and have allowed the company to automatically debit your credit card as soon as you order that "Riverdance" CD, you are paying for the merchandise even before you receive it.
And if you have a checking account that does not pay interest -- or that stops doing so once your balance falls below a certain level -- you are again losing out.
One of the most prevalent examples of this type of inadvertently idiotic behavior involves Federal withholding taxes. Numerous Americans deliberately have too much withheld during the year because they like the idea of getting a refund in April. Obviously, it would be far wiser to underwithhold one's taxes, put the extra cash in an interest-bearing account or a Treasury bill, and then pay the Internal Revenue Service in April.
What are other examples of this phenomenon? Well, there are those level-pay schedules for utility bills and advance purchases of lottery tickets. Not to mention debit cards of any variety, where the whole concept of "the float" goes up in smoke. (Of course, most people find that their easiest interest-free money comes from a credit card, providing they pay in full at the end of the month. But -- and this is a big but -- some banks now charge a fee or seek to cancel a card if the account fails to carry a balance.)
Perhaps the most overlooked type of interest-free loan is the office football pool. Here, you pick your teams, pay your cash, wait for Sunday's results and then curse yourself for picking the Cincinnati Bengals plus six points when you should have gone with the Dallas Cowboys minus seven. Meanwhile, the guy running the pool can do whatever he wants with your money.
This is an example of an inherently foolish investment that is exacerbated by an idiotic loan. All things considered, you'd be better off standing in line waiting for that subway token than participating in the office football pool. At least you get something for your money.

HEADLINE: In Old England, A Silicon Fen

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, England

 BODY:
THE rooms at Mount Pleasant House are filling up with new faces, furniture and ideas. Month after month, the five-story building, whose smoky green glass blends into the leafy texture of this ancient university town, is kept busy as yet another high-technology venture installs itself to produce new software or a growing company leaves for bigger quarters.
Moving in is the ponytailed Adrian Wrigley, working in jeans and a T-shirt -- and with nearly $2 million in venture capital -- to perfect software that allows faster, cheaper and livelier three-dimensional animation for the entertainment industry. 
 Moving out of the building, a kind of incubator for high-tech companies, are Mike Muller and the other employees of Advanced RISC Machines, which outgrew its space and now is piling into a 17th-century converted barn on the edge of town.
There, the company's ever-growing staff -- which now numbers 257, most of them researchers -- is designing microprocessors that are "small, simple, low-power and fast," as Mr. Muller puts it, to go into everything from computers to mobile phones to televisions. The success of the business, a joint venture of Apple Computer and Britain's Acorn Group, is evident in the score of empty champagne bottles lined up along a corridor, each marking a big party held to introduce a new chip.
Almost every week, meanwhile, staff members arrive for the Microsoft Corporation's new research laboratory in Mount Pleasant House, the $80 million beachhead of William H. Gates's campaign to create a global network of brain factories for his software industry titan.
Welcome to the Silicon Fen, as insiders call the vast flat and marshy lands in and around Cambridge. In the last five years, the area has become home to more than 1,000 high-technology companies that employ at least 30,000 people and produce more than $3 billion a year in revenues. Unemployment here is a low 3.5 percent, compared with 5.7 percent for all of Britain and 9 to 17 percent in Europe.
This is no Silicon Valley. The pace here is neither frantic nor flashy, and people frown on loud manifestations of wealth. While Cambridge, the home of one of the world's most prestigious universities, has produced some 50 Nobel laureates, it is a relatively small city of 100,000 encircled by rural landscape. Executives still ride to work on bicycles, as they did when they were students. The buildings are low, the skies wide open and the pace civilized.
But the energy and enthusiasm are palpable.
"I have founded and helped in the launch of 25 companies in the past 12 years," boasts Herman Hauser, 48, whose progeny include Acorn, Britain's pioneering maker of personal computers. A multimillionaire entrepreneur, he is part-owner of Mount Pleasant House and head of the Amadeus venture capital fund, which adopts scientists with brilliant ideas who know nothing about how to turn them into businesses.
"It's real. It's happening," adds the effusive Mr. Muller, at 38 the director and vice president for business development of Advanced RISC Machines. "It's a big buzz. Not quite Silicon Valley, but you have to be aware of the scale without underestimating the impact."
IT isn't difficult to see why the technology industry has planted itself on the Fen. Unlike its intellectual rival, Oxford University, which is best known for its scholarship in the humanities, Cambridge has both a long history of collaboration with industry and a decidedly scientific bent. It was at Trinity College here that Charles Babbage, inventor of the mechanical calculator, studied mathematics in the early 1800's.
"As a base for high-tech engineering, Cambridge with its university is ideal and wonderful," said Mr. Hauser, who first came here in 1973, earned a Ph.D. in physics from the university and has stayed ever since. The ferment has also drawn Xerox, Olivetti, Stanford Research Institute, Oracle and Hitachi to establish laboratories or offices here.
But the appeal is not solely intellectual. "For one thing, many people don't want to live in Seattle, California or America," said Prof. Roger M. Needham, a Cambridge computer scientist who recently took a leave from the university to become managing director of Microsoft's new lab. "Let's face it," he added, flashing a somewhat mischievous smile. "The quality of life is much better here."
The balding professor, who has taught at Cambridge for nearly a quarter-century, energetically paces his sparsely furnished new office in Mount Pleasant House as he explains how good a time it is to be starting a technology venture in England.
There is capital available on the Continent now, something that was not often the case a decade or so ago. And with most members of the European Union -- if not Britain itself, initially -- moving toward adoption of the euro, Europe will increasingly act as a single market, by some measures much larger than America.
"There are 400 million people on this continent who can work here with no permit," Professor Needham said, as if surprising himself with the revelation.
For now the ambitions of the Microsoft venture are modest. It aims to hire about 40 scientists from all over Europe and as little as possible in the way of support staff. The idea is to replicate, on a smaller scale, the company's research center in the Seattle area, where about 140 top researchers look for new computer applications.
"Microsoft wanted to multiply their researchers by three," Professor Needham explained. "But it is not easy to find brains in one place, one continent, which is why they are casting a net around the world, starting with Britain." If the British lab is a success, the company plans to create similar centers in other places where the high-tech research environment is favorable.
But Cambridge is special. "We looked long and hard before deciding on Britain," Mr. Gates said during an October visit to announce the lab. "The computer science tradition here and the companies in the area made this a great spot for us." The university, he said, "has made it possible for this area to develop as one of the centers of advanced technology in the world."
"We're going to put together a really amazing group of people," he added.
CAMBRIDGE'S distinctive role in the world of modern computers dates back to the period just after World War II when Maurice Wilkes, a mathematical physicist, and his students built the Edsac, a 3,000-vacuum-tube contraption that was the first practical computer to use stored programs.
Even today, while not a major force in the computer business, Britain is "very good at niches," Professor Needham said. "We make software for racing cars, engine controls and security," he noted, in addition to computer games. Being an English-speaking nation has been a key competitive advantage, everyone agrees, as the bulk of the world's software is written in English.
The Fen's biggest fan is Britain's new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, whose Labor Government campaigned on a platform of creating a Britain "that is fully up and running on information technology for the millennium."
Among other things, Mr. Blair has fashioned a $170 million plan with British Telecom and various cable television companies to wire every single school in Britain to the Internet; later this year, government-run schools are supposed to have unlimited access for a flat fee of $1,000 a year. Mr. Blair actively courted Microsoft and was rewarded with the company's decision to open its lab in Cambridge. But Mr. Blair also received a pledge that is expected to turn into millions of dollars in software and computer equipment for his schools initiative from Mr. Gates, whom he welcomed at 10 Downing Street.
Mr. Blair's undertaking is a big commitment, the likes of which are seen in Europe only in the Scandinavian nations, not in Germany, France or the other big economies. But analysts say government prodding is badly needed: while Britons have been very good at inventing computer applications, they have never had the means to parlay that creativity into a major industry.
In general, Europeans have been slow to adopt computer technology, in business and even more so at home; it is broadly estimated that only about 20 percent of European households have personal computers, versus about 40 percent in the United States.
Moreover, British technology companies have not enjoyed the full-throated support of the public sector that helped create demand and build a technology infrastructure in the United States. There is no British equivalent, for instance, of the Pentagon financing that established the Internet.
The financial roots of the Silicon Fen are in Britain's economic changes during the 18 years of Conservative Party rule, largely under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Cambridge was always full of scientists, but what began steering money toward their ventures were the Conservatives' tax cuts and stripping down of the welfare state, which attracted foreign banks and international investors to the City of London and British companies.
Into this increasingly amiable environment stepped people like Mr. Hauser of Amadeus, Mr. Muller of Advanced RISC Machines and the many other researchers and financiers now shaping the Silicon Fen.
Their approach is to circle around Britain's limitations, like its small market, and to play to its strengths: fine universities and the ability to work on ideas with universal appeal in a global industry. That adds up to a strategy -- to the degree that one exists -- emphasizing ideas and engineering over manufacturing brawn.
"If you try to do it all, you fail," Mr. Muller said. "Our approach is we sell ideas for a lot of money and royalties. It is based on leverage. We license the technology. It is an intellectual property business."
WHAT plan has certainly worked for his company. Just seven years old, Advanced RISC Machines had profits of $6 million in 1996 on revenues of $27 million by inventing chips that go into computers, mobile phones, television set-top boxes, TV's, digital cameras, smart cards and modems, increasing their power and speed. Its clients and partners include Digital Equipment, Samsung, Alcatel, Yamaha, Sony, Philips, Sharp, NEC and Rockwell Semiconductor Systems.
The brain power on which the Apple-Acorn joint venture is built flows directly from Cambridge University. Mr. Muller, for example, has an undergraduate degree in computer science and says Professor Needham "taught me everything I know about computers."
He is not troubled at finding himself, in some senses, in competition with his old instructor. "I am very happy to have Microsoft" in Cambridge, Mr. Muller said. "It legitimizes Cambridge's big stab at technology, and it makes the job prospects broader."
Besides the ties that the Fen is forging with Britain's leading universities, its most important relationships are with Britain's growing pool of venture capitalists and the City's financiers.
"In past years, the main problem had been a funding gap due to the limited understanding of technology investment by British banks," Mr. Hauser said. According to Bank of England reports, 16 percent of total investments in Britain went to technology from 1984 to 1995. In the United States, technology soaked up 35 percent of investment dollars over the same period.
Now, venture capital firms like Amadeus are changing the picture. According to Mr. Hauser and others who keep count, there are some 140 venture capital funds in Britain with $30 billion invested in high-tech ventures. In 1996, there was $1.08 billion in new technology investment, a quarter of which went to start-ups like the emerging companies of the Fen.
"By Silicon Valley standards, it is not very impressive," Mr. Hauser said. (In 1996, venture capitalists pumped $2.3 billion into companies in the Valley, according to Price Waterhouse, the American accounting firm.) "But remember: This is the second-largest high-tech venture capital market in the world, after the United States, and it is in a starting stage."
A crucial part of the strategy for closing the gap has been widening the circle. Globalization and the growing role of the European Union as a large economic group have helped. Cambridge-based companies can easily transcend their location by hooking up to the Internet and forming alliances in Asia, the United States and other markets.
IN many ways, 29-year-old Adrian Wrigley is the Silicon Fen character who typifies all these trends.
Both his parents are Cambridge graduates; his mother studied botany, his father chemistry. "Both knew to push science. When I was a little boy and asked a question, 'Why is that gray blue?' they would explain it in scientific terms," he said in his new suite in Mount Pleasant House.
By the time he was 11, he had a solid background in electronics and dabbled with computer equipment on the kitchen table. By 18, he was studying engineering, physics and chemistry at Cambridge. At 25, he received his doctorate in computer science.
Sitting in a meeting room, its floor a web of wires trailing from computers, he said his main research interest was "transcribing the architecture of the brain into a computer architecture." Along the way, Dr. Wrigley focused on ways to manipulate images on computers and, eventually, on how to pump life, color and shading into computer animation at tremendous speed, aiming for strikingly realistic results.
Ultimately, Dr. Wrigley developed a chip that he believed would vastly improve the quality of computer images while saving the fast-growing animation industry millions of dollars. "What I didn't know," he said, "was how to devise a business plan, a patent, a license."
It was at that point, in 1994, that Herman Hauser and his Amadeus fund entered the picture. "I went to a lecture at Cambridge by Herman. He was talking about how to start a high-tech company," Dr. Wrigley recalled.
The two men talked after the lecture -- and Mr. Hauser agreed to stake Dr. Wrigley $500,000 in start-up money.
"Herman committed to the amount, but said we have to produce something that made a great deal of money -- an end product that can sell," Dr. Wrigley said. "He said to go back to the drawing board and keep this in mind."
A year later, Advanced Rendering Technology Ltd. was created, a private company with $1.9 million in Amadeus funds, a professional manager and Dr. Wrigley, who retains a one-third ownership. The company created a site on the World Wide Web to promote its technology, and calls started pouring in from Hollywood to Tokyo.
Dr. Wrigley has not yet made plans to move out of Mount Pleasant House -- his chip hasn't really gotten its commercial footing yet -- but if those phone calls turn into sales, he may be making way for a newcomer someday soon.

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH: LIZ SMITH;
The Scoop? Gossip Maven Starts Saving

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
THE singer Sophie Tucker once offered this advice: From birth to age 18, a girl needs good parents; from 18 to 35, good looks; from 35 to 55, a good personality, and from 55 on, cash.
Almost a decade ago, at age 65, Liz Smith, the queen of gossip columnists, was hopelessly out of sync with Ms. Tucker's agenda. "I had about $25,000 saved, and that was it," Ms. Smith recalled cheerfully during a recent interview. 
 Certainly, Ms. Smith, the woman who broke the news of Donald Trump's divorce from his first wife, Ivana, and attended Elizabeth Taylor's most recent wedding, had rubbed shoulders with some of the savviest financial minds in America, from Henry Kravis to Alan Greenspan to Ace Greenberg. But she had never been a saver. From the year she graduated from college, she had worked obsessively. But her goal was always to be somebody, not necessarily somebody rich.
Even after she became a celebrity, with her name plastered across her daily column, she refused to worry about the future. She lived high, spent lavishly and figured she could always work and earn more. "Money was such an evil to me in my early life that I didn't pay any attention to it," Ms. Smith said in the drawl of her native Fort Worth. "Even before I had money, I thought it was something to throw off the back of trains." Having watched her father's gambling wreak havoc on her family and her mother's emotions, "I had learned that it didn't do any good to try to hold onto money," she continued during an interview at her simply furnished apartment in a midtown Manhattan high-rise.
Then, about five years ago, Ms. Smith met Peter G. Peterson and his wife, Joan Ganz Cooney. Mr. Peterson, a former Secretary of Commerce, was by then chairman of the hugely successful Blackstone Group, a buyout firm. Ms. Cooney was a founder of the Children's Television Workshop. After Ms. Smith got to know Mr. Peterson and Ms. Cooney, they had a discussion about her finances. "They said, 'What do you mean you don't have $5 million in the bank?' " Ms. Smith recalled. "Pete couldn't believe I was so stupid. He couldn't believe I wasn't worth millions."
Though Ms. Smith declines to disclose her salary, people close to her estimate that she makes $1 million a year -- about $900,000 from her column, which appears six times a week in Newsday and The New York Post and is syndicated to more than 60 newspapers nationwide, and about $100,000 from articles for Good Housekeeping magazine and appearances on WNYW-TV, Channel 5 in New York, and on E! Entertainment, the cable channel. In addition, her agent recently negotiated a $1 million advance from Hyperion Books for her memoirs.
Ms. Smith confesses that spending is her financial strong suit. Not only does she support her brother -- as she supported her mother until her death -- she also has a weakness for gourmet restaurants, where she likes to leave big tips. And, she acknowledges, she counted on her popular column to provide her with a steady income for many years. Twice divorced, with no children, she said she "just didn't pay enough attention."
"I was the world's oldest adolescent, emotionally and practically," she said.
THE gave her first thought to saving money about six years ago, prompted by her increasingly large salary, and got serious about it only with what she fondly called nagging by Mr. Peterson and her assistant, Diane Judge.
Mr. Peterson confirmed that he was shocked by the paucity of her savings. His response was to tell her: "As John Maynard Keynes once said, 'Some people have a propensity to consume,' and you certainly are a gifted consumer.' "
He realized that immediate action was necessary. So he sat down with her and worked out a nuts-and-bolts savings plan. The most important issue was disability insurance, "to cover the downside," as Mr. Peterson put it. And because his friend "essentially runs a small business, we got into the most efficient way of creating a tax-deferred pension arrangement" with a tax-deferred retirement account and other tax shelters, he said. "Once we found the right format, and it was tax deferred, we switched her from tax-free municipal bonds into higher-yield fixed-income instruments," he said.
Because of Ms. Smith's age, Mr. Peterson did not recommend stocks despite the higher returns that they have generated over time. "If you are 72 and you are counting on this for a good standard of living later in life, it is probably prudent to give up some of the upside to get the downside well covered," he said. "The stock market is good over the long term, but remember, between 1967 and 1982 it went nowhere."
Mr. Peterson says people should calculate their retirement needs and begin saving early. Ms. Smith had done neither, so he proposed an aggressive plan: Set aside $200,000 to $300,000 a year. She has managed to do so, she said, by directing Ms. Judge, her assistant, to regularly set money aside -- and to hound her about the size of her American Express bills. By now, that presumably means Ms. Smith has socked away more than $2 million.
Still, Ms. Smith says she will never be super-rich. "Pete has some investments now where you have to have $5 million or you can't get into it," she said. "I asked him the other day, 'When can I get into this thing?' and he said, 'Never. You'll never have enough money.' "
Mr. Peterson's role went beyond simply suggesting a financial strategy. He went along with her when she negotiated with Newsday in 1995 and helped her win a contract that reportedly runs seven years in addition to permission to run her column in The New York Post.
The contract with The Post is worth $100,000 a year to Ms. Smith, but its value transcends money, Mr. Peterson said, because it gives her a journalistic pipeline to the cultural -- and gossip -- capital of the United States. "I wanted her to have the psychic income of having a column in New York," he said.
For all of Ms. Smith's recent efforts to prepare for retirement, she just cannot get all that excited about her finances. From time to time, she glances at the monthly statements of her accounts at the Offit Bank, which specializes in money management for individual clients.
She does have a stock portfolio -- but it came about by chance. Some years ago, she said, she inherited some "really great stocks, like Coca-Cola," worth $20,000, from a friend, and the value of that cache has quintupled. But even if the stocks had not gone up, it is unlikely she would have sold them. "I have kept them for sentimental reasons," she said. She said she thought Offit Bank might have bought her a few mutual funds, but she was not certain.
GIVEN the hard times she knew as a child in Fort Worth, it is perhaps not surprising that she became a free-spender as an adult. Though her father was a successful cotton salesman for a time, he was taken off salary and put on commission during the Depression -- and his income slowed to a trickle. To make things worse, he was addicted to the race track, poker and craps.
As a result, she remembers, her parents had to sell their house and move into a smaller one. They paid the local government extra to keep her in her old school -- but she is not sure whether that was good. "I grew up with all these little rich kids," she said. "I didn't have a dime. They talked about their allowances." She never pretended to have more than she did, she added, primarily because she thought that her classmates would see through her and that she would gain stature by owning up to her reduced circumstances. "I knew it wouldn't do any good," she said. "I couldn't face that. I was always a horrible little social climber in my way."
Every Christmas, her father delivered his children a cryptic message that reflected his own tortured relationship with money. He gave each of them silver dollars -- a fortune for a child in the Depression -- but then asked them to do the almost impossible. "He would say we should save them, and of course, we were dying to spend them," Ms. Smith said. "At the same time, we thought it was not right to spend them."
In effect, her father was asking his offspring to show a restraint toward money that he was unable to muster. "It gave us an emotional economic crisis early on," Ms. Smith said.
Even after her father got a new job, the family fortunes did not improve much because he couldn't hold onto his money. "He never stopped jumping around enough to feel bad about anything," she said. "He was a real iconoclast. He had a mind like a computer. He would get a whole lot of money, and the next thing you knew, he was in a crap game."
Ms. Smith recalled his coming home late one night after playing craps, dropping into a chair and commanding, " 'Help me take my boots off."
She said he "had money stuffed down in his Lucchese boots, and it poured out all over the floor -- it was really dramatic."
Like most gamblers, though, her father lost more than he won -- and his habit created dissension in the family. "It drove my mother crazy," Ms. Smith said. Once, her mother returned crying to the house from a walk to the mailbox. "I just can't stand it," she remembers her mother saying. "The Baptist Standard and The Racing Form in the same mailbox."
Another time, when she was a college student, her father reclaimed a gift to pay off a gambling debt. He had bought her a maroon Plymouth for her to drive around the University of Texas -- then showed up one day and asked for the keys. "He said, 'I'm sorry. I have to get rid of your car,' " she recalled. "He had lost the car in a crap game or something. I was heartbroken."
Her father's compulsive behavior had some benefits. He paid her college tuition by winning $1,500 on a horse named Soap Stix, she said.
After earning a bachelor's degree in journalism and nearly getting a master's degree in English, Ms. Smith came to New York in 1949.
She had spent her teen-age years lying on the floor of her bedroom reading Walter Winchell, the most powerful social and political commentator of the 1940's and 50's, whose column appeared in more than 2,000 newspapers and whose voice was instantly recognizable to anyone who ever turned on a radio. "I was dying to go to New York and see the Stork Club," the world's most famous nightclub in those days and a Winchell hangout, she said.
She was also dying to be a journalist when she arrived with $50 in her pocket. For three months she searched for a magazine job. Finally she called the actor Zachary Scott, whom she had known at college. He sent her to see Chuck Saxon, the editor of Modern Screen. "He said 'You have the most virile writing style,' " Ms. Smith said. "I said, 'Thank you,' and hung up. Then I looked up the word 'virile.' "
After that, she worked her way up from freelance magazine writing, eventually going to work for Igor Cassini, the famous society gossip columnist who wrote under the name Cholly Knickerbocker. For the next two decades, she worked for media celebrities, from Mr. Cassini and Allen Funt, host of the TV show "Candid Camera," to Mike Wallace, the CBS newsman, to Helen Gurley Brown, then Cosmopolitan editor and her only boss who was a woman.
Though Ms. Smith envied friends in more mainstream journalistic enterprises, such jobs were hard to get, particularly for women who had not attended Vassar or Wellesley, she said. "I was probably saved from a life of intense nothingness by the fact that I couldn't get a really respectable job," she said.
Like many women in the male-dominated workplaces of those days, Ms. Smith kept in the background. And she never dreamed of demanding a raise. "This was pre-women's lib," she said. "And I thought I was a second-rate person. I was always a first-rate guy's first-rate girl." Even though she was probably one of the best-paid women freelancers around, she said: "I didn't value myself. I was like Rodney Dangerfield. I didn't get any respect."
But with psychotherapy, her attitude began to change. Her psychologist, Mildred Newman, asked her, " 'Why do you think you don't deserve to be a success?' " Therapy did not necessarily make her a better negotiator, she said, but "it helped me get out of my own way. I began to realize I didn't just want to be a journeyman journalist. I wanted more."
It was not until 1978, when The Daily News gave her a column and it became an immediate hit, that she felt she had truly arrived. A year later, when The Daily News was shut down by a strike, her bosses encouraged her to go on WNBC-TV's "Live at Five" newscast to keep her name before the public.
As her salary rose, "I felt I was rich because I could take cabs and not worry about the prices on the menu," she said. By the late 1980's, she was making about $350,000 a year from her Daily News salary, syndication fees for the column and payments for her WNBC appearances.
Still, it never occurred to her to save a penny of it. "I just thought supporting myself and living in New York was great," she recalled. "I lived like a fool and spent everything I ever made."
As Ms. Smith looks back, she realizes that her blase attitude toward money mirrored her father's so closely that it must have been a form of subconscious imitation. "I was just as much of a gambler" as he was, she said. "I kept blindly forging ahead like a mole, without thinking too much about the future. I guess I always thought I would hit it where I wouldn't have to worry. I felt like one day I would write something. I felt like I had the capacity to make money."
THOUGH her job increasingly took her into contact with the super-rich, she said she never resented them for their wealth. "I have been passionately jealous in emotional ways, but I have never been envious of anybody," she said. Sure, she said, she would like to have enough money to quit her job tomorrow and still have $500,000 a year to live on. But that will never happen, she said, and she does not really mind. "I've had a great life," she said.
Nor has she ever counted on her well-heeled friends to bail her out of tight spots. "It may be nice to have rich friends, but they'll never give you any money," she said. "That is the fallacy." Still, she said: "You might live well from knowing them. And they might give you money for charity." (Ms. Smith is an avid fund-raiser for Literacy Partners.)
Only once, after she lost her job when Mr. Cassini gave up his column in 1963, did she borrow money -- $1,500, from the real-estate heir and man-about-town Jerry Zipkin, who had asked whether he could help. She paid back every penny, she said.
Indeed, she dislikes owing money. Her agent, Joni Evans, remembered how Ms. Smith insisted on returning an advance from Simon & Schuster for a book she never got around to writing.
But if she never asks for money from friends, she listens to their advice -- as was seen when Mr. Peterson help her negotiate with Newsday. Ms. Smith had left The Daily News in 1991 and joined New York Newsday, the Long Island newspaper's New York edition. When it folded in 1995, Long Island Newsday wanted to renegotiate the contract. "They had my life in their thrall," Ms. Smith said. "They could have ruined my life very easily. But Pete sat there and said: 'I don't know if you gentlemen have noticed, but you treat Liz like she is this glamorous young girl, but she is no spring chicken.' And he added, 'She has never saved any money. So I want you to do right by her.' "
As part of the new contract, Newsday agreed to let her column appear in The New York Post, which pays $200,000 a year for it, divided evenly between Ms. Smith and Newsday. Newsday also keeps the $150,000 or more in syndication revenue that the columns earn.
Today, despite her new-found penchant for saving, Ms. Smith still spends considerably. She pays a staff of three out of her own pocket. And she continues to indulge her culinary lust. "I eat out at incredible restaurants, and I pick up checks like crazy."
Moreover, she continues to support her brother, who lives in the home she bought for her late mother. And like her father, who loved to give money away after he won it, Ms. Smith sometimes helps out friends. She gave Ms. Judge the money to make a down payment on a country house, for example.
RECENTLY, moreover, her late-blooming financial maturity has nudged her into a more expensive life style. In keeping with what she calls her adolescent outlook, she used to live a bit as a recent college graduate would, working out of an office in her Manhattan apartment. She now rents a second apartment for herself and uses her old one solely for business. And, not long ago, she bought a Mercedes.
With the exception of an occasional gift from the designer Arnold Scassi, a close friend, she added, she buys all her own clothes. So far, she jokes, she has not accepted any bribes to supplement her income. "I suppose I have my price," she said, "but I don't think I have heard it yet."
Still, saving money has become easier. Ms. Judge said that one benefit of moving to Newsday in 1991 was that Ms. Smith's salary was paid electronically. "That way," Ms. Judge said, "she is not as tempted to spend it. It goes directly into a checking account. When the account gets high, I move some of it to a money-market fund."
Clearly, Ms. Smith has heard her friends' words of warning. And it would seem she has adopted the credo of Sophie Tucker: "I've been rich, and I've been poor, and rich is better."

The U.N. Says It's Time to Pony Up

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Here's a club to join. Not feeling lucky? Never mind: the dues reflect economic position, on a sliding scale. And don't worry. The bill might be high, but there's always the option of not paying.
The club is called the United Nations. 
 When the 1998-2000 "scale of assessments" -- U.N.-speak for dues -- was finally agreed on by the General Assembly , some of the results seemed somewhat unscientific. How come North Korea, where people are starving, has to pay about 30 times as much as Cambodia, where rich politicians and business executives live tax-free lives?
The United States, which argues it is charged too much and has held back payment, sought to reduce its assessment to 20 percent of the U.N.'s regular budget, but its assessment stayed at 25 percent, or $297.7 million, while the poor countries took their cuts, lowering the base payment for 25 nations to $13,000 each.

HEADLINE: The Tarnished Darlings of Wall Street

BYLINE: By Joseph Nocera; Joseph Nocera is an editor at large with Fortune magazine.

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
The year 1997 was a rough one for the holders of health care stocks. Columbia/HCA, which had been one of Wall Street's favorite growth companies, saw its once high-flying stock drop from $45 a share in March to $26 in October after the company became the target of a major Federal investigation.
Then there was that other Wall Street darling, Oxford Health Plans. Since going public half a dozen years ago, it had been one of the fastest-growing managed care companies in the country. But in October when Oxford stunned the market by announcing its first-ever quarterly loss, shares of the stock lost 63 percent of their value in a single day. 
 And Aetna, the insurance giant, has seen its stock hammered in recent months, thanks to problems with U.S. Healthcare, its managed care subsidiary.
The problems of these companies point out the flaw of a health care industry subject to the turbulent market: What's good for patients isn't necessarily what's good for stockholders. And vice versa.
Until recently, health care stocks were booming -- owing to the recent dramatic changes in the health care economy, particularly the nationwide move to managed care.
For instance, Oxford's profits rose at a compounded rate of 75 percent a year, and its stock climbed from $4 a share in 1991 to $89 a share in 1997. Indeed, in the fall of 1996, 12 health care companies made Fortune's annual ranking of the 100 fastest-growing companies in the United States, the second-best showing of any sector.
When an investor sees numbers like these, his or her natural inclination is to jump in with both feet. Yet by now the word "investor" has come to mean not just the Wall Street cognoscenti but practically everybody -- more than 40 percent of American households are now invested in the market. But these same investors are also consumers of the new health care companies and may even have been part of the recent backlash against the cost cutting practiced by the typical managed care company.
But so long as the stocks kept going up, it was easy to overlook this weird duality. In fact, people tended to view these companies purely through the prism of the market, rooting for the stock while ignoring the business. They were letting the tail wag the dog.
Consider the root cause of the swoon in health stocks. After years of cutting costs with impunity, managed care companies are facing rising costs. Why? Because they are being forced -- in no small part as a reaction to intense criticism from doctors and patients -- to pay more for treatment. Yet at the same time, these companies have been unable to charge higher premiums, thanks to pressure from large employers who contract with managed care companies.
What's more, it's now clear that in some cases the concern with producing results that would please investors caused some companies to make terrible mistakes. Columbia/ HCA's strong-arm tactics and brutal cost-cutting led to resentment so great that the company is now removing the Columbia/HCA name from many of its hospitals.
Oxford, meanwhile, put such emphasis on growth at any cost that it spun out of control when a new computer system caused the company to lose track of its business.
What's particularly troubling is that even as these stocks have tanked, there is still a tendency to view the companies mainly through the prism of the market. Yes, there has been reporting on what Oxford's troubles mean for its customers, but the vast majority of the coverage has been about Oxford's dismal share price and about whether the company can regain its status as a hot growth stock.
But should health care consumers care if Oxford becomes a hot stock again? Maybe they shouldn't. Nobody's saying Oxford, or any other health care company, should have to lose money. But the imperative that Wall Street demands of hot growth companies -- that profits increase by eye-popping amounts year after year -- doesn't quite jibe with the business of delivering first-rate health care to the public. If there is a larger message in the decline of the health care sector, surely that's it. Besides, the situation that caused the stocks to tank in 1997 -- more and better treatment without higher premiums -- may have been lousy for shareholders, but it was a pretty good for anybody who happened to get sick last year.
I'm not advocating an end to the bull market. My retirement money is there, too, just like everyone else's. But when that wild ride does finally end, perhaps we'll start thinking about what matters again, instead of simply worrying about how the stock price will be affected.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Festivity's Not Hot;
There Went the Holidays. Whoopee.

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
YEAR after year, talk-show hosts and other celebrity soothers and healers warn against expecting too much from the holidays, lest either the immediate disappointment or the Jan. 2 withdrawal cause an emotional crash. Now, they can declare victory.
Despite the hottest economy practically since Columbus's once-celebrated landing, Christmas shoppers remained abstemious, giving retailers the holiday blues for the third year in a row. And instead of at least letting loose on New Year's Eve, more and more Americans got by with New Year's Lite: In 170 cities, zero-proof observances known as First Night sent shivering masses between performances by flannel-shirted folk-singers and grade-school ballerinas. Yawning audiences were sustained by cups of cocoa, if they were lucky. 

Not Much Memorializing
But in modern America, Holiday Rot sets in long before late December. The two Presidents' birthdays have been mashed into one. Retailers who still hope against hope for Christmas largess gave up long ago on trying to sell bonnets or anything else for Easter. Memorial Day, once filled with parades and graveyard ceremony and decoration, now memorializes little besides a chance to peel back pool covers and brush the rust from the barbecue. Labor Day? By 1994, workers had so little interest in trudging down Fifth Avenue that New York City's labor leaders had to cancel their parade. Beginning in 1996, they moved it to the following Saturday.
Columbus Day, like New Year's Eve, has gone through a severe correction. On hearing in recent years that the supposedly heroic discoverer was really the imperialistic oppressor of those who got here first, some cities have halted parades. Berkeley, Calif., instead celebrates "Indigenous People's Day," and some witty New Yorkers repaint Columbus Avenue signs to read "Genocide Avenue."
Holidays that are no holidays have modern causes but a long heritage. Extended Easter and Christmas holidays were standard during the Middle Ages, and any saint worth his miracles was remembered with a feast day. France's royal rulers guaranteed 38 holidays. The Reformation, however, began to give holiday-pooping the status of high principle.
 
No More Pudding
In the 1640's, the British Parliament, dominated by Puritans, banned Christmas festivities altogether, outlawing plum puddings and mince pies in particular. In New England, likewise, Christmas long remained a regular workday. "Can you in your conscience think," the Rev. Cotton Mather asked his Puritan congregation in 1712, "that our Holy Savior is honored by mad mirth, by long eating, by hard drinking, by lewd gaming, by rude reveling, by a mass fit for not but a Saturn or Bacchus?"
If British laborers eventually won back their Christmases, rising industrialists pruned away the rest of their holidays until they could only count on Good Friday. The growth of labor unions here and abroad helped reverse holiday erosion for a while. But Americans, overworked and underinvolved in any other activity besides channel surfing, have over recent decades enshrined Dilbert, not Bacchus, as their holiday role model.
Beginning about 1980, workers of all collars began losing paid vacation and holiday time, says Juliet B. Schor, author of "The Overworked American." Downsizing and client demands for round-the-calendar-and-clock access to professionals require many to work straight through whatever holidays they are nominally granted.
"The requirements for success have intensified," Ms. Schor said. Companies struggling to keep up with demand would rather pile on the hours than hire new workers. Boeing, late on aircraft deliveries, kept thousands at work through this year's usual holiday break.
The waning of unions has caused holidays to wane as well. For example, building janitors represented by the Service Employees International Union enjoy at least the 10 Federal holidays, and some have more. But 80 percent of janitors are not in unions, so unless they work for government, a holiday is usually a day for mourning the loss of pay.
These days, people boast of holiday workloads the way they used to recount their mad mirth. When James Rowland, executive chef at Dallas's Hotel Crescent Court, learned that his mother planned a brief Christmas visit from Tucson, Ariz., his response was, "Hey, you want to come to work with me?" Seating her for dinner at his restaurant at 11 P.M. on Christmas Eve, he noted that he was due back at work at 7 A.M.
Count on the nation's journalists, consumed with self-pity over having to publish or broadcast every day, to discover each year that work elsewhere slows around the holidays. But managers are out to keep employees marching. In 1986, the last time Christmas fell on a Thursday, 46 percent of employers gave workers a paid Friday off, according to the Bureau of National Affairs, a Washington research group. In 1997, it was 36 percent.
Even as workplace demands multiply, the civic, family and religious spirit behind the holidays has faded. Participation in all forms of associations, from churches to political groups to bowling leagues and P.T.A.'s, has stagnated or declined. The increasing numbers who don't even take a few minutes to observe Election Day can't be expected to march or wave a flag on any other day.
In devising other ways to spend holidays, wily bosses are increasingly resourceful. Editors unapologetically pre-empted this reporter's rude reveling with an assignment that kept him at his desk New Year's Day. "It's about how Americans are getting really sick of holidays," an editor said. "If you could put this together in the next day or two, it might be really fun."

One Korean Certainty: No More Business as Usual

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
AN age-old Korean practice, common among housewives, draws together a group of acquaintances to pool their cash savings and trust one among them to manage the pool profitably. Often, that means providing the money to a credit-starved business at a high interest rate.
Kim Yon-jung, a 54-year-old mother of two who runs her family's finances, participated in this kind of arrangement for years and earned well above what she could have on her own. Putting her cash in someone else's hands, Mrs. Kim also found, allowed her to avoid reporting her holdings to South Korea's aggressive tax authorities. 
 A few weeks ago, however, Mrs. Kim got the shock of her life. The woman in charge of her 30-member group disappeared with all the money, roughly $2 million.
"In the old days, that would never happen," said Mrs. Kim, still amazed that a reliable pillar of her life had disintegrated so swiftly. "My daughter was suspicious of the old way. Maybe now I should listen to her."
 
New Demands
South Korea's financial crisis, so much worse than anyone had predicted, is forcing business executives, government officials and ordinary people to thoroughly rethink the way they have done things for decades. Financial methods and practices left over from a simpler era are abruptly clashing with the demands of a more modern society, like accountability and openness, and it is as true for big conglomerates as it is for housewives like Mrs. Kim.
The current crisis emerged from a tight collusion between big companies and Government that meant that credit was allocated using political, and not financial, criteria. Only when several of South Korea's enormous conglomerates started going bankrupt did the extent of the problem emerge.
When international bankers gathered in New York, Tokyo and London last week and agreed to defer more than $10 billion in Korea's short-term debt, they were mainly interested in keeping the nation from defaulting in a way that would prevent Korean banks from ever paying back the loans.
But rescue packages and loan holidays, even if they keep South Korea's financial system nominally alive, will not fully preserve the old-fashioned ways of this country. And that is good news for an entire generation of younger men and women who see a bright side to South Korea's financial mess. For them, the weakening of conglomerates means that the traditional emphasis on seniority in the business world may have to yield a few steps in favor of ability. Many well-educated young executives are eager to take over from elders they see as long on loyalty and short on efficiency.
Young South Koreans complain that despite a steady modernization over the past 40 years, the nation's economic and social system in many ways still resembles the strict hierarchy of a small village, built as it is on an ethos of trust in a relatively small number of elders who are only informally accountable to the larger group. That may have been fine in the old village, but now it is badly outdated. Just ask Mrs. Kim.
 
Widespread Collusion
By and large, Koreans did not seem surprised that a system of bribery, politically motivated loans and fiscal irresponsibility was widely practiced by heads of conglomerates. What was so shocking was the scale of corruption and collusion. The old Korean financial system may have worked as long as the players -- and their misdemeanors -- remained small. But as companies grew into multibillion-dollar operations, the lack of adequate accountability was bound to lead to abuses.
After Hanbo Iron and Steel went bankrupt in early 1997, for example, an investigation showed that the chairman, Chung Tae Soo, had borrowed $6 billion for the company, and used several hundred million dollars of that to bribe officials to keep authorizing cheap bank loans, keeping some for himself.
Even more stunning, perhaps, was the revelation that the head of the conglomerate that owned Korean Airlines had made a beeline for the presidential mansion in 1983 when a Soviet fighter plane shot down flight KAL 007, killing all 269 people on board. The first concern of the executive, Cho Choong Hoon, was to hand several million dollars to then-president Chun Doo-hwan, to insure that Mr. Cho could keep his job.
Mr. Chun, whose total take allegedly reached hundreds of millions of dollars in his eight-year rule, was pardoned last week and released from serving a life sentence he was given last year.
The election of the liberal reformer Kim Dae Jung on Dec. 18 seems to have given many young people hope that the political system will veer in a more democratic direction. Yet Mr. Kim, who assumes office in late February, is taking over at a time of such financial crisis that it is uncertain how much he can reform the large conglomerates known as chaebol. Even so, the system built around these conglomerates, many of which resemble personal empires rather than efficient businesses, is unlikely to survive in its current form.
 
Seniority System
One aspect of Korean business life that immediately looks vulnerable, for example, is the kisu system of arranging employees by seniority.
Steadily expanding chaebol have hired a new crop of employees each year, labeling each new group according to number of years the company has been in business -- a tag that is expected to remain throughout an employee's career. Even Korea's main airline had a kisu system for flight attendants.
"When you meet someone new at your own company, you immediately ask what kisu they are," explained a Korean journalist. "Whichever one came earlier -- no matter who is actually older -- treats the other one like an inferior."
This year, few chaebol will be hiring; in fact, those that do not fall into bankruptcy will more likely be laying off people.
"The old kisu will gradually become meaningless," said the journalist.
Yet as Mark Clifford, an American journalist, observed in his prescient book about South Korea, "Troubled Tiger" (M. E. Sharpe, 1995), a system so dominated by the Government was bound to run into serious financial trouble.
"The old order is shriveling," wrote Mr. Clifford. "But the new one has yet to be born."

Fail-Safe Strategies In a Market Era

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE setting was the White House Situation Room. It was the second crisis meeting of the day in the famous underground briefing center, where, in Hollywood's imaginings, vast screens illuminate the day's catch from spy satellites and orders are barked through secure links to American outposts around the globe.
The truth, of course, is always more prosaic: the room is cramped, and the screens are more likely to be carrying CNN. But what has really changed in the Situation Room in recent months is the things people talk about there. 
 While the "Sit Room" is still where the nation's leaders go to discuss loose nukes in Russia or Iraq's latest act of defiance, it has repeatedly been used lately to hash out America's next moves to contain the financial crisis in Asia. On that Friday in mid-December, the Secretary of State, Defense Secretary and national security adviser all took part in a debate over whether American taxpayer dollars should be committed to a redoubled effort to keep South Korea's private banks afloat -- and over the consequences if the banks were simply allowed to go under.
"You could tell this was New Age foreign policy," one participant recalled later, "because the assessment didn't come from the C.I.A. It came from J. P. Morgan."
In its myriad dimensions -- financial, political, and national security -- the Asian meltdown has all the earmarks of the ultimate post-cold-war foreign policy crisis.
It is not simply that conversation in the Situation Room these days often parallels the talk in trading pits and boardrooms. Nor that Washington has finally come to regard a currency crisis in Mexico or Southeast Asia as a foreign policy problem that needs to be managed with the vigor devoted to Bosnia or the Middle East -- even if falling currencies lack the televised drama of troops with guns.
 
Three Crises
What's happening today goes a step further. The newfangled financial crises that destabilize huge economies in a single trading day appear increasingly connected to old-line political and security crises. In fact, there is growing fear that 1997's market calamities could beget 1998's security crises -- which explains why Defense Secretary William Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright joined the Administration debate over saving Korean banks.
Their concern dates back to Indonesia's financial seizure in September. That immediately raised fears that the country's economic problems, which have worsened despite an International Monetary Fund bailout, could be exploited by itchy generals looking for ways to push aside President Suharto -- probably not the best way to handle Asia's most problematic political transition. The last time military control of the country changed hands, half a million people died.
But when the trouble hit South Korea, the Administration went on full alert. That is where 37,000 American troops are lined up against the most xenophobic government on Earth. Some Pentagon strategists warned that hard-line North Korean generals might try to capitalize on the South's moment of weakness. But the more immediate worries were how the economic instability might threaten South Korea's fragile democracy, and how it might raise Seoul's doubts about the security alliance with the United States. "If we were perceived to be abandoning them on this issue," one of Mr. Clinton's top security aides said, "they could easily doubt our commitment to help them in an uglier confrontation."
 
You Never Know
Then there is the question of China, which so far has avoided the contagion afflicting the region. George Soros, the financier blamed by Malaysia's leader for starting this madness (falsely, it turns out), marked the New Year with a dour essay warning that the Chinese economy could be the next to burst. At the Treasury, that worry takes a back seat to fretting over Japan.
Of course, these are not the situations for which the Situation Room was built. If they were, every seat at the table would be equipped with a Bloomberg financial terminal.
Some critics even call the Administration's tilting with markets a prime example of its small-potatoes diplomacy. Others say this is the kind of problem where intervention may simply make things worse. As Jeffrey Sachs and Steven Radelet of the Harvard Institute of International Development argued in Foreign Affairs last month, "the currency upheavals probably reflect short-run financial considerations rather than a long-term crisis of regional growth."
The problem is that you never know whether a financial crisis is just a financial crisis until it turns into something worse. The failure of a major Austrian bank in 1931 led to a cascade of failures and devaluations through Eastern Europe and Germany that sped Europe's prewar descent into chaos. No one is predicting anything like that in Asia. But as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said recently, the same technology that has created 24-hour markets has also "enhanced the ability of the system to rapidly transmit problems in one part of the globe to another."
Washington is probably ahead of other capitals in understanding that dynamic, though it underestimated the depth of the brewing crisis. Often, its early-warning system is still tuned to another frequency.
While the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency have talked for years about making economic analysis a top priority, it is still something of a backwater. At the outbreak of the South Korean crisis, almost no one at the American Embassy in Seoul could offer the Treasury insights about what was going on, or extract the truth from South Korea's Finance Ministry.
The Treasury turned to the embassy because none of its own experts are stationed in South Korea -- the world's 11th-largest economy -- or anyplace else in Asia, except for Tokyo. Then again, maybe a bigger presence wouldn't have helped: The International Monetary Fund employs more than 1,000 Ph.D. economists, many of whom constantly travel the globe looking for trouble in the making. They issued reports praising both Thailand and South Korea for "sound macroeconomic management" only months before those countries were pleading for, and got, I.M.F. bailouts.
One reason the Government devotes so few resources to these problems is that the private sector devotes so many. Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, who has spent his days and nights consumed by Asia's problems, notes that "unlike the military sphere, in the financial sphere there are thousands of market participants processing and analyzing information, assessing risk." He adds that "that assessment is reflected in prices" as nations and companies seek to raise money in global markets.
But in the Asian debacle, like the Mexican crisis before it, finance ministries hid the data that might have sounded alarms. That is why the Clinton Administration has been pressing for worldwide rules requiring greater disclosure of monetary data traditionally kept secret. The theory is that if governments know they cannot conceal evidence of trouble, the markets will force them to solve the problem, or watch billions of investment dollars go elsewhere. The problem is that fuller disclosure could set off plenty of false alarms, turning small problems into huge ones if international lenders panic.
So much for the hope the end of the cold war would make the world easier to manage. "For all the talk about free markets and the spreading of American-style capitalism," said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management and a former Under Secretary of Commerce, "the fact is that global finance has become the quintessential interweaving of public and private institutions, mechanisms and interests.
"And as we are seeing, governments and private markets cannot be unraveled in the real world."

HEADLINE: Idealism, Past and Present

 BODY:
The end of the cold war aroused fears among some who conduct foreign policy that Americans would tire of shouldering the world's problems. Superficially, those fears appear well founded. Surveys show that Americans are put off by news of distant conflicts and prefer not to become involved. Look again, however, and a different picture emerges. It turns out that Americans crave engagement in the world's crises, but not in the way they are defined by some leaders in Government, academic institutions and the news media. As a new year dawns, it is worth remembering that citizens want the United States to assert its global leadership, but in a more nuanced and coordinated fashion than in the past.
These thoughts are prompted by two new surveys showing Americans to be perhaps more concerned and even idealistic about the world's problems than many in Washington. Polls by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes and the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found a strong cooperationist streak. For example, the Maryland study found that 74 percent of those surveyed wanted a sharing of power internationally, while only 13 percent wanted the United States to throw its weight around as the sole superpower. In addition, while Congress refuses to approve $1.5 billion in overdue assessments for the United Nations, the Pew survey found that Americans hold the organization in high regard. 
 These practical attitudes pose an interesting challenge to makers of foreign policy, not to mention the news media that report it. When it comes to American intervention, the key to winning support is to gain cooperation of other countries. As for foreign news generally, other polls show that if it focuses on the rise and fall of regimes and far-off diplomatic and military clashes, Americans no longer anchored in the worldwide contest with Moscow have little patience. But the Pew survey has shown surprising concern about those occurrences abroad that affect Americans' economic well-being, health and safety.
This might seem like mere selfishness, but the specific examples tell a different story. The Pew survey found broad support for cooperative action to halt global warming, even if it means applying fuel consumption standards that lead to higher gasoline prices in the United States. Pollsters have also found that in the medical sphere, Americans expect a muscular, multilateral response to the spread of disease, whether from the outbreak of mad cow disease in Britain, AIDS in Africa or avian flu in Hong Kong. Americans are also known to be increasingly aware that the collapse of economies in Latin America or the Caribbean can translate into immigration, and that certain economies are dependent on drug exports to the United States. As for the collapse of currencies and financial institutions in Asia, voters will certainly punish any government that ignores the threat they pose to American banks, individual investors and pension funds.
As President Clinton prepares for the second year of his second term, the foreign policy agenda is surprisingly packed. A newly expanded NATO, and a renewal of American troop involvement in Bosnia, will properly require Congressional approval. Global warming, trade, drugs and disease are at the center of American concerns. The Administration's decision to push for more open trade and to help rescue the economies of Asia will affect the jobs of everyone. The new surveys have thus reinforced an old axiom. Americans care more about the world than they are given credit for. The test of leadership remains to dramatize the connection of the new problems of today to their lives.

HEADLINE: Yellowstone Wolves and Diversity

 BODY:
In nature as in culture, diversity can be a difficult concept. Understanding it is one thing, accepting it another, especially when diversity means not only acknowledging a pre-existing cornucopia of difference -- the very ampleness of the world -- but also accommodating an adjustment to the status quo. A case in point is the reintroduction of gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park. Thirty-three wolves were released in 1995, and their number has now reached 97. Population expansion is one measure of the wolf program's success, but a better one is the wolves' impact on the natural diversity of the park.
As John Varley, the park's chief scientist, put it, the Yellowstone wolves "can create an elk carcass whenever they want." Typically, a pack kills an elk every few days. But over the remains the wolves abandon, a wonderful new diversity has emerged. Since their arrival, wolves have killed many of the park's coyotes. This has created -- or rather re-opened -- new niches for other predators, which have begun to gather in greater numbers over wolf-killed elk carcasses. The reduction in coyotes has caused an increase in rodents, which also benefits a wide array of predators. Even the coyotes who live at the margins of wolf country have prospered, thanks to the leftovers the wolves leave behind. So do grizzly bears, who feed on wolf-killed elk before beginning hibernation. The benefit wolves bestow on grizzlies may turn out to be the most exciting news of all. 
 What has interested scientists is the swiftness, the dynamism, of this shift in diversity. There has been, however, no matching dynamism in the opinions of humans who oppose the wolf reintroduction. That was made plain by a Federal district judge's recent order to "remove" the wolves, the result of litigation that is the offspring of intransigence. Several livestock groups, including the Wyoming Farm Bureau, had filed a suit that urged, in slightly cleverer terms, the old proposition, no wolves, nohow. Several environmental groups had filed a separate lawsuit -- unconnected to the Yellowstone wolves -- protesting the dropping of legal protections for wolves that were recolonizing Idaho. The two suits were unfortunately merged.
Though Judge William Downes stayed his own decision, pending appeal, his judgment is a sad encouragement to the mistaken defensiveness of livestock groups who purport to represent the interests of most ranchers. It is also a misapprehension of the purpose of the environmentalists' suit. His decision needs to be swiftly and decisively overturned on appeal. It is no exaggeration to say that since the return of the wolves, Yellowstone has witnessed an economics of diversity from which human culture -- including the culture of ranching -- can directly profit, if only it chooses to do so.

HEADLINE: It's Andrew Cuomo's Turn at Bat, And Some See Makings of Slugger

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Not long ago, as Mario M. Cuomo lunched with friends at the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller Center, someone asked him why he had no plans to run for office again.
"And Mario said something I had never heard him say before," said Sandy Frucher, a family friend who once worked for Mr. Cuomo, the former Governor of New York. "He flat out said, 'I think I would consider it. But it's Andrew's turn now.' " 
 It has been nearly a year since Andrew Cuomo, 40, Mario's eldest son and heir apparent, became Secretary of Housing and Urban Development -- the youngest ever -- and began aggressively shaking up the troubled agency to help rebuild its battered reputation.
And ever since, political pundits and power brokers have tracked his ascent like weather forecasters follow the path of a hurricane.
Will he go back to New York and run for the Senate in a Democratic primary against George Stephanopoulos? Is he shooting to become Vice President Al Gore's running mate on the ticket for 2000? Why did he make a political appearance in New Hampshire in October?
The questions are clearly a nod to a flourishing career, given his fast start as Housing Secretary, his close relationship with the Vice President and his marriage to Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, joining two of America's most famous political families. Almost anybody who talks about Andrew Cuomo wonders where he might land after he leaves this job.
"I'm going to be here for the year 2000, unless I get fired before," Mr. Cuomo said in an interview, trying to put the questions to rest. "And then I want to help the Vice President become President Gore, any way I can help. Then, who knows."
But the focus on his political ambition enrages Mr. Cuomo, who is intent on trading his image as a New York-style backroom wheeler-dealer -- one so well known in Washington that he was the inspiration for the character Jimmy Ozio in the political novel "Primary Colors." Mr. Cuomo prefers a more dignified portrait as a Washington mandarin. The very thought that this transition is incomplete profoundly upsets Mr. Cuomo, whose staff formulated a full-scale public relations offensive to counter the image during preparation for this article.
"This is a political business and a political town," Mr. Cuomo said, incredulously. "If I weren't doing the politics, I wouldn't be doing my job. I'm not here to practice medicine."
Andrew Cuomo wants nothing more than for people to quit rehashing his past and predicting his future. He wants them to focus on the present, on accomplishments he can point to without dispute.
 
A Fast Start But Miles to Go
In his first year at the helm of the department, Mr. Cuomo, who spent four years at the agency as an assistant secretary, has earned high marks from members of Congress, the Clinton Administration and several housing industry insiders. They say he has moved quickly, decisively and innovatively to help resuscitate a still-troubled agency.
"I am very impressed with the intensity and the diligence with which the Secretary is pressing for reform within the department," said Representative Jerry Lewis, Republican of California, who is chairman of the housing panel on the Appropriations Committee. "He takes the job very seriously."
But the department remains at "high risk," according to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, and Mr. Cuomo faces considerable challenges. The agency has antiquated technology, low morale and must deal with its failure to fully address the needs of poor people in urban centers.
And critics wonder whether Mr. Cuomo, in his zeal to right wrongs, may be moving too quickly to consolidate programs, handling matters too harshly and surrounding himself with inexperienced people who have little knowledge of the department.
The question remains: How can the department redefine itself?
"Part of the problem," said Representative Rick A. Lazio, Republican of New York, "is that HUD needs to establish a more relevant and important mission."
 
As Confidence Rises, So Do Budget Dollars
The way Mr. Cuomo sees it, the bottom line extends no further than the bottom dollar. "That is a real indicia of success," he said. "What does it come down to? Did you get the budget or not?"
The White House is proposing to give the department $1 billion to $2 billion more for the fiscal year 1999, which will begin Oct. 1, its first increase in three years and the healthiest rise in more than a decade. This year, the department's budget was $24 billion. The figures mean nothing without Congress's approval, but Mr. Cuomo and others said they underscored the White House's growing confidence in the department.
"I think people will regard this as the best HUD budget in over a decade," said Gene Sperling, a former aide to Governor Cuomo, who is now an assistant to the President on economic policy. "And I think that's due, in no small part, to the feeling that Andrew has been willing to both take some tough steps to improve the efficiency of HUD and that he has been very good at coming up with new ideas that have caught the attention of the President and the Vice President."
A prosecutor at heart, Mr. Cuomo tackles the job with analytical prowess and pragmatism, friends and critics say. He relishes the long hours, the homework and the debate. "Peeling the onion" is a favorite phrase. And he has experience in the field, which is uncommon for a Housing Secretary. In New York, Mr. Cuomo helped develop housing for the homeless.
"He has the best political instincts of any secretary at HUD, and I've known them all," said Cushing N. Dolbeare, the dean of housing advocates and a freelance housing consultant. "My sense is that whenever I have been in a meeting with him, he listened with two ears; one for substance and the other for how this is going to sound to people he has to convince."
The agency has several large missions. It provides rental assistance to about 4.5 million low-income people, helps revitalize some 4,000 cities through grants, promotes fair housing and is responsible for billions of dollars in mortgage insurance.
Mr. Cuomo's strategy has been threefold: acknowledge the mess the agency is in, get tough on waste, fraud and abuse, and overhaul the department's structure.
"What is HUD?" Mr. Cuomo said, posing a question and then answering it himself, a self-Socratic dialogue perfected by his father. "It is scandal. It is inefficient. It is wasteful. It is the constructor of public housing institutions. It is the destroyer of neighborhoods. It is the place where good taxpayers have their dollars ripped off. I'm going to change everything you believe about HUD. But first of all, I'm going to acknowledge all of this. Acknowledge it, then resolve it."
To get tough, he brought in the Justice Department to help chase bad landlords who defraud taxpayers and operate slums. He is bolstering HUD's enforcement center, placing a full-time agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation at the helm, and cracking down on housing discrimination.
His proudest accomplishment this year, he said, is helping get through Congress the first major piece of housing legislation in five years, which, among other things, ends excessive rental subsidies to private landlords, saving taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
To get it passed, Mr. Cuomo spent countless hours on the telephone with members of Congress and their staffs, and, in the end, he compromised where his predecessors did not, said a House Republican aide familiar with the circumstances.
"Cuomo does back up with action," the aide said.
"Cisneros got dribs and drabs from us," he said, referring to the previous Housing Secretary, Henry G. Cisneros. "Cuomo is smart. He sees the writing on the wall and changes strokes midstream."
Mr. Cuomo has also tackled the dull but important issue of management reform, consolidating programs, improving automation and taking action to reduce the size of the staff to 7,500 from 9,500 by 2002, a process Mr. Cisneros started.
This downsizing, which the inspector general recently said appeared to be an arbitrary number that could exacerbate problems at the agency, has in fact contributed to low morale. But Mr. Cuomo, with the backing of unions that represent the department's workers, is trying to allay that by running a merit competition for jobs. Employees are evaluated by a panel of civil servants and will "win" their jobs based on performance, not seniority or connections.
"Morale," one Democratic Senate aide said, "will skyrocket."
 
Blessing and Curse Of a Famous Name
Mr. Cuomo does not rest easy in his chair. He leans forward, he leans back, jabbing the air with his index finger. When he talks, he hits his syllables hard and quick, his voice sliding from a near whisper to a head-snapping hurl.
Results are what matter to him.
Yet, the same political astuteness he uses so deftly to get the job done lends him the air of a "politico" that some people find disconcerting, say some people on Capitol Hill.
"I have a feeling, as do many other people, that Andrew's mission is his own future political career," said Madeleine Hastings, a former official of the department who left it unhappily in September.
It is an image Mr. Cuomo cannot escape. He grew up, after all, under the tutelage of Mario Cuomo in a city known for its tough politics. He sounds just like his father. And like his father, he is sometimes seen as someone who is short-tempered and prickly about his reputation.
But it is also an image that implies a sterling political future. "My assumption has been, whenever Moynihan doesn't run, Cuomo will be at the top of the list," said Charles E. Cook Jr., who publishes a bipartisan political newsletter, "The Cook Report." "He will walk into any Senate race with a huge number of advantages: the name recognition, the fund-raising apparatus, and he's obviously a very talented person."
Mr. Cuomo acknowledges that his political background and family ties are both a blessing and a liability. "I was exposed to one of the best teachers you could have, in Mario Cuomo," he said. His father, Mr. Cuomo said, taught him that public service was "a cause and a mission and a philosophy as opposed to a business and a path to power." But, he added, "The inverse is people think you are highly politicized."
One example people cite of his political acumen took place last summer, when he announced that he would open a new enforcement center in New York City. The department's largest union fiercely opposed the move, which would have required several trial lawyers to move from Washington.
One agency lawyer wrote to Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, calling it incredible that "a Republican would want to fill the coffers of Secretary Cuomo for a run in New York."
Mr. Cuomo eventually dropped the idea and made peace with the union. But the notion that the move had anything to do with his political ambition clearly unnerves him.
"People who assume I want to run for elected office may be dealing from a bad assumption," he said.
Others say his plan to open a center in New York and other major cities was Politics 101; an unsolicited gift to important members of Congress who control the housing committees and whose districts were scheduled to lose jobs in the effort to downsize the department.
"It's not illogical to pay attention to the politics that affect those people who are the key policy people you deal with," Mr. Lewis, the California Congressman, said.
Despite all the talk of ambition, the fact is, Mr. Cisneros said, Mr. Cuomo chose to stay committed to the task of fixing the ailing agency.
"He could have gone back to New York at the end of his term," the former Housing Secretary said. "But he chose one of the least attractive, least promising departments in Washington to head. That speaks much more to his intent to produce results and get things done."
As Mr. Cuomo describes it, being Housing Secretary epitomizes the dignity of public service. It is about helping poor people, he said, adding that he would not trade away the job any time soon.
"We can do real good things here for people," Mr. Cuomo said. "When I got here we served 25,000 homeless people a year. We now serve 280,000 a year. Who gets a chance in their life to make that difference?"

HEADLINE: Russia's Church-Run Campus Has a Secular Goal

BYLINE: By MARINA LAKHMAN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 3

 BODY:
In the cozy top floor of the Vysoko Petrovsky monastery, where Russian Orthodox monks once immersed themselves in ancient manuscripts, Natasha Nikolayeva and her classmates were taking their final exams in Russian housing law recently. The icons that adorn the walls of the tiny lecture room comforted Ms. Nikolayeva, who came from Ukraine to study here.
"I knew that here I would find people close to me in spirit, faith and style of life," said the 21-year-old senior. "The jurisprudence was secondary, but I was looking for an education that would be a mix of the spiritual with the practical." 
 In Soviet times, it was common for church buildings to be confiscated by the state and turned into Government offices, schools, museums or even granaries. But now, for the first time, people are studying secular subjects in a Russian religious institution. Ms. Nikolayeva is one of the students at the Russian Orthodox University of St. John the Theologian, the only church-run university in the country that is training young people for the professional world of the new Russia rather than priests.
"We did not create this university to train people to serve the church," said the rector of the university and head of the monastery, Ioann Economtsev. "Our purpose was to bring about a synthesis between scholarship and faith, and religion and morality, because scholarship without morality at its core is dangerous."
Despite the university's religious name and leanings, Mr. Economtsev said most of the applicants are seeking to enter the law and economics department and as a result the competition is steeper than in other departments. In contrast with Soviet times, law and economics have become prestigious careers as the Russian media publicize the growing wealth and political influence of the country's top bankers.
Based on the traditions of the Academy of Slavonic, Greek and Latin Studies, a church university in pre-revolutionary Russia, the Russian Orthodox university is a major departure from the kind of schooling the church was able to involve itself in during the Soviet era.
It also reflects the church's attempt to consolidate its hold on Russian society and turn itself back into the country's official religion.
Although Russia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, President Boris N. Yeltsin signed a hotly debated bill last year -- at the urging of the Russian Orthodox Church -- that limits the growth of new religions in Russia and gives priority to the Russian Orthodox Church. The bill drew fierce criticism from international human-rights groups and a threat from the United States Congress to cut off aid to Russia.
The financing of the university is indicative of the church's willingness to involve itself in politics. Though the church oversees the university, it is primarily financed by private sponsors, the largest of which is the powerful Oneksimbank.
The bank's president, Vladimir Potanin, one of the most politically influential figures in the country, is a major donor to the church. His annual gift of $100,000 to the Russian Orthodox university makes up 40 percent of the university's budget.
Anna Parshikova, a spokeswoman for Uneximbank, said that the bank hopes to employ future graduates of the university's law and economics departments.
"They have attracted a great number of Moscow's elite scholars to teach there," she said. "There are few institutions that can compare."
With religion experiencing a revival since the fall of Communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the university's religious leanings are an attraction for many students. So is the prospect for a free education, a mainstay of the Soviet Union, an opportunity which is slowly diminishing as the cash-strapped Government finds itself unable to finance higher education.
With departments in law, economics and ecology as well as philosophy and theology and related fields, and with a new medical department to begin next fall, the university has increased its enrollment 10-fold to 500 students since it opened in 1993.
The university offers a rigorous academic program. Students in the departments of philosophy and theology, and history and philology are required to study ancient Greek, Latin and Russian in addition to a modern language, while Bible students are required to add ancient Hebrew and Aramaic, to their studies.
Yulia Butskikh, 20, who is in her third year of study in the philosophy and theology department, said the university had found an educational niche that is not available at other institutions.
"M.G.U. does not have the religious depth and religious academies do not have the scholarship," she said comparing the university with Moscow State University, one of the country's best-known universities. "This is a good combination of the two."
The faculty includes professors from Moscow State University, two from England -- who give their lectures on literature in English -- and Nikita Tolstoy, who until his death last year headed the Slavonics specialty in the history and philology department. Mr. Tolstoy is the son of the Soviet novelist Aleksei Tolstoy and a distant relative of Leo Tolstoy.
Unlike religious universities elsewhere, the Russian Orthodox university does not require its students to attend services and there are no stringent housing rules since the school does not have dormitories for its students. Nonetheless, all students are required to complete courses in the history of Christianity as well as the Old and New Testaments. In addition, economics students also have the opportunity to take courses like "Economics in the World of the Bible" and "The Economic Views of the Fathers of the Church."
Irina Pankova, who is in her last year of study in the university's law department, said she hoped the education she received at the university would allow her to bring about change in Russia.
"I think this education allows us to look at the future with a human view," she said, "not the way things are now, like in economics, where there is no humanity."
Mr. Economtsev said he too hopes to see his graduates transform Russia. "My goal is to prepare the intellectual and spiritual elite of Russia," he said. "We are not preparing students for the Russia of yesterday, and not the Russia that exists today. We are preparing students for a regenerated Russia, for a highly cultural, highly moral Russia of great intellectual and scientific potential."

HEADLINE: Unlikely Twist: G.I.'s Warm to Bosnia

BYLINE: By MIKE O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: OLOVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Staff Sgt. Paul Correale noticed the elderly woman in black with the toddler when the two turned to watch his patrol from 50 feet or so away. The child waved a tiny, pink-mittened hand in greeting.
The sergeant, 34, is a specialist in armed reconnaissance who describes what his training entailed this way: "They tell us to go out and get information on the enemy so the main force can kill them." And that is what he is expected to do in Bosnia if the NATO-led peacekeeping mission deteriorates into combat. 
 But, with that pink mitten waving back and forth, his patrol stopped while the sergeant, laughing, ran over to grasp the child's hand.
"I'm doing what I'm doing for the kids here," he said afterward. "I think the Bosnians are the hardest working, most decent people I've ever seen."
The United States Army has worried about this sort of thing. Senior American officers in Bosnia spent much of the last two years telling their subordinates not to let soldiers get emotionally involved in what they were doing here. There was too high a risk that Western efforts would fail, the officers said, and if the soldiers cared too much about the country their morale might collapse along with the peace.
But it seems too late for such concerns. To a considerable extent, American forces have gone from dispassionate observers in a confusing land to soldiers who feel their job is to help people they now know and like.
Senior officers now say it may be better for the Army if the soldiers feel an emotional association with Bosnians.
Soldiers get constant reinforcement from Bosnians who tell them it is good that the Americans are here. Psychological screenings of soldiers leaving the danger, discomfort and loneliness of long tours in Bosnia find that the troops feel better about themselves and their jobs than the average American does, according to Army psychologists.
An immediate benefit for the Army is that soldiers who have been assigned to Bosnia are more likely to re-enlist than others, officers say. This year the re-enlistment rates for some Army units in Europe, from which most the soldiers in Bosnia have come, are more than 50 percent higher than their goals, the Army says.
In this town there was another statistic to note: The number of times per minute Bosnians smiled and greeted the American patrol.
As they walked the frozen streets at the bottom of a cup-shaped valley where the mountains, the pine trees and the sky were uniformly white with snow and haze, most of the American soldiers spoke optimistically of their work.
They did not dwell on the factories destroyed by shelling or the large number of refugees here who are barred from returning to their homes because the country remains splintered along ethnic lines. Instead, the men in this patrol noted the rebuilt homes and hospital.
Their view of success comes in part from the limited view of their responsibilities expressed by the Army. Their orders do not include having them hunt down indicted war crimes suspects who still powerfully influence politics, although NATO troops are authorized to arrest suspects if security conditions allow. Nor are they supposed to insure that the victims of so-called ethnic cleansing return to their homes.
While a fractured Bosnia, brim-full with the unemployed, the homeless and the angry and governed by politicians who will not work together, may yet blow apart, the soldiers are told their work is going well.
Many of the 8,500 Americans soldiers in Bosnia believe that since their deployment after the December 1995 Dayton accords, they have enforced a peace that is allowing civilian and international agencies to begin rebuilding a country many of them have come to like.
Walking next to the rebuilt Olovo hospital, fresh plaster on the outside and warm clinics filled with children and their mothers inside, Capt. Dan McIntosh, who commands an armored cavalry company, said: "Think of what that means to a community to lose its only hospital. And then, we help open it up. That is something. Our soldiers set the conditions for that."
The executive officer of Captain McIntosh's company, First Lieut. Daniel Fickel, 25, of Miami, said his father tells him that what he is doing in Bosnia now is similar to what his father did earlier in the Peace Corps.
"We're really helping people," Lieutenant Fickel said. "You can't send soldiers halfway around the world to save a country and then say don't get emotionally involved."
Though the American Army policy has been to insist all three ethnic groups -- Serbs, Muslims and Croats -- be treated exactly the same, many soldiers feel that the Muslims, who have the highest number of displaced in Bosnia now, suffered the most during the 1992-95 war. Nearly everyone in Bosnia is relieved the fighting has stopped, but Muslims are convinced the West stopped a war of annihilation that was directed against them, and probably feel especially appreciative toward the peacekeepers.
But with Western governments pressing Bosnian authorities to carry out terms of the peace agreement, there have been times when the NATO-led forces, including Americans, have met violence.
The worst case for the Americans was in August, when troops tried to install a more cooperative police commander in Brcko in the Bosnian Serb-controlled area and mobs organized by local Serbian authorities blocked the attempt. Civilians attacked American soldiers with stones and gasoline bombs.
Despite such incidents, relations between most Bosnians and American troops have been good.
In Olovo, a town named for the lead mined here since Roman times and now inhabited mostly by Muslims, Sergeant Correale seems to have found a place he likes.
Displaying considerable knowledge of medieval Bosnian history, Sergeant Correale, of Huber Heights, Ohio, pointed out a citadel-like building poking through the snow halfway up a mountain and explained that it was one of two centuries-old Roman Catholic monasteries in the area. He added that, based on his reading in the five months since he came here, he has come to doubt the theory that the recent fighting in Bosnia was an inevitable continuation of longstanding ethnic antagonisms.
It is easier now for soldiers to study history and become acquainted with Bosnians than it was in January 1996, when the American troops fought rain, blizzards and a churning Sava River to enter this country. Then, everything was arduous, everywhere was dangerous and living conditions were terrible.
But as political tensions have eased and the Army has become accustomed to working in Bosnia, the soldier's life here has improved.
Even so, soldiers raised questions that senior officers say trouble them as well.
"I think we are doing good, but it is taking a lot out of everyone," said Sgt. Sabrina Pinkard, a medical technician from Columbus, Ohio, who is based at Camp Gentry, a rather isolated base on the northern edge of the American sector.
Referring to the Army's downsizing and the increase in overseas deployments in recent years, she said, "If our unit keeps getting sent places, here or wherever, with no time to rest and catch up, we are going to wear out."
"She's right," said Pvt. David Quinn, also with the Second Cavalry Regiment. Thinking about the stress on soldiers who are separated from their families, he said, "We got our own trouble back home, too."
Soldiers say what makes them think their mission is worthwhile is the balance between the personal burden and the task at hand. In Bosnia, they are getting extra pay and bonuses. Many feel that are sharpening their military skills. And life on their bases, though still difficult, has become less uncomfortable.
At Camp Demi in north-central Bosnia, where the soldiers patrolling the town of Olovo are based, a dinner last week offered choices of 6 entrees including pretty tasty burritos, 6 vegetables, 12 kinds of salad and 8 desserts.
Talk around the base was about how the Army has settled in in Bosnia. The mission has gone from short and arduous to something of indefinite length that has become part of the Army's life.
Soldiers said they were not at all surprised by President Clinton's recent announcement that there is no longer a deadline to withdraw the troops from Bosnia. It seemed clear, many thought, that Bosnia was going to be an assignment to be rotated among combat units for some time.
"I guess it's going to be somewhere between like what we did in Haiti and what we're doing in Korea," said Specialist Jason Suddeth, 21 from Galesburg, Ill.

HEADLINE: EAGER AND FLUSH, MANY STATES PLAN YET MORE TAX CUTS

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 3

 BODY:
With the economy refusing to cool, with most states sitting on sizable surpluses and with gubernatorial and legislative elections scheduled in a majority of states, tax-cut fever is once again sweeping the land as legislatures prepare to open their 1998 sessions.
Experts on state politics and fiscal affairs predict that at least half of the states will enact tax cuts of some magnitude this year, just as they have in each of the last three years. As tax cutting has become an increasingly bipartisan initiative, the debate in many states is no longer whether taxes should be reduced but which ones should be cut and by how much. 
 Even before lawmakers return to their capitols, dozens of tax-cut proposals have been floated in an effort to outmaneuver the political opposition and to snatch election-year credit for returning money to the voters. Gubernatorial elections will be held this year in 36 states, and legislators face elections in 46 states.
A survey this week found that either governors or legislative leaders in at least 26 states have started calling for tax cuts, well before any governor has proposed an executive budget.
Here in Georgia's capital, for instance, Gov. Zell Miller, a Democrat, and the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate appeared in an unusual show of unity last month to announce their support for a plan to cut personal income taxes by $205 million. They have pledged to enact the plan, which would increase personal income tax deductions, within the first two weeks of the legislative session, which begins on Jan. 12.
In most places, this year's tax reduction proposals have been relatively modest, often because larger tax cuts were enacted in previous years and because lawmakers have lingering memories of slashing budgets and raising taxes in the recession of the early 1990's.
But nationwide, authorities on state fiscal matters predict, the aggregate amount of state tax cuts in 1998 is likely to match or exceed that of 1997. As in Washington, that is a reflection of both the fiscal conservatism that has been embraced by both political parties in the Clinton era and the robust health of the economy.
"I think there will be somewhat larger tax cuts in 1998 than in 1997 because, after all, this revenue growth has sustained itself longer than anyone expected," said Ronald K. Snell, director of the economic and fiscal division of the National Conference of State Legislatures. "My guess is that they would exceed 1997 just based on the number of states in which governors and legislative leadership are talking about them."
Another authority on state finances, Hal Hovey, the editor of State Budget and Tax News, predicted that "there will be some form of countable, calculable tax cuts in at least 25 states."
Mr. Snell said that 27 states cut taxes in 1997 for a net national tax reduction of $2.5 billion. In 1996, 29 states cut taxes worth $4 billion, while in 1995, 25 states cut taxes worth $3.3 billion, he said.
In enacting tax cuts over the last three years, many governors and legislative leaders have underscored the need to compensate taxpayers for the tax increases they endured in the early 1990's. And as tax cutting has become a national priority, states have felt pressure to reduce tax rates to remain competitive with their neighbors.
Virtually every kind of tax is vulnerable to reduction this year, although Mr. Hovey said he sensed declining interest in cutting business taxes. He said that may be because job creation had become less urgent with the national unemployment rate at 4.6 percent, the lowest level in 24 years. Property taxes on motor vehicles have become a new target after the Republican candidate, James S. Gilmore 3d, won last year's gubernatorial race in Virginia by promising to cut that state's onerous car taxes.
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, a Republican, has yet to announce whether he will propose new tax cuts this year after presiding over a whopping $11 billion in cuts in the last three years. But the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, also a Republican, has called for an additional $1 billion in cuts, much of it to benefit businesses.
"It's started to work in New York," Mr. Bruno said, "and when something's working in a positive way you ought to keep doing it."
In some states, governors and legislative leaders have started to warn that further tax cutting would place services at risk if the economy deteriorates. And, predictably, advocates for more spending on schools and social services argue that state surpluses should be spent rather than refunded.
Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition of the country's largest public school systems, said, "Now is the time, when the economy is flush, both at the Federal and state levels, to do the difficult things that government can't seem to gather the will for in bad times."
But in most places, the steady growth of the last four years has convinced lawmakers that additional tax cutting can be afforded without endangering essential programs.
As in many states, in Georgia the Democratic proposal this year follows large tax cuts in recent years. In 1996, Mr. Miller and the General Assembly enacted the biggest tax cut in state history by eliminating the sales tax on groceries, a $550 million reduction in a state with a general fund budget of $11.8 billion.
This year's pre-emptive strike by Georgia's Democrats comes at a time when Republicans are mounting an aggressive campaign to win the governorship here for the first time this century and when Republicans hope to continue to chip away at the Democrats' thinning majorities in the House and Senate.
Even before the Democrats offered their plan, Guy Millner, the leading Republican candidate for Governor, proposed a much larger tax reduction. He has called for eliminating the property tax on motor vehicles in the first year of his administration, a cut worth $490 million. In the second year, he would offer an additional $360 million in tax credits to residential property owners. Mr. Millner's plan, which has been criticized as unrealistic by some Democratic leaders, would eventually reduce state revenues by more than 7 percent.
Though he refused to comment on Mr. Millner's proposal, Mr. Miller said in an interview that voters wanted a balance between responsible tax cuts and new spending.
"They want investments in education and jobs and safe streets, the things they talk about around the kitchen table, but they also want responsible fiscal government," he said, pointing out that Georgia has spent heavily on education and prison construction in his two terms. "This bubble some day will burst, and we need to always keep that in mind. So while this $200 million tax cut we're going to be doing this year is responsible, maybe to do more than that would be irresponsible."
Alan Secrest, a pollster who has worked for a number of Georgia Democrats, including Mr. Miller, said that the Democrats' tax plan here was aimed primarily at protecting the party's majorities in the General Assembly.
"Democrats in states like Georgia are doing a good job of thinking and acting like a political minority before they become one, meaning that they are presenting a cogent, unified message and they are agreeing to disagree in private," Mr. Secrest said.
The drive for tax cuts around the country is being fueled by strong revenue collections, particularly in personal income taxes paid by the wealthy, which have left states with end-of-the-year surpluses. Many states also have filled rainy-day reserve funds to their statutory limits.
In the 1997 fiscal year, which ended June 30 in most states, 44 states had surpluses totaling $14.7 billion, said Arturo Perez, an analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since then, the good news has only continued. A report issued this week by Mr. Perez concludes that 29 states predict that revenue collections for 1998 will exceed expectations, while spending in nearly all states has remained on target.
Such news has been a political godsend for Governors like Thomas R. Carper of Delaware. Under Mr. Carper, a Democrat in his second term, Delaware has cut taxes for five consecutive years. "It doesn't get much better than this," he acknowledged in an interview. This year, Mr. Carper has proposed cutting $53 million in personal income and business taxes. Republicans who control the House in Delaware have proposed tax cuts nearly twice that large.
In Massachusetts, all four announced gubernatorial candidates -- two Republicans and two Democrats -- have already called for tax reductions. The Republicans -- A. Paul Cellucci, the Acting Governor, and Joseph Malone, the State Treasurer -- both support a ballot initiative that would reduce personal income taxes to 5 percent from 5.95 percent over three years. Patricia McGovern, a Democratic candidate and former State Senator, has proposed the same rollback over five years. And Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, also a Democrat, wants tax rates brought down to 5.25 percent over five years.
South Carolina's Governor, David Beasley, a Republican who faces re-election this year, is seriously considering calling for a reduction in motor vehicle taxes when he unveils his budget on Jan. 12, said Gary Karr, his spokesman. The state, which has a $4.7 billion budget, has already devoted $750 million over three years to help roll back property taxes for homeowners, and will spend another $240 million on that effort this year, Mr. Karr said.
But in some states, legislators and governors are beginning to urge caution about reducing tax rates further on the basis of recurring surpluses. A particular danger, they said, is that surpluses of recent years have been produced largely by personal income tax receipts, which may reflect the unprecedented three-year surge in the stock market rather than any permanent growth in the economy.
"The danger is that we will give it away and then find over the next years that we're not doing well and can't sustain the tax cuts," said State Senator Rochelle Pingree, the Democratic majority leader in Maine, where Republicans have proposed reducing the state's 6 percent sales tax by 1 percent. "But 1998 is an election year, and it's appealing to say, 'I gave you something back.' "

HEADLINE: Chiropractors' Problem: What Price Acceptance?

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
For chiropractors in New York, 1998 has been touted as the year of the back, the year when insurance companies and managed-care organizations are finally being forced to confer legitimacy on their oft-maligned profession.
With the start of the new year, New York became only the third state to mandate coverage for most chiropractors' services. But the new regulations do not have chiropractors looking for more office space, hiring new associates or ordering new cars. 
 Chiropractors across the state said that although they were gratified by the new laws -- which were opposed by physicians, the insurance industry and the Giuliani administration -- they doubted that they were in store for a windfall.
"I don't think people are going to rush to go see chiropractors just because there's a new law," said Dr. Martin Kotlar, a chiropractor in North White Plains. "If, suddenly, you were able to get open-heart surgery covered by insurance, would you go out and get it just because it was covered?"
Most chiropractors said that they would likely get more patients because of the new law. But they said that managed-care companies, seeking to hold down the cost of this newly required service, would offer chiropractors far less than the fees they are now charging, which had been covered in full or in part by insurance, or, in other cases, were paid out of pocket by patients.
"Managed care pays a fraction of the usual fee and it's usually less than it costs," said Dr. Andrew Lacerenza, a chiropractor who has a solo practice in Lindenhurst on Long Island. "So, most everyone I know is playing it very close to the vest. I don't see anybody moving from a 1,000-square-foot office to 2,000 square feet."
The health-care climate in New York has changed significantly in the decade since chiropractors began their campaign to gain parity under the state's insurance laws. Nearly half the people in the state now receive their health care through managed-care companies that negotiate discounted rates with providers.
In that time, doctors in virtually every specialty have been forced to cut back expenses and streamline their operations, trying to treat more patients for less money per visit.
The new law requires health insurance companies and managed-care organizations to pay for up to 15 visits to a chiropractor each year. Beyond those visits, the insurers can limit payment for treatments that are not deemed medically necessary, but only if the decision does not discriminate specifically against chiropractors. That is, if the insurer would continue to cover such treatment if it was given by an orthopedist or a physical therapist, it cannot bar the treatment simply because the provider is a chiropractor and the patient has reached the 15-visit limit.
Chiropractors say the nondiscrimination provision gives them a sense of legitimacy and credibility that has long eluded them in New York's conservative medical establishment.
"The main focus of this has never been making more money," said Dr. Robert Crocker, a member of the board of directors of the New York State Chiropractic Association, a professional organization representing about 2,000 of the nearly 5,000 chiropractors licensed in the state. "Chiropractors have been marginalized for so long by the medical establishment we're more intense about getting a legitimate standing for the profession."
"We always felt," he continued, "that if we got a fair shake in terms of insurance coverage, we'd stand or fall based on whether or not we did a good job for the patient. We figured any economic boon would come from that."
Dr. Crocker, who has a solo practice in North Babylon on Long Island, said he had no plans to increase his office space, the size of his staff -- which currently consists of one full-time and one part-time receptionist -- or the size of his car.
"This has always been portrayed by our opponents in the insurance industry as a blank check to chiropractors," Dr. Crocker said. "That's not what it looks like from this end."
Dr. Lacerenza said that welcome as it is, the new law addresses only a small corner of the problems chiropractors have faced in dealing with insurers and managed-care companies. Five years ago, he and two other chiropractors filed a lawsuit against 12 insurance and managed-care companies, charging them with violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.
The suit, which will face its next hurdle on Feb. 11 in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, charges that the companies conspired to exclude chiropractors from the managed-care setting and that individual companies had a range of regulations that served to restrain the practices of chiropractors.
One of the biggest problems Dr. Lacerenza described is one faced by various doctors: in putting together their panels of doctors, managed-care companies often limit how many doctors can join, locking some practitioners out and, at times, forcing patients to travel longer distances to get care from a listed provider.
"I've applied to be on the panels of 12 H.M.O.'s," Dr. Lacerenza said. "And I've been denied every time. They told me they had enough people in my geographic area. They told me the plan was closed. Now it's obviously because I've filed this suit. But there is some secret procedure to getting on these panels. We believe that anyone who meets certain minimum qualifications should be able to get in."
Dr. Dale Cohen is on the panels of about 10 managed-care companies. And, he said, in 90 percent of those arrangements, the rates he is paid are lower than his regular rates. He added that even if it meant limiting the number of potential patients, he would not join certain managed-care plans because the fees they offer are too low.
"Access to a bigger patient base is not worth it to me if the reimbursement is too low," said Dr. Cohen, who has his own practice in Camillus, which is near Syracuse.
Still, he said that he expected the new law to bring more patients his way. "But," he added, "I don't expect there to be such an increase in income that I or other people will be going out and buying yachts."
Dr. Howard S. Asness of Great Neck was a tad more optimistic. He said that the new law would give patients more freedom to choose chiropractors to deal with certain medical problems and that he hoped some of those patients would choose to go to him.
"It will help my practice," Dr. Asness said. "Is it going to make me an overnight millionaire? Unfortunately, only the lottery is going to do that."

Mr. Break-It And Mr. Fix-It

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Twenty-five years ago today, New York newspapers reported the purchase of the Yankees by a group of out-of-towners whose leader proclaimed: "I won't be active in the day-to-day operations of the club at all. I can't spread myself so thin. I've got enough headaches with my shipping company."
George Steinbrenner laughed last week when he was reminded of that statement. 
 "That's good," he said. "That is the way I started. Sure, yeah, I meant it. I didn't think I was going to be in New York that much. I didn't hold true to my word because I saw things that needed fixing. I didn't understand how bad things were or how complicated they were."
It was his visit to Yankee Stadium on his first day as managing partner, he said, that gave Steinbrenner, then 42 years old, the first clue that his presence would be required on a regular basis.
"I walked in the office the first day," he related, "and in the middle of the winter, fresh-cut flowers were on every secretary's desk. I said to one secretary: 'These are beautiful. What is it?' She said, 'Mr. Burke has fresh-cut flowers on every secretary's desk every day.' I said, 'What does that cost?' When I found out, it got me involved in a hurry. It escalated and enlarged."
Mike Burke, an urbane Irish-American, had run the Yankees for the previous owner, CBS, and it mattered not that the economics of operating the team had run away from the television network. If Burke felt that flowers provided a touch of class, flowers there would be.
Then along came the man from Cleveland.
Without fanfare, the Yankees yesterday marked the 25th anniversary of Steinbrenner's ownership. The number of years is more significant than simply being a round number. They make Steinbrenner the longest-tenured owner in the grand and glorious history of the Yankees. Jacob Ruppert had owned the team for 24 years when he died in 1939.
If it hadn't been flowers, something else would have prompted Steinbrenner to depart emphatically from his Jan. 3, 1973 pledge. To this day, he remains as involved on a daily basis as the proverbial elephant who sits wherever he wants when he enters a room.
Steinbrenner, in fact, is even more involved now than he was at the start because he is more knowledgeable about baseball. He, and not his general manager, negotiates the major player moves the Yankees make, and he also takes time for less glamorous chores, as he exhibited last summer when he ran the Yankee Stadium parking lot for a day.
Whether he is signing Hideki Irabu to a multimillion-dollar contract or parking a Jeep Cherokee, Steinbrenner is involved.
"I'm a hands-on guy," he acknowledged unashamedly. "No sense trying to lie about that."
Worse, he admitted to no one's surprise: "I'm not a good sportsman. I'm a poor loser. I'm just that way." And while he was being candid, he said, "I'm not totally happy with everything I've done, but on balance, I'll stand on the record."
Except for Bud Selig in Milwaukee and Gene Autry in Anaheim, where the cowboy has ceded ownership control to the Disney people, Steinbrenner is the most senior owner of a Major League Baseball team.
To mark his 25th anniversary, he agreed to a series of interviews, even with a reporter he tried to bar from the clubhouse in his first season as owner because he was unhappy with the reporter's articles.
An out-of-towner from Cleveland, who nevertheless liked to say he hadn't just ridden into town on a load of pumpkins, Steinbrenner initially resented negative newspaper articles about him, then came to understand that the important thing was to get his name in the papers, especially on the back pages of the tabloids.
Not very far into his quarter century in New York, he became one of the best and widely known sports personalities in the country.
"You guys did that," he said, meaning reporters.
But no one could have done it without him and his actions, sometimes outrageous, sometimes engaging, but always worth the price of admission.
 
Signing Catfish Hunter Makes the Difference
 Although he has worn out his welcome with many Yankees fans over the years, they all loved him for restoring the team to its championship level in his first five years. But he readily admitted he had help, his arrival in New York closely coinciding with the arrival of free agency.
"Without free agency coming the way it did," he said, "I couldn't have done much because we didn't have much."
Catfish Hunter, whose contract-created free agency preceded by two years the start of negotiated free agency, showed Steinbrenner what he could do by signing stars who were free to roam.
Asked if there was one move that ignited the restoration, the owner said: "Catfish Hunter was the cornerstone to turning our club around. His demeanor around the other players, the way he carried himself, the way he dealt with problems in the clubhouse. He was a winner. He knew how to win. You have to know how to win. It's not something that just happens."
Reggie Jackson followed soon afterward. "Sure he was a hot dog," Steinbrenner said. "So what? He was a great acquisition."
In the beginning, Steinbrenner played the free-agency game better than anyone. But he lost his touch in the 80's, and the change was reflected in the lack of success on the field. Worse, Steinbrenner spent years trying to undermine one of the last good free agents he signed before the drought, constantly feuding with him and gathering questionable ammunition from any source.
"I don't even want to discuss that," he said when Dave Winfield's name was mentioned.
"All of that never should have happened. Dave Winfield was one of the greatest athletes I've ever known. What part of it is me, I'll take the blame."
Does he mean that, or is that just the prudent position to take now, after the fact? Steinbrenner, in the interview, also praised Gabe Paul, his general manager in the early years and the middleman in his $10 million purchase of the Yankees.
"Gabe Paul was one of the smartest guys I met in baseball," he said. "I learned a lot from him. We had problems, but I had a high regard for him."
Yet when Paul left the Yankees to return to Cleveland and the Indians, after the Yankees won the World Series in 1977, Steinbrenner spoke of him with disdain. "He ran baseball teams for 30 years and what did he ever win before he came here with me?" he remarked huffily at the time.
Billy Martin was the manager who directed Steinbrenner's team back to the top, and the owner has a posthumous place in his heart for the man he fired and hired more than any other.
"Billy was a love," he said. "It was an affection for the man, for each other. He couldn't help himself. I'd tell him, 'You're going to destruct if you don't slow down.' I had great admiration for him.
"He was one of the most genius managers I've ever seen. Sheer genius. He always had the other team wondering what he was going to do."
Just as he had Steinbrenner constantly wondering.
"I remember being in Texas," Steinbrenner related. "The alarm system went off in the hotel, and we're all sitting out on the grass at midnight. I was sitting with Tommy John, and here comes Billy. He's got a towel on the side of his head, there's blood all over the towel and his ear is almost off. I said geez, here we go again."
Martin, who had been bloodied in a bar brawl, didn't always requite Steinbrenner's love, like the time in 1978 when he said of Jackson and the owner: "The two of them deserve each other. One's a born liar, the other's convicted."
Nearly 20 years later, Steinbrenner said, "That wasn't a very tasteful thing to say." But he added candidly, "It was accurate."
Steinbrenner's relationship with another of his 14 different managers did not turn out so well. Because he fired Yogi Berra 16 games into the 1985 season after saying the job would be his all season no matter what happened, Berra said he would never go back to Yankee Stadium as long as Steinbrenner owned the team. He has kept his word.
"I've tried everything I know to get him to come back," Steinbrenner said. "I've tried to apologize to him. I would love to have him come back. Every Old-Timers game I call or write a letter. I think it's important that he comes back. But I can't run a man's life for him."
Berra ironically is a close friend and neighbor of John McMullen, former owner of the Houston Astros and before that a limited partner in the Yankees. McMullen is the man who in 1979 uttered the memorable line about Steinbrenner, "There's nothing more limited than a limited partner in the Yankees."
"Oh yeah, there's a lot of truth to that," Steinbrenner said, again speaking candidly.
"I imagine it would have been limited if you were Jacob Ruppert's partner. I've been a tough managing partner, but I think I've been a good managing partner. My partners have done well. I've done well for them."
 
The Perfect Player? 'Tough Warriors'
 Steinbrenner readily acknowledged that he has been tough on players, too.
"I haven't changed a lot like that," he said. "I'm very demanding. I want the very best from each guy, and if he won't give me his best, then God bless him, I hope he's happy somewhere else."
And then he invoked a term that is new for him but one he is certain to use in the future because he obviously liked the sound of it.
"I want warriors, mentally tough warriors," he said. "I'm looking for the Paul O'Neills of the world, the warriors. I have a passion for winning. I want my players to be warriors and have a passion for winning."
The style he seeks, Steinbrenner said, is right for the city his team plays in. "New Yorkers have to be tough," he said. "When you're taking a cab, you're fighting for that cab. You go to a lunch place, you've got to battle for a table. It goes on every day. There's a mental toughness about New Yorkers."
When he came to the city as principal owner of the Yankees, Steinbrenner said: "I was in awe of New York, the bigness of the city. It was four or five years before I saw and really understood that mental toughness that New Yorkers have. I want my team mentally tough. Maybe I didn't always go about it the right way, but I'm a tough boss."
His ownership, or managerial, style, has always followed the practice of creative tension. His best teams, those in the latter half of the 70's, played in an ocean of turmoil and turbulence. "I used to say a calm sea never took a ship anywhere," Steinbrenner said.
"You need some agitation, some volatility, on teams to win."
In the past 25 years, the Yankees have played in and won as many World Series as anyone. They have also won more games than anyone. Then again, Steinbrenner leads the league in suspensions and fines, too. But he holds no grudges, he said, against the commissioners who kept him out of active operation of the team for a total of 45 months, nearly 4 of the 25 years.
"I have no ill will toward Bowie," he said, speaking of the former commissioner Bowie Kuhn, "nothing against Fay Vincent."
Although he has not lost any of his fight, Steinbrenner said he doesn't think he'll remain in charge of the Yankees for too much longer.
He has been grooming his son, Hal, and his son-in-law, Steve Swindal, to take over eventually.
"I don't know how much longer," he said. "I want to see my horses run. I have no trouble talking to them, telling them I want them to win. I have 10 grandchildren. I want to spend time with them. It's hard to back away all of a sudden. But I think I am to the point where it's not too far off where I see myself in another role. I won't say I'm going to get out and let them take over. No one will believe that. But it won't be in the too distant future."
This, remember, is from the guy who 25 years ago yesterday said he wasn't going to be active in the day-to-day operations.

HEADLINE: BOATING REPORT;
Indoor Boat Show Takes Float Out of the Flotilla

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
It might be an anachronism of sorts to stage a boat show when the snow flies. But the New York National Boat Show, in its 88th edition this year, opened its doors yesterday to a thousand reminders of summer days.
Most of those reminders take the form of powerboats lined up in the cavernous environs of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. A dozen sailboats are in the mix too, as well as hundreds of marine accessories from satellite navigation instruments to foul-weather jackets. Spread them out across four football fields worth of display space, and consumers are confronted with the largest indoor boat show in the Northeast. It was only in the 1980's that the show took up more space, said Michael Duffy, the event manager. 
 "That was in the false prosperity of the 80's," Duffy added. "Now we have the repeal of the luxury tax on boats, consumer confidence is up, and the economy is good."
Still, boat show organizers are faced with a hard sell. While big, expensive yachts are having a manufacturers' heyday, the market is relatively flat for smaller boats of 10-30 feet, according to the National Marine Manufacturers Association. The trade group represents about 1,600 marine companies.
As always, organizers are looking for a way to entice buyers. But this year, the boat show is as diverse as it gets. On hand to speak about his experiences in ocean racing will be Brian Hancock, a world-class ocean racer from Marblehead, Mass.
Hancock has sailed in three former Whitbread Round the World Races, and now he plans a solo voyage in the 1998-99 Around Alone, a single-handed race around the world. Hancock already has a 50-foot sailboat ready to compete, and will be at the boat show with slides and videos of the yacht. "When I was 21, it was a real boost for my early years to do a Whitbread," Hancock said. "Now that I'm nearing 40, doing it alone will be another challenge."
Other highlights at the boat show include a Kids Korner, which has a 30-by-50-foot pond set up for radio-operated model boats. In the middle of the pond is a cardboard replica of New York City.
For fishermen, show organizers are offering two computer-controlled, fighting chair simulators. A hydraulic unit is set up by J & B Tackle of Niantic, Conn. The other, which includes a 7-foot video screen, is on display in part through sponsorship of the International Sport Fishing Association.
Seminars are being offered throughout the show, which ends next Sunday. They include instruction on everything from securing a captain's license to fishing for stripers off Montauk, N.Y. A schedule can be obtained by calling (212) 922-1212.
The boats on display range in size from 10 to 58 feet. The largest boat, the Sea Ray 580, comes equipped with a luxury cockpit that includes a digital stereo with four speakers and remote control, and electric foldaway seating.
Below deck, the interior is outfitted with leather seating and wood trim. The yacht has twin 640-horsepower Caterpillar engines. Its retail price, which varies according to options, starts at $908,900.
On a more modest scale, Boston Whaler is coming out this year with a 26-foot center-console outboard. The boat, the Outrage 26, retails for about $35,000 without power. Twin 200-horsepower outboard engines are recommended for another $25,000. As with other Boston Whaler models, the boat is made with a foam core to keep it from sinking if holed.
Amid a wide array of gear, a new compass for kayaks is on display from Ritchie Navigation. The compass fits on the deck of a kayak with two small nonmagnetic fasteners so as not to penetrate the craft's watertight capability. It also twists on and off for easy removal from its mount. The compass is $69.50.
Adult single-day tickets to the show cost $8; children, ages 6-12, are $3; for those 5 and younger, admission is free. The number for general information is (212) 984-7070.
 
MAKING WAVES
Nine sailboats are expected to leave Sydney today for the fourth stage of the Whitbread Round the World Race. The 1,270-mile voyage to Auckland, New Zealand, is one of the shortest in the nine-leg, 32,000-mile race. Leading over all is EF Language, the Swedish yacht with Paul Cayard of San Francisco as skipper.

HEADLINE: American Weaver Revives Old Laotian Art

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: VIENTIANE, Laos, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Among the more exotic casualties of the Indochina war, the long-nosed lion-elephant, the eternal Naga serpent and the magical Mom bird appeared to be on the verge of extinction in Laos.
These mythical creatures, once common throughout this tiny rural nation, were part of the symbolic vocabulary of traditional Laotian silk weavers, whose work fell victim to the chaos of the war and the social disruptions that followed it. 
 Now an American weaver named Carol Cassidy is working to revive an art that, like that of the dancers of neighboring Cambodia and the temple muralists of Thailand, has embodied the nation's cultural inheritance.
In a refurbished French colonial mansion surrounded incongruously by a white picket fence, she employs 40 weavers, dyers and bobbin winders to produce glowing fabrics adorned with the stars and ships and scrolls of Lao tradition, as well as the dragons, peacocks and butterflies of Buddhist symbolism.
But Ms. Cassidy is not a preservationist; her scarves and slipcovers and wall hangings bear her own contemporary stamp. For her, the ancient symbols are artistic forms rather than bearers of legend.
"I start with traditional patterns and techniques and I modify, interpret, translate, adapt into a product that becomes international," she said. "The elements are traditional but the complete design is my own creation."
A recent example is a wall hanging woven for Denise Tomecko, an American masseuse who lives here, who wanted an ornament that would complement a treasured deep blue Tibetan carpet.
Ms. Cassidy found Laotian symbols that echo the dragons and knots pattern of the carpet and arranged them in a severe symmetry that seems more Tibetan than Laotian.
"She made me something that was very Lao but was reconstructed and modified to blend with a Tibetan prayer rug," Ms. Tomecko said.
Ms. Cassidy's enterprise, Lao Textiles, was founded in 1990 -- the first American company licensed here after the end of the war in 1975, and still one of relatively few Western businesses in this country of 4.6 million people.
Laos was heavily bombed during the war when the United States tried to cut Communist supply lines in neighboring Vietnam. As in Vietnam, the Laotian war ended in victory for the Communists, who continue in power today.
Ms. Cassidy said her experience with Laotian officials had been excellent as they begin to open their country to foreign investment.
"They have honored everything they ever said," she said. "Everything we agreed to in 1990 has been maintained, which is an incredible feat. I believe in the Lao's integrity and their deep commitment to their principles."
Pitched to a small, high-priced and mostly overseas market, her business is thriving at a time when the Laotian textile industry has been badly wounded by recently imposed foreign tariffs.
She markets her products as one-of-a-kind "original art" rather than as mass-produced textiles, placing them beyond the scope of the tariffs levied on assembly-line manufacturers.
"Threads are our palette," Ms. Cassidy said. "We weave art."
Her work sells in American boutiques or is shipped on special order for cushions or upholstery. A scarf might cost from $85 to $125; a brocade wall hanging sells for $1,800.
"In local terms our prices are high, but they aren't high by international standards," she said. "And I pay my workers professional wages."
These wages can reach to nearly three times the average national income of $350 a year. Many of the weavers -- like Simone Bankeo, 28, whose husband is a university professor -- earn more than their husbands.
Ms. Cassidy, 41, is a native of Woodbury, Conn., and studied weaving at the University of Michigan and at the University of Helsinki, in Finland. She spent seven years in Africa, where she taught village women the art of mohair weaving.
She arrived in Laos in 1989 and spent a year training weavers for the United Nations Development Program before starting her business. It did not take long for her art to be recognized: it was displayed for three months in 1995 at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.
There is an air of intense concentration at the 20 looms in her workshop. The hands of the weavers perform a rapid, repetitive ballet as Laotian pop music plays quietly.
The brightly colored patterns emerge slowly. The workshop produces no more than 30 to 50 pieces a month.
On the concrete floor by a water cooler, a woman turns a spinning wheel. In a small room behind her, ropes of silk are dipped in imported chemical dyes mixed by Ms. Cassidy to match the colors of the less hardy local herbal dyes.
"This is my world, my cocoon," Ms. Cassidy said. "It's bamboo, wood, silk. But it ends up -- if you look at Vogue -- in Valentino's Paris apartment."
Along with the techniques of her workshop, Ms. Cassidy said, she also teaches her workers the concept of weaving as art. One of the first English phrases she taught her chief weaver and collaborator, Chansouk Phomalin, was, "I am a designer."
In this achingly poor and isolated country, Ms. Cassidy is fostering not only the revival of an art form but a rare standard of personal achievement.
"I've been rough with the workers," she said. "I've introduced the idea of the critique. They need to understand this, because their work has never been integrated into the monetary economy. Everything matters. Every color matters. Every thread matters."

HEADLINE: Flaws Known Decades Ago at Madison Ave. Tower Where Bricks Fell

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
After a ton of bricks rained onto Madison Avenue from the wall of an office tower last month, it took just a day for engineers to determine that the 39-story facade was missing thousands of masonry anchors that tie it to the building.
While city officials and the tower's new owner were shocked to learn of the shoddy and dangerous workmanship at 540 Madison, another unsettling surprise awaited them: the precise flaw had been revealed in a lawsuit that sat unnoticed for more than 20 years in a public file at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan. 
 In fact, the tower's troubled but largely unexamined 27-year history is rife with red flags that went unnoticed by city building officials, the tower's original investors and its current owner, Harry Macklowe. Warning signs showed up in city inspection reports filed in 1982 and 1987. And cracks in the brickwork appear to have been covered over with cosmetic work, according to city officials and executives involved in stabilizing the building. Yet, none of this came to light earlier this year when Mr. Macklowe's contractors punched 94 windows into the wall, which Gaston Silva, the city's Buildings Commissioner, said probably aggravated problems with the brickwork.
The trouble with the building was reckoned with only when it became unavoidable. The shower of bricks on the afternoon of Dec. 7 has disrupted life ever since along Madison Avenue from 52d to 55th Streets, with vehicle traffic fully restored only last week.
The cause of the collapse is unrelated to the hunk of ornamental masonry that fell from the Belleclaire Hotel on the Upper West Side Dec. 29, or the chunk of concrete that tumbled from a building on 46th Street the next day followed quickly by the partial collapse of a six-story building on West 42d Street, near Eighth Avenue. But all the concrete and masonry suddenly raining down on New York does highlight the weaknesses or loopholes in the city's building inspection process.
Landlords have no obligation to notify the Buildings Department of serious structural problems that might lead to a collapse, Commissioner Silva said. And the facade inspection reports that the city does require landlords to submit every five years often leave many problems undetected.
In the case of 540 Madison, the lack of a rigorous inspection and reporting program had devastating effects -- a major thoroughfare partly closed for weeks, business derailed, lives exposed to risk. The wall is being dismantled and replaced at the cost of several million dollars.
The trail of unheeded problems began with a 1973 lawsuit in which Francis J. Kleban, who built and originally owned the tower, said it was serious flawed. He claimed that the brick mason -- the J. Harry McNally Corporation -- had failed to install the dovetail anchors, brick ties and expansion joints that are intended to bind the brick facade on the south and west walls to the building's frame.
"It provides some background to what's happening today," Commissioner Silva said recently. "It's very troubling that this guy had known about these problems for 20-odd years."
One engineer involved in dismantling the south facade of 540 Madison said that two-thirds of the 14,000 brick ties -- corrugated metal strips -- that should have been laid into the mortar during construction were missing. And, he said, there were no anchors in the dovetail joints that hook the brick facade to the interior concrete walls of the building. Further, he said, only two expansion joints were found to be "operable."
Mr. Macklowe, who bought the building for $35 million from the Kleban estate in September 1996, said he had been unaware of Mr. Kleban's allegations in the 1970's and of a 1991 report on the building's facade.
"If we had been given any information, we would have immediately investigated it with the seller and the proper authorities," Mr. Macklowe said.
But unwinding the history of the tower is difficult. The firm that designed the building is defunct, as is the McNally Corporation, and Diesel Construction, the general contractor, has gone through various corporate permutations. Irwin Miller, a former top executive at Diesel Construction whose name is on the original building permit for 540 Madison, was not the only person to say, "I can't remember back that far."
In 1968, Mr. Kleban, who had already developed office towers and apartment houses on Park Avenue, set out to put up his tallest building, on a Madison Avenue parcel owned by the Government of Finland.
His friends say Mr. Kleban, a descendant of a real estate family that had built apartment houses along the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, took special pride in 540 Madison, designing a luxurious apartment for himself atop the tower. A meticulous person who gained construction experience with the Navy's Civil Engineer Corps during World War II, Mr. Kleban oversaw many details of the project.
"I'm surprised to see what happened because he really knew construction," said Arthur Rosenbloom, vice chairman of Newmark & Company and a longtime friend of Mr. Kleban.
According to court records, Diesel sued Mr. Kleban in 1973, three years after the building opened, alleging that he owed it $66,851.39. Mr. Kleban fired back, stating that Diesel had not properly supervised subcontractors on the job, resulting in "severe leaks" in the glass walls and the "collapse, cracking, spalling and other deterioration" of the bricks walls on the south and west sides of the building shortly after it opened in 1970. He also sued the architect and the engineer.
As the lawsuit dragged on, Diesel sued the subcontractors and extensive repairs were made to the glass walls in the 1970's, though it appears that the brick walls were left largely untouched. It is unclear how the litigation ended because no record of a settlement can be found.
"My best recollection is that the overall litigation was settled," said Douglas R. Hoyt, a lawyer who then represented the bricklayer, J. Harry McNally. Diesel, he said, "would continue to make repairs."
Asked about the litigation, Nathan Goldman, one of Mr. Kleban's partners at 540 Madison, said: "It's news to me." Mr. Goldman, a founding partner at Sonnenblick-Goldman Corporation, a real estate investment bank, said the tower had always been a "well-paying" investment.
Profitable or not, the tower continued to have problems. I. Leonard Messer, a consulting engineer, inspected its facade in 1982 and 1991, in accordance with a city law passed after a student was killed by falling masonry. According to his 1991 report, repairs were made in 1982 that involved "vertical cracks in the brickwork at the southeast and northwest corners at various floors." Vertical cracks and flaking brickwork were found in 1987 by another engineer, his 1991 report said. He found no unsafe conditions in 1991, but did suggest annual inspections by a licensed engineer, a nonbinding recommendation that the owner did not adopt, Commissioner Silva said.
The city requires landlords to file building facade inspection reports every five years, but there is no guarantee those inspections will detect serious problems, since they cover only the front of a building and usually involve only a visual inspection from the street.
About one year after Mr. Kleban died in 1995, Mr. Macklowe bought the tower. He quickly raised rents, renovated the lobby, enlarged the retail space and cut windows into the south wall.
The tower was a step in a comeback attempt for Mr. Macklowe, who had developed more than $1 billion worth of properties in the 1980's but lost several of them in the recession that followed. Mr. Macklowe revived his real estate career last year and was moving on to his next deal -- a tower on Madison between 41st and 42d Streets -- when things went awry at 540 Madison.
According to a top executive at the Macklowe organization, it was around Halloween when the company first noticed a serious problem: bulging brickwork near the new windows on the 34th floor, the same section that gave way on Dec. 7.
The discovery was a surprise, said another Macklowe executive who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding that the company had found no problems with the brick walls during a physical inspection at the time of the purchase, nor did the title company come across the Kleban lawsuit.
But Mr. Messer, the engineer, said that workers and engineers who installed the windows in the south wall should have noticed the cracks and the lack of brick ties securing the facade to the interior wall. "Punching those windows out really caused the thing to let go," he said.
Jacob Grossman, a partner at Rosenwasser/Grossman Consulting Engineers, said the contractor called him on Nov. 7, asking him to come to the building " 'because there are some problems in the wall.' "
"Our inspector immediately identified the problem: the wall was bulging out," Mr. Grossman said. "He told them to raise the safety net. We also told them masonry walls are not our expertise."
The next day workers hoisted safety nets along the south wall. On Nov. 12, Mr. Macklowe's company notified the owners of the low-slung buildings to the south of the tower that it had "discovered some shifting of the brick on the south side of the building" and wanted to install protective measures during repairs. Mr. Macklowe is still being fined $150 a month, as he has been since February for failing to file the required facade inspection report.
Two weeks later on Nov. 25, the contractor obtained a permit for a sidewalk shed along Madison Avenue.
But once again, the Buildings Department remained in the dark until the bulging bricks gave way on Dec. 7.
"If the engineer and the owner were aware of the seriousness of the bulge they should have notified us," Commissioner Silva said, though he added that they were not legally required to do so. "They did the right thing in setting up the nets and the shed, but it would have been better if we had known."

HEADLINE: Amid Anxiety, Glimpses of Hope;
Southside Adapts to a New, Uncertain World of Welfare

SERIES: WELFARE NEIGHBORHOOD: One year later.

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Of all the dire predictions about the dismantling of the nation's welfare system a year ago, perhaps the most disturbing was that more children would suffer from neglect, hunger and abuse in the chaos of households cut off from benefits. Child welfare experts feared the worst. New York City officials foresaw many more children entering foster care.
For a year, Marcia Harris has been as qualified as anyone to determine whether these predictions were coming true. Ms. Harris, a caseworker at St. Joseph's Services for Children and Families in Brooklyn's Southside neighborhood, works with families on public assistance who have been ordered to seek counseling and other aid because their children were deemed to be at risk of abuse or neglect. 
 Clearly, an immediate disaster has not occurred. Ms. Harris has not recommended that a single Southside child go into foster care because women unable to cope with new welfare requirements or cutbacks had put their children in danger. And she has seen striking instances in which mothers have risen to the challenges. One obtained a license to drive a school bus and is considering three job offers. Another began using birth control for the first time, realizing that there would be no additional welfare money for another child and that she had to find work. "Across my overall caseload, I have perceived a high level of motivation among these mothers," said Ms. Harris, who works with 13 of the 113 Southside families involved with St. Joseph's. "There has even been some real bonding among them. They share information, tips about day care and the like. We have not yet seen cases where people truly snapped."
That said, things have not been easy at St. Joseph's, a social services and foster care agency that has worked with Southside families for 20 years. Caseworkers say there is an overwhelming sense that the hardest consequences lie ahead. Lifetime limits on welfare will not take effect for years.
The office's yearly allowance for emergency shelter funds ran out in August, and its food pantry was wiped bare months ago. Ms. Harris and other caseworkers say the demands of the welfare changes have produced a powerful anxiety and depression among some clients. The office has sent many more parents for mental health care in the last year, and the number of people seeking help was up 15 percent.
"People have managed, people have hustled," said Barbara Wald, the director of preventive services. "But it's way too early to tell responsibly what it will in the end mean for these parents and children. I absolutely remain nervous."
The experiences and emotions inside the St. Joseph's office in the heart of Southside -- surprise and relief balanced by a haunting uneasiness -- reflect the neighborhood's 12-month engagement with the Federal, state and city changes in welfare policy and enforcement.
The legislation, and the state and city efforts at carrying it out, have inarguably affected the routines and decisions, the character and conversation, of a neighborhood where roughly half the residents received public assistance of some kind. The neighborhood has not been decimated. But many residents note that it was a poor neighborhood to begin with, and thus incrementally grimmer circumstances are often hidden.
Lorraine Morgan and Sandra Velasquez, with 25 years on welfare between them, are off the rolls and working. Solangel LaFontaine refused the welfare work requirement and moved with her son to Florida. Esmeralda Santos, who was ordered into workfare last year, remains stuck there, her seventh-grade education garnering her no job opportunities. Ana Melo, a 55-year-old woman with serious medical problems, was given a workfare job cleaning the Staten Island Ferry terminals, but has at last moved from welfare to Federal disability benefits. A recovering drug addict who refused to give his name admits he abused welfare for years to feed his habit, but is now working as a graphics printer.
William Rodriguez, who dared to open a supermarket on Havemeyer Street last May despite declining food stamp revenues and other potential disruptions to the neighborhood's revenue flow, has seen profits from his $1 million gamble slowly grow, reaffirming his belief that, one way or another, "people are going to buy food." Christina Seabrook, a supervisor at Southside's welfare office, took a new job when the city closed the office last June, citing declining welfare rolls. She now works for the Department of AIDS Services.
The old Southside welfare office, where recipients had shared the troubled particulars of their lives for 30 years, is now an office for detecting welfare fraud.
"I think it's true that for many people in this neighborhood the old attitudes no longer exist -- the idea that to go on welfare and get along is a realistic possibility," said Msgr. Bryan Karvelis, pastor of Transfiguration Roman Catholic Church in Southside. "And it's true that we have not seen people cast into the streets in great numbers. That's not to say there isn't a crisis. It's just that poor people, by definition, have always lived in crisis. They go from crisis to crisis, surviving as best they can along the way. We have survived. So far."
In straight numerical terms, the drop in Southside's welfare population over the last year has been striking. The greatest reduction has come among the single adults without children who were receiving benefits under a state welfare program known as Home Relief -- a reduction of nearly 50 percent, to 630 from 1,182. The decline in the number of people receiving Federal welfare benefits for single women with children has been less pronounced: 5,654 mothers now on the rolls, from 6,288.
The number of people receiving Federal disability benefits -- Supplemental Security Income -- has barely changed, partly because of the Federal Government's decision not to strip it from legal immigrants. The statistics also show that more people are using what assistance remains. There are 4,163 people in Southside who are not on welfare but are poor enough to receive Medicaid, up 450 from a year ago.
There are several explanations for the stark reductions and the more modest observable damage. Many people have found jobs, or are merely relying on jobs they already had. Those on Home Relief, too, have always been a very fluid population, moving on and off the rolls quickly. Thus as stricter standards for qualifying take hold, an inevitable shrinkage has occurred. Social workers who deal with the neighborhood's Hasidic families -- many of which qualify for a form of Home Relief because they have only one working parent -- say the wives have declined work assignments.
For the single mothers on welfare, New York State has been relatively lenient. If a mother refuses a work assignment, she loses cash benefits, but her children do not. And so for Lydia Rodriguez, a Southside mother of two, her economics have changed, but not disastrously. Ms. Rodriguez survives on $140 a month in cash and $208 a month in food stamps. She used to get $245 in cash and $280 in food stamps. Family members have helped, and Ms. Rodriguez only shrugs when asked how much harder life is.
New hardships have not produced any great upsurge in crime. Burglary was up 7.5 percent in 1997 in the 90th Precinct, which includes Southside, but robbery was down 8.5 percent, assault 6.8 percent, and grand larceny 11.4 percent. Incidents of domestic violence, frequently provoked by financial strains, have not increased.
Meanwhile, the successes in Southside, numerous if tentative, are more easily identifiable. At the Williamsburg Y Day Care Center, Ruth Neale, the director, has had 19 women come to work as aides as part of their workfare requirement. Ten of them left welfare and found jobs -- three at restaurants, another as a secretary, another in a factory.
"The work has been something totally new to these women, and the process has been slow, but many have done it," Ms. Neale said. "Of course, there are setbacks. One mother was off the rolls, had two jobs, but now is pregnant again. She is back to square one."
Sandra Velasquez, 34, doubted she would ever get off square one a year ago. She had grown up on welfare. She had two boys, 14 and 9. Basic literacy classes were hard. She had been shot in the stomach several years before and had lingering medical complications.
A year later, after a six-month stint in workfare, she works as a sales clerk at a store in Manhattan. She makes $170 a week after taxes, more than double the $147 she got every two weeks during her 10 years on welfare. She still gets $80 a month in food stamps. The older boy cares for the younger after school.
"Put it this way, I feel like I got lucky," Ms. Velasquez said. "I can't be there as much with my kids. But now when they ask me for money, I actually have some."
Ms. Velasquez's tale, echoing the surprising resourcefulness of their clients, sounds familiar to the staff at St. Joseph's. "They have smarts and a strength beyond what we give them credit for," Ms. Harris said.
Only eight Southside children have been placed in foster care this year, exactly the same total as a year ago. Evening classes in child rearing have been set up for clients who now also have to meet their workfare requirements.
Still, there is plenty of worry to go with the slices of mild wonder.
The veteran social workers insist that their worry is rooted in responsible thinking, not ideology. Financing for the work they do has been cut back. Many of the agency's foster parents are on welfare themselves, and thus face uncertain futures. And there are all the clients whose problems seem intractable.
"What I carry with me is the fear that because there hasn't been an early apocalypse, people and politicians and others will take that as proof that many of these poor families didn't need help," said Cecilia Rivera Healy, executive director of St. Joseph's. "They did. And they do. And they will."
Whether the new era of welfare will begin a new era in Southside is as much an open question now as a year ago. Whatever its strengths and resiliency, Southside has not suddenly become a place of bustling work and industry.
Rents are rising. Young people from Manhattan continue to pour in, displacing more poor families. Disputes about access to affordable housing have only worsened among Latinos and Hasidim. The notion that the debate about welfare might promote greater political involvement among the poor was naive. Only 28 percent of the neighborhood's registered voters voted in the mayoral election last fall.
"Southside exists as a world of lowered expectations, and the welfare changes have only lowered them further," said Angelo Falcon, the executive director of the Institute for Puerto Rican Studies, who was raised in Southside and who lives there still. "It is a neighborhood that exists as a small poor place in a very rich city. Evidently, the crumbs of that rich city are enough to keep a neighborhood like Southside alive."
 
Welfare Neighborhood
The nation's welfare system is being reshaped by an array of new Federal, state and local laws and regulations. This is the 14th and final article in a series that has examined how the changes have come together in one Brooklyn neighborhood, Southside in Williamsburg. Other articles have examined disabled children, drug addiction, welfare fraud, the closing of a welfare office, the effect on local merchants, and teen-age mothers returning to school.

WHAT HAS CHANGED
 
Number of single adults without children on welfare is cut nearly in half, to 630 from 1,182.
 
Number of single mothers on welfare rolls drop to 5,654 from 6,288.
 
About 185 children lose Federal welfare for the disabled because they are no longer considered disabled enough.
 
The city's workfare program expands to include more single mothers, who now make up roughly half of the 35,000 to 38,000 participants.
 
WHAT HASN'T
 
Federal benefits are not cut for elderly or disabled immigrants already on welfare in August 1996.
 
New York does not take away welfare benefits from legal immigrants already living in the state in August 1996.
 
The state decides not to deny food stamps to recipients aged 18.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Immigrant's Medical Career Is Now Just a Memory

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
George Petrenko comes from a long line of doctors. His grandfather was a surgeon, his grandmother was a psychiatrist and his mother was a dermatologist. Most of his relatives in Ukraine are physicians, as well.
"Being doctors, you could say, is in our blood," said Mr. Petrenko, 36, a trained physical therapist who shares a Rego Park, Queens, apartment with two other generations of his family. 
 But since they emigrated from the former Soviet Union in 1990, none have been practicing medicine, their credentials deemed worthless in their adopted country. Mr. Petrenko earns minimum wage as a part-time home health-care attendant and his mother works in a beauty salon.
"We wanted freedom, so we made sacrifices," said his mother, Eteri Barbakadze, 62, whose family endured years of state-sanctioned anti-Semitism. "For this, I have no regrets."
Her son, however, does not swallow his pride so easily. "In Russia, I had status, I had respect," he said, sucking hard on a Marlboro. "Here, I am nothing."
In many ways, the Petrenko family's story is a familiar one. They spent years as refuseniks -- Jews punished by the Government for requesting permission to emigrate. They lost their jobs, and Mr. Petrenko's father, Igor, 60, a renowned Soviet gymnast, was thrown off the nation's Olympic team. They moved from Ukraine to the republic of Georgia, thinking that exit visas could be obtained more easily there. But this self-imposed exile lasted a decade, while the family suffered frequent harassment by Georgians who resented Russian-speakers.
Like many immigrants, they arrived in New York with nothing and started over from scratch. George drove a limousine, his father found work as a handyman and his mother was hired as a cosmetologist by a salon on West 57th Street. Within eight months, the entire family was speaking passable English.
"In the beginning, we did quite well," said Mrs. Barbakadze, a whirlwind of a woman, as she plied a visitor with warm borscht. The family vacationed in Florida, bought a large-screen television set and sent their youngest son, Boris, to New York University. "Of course he was premed," Mrs. Barbakadze said.
But the family's flush of good fortune has since faded. George Petrenko's wife, Galina, died of breast cancer last January; then he suffered a heart attack. He and his two sons, Igor, 18, and Daniel, 8, moved into his parents' two-bedroom apartment.
Mr. Petrenko remains hobbled by his heart condition and weighed down by depression. Daniel is so traumatized by his mother's death that he cries every time her name comes up in conversation.
"If he hears the word 'dead' or if someone dies on television, he runs into the other room," Mrs. Barbakadze said as she fought back tears.
Because Mrs. Barbakadze and her husband have three extra mouths to feed, money has become extremely tight. George's heart surgery has left him with more than $10,000 in medical bills. Neither he nor his children have health insurance. "I am not used to such a life," he said. To help his family, Boris postponed medical school and took a job as an office manager.
Fira Furman, a social worker at the Rego Park Counseling Center, has tried unsuccessfully to persuade Mr. Petrenko to apply for public assistance. "He says he did not come here to be on welfare, to give up," she said.
The family, however, has reluctantly accepted help from the center, which serves the area's large Russian population. Mrs. Furman makes sure they have enough food and clothing, and she is trying to arrange therapy for Daniel. "Everything we have, it is because of them," Mrs. Barbakadze said, gesturing to living room furniture donated by the center, an affiliate of the UJA-Federation of New York and a beneficiary of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
On New Year's Eve, the family gathered around the television set while Mrs. Barbakadze showed off her husband's gymnastics medals. Although he would prefer to work as a coach, Igor Petrenko says he is grateful to have steady work as a handyman. His wife, too, is content just to have a job, especially as economic conditions in Russia have gone from bad to worse. Mrs. Barbakadze's elderly mother, who stayed behind, has no heat in her apartment, and many other relatives are struggling to feed themselves. "We would like to bring my mother here, but we cannot afford to," she explained."
Although Mrs. Barbakadze remains optimistic, her son finds hope more elusive. "The only thing worse that could happen to me is -- " he stopped in mid-sentence as Daniel came into the room carrying Bim, the family's cocker spaniel.
George Petrenko tried to maintain his smile as Daniel, his eyes heavy with loss, clung to his leg. He also fears for young Igor, who has been doing poorly in school.
Later, as he took Bim for a walk, George offered his own analysis of why Igor was not living up to his potential. "How would you do," he asked, "if you had a nothing for a father?"

HEADLINE: Greenspan Weighs Prospect of Deflation

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Falling prices may not be such a good thing after all, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today, making clear that the central bank would seek to avoid deflation just as it seeks to avoid inflation.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks, delivered in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association and American Finance Association, were his most extensive yet on the topic of deflation. 
 A text of his speech was released here.
Mr. Greenspan did not say directly whether he thought deflation was very likely. But, as inflation has diminished to levels unseen since the mid-1960's, private economists have begun to speculate about prospects for a period of general price declines.
Prices paid to producers like factories and food processing plants declined at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the first 11 months of 1997. Consumer price inflation, including services, rose at a scant 1.8 percent rate in the same period.
Most analysts expect inflation to hold at that level or even increase slightly this year. But a few warn of deflation, especially if a flood of cheap imports from economically ailing Asian nations forces domestic manufacturers to cut their prices to stay competitive.
Consumer prices have edged lower only twice since World War II -- in 1949 and 1955 -- and they have not fallen consistently since the 1930's.
Mr. Greenspan said that deflation was not destructive if it took place at a time of a rapid growth in productivity.
The Fed's goal has been price stability -- overall price changes so small they do not affect the decisions of businesses and consumers.
"Even a moderate rate of inflation can hamper economic performance," Mr. Greenspan said. "Moderate rates of deflation would most probably lead to similar problems."
And, Mr. Greenspan said, deflation poses several problems that inflation does not. Because interest rates cannot fall below zero, deflation raises the possibility of high real -- that is, price-adjusted -- interest rates. Also, because employees would resist wage cuts, deflation would produce an upward bias in real wages. That probably would mean fewer jobs and higher unemployment than would otherwise be the case.

A Bullish Public

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
You wouldn't know it from the recent so-so holiday shopping season, but American consumers told pollsters last week that they haven't been this confident about their economic future since mid-1969. The unemployment rate is down to 4.6 percent, incomes are edging up and the stock market finished a third straight year in which returns at least doubled historic norms. ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

ROSY OUTLOOK
What? Us Worry?
Unruffled by Asia's crisis and buoyed by the promising job market, American consumers approached 1998 with more confidence about their economic future than they have expressed in almost three decades, according to the December survey by the Conference Board. Some 40.6 percent of the respondents to the monthly survey called jobs "plentiful," up from 36.4 percent in November. The optimism was viewed as a strong signal that the economy would remain vibrant, partly because consumer spending accounts for a large portion of domestic growth. The Conference Board's overall confidence index jumped to 134.5 in December, from 128.1 a month before. As if to accent the positive feeling, the Conference Board's leading index of economic indicators rose one-tenth of 1 percent in November. 

SOUTH KOREA
A Multiparty Bailout
The South Korean Government cleared a crucial hurdle in its effort to stabilize its battered economy, paying off or extending a large portion of its monthly debt to foreign banks. Two days before the due date, some of the world's largest commercial and investment banks -- in tandem with the regulators who oversee them -- had gotten together to push a plan to extend payment deadlines for up to $15 billion in troubled loans to strengthen South Korea's precarious financial position. But as the week wore on, it became clear that the plan was not a done deal. Many smaller banks with less money at stake felt that they had little to gain -- and maybe more to lose -- by rolling over the loans. Even among large banks, the plan was seen as an act of preserving the bottom line: "The only reason the banks are rolling over the short-term debt is because they know if they call it, the loans will default," said David Durrant, an analyst with I.D.E.A., a financial advisory firm in New York.
 
PHONE REGULATION
Happy New Year, Baby Bells
A Federal judge struck down major sections of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, saying the law unfairly kept the regional Bell telephone companies out of the long-distance market. Should the ruling survive the appeals process, it would allow the Bells to offer long-distance service for the first time since AT&T was broken up in 1984. Not surprisingly, AT&T was not amused, calling the ruling "inexplicable and clearly erroneous."
 
TECHNOLOGY
A Disk for the Verbose
I.B.M. says it has broken the magnetic disk-drive storage barrier of 10 billion bits of data per square inch. The company said the new technology would first appear in products in 2001. A 2.5-inch disk drive will be able to hold 6.5 gigabytes of data, making possible ultraslim laptop computers that will nevertheless have vast storage capacity. A 3.5-inch platter will hold 12 to 13 gigabytes. A gigabyte is a billion bytes, equivalent to about 62,500 double-spaced, typewritten pages.
 
BROWSER WARS
Click if You Dislike Microsoft
The Justice Department accused Microsoft last week of "disobedience" and of "jerry-rigging its own products" in response to a Federal judge's order to allow the makers of personal computers to license Microsoft's Windows operating system without being forced to also load its Internet browsing software. The comments were made in a filing in United States District Court in Washington, as the antitrust battle between the Justice Department and the Microsoft Corporation continued to escalate. In the filing, the Government also proposed what many computer users see as a quick solution for unbundling Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer, from Windows -- simply use a Windows 95 feature for adding and removing programs, which is labeled "Add/Remove Programs." The Government noted that on Nov. 18, on a page of Microsoft's Web site, the company itself said that removing Internet Explorer, or I.E., was not a daunting technical challenge that would cripple recent versions of Windows -- as the company told the court earlier this month.
 
CLIMATE CHANGE
Nuclear-Power Economics
The nuclear industry's main lobbying organization, the Nuclear Energy Institute, has been arguing for months that global warming is a reason to build more reactors. But neither these arguments nor the Kyoto accords on global climate are likely to revive nuclear power. For better or worse, when a power plant is needed these days, the decision on what kind to build is generally made according to the availability and cost of fuel, not the potential output of carbon dioxide. And many experts argue that the cheapest way to make electricity now is to burn natural gas in combustion turbines, which are essentially giant jet engines bolted to the ground. In such "combined cycle" plants, 50 percent of the energy in the natural gas is turned into electricity, compared with about 30 percent in older plants running on fossil fuels.
 
JOBS
Littler Town of Bethlehem
The Bethlehem Steel Corporation is shutting the last factory in its hometown, cutting the last 800 jobs in its coke division by the end of March. The last steelmaking furnace in Bethlehem closed two years ago. . . . Nationsbank expects to cut more than 6,000 jobs in Florida once it takes over Barnett Banks. . . . But even those numbers seem small potatoes compared with the situation in France, where the latest figures show that 12.4 percent of the labor force is out of work (compared with 4.6 percent in the United States in November). . . . The Toyota Motor Corporation is thinking about making luxury sport vehicles in the United States as early as 2000. A second assembly line might be built at a plant already under construction in Princeton, Ind. Toyota also announced that it would build a new plant in France.
 
NEW VENTURES
Let's Talk Stopping Power
Smith & Wesson, famous for its handguns, is turning to a new tool for law enforcement: bicycles. The company, the nation's largest handgun maker, has wheeled out a line of police bicycles complete with lights and sirens, The Associated Press reported. David Sargeant, business manager for Smith & Wesson, estimated that more than 20,000 police officers across the country now patrol on bicycles, and their numbers are expected to increase sharply. Several bicycle companies, including Raleigh, Trek and BMW, already make special police models of their mountain bikes. But Smith & Wesson sees its entry into the field as an expansion of a line of law enforcement equipment that includes everything from handcuffs to identification kits. The company's 24-speed mountain bikes range from $750 to $1,200.

HEADLINE: Masters Give Dogs a Bad Name

BYLINE: By DAVID HOWARD 

 BODY:
DEBBIE WILCOX, Naugatuck's dog warden, sees the way some people treat dogs, and it disturbs her as much as when dogs bite people. Rather than pay $70 or $80 to euthanize an animal, some owners dispose of them like old, ruined furniture, she said. In one incident, Ms. Wilcox recalled, "I saw the car pull up, and they threw the dog out of the back onto the street, shut the door and took off. When they do that, we get them."
City pounds are getting dogs in growing numbers -- and it isn't just the burgeoning stray population that is alarming state and municipal officials. 
 The breeding, selling and fighting of pit bulls and other dogs has grown into a cottage industry in the state's big cities.
Some dogs are beaten, locked in basements or abandoned if they don't perform up to expectations, animal control officials said. Pit bull owners hang weights around the dogs' necks to try to make them stronger or they are said to stir gunpowder into the dogs' food, believing it will make the animals more aggressive. As a result, a growing number of abandoned dogs -- many of them abused and aggressive -- are loose on the streets.
The illegal dog-fighting culture has created some unusual problems. In October, a wandering Rottweiler knocked over and bit an 8-year-old Waterbury boy. The child required 210 stitches on his face and neck. Two months earlier in Waterbury, a man saved a 10-year-old from a pit bull that broke loose from its chain and mauled the boy's chest and arm.
Numerous other incidents have been reported in New Haven, Hartford and Bridgeport. Whole neighborhoods in New Haven feel under siege by owners of dangerous dogs, a task force on attacks in that city reported. In Hartford, officials have said they have never seen so many strays.
The issue runs deeper than a shortage of sturdy leashes. While certain breeds seem more predisposed toward violent outbursts, officials are blaming their handlers for inducing or encouraging viciousness. "It's certainly a big problem," said Julie Lewin, a spokeswoman for the Fund for Animals. "There appears to be a growing number of people acquiring dogs for the wrong reasons."
"I think bad animal behavior is a direct result of bad human behavior," said Lisa Mason, a Waterbury alderwoman who organized a committee to address the issue there. "I think the problem stems from ignorance and cruelty."
Money, gambling and image are at stake. Pit bulls and Rottweilers are regarded as badges of machismo as well as a source of income, primarily for unemployed or underemployed young men. Puppies can sell for several hundred dollars each -- and the purse for winning a dog fight can run as high as $500. Many of the dogs are not vaccinated or registered. The New Haven task force found that only 10 pit bulls were licensed in New Haven in 1996, even though officials estimate there are thousands in the city.
But the problem isn't limited to people who participate in dog fights. Fearful owners have turned animals loose during waves of attack-related publicity. "Now people are scared of every pit bull and every Rottweiler, and not every one of them is mean and nasty," Ms. Wilcox said.
Officials are trying to deal with the problem from a variety of angles. Ms. Mason said she is in favor of "seriously punitive action" for people whose animals hurt other people. But Marsha Rabe, a member of the New Haven Humane Commission, said new laws aren't necessary; it's a matter of enforcing the existing ones. In 1996 the state legislature upped the criminal classification for dog fighting and other willful forms of animal cruelty from a misdemeanor to a felony.
Some cities are now willing to throw money at the problem. New Haven set aside money to hire an assistant dog warden and a kennel worker, two of the five new positions recommended by the city's task force, said Alderwoman Robin I. Kroogman, who led the effort. Virtually no one opposed the expenditures, even when money was painfully tight. "Bad times make for strange bedfellows," Ms. Kroogman said.
Still, Ms. Lewin said, animal control operations in most Connecticut cities are "tragically underfunded." "It's clear," she said, "that dogs can be, for all practical purposes, invisible to authorities."
Officials agree that the key may be better communication with the public about what's going on. New Haven is installing a dog-related curriculum in its schools in 1998-99, and Waterbury is considering a similar course of action, Ms. Mason said. She envisions a canine version of the fire-fighting Smokey Bear campaign that would teach children how to treat an animal properly and what to do if they are attacked.
Ms. Rabe is also hoping New Haven will set up dog-training programs in various neighborhoods. "A lot of people are learning by bad examples," she said. "We need to teach young kids that there is a way to have a dog come to you without having to beat him or feed him gunpowder. It's really sad. Kids have been exposed in inner-city neighborhoods to a lot of dogs that have been put through hell and come out nuts. You walk down the streets of New Haven with a dog, and the kids cringe. They ask you, 'Does that dog bite?' "
Ms. Wilcox said people call her to complain when they see a dog that appears to be dangerous -- even when it's walking around on a leash. When Ms. Wilcox tells them there's nothing she can do, they respond angrily. "They say, 'Oh, so you're going to wait until it tears my kid up and then do something?' They just don't want them in their neighborhoods."
The result is that many dogs -- especially those with reputations for savagery -- languish in already crowded municipal pounds, then are euthanized. Putting the animals up for adoption is a tricky proposition, Ms. Wilcox said. Most families won't consider a pit bull, and often the only inquiries come from people she suspects will use them for fights or enlist them as guard dogs for drug dealers. She said she would not allow such people to adopt dogs.
State law allows pound operators to euthanize an unclaimed stray animal after seven days, but some dog wardens keep them around longer, hoping they'll be adopted. Many are never claimed, and many more remain loose. Ms. Mason said she has heard of packs of stray dogs roaming in Waterbury. Animal advocates see that as further proof that cities and towns also need to be more aggressive with spaying and neutering programs.
"It is a huge problem," Ms. Rabe said. "It's a symptom of the whole urban weave of things, and you have to go at it a number of ways or you're just Band-Aiding the whole thing."

Since 70's, the World Has Become Safer for Consumerism

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
The 1997 movie "The Ice Storm" gave Americans a bleak view backward to the early 70's and, as a vivid aside, reminded them how far many consumer products have come since then.
Feuding patterns in shirts and ties were the least of it. Irons back then were known to lose control of their heating mechanisms, leading to melted messes in at least one safety test. People mowing the lawn had to deal with the worry that the mower blades would keep whirring even if they let go of the machine, cutting up whatever azalea, pet or small child got in the way. Childproof containers for over-the-counter drugs were a thing of the future. 
 Stereo equipment ranged all over the map in terms of sound quality. Automatic-changer compact-disk players didn't exist; there was, however, that short-lived medium called the eight-track tape. Disposable diapers were expensive and soon to be labeled socially irresponsible. Cars had so many flaws that consumers actually expected problems.
But then came consumer advocates and the Government, calling for better standards that, in many cases, have arrived. In addition, as shoppers flocked to products made abroad, United States captains of industry were forced to pay attention and compete. Terms like "planned obsolescence" became politically incorrect. Now, if you are going to make a household appliance (hold the harvest-gold color scheme), the quality has to be better.
Take the refrigerator. "Refrigerators have gotten a little smaller on the outside but still give you the same dimensions inside," said R. David Pittle, technical director for Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, in Yonkers. "Their compressors are quieter and cost less to run, thanks in large part to the Government's requirements on energy-efficiency labeling."
Color television is also on a higher plane, even before the arrival of digital TV, thanks mostly to competition among manufacturers, many of them from overseas. And hair dryers, once known to cause many electric-shock deaths, have become far safer. Those made in the last few years must have mechanisms that shut the dryers off if they fall into, say, a bathtub. "Now, when they are dropped in water, they shut off and nobody is killed," Dr. Pittle said. And lawn mowers are required to have devices that automatically shut them off if the operator lets go.
Of course, concerns remain about other products, on quality or safety issues. "In summer 1995, we tested a group of child-safety seats and 3 out of 25 were unacceptably dangerous because they came apart on impact," Dr. Pittle said. Two of the three companies recalled their child seats; the third did not, because the Government did not force it to, he added. "Part of their argument was that they didn't have any complaints," he said.
Overall car quality has gone up sharply over the last decade, mainly in response to competition from Japanese imports. "There were days when, after you bought a new car, you'd keep a pad of paper on the front seat to jot down every problem you had," said Robert Schnorbus, director of automotive analysis for J. D. Power & Associates. "You almost expected to have to take the vehicle back." Now, he estimates, there are half the complaints there were 10 years ago.
The same trend is apparent in cars more than 5 years old, Mr. Schnorbus said, heightening the demand for used cars. People are still replacing their old cars, but not always with new models fresh from the factory. "This is part of the reason we have seen new-vehicle sales flatten out," he said. "Because fewer new cars are needed to replace scrapped vehicles, used vehicles are getting a greater share of total sales."
Not that all is rosy on the automotive front. Safety experts are particularly troubled by the popularity of sport utility vehicles, which, because they are heavier and have higher bumpers, can do a lot of damage when they collide with standard cars. Dr. Pittle is also concerned about the higher center of gravity on such vehicles, which makes it easier for them to roll.
"The S.U.V.'s have replaced the station wagon as the family car," he said, "and they should perform as safely as any other product used as a family car."
Most evolutions in car design -- like air bags, anti-lock brakes and daytime running lights -- are intended to keep people safer. While air bags have come under attack for causing deaths of small children in the front passenger seat, the lives they save far outnumber those deaths. But innovations in brakes and lights have yet to become standard equipment on all vehicles.
Some things, of course, are every bit as vulnerable as they ever were. Paper bags still break. Eggshells crack. Light bulbs have to be replaced. And, as was true in the era "The Ice Storm" depicted, marital bliss still doesn't come in a can.

Ready or Not, Europe Draws Closer to One Currency

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
When European Union leaders meet on the first weekend in May to decide which of their countries qualify to start phasing in a common currency in 1999, they will be making a monumental political decision as well as a monetary one.
Politically, creating a common currency could have far-reaching consequences, either putting Europe on the road to becoming a superstate on a par with the United States or blocking closer unity by widening existing European national divisions. 
 Until now, all European politics has been national, even the elections every five years to the European Parliament, whose members are virtually all political obscurities. The decisions that really count, about foreign and security policy, taxation and government spending, have always been made in London, Paris, Bonn and other national capitals, not in the European Union headquarters at Brussels.
Next Jan. 1, however, the countries that qualify to start using the new currency, the euro, will surrender to an independent European Central Bank based in Frankfurt a basic power of national sovereignty -- to issue and regulate legal tender.
The new euros will not actually start jingling in people's pockets until three years later. But just as the creation of the Bank of the United States in 1791 reinforced the power of the Federal Government and led to long, bitter political battles over states' rights, the impending arrival of the euro has been seen, particularly by its opponents, as a key step down the road to a centralized European state.
Among the countries expected to adopt the euro initially, none has been more shaken politically by the idea of giving up its national currency than Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has been among the firmest supporters of the euro, nevertheless likes to point out that the Deutsche mark, which was introduced in the western part of the country before the Federal Republic was established or had a flag in 1949, became a symbol of German recovery and self-respect after World War II.
Mr. Kohl is counting on the euro to keep Germans firmly tied to the European Union after German unification. But polls show that many of them are skeptical about the new currency, and Mr. Kohl faces an uphill battle to win a fifth election as Chancellor next September. The Social Democratic opposition has not made the euro much of an issue so far, perhaps because no matter who wins the German elections next fall, the new currency will already be cast in stone by then.
German insistence on a strong euro has often been expressed as skepticism about the wisdom of including in the currency union the "Club Med" countries of southern Europe -- Spain and Italy are the largest -- that have historically been less worried about inflation.
Those countries, except Greece, are now generally expected to join the currency union with the first round of members in 1999. German opposition to their joining softened last year as Germany's own economy weakened, and Italy, for instance, is doing a better job of controlling budget deficits these days than Germany is.
Still, even with Italy and Spain, at most 11 of the 15 current European Union member states will be qualified or willing to join in the first round. Not only Britain, which has long resisted monetary union, but also Sweden and Denmark do not want the euro just yet, and Greece cannot meet the limits on inflation and Federal budget deficits set by the treaty that established the euro.
While France has embraced the single currency as a way of tying Germany firmly to Europe, there has been political fallout over the strict fiscal policies that France has had to adopt to bring it into line with the requirements for the common currency. The belt-tightening has exacerbated France's high unemployment. Lionel Jospin, the Prime Minister, has persuaded fellow European Union leaders to hold regular political consultations among the countries that adopt the euro to make sure that the independent central bank thinks about fostering economic growth and jobs as well as keeping inflation under control.
France and Germany have not yet agreed on who the president of the new European central bank should be. Germany supports Willem Duisenberg of the Netherlands, and France has proposed Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of its Banque de France. The choice will be made in May, and there is speculation that France would support Mr. Duisenberg if Germans and others agreed to let Mr. Trichet take over after four years.
Europeans coordinate a lot of things already, including foreign aid and trade, environmental regulations and agricultural policy. But once the common currency goes into effect, the individual countries in it will have no choice, no more ability to play with exchange rates or expand the money supply to stimulate job growth than individual American states do now, under the Federal Reserve System.
Thrown together in the economic sphere, Europeans may eventually get serious about making foreign policy together and build a military-industrial complex to rival that of the United States and weaken NATO, argue critics like Martin Feldstein, the Harvard economics professor.
But the euro could also prove to be a divisive force inside Europe. If Germany's economy booms while France's busts, one monetary policy cannot make people in both countries happy. And there will continue to be tensions between "ins" and "outs" as long as the common European currency falls short of being the single European currency.
Ten formerly Communist countries in central Europe, plus Cyprus, are all hoping to join the European Union after the new currency is in place, and negotiations will begin with six of them in March. Not all may qualify to have the euro even after they get in, officials say.
So, whether the new currency will lead to a European federal state or accentuate European national differences instead remains to be seen. What is indisputable is that, as Lawrence H. Summers, the United States Deputy Treasury Secretary, said recently, its creation will be "an event without precedent, either in European history or the history of the world."

As European countries prepare to phase out their marks, francs and lire in favor of one currency, the convergence has been seen in many ways. Interest rates, for example, have been drawing ever closer; with the single currency in place, there will be only one monetary policy. And most countries have brought their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross dometic product, the threshold for joining the currency plan. Of the 15 members of the European Union, 11 are initially expected to join. Graphs show interest rates, inflation, and budget deficit for European countries. (Source: Eurostat)

Travelers Should Expect Costs to Rise Again

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Because of the strength of the United States economy, travelers have been filling airplanes and hotel rooms to levels not seen in years. With no immediate end to the boom in sight, experts generally expect travel costs to rise by as much as 7 percent in 1998, several percentage points more than the current general inflation rate.
American Express forecasts that overall business travel prices in 1998 will rise 6 to 7 percent in the United States. That would match what American Express predicted for 1997, an increase it now projects at 12 percent, largely because of a rise in air fares. It says American companies spent an estimated $156 billion on travel last year -- 42 percent of it on air fares, 21 percent on lodging, 14 percent on meals, 8 percent each on car rentals and entertainment, 5 percent on communication and 2 percent on taxis, tips, tolls and other expenses. 
 Other forecasters -- Runzheimer International, Rosenbluth International and Travel One -- generally agree with American Express on the overall increase in costs. Still, the companies differ on the areas in which they think the increases will come and on the reasons.
American Express and Runzheimer, the management consulting firm based in Rochester, Wis., generally agree that air fares -- which in 1997 cost the typical business traveler an estimated $850 for a full-fare economy class roundtrip ticket -- will rise about 5 percent in 1998.
But while Runzheimer says that increased fuel costs could force fares up and predicts that some discounts for 7-day and 14-day advance purchase will disappear, American Express cites wage demands by airline unions as putting upward pressure on air fares.
Rosenbluth International, the travel management giant in Philadelphia, says that air fare increases could vary considerably around the country. Even though they could be held to as little as 2 percent in most of the United States, it says, they could reach 9 percent for flights into or out of some key markets, including New York.
Travel One, another big management company, forecasts 1998 fare increases of 6 percent on domestic flights and 7.5 percent on international fares. It says the increases are enough that corporations will investigate such air travel alternatives as charter flights and full or partial ownership of corporate aircraft.
Travel One, which is based in Mount Laurel, N.J., also expects hotel rates to soar 10 percent in 1998 because of continuing high demand. Consequently, it says, companies will consider making corporate housing available in cities frequently visited by their employees, or they may buy blocks of hotel rooms at discounted rates.
American Express sees sharp increases in corporate hotel rates, which it estimates averaged $127 a night in 1997. It expects increases of 13 to 15 percent, largely because it predicts that the occupancy rate will dip slightly from 1997 and that more rooms will be added. Runzheimer forecasts a 6 percent increase in room rates.
Increases in car rental costs are expected to range from 4 to 8 percent in 1998. Runzheimer said that car rental companies, having trimmed costs by not buying and maintaining fleets big enough to accommodate 100 percent of demand at peak periods, can now raise prices enough to produce modest profits. Rosenbluth, said that higher car rental rates will result largely from higher taxes and insurance costs, as well as from less competition because of the consolidation of the industry.
The big bargain in 1998 travel, if the forecasters prove correct, will be meals and entertainment, whose prices they expect to rise by only 2 to 3 percent.
All of the predictions assume, of course, that the economy keeps rolling and that Americans' wanderlust continues. As Rolfe Shellenberger, Runzheimer's senior travel consultant, noted, "Travel demand expectations could be thrown off by such events as war and terrorism, economic catastrophe such as stock market crashes, or political retrogression to planned economies" overseas.

In the 90's, Trying to Keep Prudent With the Joneses

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW

 BODY:
Ask Cameron Montgomery about his life in the 1980's, and he may flip you a wry smile. As a stockbroker in New Orleans, Mr. Montgomery drove a Porsche, wore expensive suits and popped down to Barbados and Jamaica for long winter weekends.
He does none of that anymore. 
 Not only did Mr. Montgomery walk out on his country club, he also yanked his kids out of their private schools and placed them in public ones. His suits have been swapped for polo shirts and khakis, and seldom does he think about stocks and bonds -- unless they come up in one of his nightmares.
"I wanted a simpler life," said Mr. Montgomery, who now lives in Greenville, Miss., and teaches marketing at Delta State University. "When I was a stockbroker, I didn't like the ethics or the pressure. The money back then was nice, but I just didn't feel like I was helping anybody. Now I have kids, and they take a lot of my time and money."
Meet the 90's consumer. Even those who are earning as much or more than before, and generally feeling good about their financial futures, are not exactly jumping for joy. Money that would have gone into a new Mercedes or a Gucci gown 10 years ago is now being poured into the stock market, as a sandbag for when the tide rolls out.
Still, while the 80's may have been the decade of greed, gluttony has not disappeared. Debt levels continue to soar, as consumers make "sensible" purchases -- buying a home instead of renting, and trading in a flashy sports car for a more practical but equally expensive sport utility vehicle. In the 90's, spending has just taken on a more prudent veneer.
"The Nineties is about a psychology of uncertainty that has supplanted the affluence of the Eighties," said Madelyn Hochstein, president of DYG Inc., an opinion polling company in Danbury, Conn. "The consumer view is that the economy is good now but it won't always be that way. Therefore, you have to be practical about money; you just can't go out and spend it."
"A lot happened between that time in the 80's and today," Ms. Hochstein said. "The market crashed in 1987, and companies started to downsize. Not only were companies restructured, many executives were restructured as well. They may be working now but not in the job they once were. People haven't forgotten any of those things that happened to them."
That may explain why the extravagance of the 1980's, garishly seen in the dirty deals and extramarital escapades of popular television series like "Dallas," no longer captures the nation's fascination.
"Melrose Place" may be the closest "Dallas" equivalent -- certainly in the amount of bedroom gymnastics allotted to a single hour -- but the characters are far from wealthy. Billy, one fresh-faced hunk of the show's many, works in an advertising agency and has yet to don a tie. Not only does he live in a modest apartment, his only splurge appears to be for a gym membership to perfect his chiseled abs.
More important to the 90's consumer, though, Billy has a job. And he goes to it every day. The Nineties are a time of careers, 401(k) contributions, promotions and the stock options that come with them.
The nation's low unemployment rate has given consumers a sense of comfort -- at least for the time being -- that they haven't experienced in decades. A University of Michigan survey of consumer confidence in December hit its highest point since 1965.
What is noteworthy, though, is how people are spending money compared with the Eighties. Some 66 percent of all households now own their homes -- more than ever before -- one more statistic in the chase for security. Once baby boomers and Generation X'ers have families, their cash does not stray too far from the cradle.
When an affluent couple of the 80's wanted to show off their wealth, they bought a Mercedes or a BMW to turn a few heads at the country club or the supermarket parking lot. Today, if that same couple had children, they would buy a Ford Explorer or Jeep Grand Cherokee to tool around town showing off their troop.
With many family expenses outpacing inflation, children may now be the ultimate status symbol. College tuition and fees, for instance, have risen 5 percent annually for public and private schools in the 90's, a decade in which inflation is crawling ever closer to zero. And there is, of course, the obligatory expense of keeping the children equipped with Gap clothes as they grow up.
To meet these responsibilities, and others, consumers have turned to the stock market. In the 80's, the market was the playground for moguls like Michael Milken to get rich quick. Now the club membership has broadened. Consumers have discovered that investing is one way to get comfortable slowly, and they have dumped record amounts of their disposable income into stocks. Individuals now own some $5.7 trillion in stocks, twice the amount they owned in 1991, according to the Federal Reserve.
With all this income going to buy homes and stocks, consumers certainly are not saving much cash. The personal savings rate is now about 4 percent, compared with 5.1 percent to 5.5 percent in the late 80's.
They are still spending money on themselves, of course, though perhaps in more subtle ways. The must brands of 10 years ago -- names like Armani and Gucci -- are still around, but they have been supplemented in wardrobes and behind the driver's seat of sport utility vehicles by outdoor clothing from Patagonia or the North Face.
Outfitted like this, consumers have been choosing ever more exotic vacations. Beach resorts like Cancun, Mexico, may have been the hot spots of 10 years ago, especially for Wall Street getaways, but now people want vacations with meaning -- or at least the appearance of it. A survey by the American Society of Travel Agents last summer disclosed that more travelers were booking adventurous trips than in the past. Two of the most popular destinations were South Africa and Costa Rica.
One popular excursion offered by Destination World, a travel agency in Santa Barbara, Calif., is a two-week trip each August from Los Angeles to Tana Toraja, on a tiny island in Indonesia that is known for its annual burial service. The price: about $6,000, including air fare.
While the hangover from the extravagance of the 80's may have made many people cautious about their long-term futures, they have not been willing to give up the instant gratification of splurges like these -- particularly when the stock market deposits unexpected gains in their laps.
"I already have more money than I thought I was going to have," said Edgar A. Hatcher, a retired Manhattan advertising executive. "My wife and I have been able to take vacations and pick up a few nice prints. But my children are having to work harder than I did. They make more money than I ever did and still they're not sure how they're going to make it."

Asian Economies Come Down to Earth
For years, investors seeking growth had looked to Asia, where economies often seemed to rise as rapidly as the shiny skylines of the capital cities. In 1997, though, cracks started appearing in the foundations, and the global economy -- the same force that had laid the bricks for the furious growth -- proved that it could help tear down what it had joined in building. One economy after another, starting with Thailand, stumbled as currency devaluations set off a financial rout. Though it had looked for a while as though the crisis could be contained to countries like Thailand and Indonesia, with the help of the International Monetary Fund, the size of the problem was demonstrated when South Korea also succumbed.
 
Japan's Woes Continue
Japan, whose economy has been sluggish throughout the 1990's, was still standing as Asian economies tumbled around it. But the crisis in Japan's financial services industry deepened. Nomura Securities, the biggest Japanese securities firm, was penalized by the authorities after it was found to have made illegal payments to a racketeer. The gangster scandal spread to other companies, including Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Yamaichi Securities, which later collapsed. 

No Longer a Colony
The lowering of the Union Jack in Hong Kong was expected to test the notion that the end of the cold war had elevated economics above politics. After getting their hands on the former British colony, the talk went, China's leaders might be unable to resist imposing some of the elements of their command economy, in addition to limiting political freedoms. Instead, the financial markets shrugged off the change of leadership and continued to rise -- until the spreading Asian crisis threatened to undermine this capitalist capital, too. But the Hong Kong sell-off only reinforced the argument that in the global economy, the concerns of the market, not political ideology, rule.
 
Defeat for Clinton on Trade
The Asian financial crisis was a handy symbol for Congressional Democrats concerned about the dangers of foreign trade entanglements. Members of President Clinton's own party led the fight against legislation that would have renewed his authority to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could accept or reject but not alter. Facing defeat, the President agreed to shelve the matter, handing a victory to organized labor, which saw a threat to American jobs from a flood of ever-cheaper goods from Asian countries determined to export their way out of economic trouble. But many business executives warned that the lack of so-called fast-track negotiating authority would prove costly to the United States economy.
 
Deal Making, Euro-Style
The United States may have been casting an increasingly wary eye abroad, but, more and more, other countries were adopting American ways of doing business. Nowhere was that more apparent than in a Europe preparing for currency union. Though politicians, particularly in France, may have gone along only grudgingly, big European companies rushed to imitate their American cousins, with a wave of deal making and consolidation unlike anything the Continent had seen. Among the biggest combinations were Grand Metropolitan's linkup with Guinness, bringing together two giant food and alcohol conglomerates, and a complex deal to join the financial services businesses of BAT of Britain and Zurich Insurance of Switzerland. The big Swiss banks -- criticized for their handling of the Nazi gold affair -- were among the biggest deal makers, with Union Bank and Swiss Bank agreeing to merge.
 
The Gold Bust of '97
Even in a world pushing into the 21st century, room remains for something as venerable and familiar as good old gold lust. Such was the driving force, it seems, for all parties in the Bre-X Minerals scandal: the Canadian company's geologists, its executives, even its investors who lost everything when Bre-X collapsed after its claim to have made the richest gold find in history -- in the Busang region in Indonesia -- was found to be a fraud.

1997 HIGHLIGHTS

 BODY:

Companies Continue The Rush to Combine
Mergers and acquisitions seem to have become a constant in the business landscape, works-in-progress more unceasing than construction in Manhattan. Most major industries contributed to the record level of deals last year: In banking and financial services, First Union agreed to buy Corestates; Travelers Group, which already owns Smith Barney, added Salomon, and Dean Witter, Discover joined Morgan Stanley to form a Wall Street giant. The consolidation in aerospace and high technology continued with Lockheed Martin's acquisition of Northrop Grumman. Perhaps not surprisingly, one of the more engaging takeover battles -- the fight for ITT between Hilton and Starwood Lodging, the eventual winner -- involved companies in the gambling and hotel businesses. But the biggest deal of all was in telecommunications, where Worldcom trumped its rivals, GTE and British Telecommunications, in a grab for MCI Communications. 

Doing the Math
The merger imperative gripped a business comfortable with big numbers: accounting. In September, Coopers & Lybrand and Price Waterhouse announced their plan to create what would be the world's largest accounting firm. Analysts had barely finished suggesting that the industry had no more big mergers left in it when KPMG Peat Marwick and Ernst & Young said they, too, would join, stepping over the Coopers-Price combination to become the world's largest. The bottom line: The Big Six -- not so very long ago the Big Eight -- was poised to shrink to a Big Four.
 
Tobacco Battle Continues
Anti-smoking groups had been calling for the heads of Big Tobacco for years, but it took the unseen hand of the market to bring the tobacco companies to the table to negotiate a historic settlement. Stock prices were weighed down by the open-ended prospects of huge liability payments as state attorneys general and others sought to recover the costs of medical care for smoking-related illnesses. Still, the accord, which would require the industry to pay $368.5 billion over 25 years and submit to new Federal marketing and advertising restrictions, almost immediately became nothing more than a start for real negotiations. One thing is certain, though: Joe Camel is gone, after R. J. Reynolds Tobacco agreed to drop the cartoon figure and replace him with stylized versions of the original Camel cigarettes trademark.
 
Labor Wins, but a Leader Loses
It was hailed as a watershed event for labor in the 1990's: a head-to-head confrontation between the teamsters and the United Parcel Service in which the workers -- after a seemingly endless run of losses -- won. But for Ron Carey, the union's president, who had made great political hay in bringing the strike off, there was a defeat, too, just days after an agreement to end the strike was reached. A Federal panel found that his re-election campaign had benefited from illegal financing; the vote was voided, and Mr. Carey was barred from running again.
 
Trouble for Health Companies
Several big health-care companies will spend this year recovering from the woes of 1997. The Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation became the target of a criminal investigation of how it billed Federal health programs like Medicare. The company's chief executive, Richard Scott, who had built it from obscurity to the biggest hospital chain in the country, was replaced as Columbia sought a less aggressive, more cooperative image. Another once high-flying company, Oxford Health Plans, was hurt by problems with its billing system, though it cited the switch to a new computer system. Still, the trouble hurt the company's earnings and sent its stock plunging.
 
A Five-and-Dime Is Not Spared
The end had been coming for a long time. Even so, the announcement that the Woolworth Corporation was closing its last 400 F. W. Woolworth stores was heavy with nostalgia. With a product selection that seemed increasingly quirky, Woolworth -- which dropped its five-and-dime price limit during the Depression -- had survived for 117 years despite the growth of suburban malls and the decline of downtown shopping areas.

Oil Prices Expected To Be Firm

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
An underpinning of the economic boom of the 1990's has been the relative steadiness of oil prices. While big oil-producing countries have been frustrated by an inability to raise prices, American drivers, and hence the whole economy, have benefited from steady costs at the pump.
But the surge in economic growth in recent years has led to increasing demand for oil, a trend that is expected to gain strength this year. In the face of tight supplies, that might be expected to push up prices -- or at least to keep them firm -- possibly setting off alarms about higher inflation. 
 Nonetheless, the big oil producers, particularly the Persian Gulf nations that dominate the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, are expected to play an even greater role than usual in determining supply and prices.
In November, OPEC members agreed to raise their overall production ceiling to 27.5 million barrels a day, from 25 million barrels. The increase will not really add supply, however, because some countries have already been cheating on their production quotas.
The amount of oil that will actually be available will depend much on Middle East politics, and particularly on Saudi Arabia, whose production quota has increased the most. Saudi Arabia will now be allowed to pump up to 800,000 more barrels of oil a day to help meet the 75 million to 76 million barrels a day that are expected to be needed this year -- up about 2 million barrels a day from 1997.
Saudi Arabia, which has the capacity to pump even more oil than it is allowed to, will be in a position to watch whether demand will be as strong and whether production from other sources like the North Sea will be greater than expected. If the last few years are a guide, the Saudis will seek to add production only if demand can absorb it -- seeking to keep up prices.
Other factors, too, point to the possibility of higher prices. These include the inability of the industry to make substantial additions to its reserves and growing shortages of increasingly costly drilling equipment.
Meantime, demand for gasoline has increased -- particularly in the United States, where gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles are highly popular -- and has generally been underestimated by experts.
All bets about the course of oil prices are off, however, if another big producer -- Iraq -- is allowed to return fully to the world market by the United Nations. And despite the relative steadiness of prices recently, day-to-day volatility has not been eliminated entirely. On the Monday after OPEC decided to increase its production quotas, for instance, the active crude oil futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell sharply. The price, above $25 a barrel in early 1997, ended the year at $17.64.
Constantinos Fliakos, an oil analyst for Merrill Lynch, while saying that he expected oil prices to be held down by quota-cheating OPEC members and the possibility of lower demand in Asia, acknowledged that predicting oil prices was often simply a game of hunches like these. "Poker is easier," he said.

On Taxes, Count on Congress for More Discussion but No Big Changes

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The Republicans and the Democrats have signaled that this year they are set to repeat the performances that led to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Unfortunately for taxpayers, that legislation has been described by many experts as a badly drafted mess that, while promising simplicity and fairness, actually adds complexity and creates burdens for many people, especially those with modest incomes.
The Republicans believe that by championing lower taxes and rewards for those who save and invest, combined with attacking the Internal Revenue Service, they can solidify their hold on both houses of Congress and pave the way to a Republican White House in 2001. 
 The Democrats remain in disarray, with no viable alternative to the Republican agenda and with leaders who talk only vaguely of tax reform.
But regardless of the tone of the debate, one fact remains unchanged: the share of the national economic pie going to taxes continues to enlarge, despite a half century of talk by politicians of both parties polishing their images as tax cutters.
And as 1997 came to an end, money was pouring into the I.R.S., a result of the booming economic fortunes of those citizens with the highest incomes. While receipts collected in October 1997 for payroll taxes like Social Security were up 7.4 percent over October 1996, individual income taxes were up 13.2 percent. That indicates that over all, the one in five Americans who make more than about $66,000 annually are experiencing sharply rising incomes. And for those making more than $250,000, the top 1 percent of taxpayers, all indications are that the good times are really good, contributing to the bulge in Government coffers.
"The Government is taking a larger and larger share of the pie even with the constraints on spending" that Congress enacted in recent years, said Aldona Robbins, a supply-side economist with the Institute for Policy Innovation, a Washington nonprofit organization that does research on taxes and the economy.
That money will cause lots of fights over how best to spend, or give back, any surplus. But what about fundamental tax reform?
"You will hear all kinds of ranting and raving, but there will not be any big changes," said Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group that favors a progressive income tax system.
Here is what to look for:
 
TAX CUTS Count on them, but not necessarily for much money. Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the Ways and Means Committee, has committed himself to an annual tax cut. Ari Fleischer, his spokesman, said Mr. Archer "believes the American people are entitled to tax relief every year, that they remain overtaxed, and it ought to be our goal to reduce the size of government so that people can keep more of what they make."
 
COMPLEXITY Expect more of it. The Republicans want to cut taxes, and President Clinton has indicated a willingness to consider cuts and changes, but the available dollars are relatively few. A likely result will be gimmicks that give tax breaks to those willing to run the gantlet of intersecting rules and extensive worksheets to calculate benefits. Such measures cost less than outright reductions in rates because many people cannot, or will not, take advantage of them. Complexity, in turn, means higher fees for accountants and tax preparers.
 
INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS Before 1987, the first $200 of dividends and interest for each individual ($400 for a couple) was not taxed, a policy that Representative Kenny Hulshof, a freshman Republican from Missouri who serves on the Ways and Means Committee, wants to revive. Mr. Archer, the committee chairman, has him out floating this trial balloon. "People who put together a little nest egg, say $4,000, on which they earn 5 percent interest, or $200, should not be penalized for their thrift," Mr. Hulshof said.
Mr. Archer and his allies say that they eventually want to end all taxes on savings and investment income.
 
CAPITAL GAINS The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 lowered the maximum rate on long-term capital gains. But it raised the complexity, creating a host of new effective capital gains rates, depending on the length of time an asset is held or a taxpayer's bracket for ordinary income. Because of this complexity, people with capital gains last year will not be able to file their 1997 tax returns until February, when the I.R.S. will issue a revised Schedule D.
In a recent speech, Donald C. Lubick, the assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said that "we have not heard the last word" on capital gains rates.
 
ESTATE TAXES Speaker Newt Gingrich wants to eliminate the estate tax, which will raise about $22 billion this year, a little more than 1 percent of Government revenues. Republicans say the estate tax penalizes savings and encourages all sorts of tax games that create inefficiency. And the tax is hated by millions of people, many of whom live in fear of it but do not have enough money to be affected by it. Democrats can be expected to denounce ending the estate tax as favoring the rich because only the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans pay it. Democrats can also be expected to argue that the tax makes up for holes in the income tax system that allow those who own businesses to avoid paying many taxes during their lifetime.
"Ending the estate tax would further reduce progressivity in the tax structure," said Mr. McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice.
 
MARRIAGE PENALTY Millions of married couples pay higher taxes than they would if they just lived together. Two single taxpayers, for example, each with taxable income of $50,000, would be in the 28 percent bracket, but if they married and reported taxable income of $100,000, they would be in the 31 percent bracket. Democrats and Republicans alike detect voter resentment at this, but they hear no complaints from the millions of American couples who, conversely, get a marriage bonus under the current tax laws. (In this case, a single taxpayer with income of $125,000 would be in the 36 percent bracket; if she married someone who had no income, they would be in the 31 percent bracket as a couple.) One possible way to end the marriage penalty would be a law that allows married people to figure their taxes twice, as a couple and as if they were two singles, and to pay the lower amount. That, however, adds complexity.
 
THE I.R.S. Expect more attention to be paid to I.R.S. abuses of taxpayers as Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, conducts hearings to coincide with the April 15 deadline for filing 1997 income tax returns.

Buoyant Stock Market Keeps Mergers in Pipeline

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL

 BODY:
Telephone companies, regional banks, Wall Street firms, hotels and casinos, oil and gas ventures, radio and television stations -- the list is almost endless as a growing procession of industries is caught up in the enthusiasm for takeovers.
After yet another record year for mergers and acquisitions, the trend shows little sign of abating, experts on Wall Street say. With just the deals that are now in the pipeline, they say, 1998 will be another very active year for the merger mavens, particularly those who specialize in telecommunications, financial, high-technology and health care companies. 
 The total value of mergers and acquisitions announced in the United States last year was $919 billion, according to the Securities Data Company, a New Jersey statistical concern. Thanks to such huge deals as Worldcom's $36.5 billion offer to acquire the MCI Communications Corporation, that 1997 total represents a staggering increase of nearly 50 percent from 1996 merger volume of $626 billion, which was itself a record.
"Many of the factors at work in the past year appear to be continuing," said Kendrick Wilson, a vice chairman at Lazard Freres & Company who specializes in advising financial companies on mergers.
Mr. Wilson said in an interview that he expected the ferocious pace of merger business to continue, driven by "high stock valuations, the continuing struggle for revenue growth, the need for technology, pressures on expenses and the pressure of institutional investors who are very short-term and performance-oriented." Takeovers are generally the fastest way for company management to build revenue and profits, particularly at a time when it is easy to issue new stock.
Some specialists sound a cautionary note, however.
"The merger business has always been a cyclical business," said Robert A. Kindler, a partner who specializes in mergers at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, "and anyone who predicts with any confidence that the merger business will continue this strong indefinitely is going to be wrong."
The caveat, as at this time last year, is that any serious threat to the stock market could dampen the merger mania of America's boardrooms, which often rely on high-priced stock to finance takeovers.
The merger boom is also altering -- some critics would say weakening -- the capital structure of many big companies as they issue new stock or take on added debt to pay for the deals. Such financing can dilute earnings per share and can lower the value of shares outright.
"A lot of these companies that have grown fast by acquisition may find that their currency is not as valuable as it once was," Mr. Kindler said.
Those are problems for the future, however. For the moment, Wall Street is enjoying record profits, not least because of the growing merger business. Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company -- itself the product of a merger last year -- led the field of investment banks advising on mergers in 1997. Through Dec. 19, it had worked on 282 transactions around the world, valued at $322.5 billion.
The boom has also provided rich pickings for Wall Street's law firms. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett led the field in 1997, according to Securities Data, advising on 23 percent of mergers and acquisitions in the United States.
The fees generated by the merger business are among the fattest on Wall Street and have contributed to the billions of dollars in bonuses at brokerage firms this year. So it is perhaps not surprising that with the merger boom continuing, Wall Street firms are being sought not only for their advice but also as acquisition targets.
Several of the biggest deals of 1997 involved Wall Street firms, including Dean Witter, Discover's $10.2 billion acquisition of Morgan Stanley in February. In September, the Travelers Group, which already owned Smith Barney, doubled its Wall Street presence by agreeing to buy Salomon Inc.
Those deals were accompanied by a string of smaller ones as banks, including Bankers Trust, BankAmerica, Nationsbank and others, snapped up brokerage firms, particularly those that specialize in newer growth industries such as health care and high technology.
Brokerage firms have also shown themselves to be eager to acquire money management firms, in part because this can help make their earnings more consistent, improving the value of their stocks in the eyes of investment analysts. Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs & Company have all moved aggressively into this business. In the biggest such transaction to date, Merrill Lynch agreed in November to pay more than $5 billion to acquire Mercury Asset Management P.L.C. of London.
"It seems that current trends remain in place, whether in the brokerage or consumer-finance sector," said Leslie A. Nelkin, managing director of Furman Selz L.L.C. "Companies are seeing benefits in scale and the need to offer a panoply of products, and that's leading to consolidation."
"The only thing that could stop it," he added, "would be serious concerns about the financial markets, and that does not seem to be happening."
While the interest in Wall Street firms and other financial companies accelerated last year, the busiest area for mergers and acquisitions remained telecommunications. There was more than $90 billion of merger volume in telecommunications, or about 10 percent of the total, according to Securities Data. Still, that was below the level of 1996, when deals in this field topped $100 billion in value.
The wave of mergers and acquisitions spread through most industries, with banking and hotels and casinos among the busiest. Particularly in banking, acquirers were helped by the stock market's vigorous growth, which let them issue their own, often highly valued, shares to pay rich prices for their targets.
Could the merger boom continue even if the stock market registered a significant drop? Perhaps, at least for a while.
A number of investment firms, such as the Blackstone Group, Lehman Brothers and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, have raised billions of dollars from institutional investors in the last year or so as they have assembled new merchant banking funds, and they have yet to invest most of this money.
In the event of a market decline, however, Mr. Nelkin said this investment capital would probably go into industrial stocks rather than more speculative issues.

Doing the American-Opposition-to-Big-Government 2-Step

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Americans have long complained about abuses by the Internal Revenue Service. Taking aim at an easy target, in 1997 Washington finally did something about the complaints: With the reluctant support of President Clinton, the House passed, 426 to 4, a "Taxpayer Bill of Rights," setting the stage for what is likely to be an equally lopsided vote in the Senate in 1998.
By most accounts this ritual slaying of Big Brother is symptomatic of a broader revolt against intrusive government that has been gaining momentum since Jimmy Carter unleashed "supersaver" airline fares. And there is plenty of evidence -- everything from revised welfare laws to the current drive to deregulate electricity -- to buttress the idea that Americans have lower expectations of what government can accomplish and less tolerance of its abuses. 
 Look closer, though, and the picture clouds. The impact of apparently popular environmental regulation on daily life is growing by leaps and bounds. Efforts to contain the cost of Medicare guarantee that Uncle Sam will be a party to the most private interactions of patients and doctors. And even the cathartic attack on the tax collector could have unintended consequences. "Taking the I.R.S. down a peg may lead to more exacting record-keeping and reporting standards for taxpayers," argued Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan's Business School.
The nation's always tumultuous relationship with New Deal-style government has been on the rocks at least since the 1970's. Washington, once seen as the champion of the weak and a catalyst for economic and social progress, has come to be reviled as the agent of special interests.
Elaborate regulations governing the airline, trucking, railroad, long-distance telephone, natural gas and oil industries were dismantled over the last two decades, while the burden shifted to government to show whether or why corporate mergers and aggressive business practices restrained commerce. Big tax cuts, followed by a decade of budget deficits, ended the era in which Washington was inclined to define aspirations -- eliminating poverty, moving the disabled into the mainstream, saving family farms, assuring the survival of passenger trains -- and throw money at them.
An ideologically driven Republican Congress beat back the Clinton Administration's effort to provide universal health insurance, and it ended welfare as millions of single mothers knew it. Emboldened by skepticism about the welfare state, mainstream research organizations and advisory commissions have broached the idea of taming Social Security deficits by privatizing the system. Even Democrats are talking the talk, calling for tax simplification and revisions in entitlement spending and emphasizing the need to use market incentives to ease the burden of regulation.
But the opposition to big government is less tidy than it might first appear. For starters, a tsunami of environmental regulation is still building momentum. If Congress agrees, the United States could be forced to double energy prices in the next decade to meet its commitment at the recent conference in Japan on cutting greenhouse gases.
Even without new legislation, big changes are coming. Open-ended requirements in the Clean Air Act require the Environmental Protection Agency to identify hazardous pollutants and then set standards that eliminate health effects. And despite protests from White House and Treasury economists, the E.P.A. has just reduced tolerances for ozone and fine soot particles to levels that would almost certainly require wrenching changes in transportation, energy use and the details of daily life.
"People don't yet realize the new standards will affect everything from gasoline lawn mowers to the way the neighborhood bakeries vent their pastry ovens," said Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University.
Or consider medical care. Congress brushed aside White House plans for broadening medical insurance coverage and heavily regulating delivery of services. But what a difference a few years can make: in equally high dudgeon, legislators last year rushed to the defense of the mothers of newborns, whose insurers had refused to pay for an extra day in the hospital.
The inclination by Congress to micro-manage private health care may be beaten back, in part by heftier campaign contributions from the insurance lobby. But paradoxically, Washington's determination to cut Federal spending leaves little doubt that older Americans will have to jump through new hoops to get Government-financed medical care.
Under the accord reached last year, fully half of the Federal budget savings over the next decade will come from slowing the inevitable growth in Medicare spending. This will require the ratcheting down of both the costs of individual services and the volume of services delivered -- all of which translates into a larger say by both Government and insurance company bureaucrats into who gets what treatment.
"With unconstrained fee-for-service insurance, no one stands between doctor and patient," said Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. But with tightly constrained managed care, he added, the Government will surely be sucked into the dialogue as both the gatekeeper to access and as a defender of patients' rights.
By the same token, Judy Gueron, president of the Manpower Development Research Corporation in New York, suggested that extracting Washington from its traditional welfare-state role might well mean a greater government presence in maintaining the remnants of the social safety net. The least intrusive public assistance program, after all, is a monthly check or a book of food stamps. By contrast, successful welfare reform will probably turn on the states' willingness to push, plead and train people off the dole -- and then provide child care and medical insurance.
And then there is the aforementioned Taxpayer Bill of Rights, evidence that Washington is listening to the pleas of citizens to get government off their backs. Should the bill become law, the burden of proof in tax disputes that reach Tax Court would shift from the taxpayer to the I.R.S. But in becoming obliged to prove that taxpayers have cheated, the I.R.S. must fall back on greater disclosure to deter fraud. A likely result will be demands that honest taxpayers keep better records and file more forms.
Tax policy is a perfect example of Americans' deep ambivalence about the proper role of government. Soon before the House voted on the I.R.S. bill, Congress passed legislation that includes tax credits for college tuition. And Mr. Slemrod notes that with the new benefits will come -- you guessed it -- bigger government in the form of new tax-reporting requirements for both beneficiaries and colleges.

Stocks Romp Smartly On; Will Nothing Stop the Bull?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IN the 1990's, the performance of the American stock market has been nothing short of amazing, particularly in the last three years. Over that stretch, investors in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have seen their money more than double. That had never happened before in so short a period.
Much of that performance has come from demographics, as the baby boom reaches the age when it seems wise to invest for retirement and surveys an investment scene characterized by interest rates far lower than when the boomers were young and borrowing to buy homes. 
 But the stock market's outstanding performance reflects more than demographic levitation. It has had an important fundamental support: Corporate earnings have also risen, with a consistency and a magnitude not seen in nearly half a century.
To be sure, stock prices have also risen rapidly, leading some to question whether investors are overpaying when they buy stocks. And companies do not necessarily have to have earnings to be stock-market stars. The best performer of last year, excluding stocks that began the year at less than $5, showed a gain of more than 500 percent. It was an Internet company that has yet to show an annual profit. And its name aptly summed up the attitude among stock market investors: Yahoo. (Ranking second was another money-losing Internet company with an appropriate name for this market: Mindspring Enterprises.)
Still, for most companies profits do count. And the very persistence of rising profits has helped to convince investors that it does not matter if you pay a bit much for a stock based on current conditions: better days and higher profits that are coming will more than offset that.
For 1998, the biggest question mark on the bullish horizon may be whether confidence in earnings growth will still prove to be justified. While most Wall Street analysts think profits for companies in the S.& P. 500 will rise for a seventh consecutive year -- which would also be a first -- there are some who see clouds on the horizon.
It is a horizon that has remained remarkably clear for most of the 1990's. Corporate profits fell in 1991, reflecting the aftermath of a brief recession in 1990 and a slew of restructuring charges. But they rose in 1992 and every year thereafter. Standard & Poor's estimates that profits on the S.& P. 500 in 1997 were up 163 percent from the 1992 level.
The only better performance over a six-year stretch came in the years 1945 through 1950, amid a postwar boom. Then profits more than doubled, but that was off a very low base that had been held down by wartime wage and price controls.
The rise during this decade has come from a variety of forces that may be running out of steam. The widespread corporate reorganizations of the early 1990's cost jobs but made companies more efficient. That helped them to get a rising share of profits from exports. The threat of overseas competition helped to keep wage costs down, and the health care revolution stemmed the rise in employee benefit costs. One result was that corporate profits came to take an ever bigger slice of the revenue pie while workers got much less.
Now, that may be changing. Wage-cost pressures seem to be rising, though the data are ambiguous. And while the pressure of low-cost imports, particularly from Asia, seems likely to keep price inflation in check, the tight labor market in this country could push wages up.
As a result, companies might end up with higher costs from wages without an ability to pass on the costs to customers. That would mean lower earnings.
On the other hand, interest rates are expected to remain low, providing little competition for investments. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell below 6 percent late in 1997 and is likely to remain there.
In 1997, the S.& P. 500 rose 31 percent, for a total profit for holders of the stocks in the index of 33.4 percent, including reinvested dividends. That brought the three-year performance for the index, which dates back to 1928, to a stunning 125 percent, including reinvested dividends. The previous best performance for the index over a three-year stretch came in 1933-35, when the market was bouncing off Depression lows. In that period, investors made a 95 percent profit.
To be sure, the S.& P. 500 figure overstates how most investors did. The S.& P. 500 outperformed most other indexes by a sizable margin last year in part because a lot of foreign money came into the United States market, fueled by worries about the crisis in Asia, and gravitated toward the internationally known companies that dominate the index. Still it was remarkable.
To some, the current period is most reminiscent of the mid-1950's. Then, as now, inflation and interest rates were low. (Lower, in fact, than they have been during this three-year run.) And from 1954 through 1956, the S.& P. 500 had a total return of 88 percent, assuming annual reinvestment of dividends. Until now, that had been the best postwar return for such a stretch.
It is a comforting analogy. For while stock prices fell in 1957, as the country endured a brief recession, the slide was not a deep one. And in 1958 stock prices shot up again, with the total return on the S.& P. 500 more than 40 percent.
There are several similarities. During the 1950's run, as during the current one, a President was re-elected by a large majority. But the opposition party held on to control of both the House and the Senate as the President proved to have very short coattails. (Memo to Bill Clinton and Al Gore: At the mid-term election in 1958, the fact that the stock market was soaring did President Dwight D. Eisenhower's party little good as the opposition Democrats scored a landslide victory in Congressional elections. And two years later, Vice President Richard M. Nixon lost the Presidential election.)
But before investors settle down for another comfortable period, they should note that there is one way in which the market does not resemble the 1950's. That is in volatility. The 1950's market was remarkably placid. Last year's gyrations reached a peak on Oct. 27, when the market plunged amid worldwide panic over the Asian turmoil. But there was plenty of volatility even before that. For the year, 32 percent of the trading days saw the S.& P. 500 end the day up or down at least 1 percent from the previous day. That is an average of about three days every two weeks. That is more than double the volatility of 1996 and three times that of 1995.
Another means of measuring volatility, known formally as the standard deviation of daily moves, shows just how widely spread out daily moves are. By that measure, 1997 was the fourth most volatile year of the last half century, trailing only 1987, 1982 and 1974. All those years saw violent reversals of the market trend. The fact that there was no such clear reversal this year could indicate that one is about to come.
Or, the higher volatility could be reflecting changes in the way markets operate. In the current world of derivative securities and huge bets placed by institutions, higher volatility may endure until the market adjusts to new trading strategies.
The day last fall when American stock markets were forced to close early because a wave of selling had sent prices plunging seems largely forgotten now. Unlike the 1987 market crash, that plunge, on Oct. 27, is barely reflected in mutual fund cash flow data. When professional investors got scared, individual investors saw an opportunity and stabilized the market.
Such commitment by individuals, reflecting both demographics and a widespread conviction that stocks are now and always will be the best long-term investment, is the strongest thing the stock market has going for it in 1998. If that behavior persists, even widespread earnings disappointments might not be enough to slay the great bull of the 1990's.

Conditions seem ripe for more and more turbulence on Madison Avenue.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
MADISON Avenue has just experienced what may be the busiest back-to-back years in its history as 1997 followed in the frenzied footsteps of 1996. Again, accounts with billions of dollars in billings shifted among agencies at a dizzying pace, dozens of large creative and media assignments underwent consolidation, high-profile executives switched jobs frequently, and big agency companies acquired scores of smaller shops.
Will 1998 make it three wild years in a row? Or is the frenetic pace too intense to sustain? The preliminary outlook seems to be: keep those hatches battened down. 
 "Our El Nino is going to be here with us for a while," said Wally Snyder, president and chief executive of the American Advertising Federation in Washington, which represents marketers, agencies and media companies.
"We can expect more turbulence because so much of it is being driven by consumers," he added. "They're not as brand loyal as they have been, they're more culturally diverse, they have more options than ever before. So marketers are looking for more and more ways to make the sale."
O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, agreed.
"As long as the stock market holds up, I don't think there will be any change" in the tumultuous tenor of the times, Mr. Drake said.
Accounts will keep changing agencies "as long as C.E.O.'s are being held accountable virtually quarterly by the stock market," he added, referring to top executives who must produce earnings gains or watch their companies' share prices plummet.
The rapid rate of acquisitions will also continue, Mr. Drake predicted, because the huge publicly traded agency companies that woo investors by projecting that earnings will increase by 20 percent annually "can't do that just from internal growth; they have to keep buying."
The ranks of those publicly traded agency companies are likely to expand in 1998 as Young & Rubicam Inc., privately held since its founding, prepares for an initial public offering that may come in the second quarter of the year. Trade publications have estimated that the stock offering could value Y.& R., the world's fifth-largest agency company, at $2 billion.
Lorna Tilbian, media analyst at Panmure Gordon in London, said she expected additional initial offerings and acquisitions involving agencies because "in this economic cycle, a lot of executives are in their 50's and they're looking to sell at the top of the market."
"In the next cycle," she added, "they might be too old to cash in their chips."
A potential stock offering by Young & Rubicam is not the only factor encouraging privately held agencies to go public. Another significant influence, said James Dougherty, who follows the advertising industry for Prudential Securities in New York, is the rich valuations the stock market has been placing on the shares of publicly traded agencies like the Omnicom Group and the Interpublic Group of Companies.
The executives who run privately held agencies, Mr. Dougherty added, "have to look at stocks trading for 25 times earnings and ask, 'Can we afford not to be public?' "
Mr. Drake of the agency association said that was particularly true because the privately held agencies "are increasingly at a competitive disadvantage in competing for acquisitions and for talent."
But then "there's a real talent shortage" at all agencies, public and private, he added, with "a lot of big jobs on the street right now, some of them open for a long time."
"Agencies are having a harder and harder time attracting bright talent," Mr. Drake said, because of the appeal of higher-paying careers like investment banking and because programs to recruit newcomers to the advertising industry were cut back during the last recession.
That lingering problem from the early 1990's is a reminder of how rooted agencies are in the ups and downs of the economy. But over the long term, that has its benefits, one analyst declares.
"The advertising business is an economic phenomenon that has a fundamentally upward bias," said Alan J. Gottesman, managing director of West End Communications/ Consulting in New York, as more products and services, ranging from computers and anti-baldness drugs to cellular phones to tiny beanbag toys, are introduced to consumers.
"More comes into the system, which continues to escalate inexorably," Mr. Gottesman said. "And what goes out? Very little -- W. T. Grant and Ipana."
"There are also increasingly competitive situations in existing categories such as automobiles, laundry detergents, home entertainment and movies," he added, which all contribute to rising advertising spending.
Indeed, a leading agency prognosticator has revised upward his prediction of American ad spending in the new year. Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at McCann-Erickson U.S.A. in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic, estimated last month that ad spending in 1998 would total a record $198.4 billion. That compares with a forecast of $196.5 billion that he offered in June. Mr. Coen's more recent estimate of 1998 ad spending would represent an increase of 6.2 percent from the $186.8 billion that he predicted was spent in 1997.
Mr. Dougherty of Prudential Securities said that increase "would soak up a lot of the risk in Asia and Latin America," if the economic turmoil in those regions resulted in disruptions like cutbacks in ad spending.

Big New Risks For America's Insurance Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Asian crisis of 1997 started slowly, like a typhoon lazily making its way across the Pacific.
It hit first in Thailand, a country that Americans know more for its beaches and its architecture than for its ill-regulated financial markets, which had been languishing already. The devaluation of the country's currency, the baht, began just before the July 4 holiday, when it seemed particularly easy to dismiss the free fall as one of those freak events that occasionally wipe out unwary investors in faraway markets. Then the storm picked up moisture and descended on Malaysia and Indonesia. To Americans, it still seemed remote. It was not until the fury hit Hong Kong, prompted a brief but impressive selloff in New York, swamped South Korea and then threatened Tokyo that Americans really woke up to the market disaster hovering across the Pacific. 
 So, for 1998 one question that looms over the American markets is: Will the Asian crisis stay in Asia? Or despite months of frantic efforts to contain the contagion, is it bound to drift across the ocean? If Asia ultimately undoes the American markets, it will be a cruel twist of financial fate. Asia was supposed to be the continent of miracles in the 90's, the place to put money as a hedge against the day when the great American bull run came to a halt. After all, as managers of emerging-market funds argued for years, Asia boasted the world's fastest-growing middle class, buyers who had already stuffed their shelves with Hollywood movies and were eagerly moving on to Explorers and Pentiums. Asia, in short, was America's insurance policy. Just ask Microsoft, which is having less trouble with Jiang Zemin's central committee in China than with Janet Reno's antitrust division at the Justice Department.
As the Asian hunger for things American grew, it was easy to draw neat lines showing how profits for American companies would rise, feeding ever-greater expectations about earnings and stock prices.
But suddenly the insurance policy lapsed. And the prescriptions written by Washington and the International Monetary Fund for what ails Asia -- prescriptions that call for high interest rates, the shutdown of banks and overextended businesses, and a new era of government austerity -- portend years of hardship as economies shrink and industries reorganize. Just when the United States was looking to Asia for export growth, Asia began looking to the United States to consume its cars and electronics, now 50 percent cheaper than they were early in 1997.
Whether American investors can maintain their optimism through a prolonged Asian downturn has as much to do with market psychology as with the monthly tally of American exports. How else to explain that terrifying plunge in the American markets in October when Hong Kong stocks collapsed and investors convinced themselves that the trouble was headed here? Or the equally inexplicable recovery of the American markets for the rest of the year, despite the subsequent meltdown of South Korea, the world's 11th-largest economy and one of America's biggest trading partners?
With the exception of the Hong Kong scare, the market psychology of the Asian crisis has been chiefly of the it-couldn't-happen-here variety. Time after time, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has offered up for the cameras his reassuring patter about the "solid fundamentals" of the American economy -- low unemployment, factories working at near capacity, no imminent threat of inflation. In fact, his aides say that a flood of inexpensive Asian imports already beginning to show up on American store shelves is helping keep inflation in check. And so far, those imports have threatened virtually no American jobs.
Mr. Rubin has plenty of logic to back up his public optimism: The United States does not suffer from many of the maladies that led to the Asian meltdown. Americans have not been building office towers that no one is occupying, for example, or adding the capacity to make 10 times the number of cars that the local markets can absorb.
Still, Mr. Rubin has been caught in the classic bind afflicting any finance minister: If he said publicly how concerned he was that American markets might suffer the same fate as Asia's, he might cause exactly the selloff he is trying to avoid. But if, as a former trader himself, he was not acutely concerned that the contagion could end up here, the Treasury Department would not have spent the last two months putting the Government on the financial equivalent of red alert, holding meetings in the White House situation room and flying officials around the world to try to recork the bottle.
This contrast of public confidence and the frenzied effort to contain the Asian crisis has given these prosperous times an acutely fragile feel. With the American markets still at dizzying heights, people might feel that anyway. But Asia has made possible any number of scenarios for a bursting of the balloon.
Robert A. Johnson, the former managing director at Soros Fund Management, wrote recently that "the Asian downturn and the sharp deflation of optimism have made the global pie smaller." Others point to the global manufacturing overcapacity and the very real possibility that American factories could get squeezed as Asian nations, taking advantage of their devalued currency, flood the world with cheaper exports.
Dour economic historians, who always seem to keep statistics from the 1920's at their fingertips, offer another explanation for why angst may be in order: From 1921 to 1929 American industrial production surged, car factories operated at record levels, and American technology ruled -- while much of the rest of the world was descending into currency devaluations and other forms of economic chaos. (Naturally the White House could not resist noting the good fundamentals then, either: Calvin Coolidge's last State-of-the-Union Message, in December 1928, took note of "the highest record of years of prosperity" in American history.)
These explanations all seem vaguely unsatisfying, though. Exports matter, but the markets have already discounted the diminished demand from Asia; market history matters, but more as a cautionary tale of how small disasters can become large ones rather than as a model ripe for replication. What sends markets over the edge is a nasty surprise, a set of circumstances that few could have anticipated. No one predicted a year ago that one Asian government after another would be forced, by their own missteps and the pressure exerted by currency speculators, to unhook their currencies from the dollar, after which everything else cascaded out of control.
Certainly, plenty of potential surprises could strike next. China is perhaps the biggest source of worry. So far it has been immune to the Asian contagion, chiefly because its currency is not fully convertible. But Shanghai is also full of empty office buildings, and the privatization of state-run industries will put enormous pressure on the Government to intervene in the markets, chiefly to prevent mass unemployment. An economic collapse that spun out of Beijing's control would be felt well beyond Asia.
Japan poses a threat of another kind. It has denied the depth of its economic and structural problems for so long that investors doubt each new Government promise to clean things up. If the Japanese stock market plunges further, it will sink many of the banks that today are barely holding on. And each step forward -- including a big commitment of public funds to shore up the financial sector -- is matched by a step backward. Just a few weeks ago, for example, the Japanese Finance Ministry said it would not press the banks to meet higher financial reserve standards that were to go into effect in the spring; the markets took that as another sign that problems were still being covered up. And the country's economic problems are finally taking a toll on Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, whose hold on power looks increasingly shaky because of the mismanagement of the economy.
And then there are the wild cards, like politics. In Indonesia, for instance, questions abound concerning the health of President Suharto and whether he will be chosen for a new term. Trouble could break out again between China and Taiwan. Or South Korea could back away from some of the commitments it made to the I.M.F.
In 1997, investors bet that despite the ill winds blowing from Asia, these things, or worse, would probably not happen. The fate of the United States markets in 1998 may depend on whether such thinking continues.

But in 1997, many American investors may have wished they had kept their money at home rather than in places like Hong Kong, right, where a stock trader reacted to the market's plunge in October. Ripples from the Asian crisis spread to markets like Rio de Janeiro, middle. The performance of the Tel Aviv stock exchange, bottom -- up close to 40 percent for the year -- followed the internatinal-fund salesman's pitch that investors willing to ride out turbulence can reap benefits overseas.

Chance of Surplus Has 2 Parties Salivating

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
It is a Congressional election year, so more talk than action can be expected in Washington. But when it comes to economic issues, there will be plenty to discuss, and the debate could help shape the nation's agenda for years to come.
In Congress and on the campaign trail, Republicans and Democrats will be wrangling over tax cuts and the very nature of the tax system. The impending retirement years of the baby-boom generation are giving increasing urgency to efforts to deal with the looming financial problems of the Social Security and Medicare programs. In addition, Republicans are eager to give new momentum to their deregulatory efforts, perhaps by trying to loosen controls on the electric power industry. 
 And most of all, with the Federal budget moving into balance and maybe into surplus, members of both parties will be grabbing for a slice of what would be the first excess pool of Federal money to confront lawmakers since 1969.
"The central issue is the real possibility of a budget surplus and what we should do with it," said Stan Collender, a Federal budget analyst at Burson-Marsteller in Washington, citing estimates of a surplus this year that could amount to tens of billions of dollars.
The year is also certain to feature impassioned debate over the ways in which the United States should engage economically with the rest of the world. President Clinton has promised to try again to win trade-negotiating authority from Congress so that he can proceed with deals to open markets around the world. Late last year, liberal Democrats and their supporters in organized labor blocked his request -- which would have renewed his authority to reach deals that Congress can either approve or reject but not amend.
With financial turmoil plaguing Asia and threatening to spill into other regions, internationalists in both parties face a fight to convince Congress that the United States should increase its role in international bailout packages. And the Administration will face a difficult fight in Congress to overcome intense industry opposition to the proposed global treaty limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
Here is a guide to some key economic issues on Washington's plate:
 
BUDGET The Federal budget deficit last year fell to $22.6 billion, its lowest level since 1970 and $100 billion lower than Congressional and Administration analysts had expected at the beginning of the year. Officially, both Congress and the White House are still projecting a deficit for the fiscal year that will end in September, but they say privately that the deficit might be eliminated, four years ahead of the schedule laid out in the balanced budget agreement reached by the Republican leadership and Mr. Clinton last year.
The good news is a result of the economy, which continues to grow and generate tax revenues at a rate higher than Government economists predicted. But no one in Washington is waiting for a final tally to lay claim to any surplus.
Representative Bud Shuster, the Republican from Pennsylvania who is chairman of the House Transportation Committee, wants to spend more on highways. Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, wants to increase spending on the Pentagon and on science. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is urging Congress and the White House to start paying down the national debt.
Several contingents of Republicans want any surplus allocated to tax cuts. Democratic leaders want more spending on health and education. The White House has not signaled its priorities yet, should a surplus materialize; with Mr. Clinton eager to claim as his legacy a nation restored to fiscal health, the Administration's main message has been not to spend money that may never appear.
 
ENTITLEMENT REFORM Last year's budget deal extended the solvency of the Medicare health insurance program for the elderly by a few years, but it did little to address the long-term problems of either Medicare or Social Security. As the day draws nearer when both programs are expected to begin to face a financial crunch, Washington is reluctantly beginning to grapple with the politically painful choices necessary to make certain that the programs can meet the needs of the baby boomers as they start retiring in earnest a dozen years from now.
Among the most critical issues are whether to invest some of Social Security's money in the stock market and whether to move eventually to a system under which individuals would take full or partial control of their Government-sponsored retirement plan. Nothing is likely to be resolved this year. Given the stakes involved, though, the debate is sure to be lively, and Wall Street will have an important voice.
 
TRADE The Administration won a substantial trade victory last month with an agreement under which many nations will open their markets further to American banks, securities firms and insurance companies. The White House challenge now is to win from a skeptical Congress the right to negotiate further trade deals.
Mr. Clinton's own party blocked his request for the new "fast track" negotiating authority in November, arguing that the United States should open its markets only to countries that do not exploit their workers and their environment to win a competitive advantage over American workers and companies. But Mr. Clinton has vowed to try for the authority again soon. One possible compromise would allow further negotiations to open up markets in specific categories of goods and services but would limit the President's ability to agree to broad trade deals with particular nations, such as the one Mr. Clinton had hoped to negotiate with Chile.
 
TAXES Republicans believe that no issue resonates with voters like taxes, and they plan to make the most of it. The size and composition of the package of tax cuts they will seek have not been determined. Some Republicans are looking at specific proposals like a plan to remove the so-called marriage penalty, under which couples filing jointly pay more in taxes than they would if they were not married. But such a move could be prohibitively expensive.
President Clinton may propose his own package of cuts aimed at specific groups. But much of the political debate in 1998 will be centered on the broader questions of whether the current progressive income tax system could be replaced by a simpler system; that, Democrats note, would almost certainly entail shifting some of the burden away from the wealthy and onto the middle class.

As U.S. Toasts the Good Times, Optimism Does Not Go Unchecked

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
SO far, the Asian financial crisis has hit the Boeing Company with all the force of a wispy feather. An Indonesian airline delayed delivery of three planes for less than a week, and some Asian airlines have talked about giving up options to buy new jets. But not one actual order has been canceled, and the Boeing assembly lines are straining to keep up with demand.
Behind that picture of good fortune, however, is a disquieting fear. Nearly one-third of Boeing's backlog of orders are from Asian airlines. If they began to cancel, Boeing would be in trouble. 
 The United States economy, like so many of its premier companies, is in a similar position. There is plenty to celebrate, but the boom is precarious. The odds are that the economic expansion that began in 1991 will last at least another year, becoming, by December, the second-longest period of uninterrupted growth in half a century, trailing only the 1960's. All 52 forecasters surveyed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators expect 1998 to be another year of growth. But that does not rule out the possibility of trouble.
The Asian crisis has raised the most alarms, but there are other, sometimes related, threats -- a consumer debt crisis, a sharp decline in stock prices, a punishing trade deficit. Unemployment could rise if corporate profits shrank, bringing fresh cost-cutting and layoffs. Some experts even raise the specter of deflation, which could pull down incomes as well as prices, leaving many Americans without enough money to pay off their debts.
All this sounds unduly pessimistic today, as the good times continue to roll. But scary images are woven prominently into the forecasts. Even the optimists struggle with them.
"People are talking of the domino effect: If Korea and Japan are down, who are we in America to think that our economy can grow, anyway?" said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. "I hear that line all the time, and I totally reject it. Over the last two years, the United States economy has defied seers of an imminent slowdown, and it will again in 1998."
The Asian currency devaluations and stock market selloffs, the bankruptcies, bank failures and collapsing consumer demand in that part of the world have shifted attention from the United States economy's strengths to its vulnerabilities.
Boeing production would be hurt if the downturn were to spread to China, Singapore and Taiwan, said Lawrence W. Clarkson, a senior vice president. Quite apart from Boeing, a spreading Asian crisis could frighten Americans enough that they would stop spending, or sell their stocks, or do both. So far, neither has happened, although people have been hearing every day about what the Asian trouble could do to them. The economy's strengths have prevailed.
The gross domestic product grew by nearly 4 percent last year because of bursts of consumer spending, mostly on credit, and big outlays by business for new equipment. This rapidly expanding output of goods and services helped to push corporate profits to their highest levels since the 1960's.
The strong profits, in turn, played a big role in driving up stock prices, adding to the wealth of tens of millions of American shareholders and encouraging them to spend. Ample work also gave people more money and encouragement to spend. The work force grew by almost three million jobs, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest levels in years, and weekly wages rose slightly faster than the inflation rate for a majority of workers.
"For the first time in years, there have been real, broad-based wage gains," said Lawrence Mishel, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Of course, the wage gains, adjusted for inflation, do not get typical workers back to what workers earned in the 1970's and 1980's. But spirits are lifted anyway.
"Consumers judge small income gains more favorably than they did in the past," said Richard Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Center. "Their expectations have fallen. They expect their living standards to improve, but only in modest increments."
The increments have indeed been modest. Wages have been gaining ground not so much because of big raises, but in large part because inflation has been so low -- less than 2 percent over the last 12 months.
The persistently low inflation rate has inhibited the Federal Reserve from slowing the economy, a step that would halt, in the process, the gains in wages and jobs.
"Lots of things can happen to the American economy in 1998," said David Collander, an economist at Middlebury College, "but the most likely thing is that it will keep on growing as long as inflation does not accelerate and the Fed does not step in."
In the Fed's eyes, a strong economy normally produces shortages. With demand rising, there are not enough goods and services to go around. So businesses, in effect, ration what they have by raising prices. Or they raise prices to pay for wage increases. Either way, the inflation rate rises or seems about to do so. And the Fed, in response, slows the economy by raising interest rates to discourage spending and investment. Often in the past, the Fed has raised rates too much and recessions have developed.
This time, however, the pricing pattern is broken. Prices have not risen, even as wages have. Despite strong demand, goods and services are plentiful, not scarce. The Asian crisis plays a role here. With consumers in Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan buying less, those countries are exporting more of their merchandise to the United States, at ever lower costs in dollars, because their currencies are falling in value.
The rising supply of Asian goods comes at a time when United States companies have stepped up production capacity at home. The machinery and floor space used in domestic production have grown over the last two years at an annual rate of more than 5 percent, new Government figures indicate. That is nearly double the growth rate in the early 1990's.
The issue of the year, then, is oversupply. In a number of industries -- autos, toys, paper, plastics, textiles, electronics -- production outstrips demand. The problem is how to get people to buy up all that is out there, not to spend less. And the Fed, partly in recognition, has left interest rates untouched for nearly a year.
"The global economy desperately needs all the yuppies it can muster," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the Wall Street firm.
If they don't meet the challenge, the oversupply will push down prices, which may be a boon to consumers initially. But deflation means more than just falling prices. The price declines squeeze profits. Companies cut back through layoffs and less investment. Unemployment rises, the economy slows, and wages lose ground.
The real deflationary damage kicks in if the value of homes, cars, stockholdings and other property bought on credit drops so much that it is worth less than the debt still owed. With incomes weakening, people fall behind on their debt payments. Defaults rise -- they are frequent even now -- and the property, often held as collateral, loses more value. Banks, credit card companies and other lenders are hurt. There is less lending, and the crisis deepens.
Low interest rates help to avoid all this by bringing out the yuppies. Some rates have fallen even without action by the Fed. The 30-year home mortgage, for example, has dropped to around 7 percent, down more than a percentage point in the past year. The lower rate has stimulated not only home sales and construction but also demand for appliances, carpeting, furniture and many other home furnishings. The housing industry and its satellite suppliers account for nearly 10 percent of the nation's economic activity.
The lower mortgage rate means that the payment on a 30-year, $130,000 loan, the average home loan, has fallen by roughly $100, to less than $900 a month. Forty percent of all mortgage applications lately are from home owners who are refinancing existing mortgages to lower their monthly payments and thus free up cash for other purposes.
"We are in a mini-refinancing boom, and that is definitely a kick for the economy," said David Lereah, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. "But if mortgage rates stay where they are, the refinancings and the housing activity will begin to decline in a couple of months as we run out of people willing to take advantage of a 7 percent mortgage."
Like many forecasters, Mr. Lereah expects the nation's economic growth rate to decline in 1998 to 2.5 percent, from nearly 4 percent last year. That would still be above the average annual rate during this recovery, which was weak until the surge in growth over the last 18 months. And 2.5 percent would still be enough, the forecasters argue, to keep the unemployment rate low and wages rising by a bit more than the inflation rate.
Their outlook assumes that the economy's strengths, not its weaknesses, will prevail. But the weaknesses are noteworthy, too.
Perhaps the most alarming is household debt, built up through credit cards, personal loans, mortgages and other borrowing. Household debt has risen to record levels today as a percentage of the personal income available to repay the debt. Measured this way, the debt load is nearly one-third greater than it ever was in the 1960's, 1970's or the early 1980's.
That makes repayment a problem, and personal bankruptcies are at a record level. So are credit card defaults. But the greater danger, some economists say, is that the debt might stop rising. The rate of growth in household debt is already beginning to slow as households cut back their borrowing. As they do so, the economy is deprived of a stimulus that contributed so much to the strong recent economic growth.
Debt has been a source of growth for years. Government borrowing in the 70's and 80's, evident in the rising national budget deficit, provided the main stimulus in that era, says Wynne Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy Institute. Then, as the Government deficit leveled off and shrank, rising household borrowing took over the task of stimulating the economy. "Now if private credit stops rising, too," Mr. Godley said, "the motor is taken away from the expansion."
Nothing in economics happens in isolation. One dynamic feeds on another. When consumers cut back on borrowing, spending slows, production declines, job creation slows, unemployment rises, and the economy weakens.
This downward slide is already mildly evident, some economists argue. If so, the Asian crisis will reinforce it. Sales by United States companies to Asian buyers are already shrinking. And rising imports from Asia, at fire sale prices as their currencies weaken, will chip away at the demand at home for American-made goods. In the struggle to sell, companies forgo price increases or cut prices, and corporate profits decline, pulling down stock prices in the process. Soon, millions of shareholders find a part of their wealth gone, and they pull back again on borrowing and spending.
That prospect focuses a lot of attention on prices. "The dominant economic issue this year will be pricing -- the difficulty in raising prices -- and what that will do to profits," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company.
Asia's role in this process shows up, for example, at Varian Associates, a California-based manufacturer of medical instruments and equipment for making semiconductors. Varian reports that while sales in Asia have slowed sharply, a rise in orders in the United States and Europe, particularly the United States, has more than offset the Asian drag, and Varian's overall revenue is up -- for the time being.
"Fortunately, the International Monetary Fund has stepped into Asia with its bailout programs," J. Tracy O'Rourke, Varian's chairman, said hopefully. "Those programs usually work."
For now, his optimism still reflects the view of most forecasters -- but by no means all. "Something will go wrong for the American economy," said Albert M. Wojnilower, an economist at the Clipper Group, a Wall Street firm, "but it is too soon yet."

Fed Awaiting Clear Signs At Crossroads

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
Case 1: The economy continues to expand briskly this year. The unemployment rate remains low, and employers have to raise wages to attract the workers they need to keep up with demand. To maintain profit margins, companies start pushing prices higher, and before long inflation again becomes a threat to destabilize a business expansion that is nearly seven years old.
Case 2: Asia's economic woes continue. Manufacturers in countries like Thailand and South Korea flood the market with goods made cheap by their devalued currencies. Jolted by competition from abroad, United States manufacturers cut prices. Financial markets tumble, and the economy grinds to a halt. Soon the big threat is from a decline in the general price level -- deflation -- a phenomenon the United States has not experienced since the 1930's. 
 What's a Federal Reserve chairman to do? Faced with such divergent possibilities, Alan Greenspan, who has led the Fed for more than 10 years, has chosen to sit tight for now, keeping interest rates steady through the turmoil of the last several months. And while Mr. Greenspan generally has been extremely vigilant about the possibility of inflation, lately he has been talking more about the possibility of deflation.
The complexity of the situation has made predicting Fed policy even more treacherous than usual. Economists are increasingly divided over whether the next move in interest rates should be up, to choke off inflation, or down, to head off a slowdown in growth and avert any risk of deflation.
"Expect Fed thinking to evolve further in coming months," said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch, who has been sounding an alarm about deflation. "If U.S. growth slows in early 1998 and further signs of deflation emerge, as we expect, we believe that the Fed will eventually decide to ease monetary policy."
But others think Asia's problems will not dampen economic activity here enough to eliminate the inflation threat.
"The U.S. economy has significant momentum, and its labor markets are very tight," Goldman, Sachs & Company told its clients in a recent report. "Thus, both short- and long-term rates still appear poised to head higher, even though the magnitude of the rise in 1998 is likely to be more muted than we previously had anticipated."
Mr. Greenspan proved willing in 1997 to keep the Fed on the sidelines -- its only change in interest rates came in March, a quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate -- despite a sharp drop in unemployment and robust economic growth rates. Indeed, Mr. Greenspan all but repudiated the traditional framework economists use to judge the risks of inflation, acknowledging the argument that the economy is changing so rapidly that policy makers can no longer rely on some of the old rules.
The Fed's new pragmatic approach is likely to be on full display this year. Mr. Greenspan continues to dominate policy-setting sessions and has been challenged only occasionally by the hard-line inflation fighters within the Fed system.
Even those who continue to believe that low unemployment combined with strong growth will inexorably lead to inflationary pressures -- Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, is foremost among them -- have been content to wait for more early warning signs of inflation. And pressure from outside the Fed not to raise rates has grown steadily, with politicians, manufacturers and many economists saying the central bank should give the economy freer rein to grow.

Progress on Health Costs, But Nagging Woes Persist

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Five years after the Harry and Louise television commercials helped kill the Clinton Administration plan for Government-nurtured managed competition in health care, competition is thriving in the marketplace. But the buyers and the sellers are still struggling to find a way to manage the health care monster in a way that assures both high quality and affordable costs.
Costs are headed up again, after a two-year hiatus, though the increases are far from the double-digit spurts that helped push health care to the top of the national political agenda in 1993. 
 The health care economy has undergone sweeping changes since then. But the system is so big -- health spending accounts for one-seventh of gross domestic product -- and is so varied that even experts who have studied it for decades are cautious about making predictions.
"I don't think anyone knows where we are going," said Marilyn Moon, a health economist at the Urban Institute in Washington. "This is a wacky period in health care."
Most Americans now are members of managed health plans, often for-profit health maintenance organizations that try to keep profits growing to please Wall Street. But the growth of managed care has not reduced costs enough to encompass millions of people who feel that they cannot afford insurance.
Even with the booming economy, the number of uninsured Americans, who are largely children of low-income parents, rose to 41 million last year from 37 million in 1993.
"More people are uninsured, and even those who have insurance often don't have access to high-quality care," said Dr. John M. Eisenberg, the administrator of the Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. For instance, H.M.O.'s in some regions do not send heart bypass patients to hospitals with the best success records in heart surgery, suggests a recent study of Florida health plans that was published in Health Affairs, a scholarly journal.
Employers, especially those who own small businesses, have shifted a greater share of health costs to employees, who often think that they cannot afford to join the company health plans on those terms.
As Jon Gabel, director of health care surveys for KPMG Peat Marwick, a benefits consulting firm, put it, "The more health insurance premiums go up, the more they are passed on to employees, who will be asked to contribute even more in the next couple of years."
People without insurance often end up in hard-pressed public hospitals, which have been hurt by state and Federal budget cutting. "People are schlepping along, not really addressing this," said Dr. Ron Anderson, chief executive of Parkland Hospital in Dallas. "We've had a real squeeze on revenue, but demand on public hospitals hasn't gone down."
The health plans typically try to hold down costs by putting pressure on doctors and hospitals for reduced fees, in many cases offering them financial incentives to restrain the volume of tests, admissions to hospitals and referrals to specialists. Some plans also encourage members to have mammograms and other tests, get children vaccinated and take other steps to stay healthy and keep medical costs low.
With help from such measures and from the slowdown in overall inflation, some of the biggest employers, including General Motors, have kept their enormous health care budgets flat or close to it over the last few years. It has also helped such employers that the managed care companies have been eagerly cutting prices to gain market share, although this has hurt the care companies' earnings.
G.M. spends $3.5 billion annually for health care for active and retired workers and incurs an additional $1.5 billion accounting expense against earnings as a required cushion for future retirees.
Like many other big companies, G.M. rates its plans on factors like cost and quality and summarizes the results for employees. "We encouraged our people to take the high-quality plans by charging them less," said Jim Cubbin, executive director of health care initiatives at General Motors. "We are testing the concept that quality in health care will translate to lower cost."
Health care economists say the years of pressure on doctors and hospitals have had positive results, giving them a growing appreciation of the virtues of cost restraints. But the doctors have also fought back, sometimes joining with patients in well-publicized complaints of denials of care.
In response to such complaints, H.M.O.'s, the states and Congress have passed hundreds of measures outlawing unpopular restrictions like one-day limits on hospital maternity care. James Bentley, a senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said, "The market has been working, and Congress is picking gaps in the system, issues that it can build a consensus around."
But spokesmen for the managed care industry and outside experts agree that these laws will add to costs.
On the political front, the ultimate question is whether middle-class fears of losing health coverage will return, said Stuart H. Altman, a Brandeis University professor who is chairman of a council studying changes in the health system for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Such worries, during an era of corporate layoffs, fueled the debate five years ago over whether the Government should take charge of the nation's health care system.
"Average middle-class people no longer are subject to these kinds of fears," said Robert D. Reischauer, a Brookings Institution economist and former director of the Congressional Budget Office. Instead, he said, the "steady erosion in employer-sponsored health insurance coverage is a very slow process" that has not attracted much attention.
But for the doctors, hospitals and insurers, there has been no getting around the big changes of the last few years.
Paul B. Ginsburg, an economist who is president of the Center for Health System Change, a research group in Washington, said demands by consumers for access to more doctors had changed the way health plans try to keep control of costs. The health plans often no longer rely on exclusive relationships with a limited number of care providers, he said.
"One result is greater use of financial incentives" to keep costs down, Mr. Ginsburg added. Another is a "trend of transferring responsibilities for care management to provider organizations, along with the financial risks and responsibilities."
Doctors' incomes turned up again in the last few years, after a dip in 1994. The increase, after accounting for inflation, has been modest, less than 1 percent a year, according to the American Medical Association. The medical schools are still turning out doctors at twice the rate of growth in the overall population.
Hospitals are still operating at 60 percent of capacity, but many of the unused beds are "mothballed," adding little to costs, so most hospitals have been able to generate profits or, in the case of nonprofit hospitals, surpluses.
As for the H.M.O.'s, "their job is getting more difficult," said Mr. Altman of Brandeis. "They have to push harder on one side, against doctors and hospitals. On the other side, buyers are more demanding; they want higher quality, lower prices, greater access and more choice of doctors and hospitals."
The stocks of many H.M.O. companies have suffered as they have reported disappointing profits, exacerbated in some cases by problems with the companies' information systems.
"In the early days, the H.M.O.'s extracted fairly substantial profits," Mr. Altman said. "Those days are over."

What's New at the Store

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY

 BODY:
Like consumers who vow each year to snuff out a smoking habit or to make fewer trips to the refrigerator, manufacturers of everything from cars to computer software have lofty goals for new products in 1998. Some items are truly innovative while others may be just silly enough to work.
Pepsi has a new can. Volkswagen is bringing back the Beetle. Microsoft is updating Windows, and men's and women's fashion apparel is expected to lean to the classic. What is more, many consumers will get their first look at high-definition television sets and their first taste of fat-free snacks made with olestra, the fat substitute from Procter & Gamble. 
 Obviously, manufacturers are hoping to cash in on the upbeat economy and high level of consumer confidence. "If your market research comes back and says people have disposable income, then clearly you are more motivated to put more new products on the market or reposition old products," said Milton Rosenau Jr., president of the Product Development and Management Association, a trade group.
Toy makers and retailers are doing a bit of both as they count on the next generation of virtual pets -- those egg-shaped, computerized toys on a key chain that "die" if not properly fed and cared for -- to pull in shoppers. The latest virtual pets combine elements of another product that has been hot for more than a year: stuffed animals.
Stuffed animals have been helped by the popularity of the likes of Tickle Me Elmo, Beanie Babies and Sing and Snore Ernie. And virtual pets are all the rage with youngsters, so much so that many parents cannot get their children to put them down long enough to do their homework. But warm and fuzzy they are not.
So, toy makers hope that by combining stuffed animals with the technology that makes pets like Tamagotchi from the Bandai Company so appealing, they will create an even bigger frenzy for cuddly cyber- creatures. This spring, Oddzon Inc. will introduce e.Baby, an electronic stuffed baby bear with an expressive computer-like face. The toy, which will sell at retail for $19.99, talks, kisses, giggles and burps and makes more than 100 other sounds and phrases. The bear might pout, for instance, and say, "My tummy hurts," until the "parent" responds.
As for grown-ups, Volkswagen is counting on a hit with a car that could play well to consumers' nostalgia. The German auto maker is revising the Beetle and introducing it this spring, 21 years after the original version was phased out in the United States.
Though the Beetle has been updated for the 1990's, it has a retro feel and resembles the familiar Bug that many baby boomers drove to proms and college campuses years ago.
"We have created a 21st-century design that evokes that feeling people had for the original," said Tony Fouladpour, a spokesman for Volkswagen of America in Auburn Hills, Mich. "What we want to do is give people the sensation of driving into the future, not into the past."
Indeed, under the sheet metal, this car is nothing like your father's Bug. That extends to the price, which the company says will be in the range of $15,000 to $16,000, compared with the $3,600 it took to drive away with one the last year the company sold the original model in the United States. Some features of the new Beetle, like airbags and anti-lock brakes, were unheard of in the first generation and reflect new technology in the auto industry. One of the biggest differences, though, is the placement of the engine. Remember the rear-end engine and front-end cargo compartment? The motor for this one is under the front hood. VW will provide the first peek at the new car -- previously only the concept version was shown -- this week at the Detroit auto show.
Speaking of updated technology, Microsoft is expected to introduce Windows 98, the new version of its dominant computer operating system software. No date has been set, however, and the company -- following its recent pattern -- has already delayed the planned introduction.
Microsoft now says the release will occur in the second quarter of this year, but a judge's preliminary ruling in December that the company must allow computer companies to separate Microsoft's Internet browser software from its operating system software could cause further delay. The software had been expected to integrate Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, more closely into Windows.
As for consumer electronics, the big news this year is the expected sale of the first high-definition television sets, or HDTV, which are scheduled to be in some stores by the summer.
The Government's decision last year to begin the transmission of the next generation of television, the nation's first broadcast-television standard update in more than 40 years, will eventually render obsolete all 240 million sets now in use around the country.
Because the new sets will encompass the digital technology used in computers, they will open up the possibility of more interactive services. They will also offer a far sharper picture than can be received today and will include "surround-sound" systems.
"It will be like having a movie theater in your home," said Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing Association.
The sets will not be cheap, though. Prices are expected to start at nearly $3,000, though industry experts expect them to drop quickly. And consumers will have several years to replace the televisions they currently own before conventional analog broadcasting ends.
As for those trips to the kitchen during commercial breaks, several food companies are rolling out new or updated products and packaging.
Snackers watching their waistlines will be able to nibble on olestra products when chips containing the ingredient, to be marketed under the name Olean, are rolled out nationally this summer. The products include Procter & Gamble's Pringles potato chips, Frito-Lay's Wow chips and Nabisco's Fat Free Wheat Thins and Fat Free Ritz Crackers, although Nabisco has not yet decided whether it will sell its snacks nationwide. All of the products are on store shelves in Indianapolis, a favorite test market for many companies.
While olestra promises the taste of real munchies without the fat and with half the calories, it can cause gastrointestinal distress, which prompted the Food and Drug Administration to require a warning label on every box and bag of snacks containing it. It reads: "Olestra may cause abdominal cramping and loose stools" -- not great from a marketing standpoint. Procter, which gained F.D.A. approval in 1996 to use olestra in salty snacks, says that only about 2 percent of people who consume it experience digestive upset, which the company says is the same proportion of people who experience problems from eating raw vegetables or high-fiber foods.
But the harshest critic of olestra, Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, has said that calls to his agency indicate a much higher percentage of people experiencing problems with olestra products.
For those who do decide to indulge in olestra products, they can wash them down with Pepsi that is now being sold in updated cans. The containers, which replaced the red, white and blue cans, are bright royal blue with the word Pepsi in white lettering on the side. The packaging is the company's first American redesign since 1991. It coincides with Pepsico's 1998 advertising campaign and is intended to highlight blue as the theme color for the company's 100th anniversary this year and to play up the Pepsi globe logo.
Fast-food companies, meanwhile, also plan several new products. After two years of testing, Burger King recently introduced a french fry that it says will be crisper than other fried spuds. The goal is to steal as many fast-food lovers as possible from the chain with the golden arches.
Not to be outdone, McDonald's is taking a stab at an oval burger that it says is meatier than traditional patties and is refining its overall menu and will switch to a new kitchen production system in the second quarter of this year. The maker of the Big Mac has suffered from stiff competition, not just from other burger makers but also from chains like Boston Market that are popular with consumers looking for alternatives to fried foods and beef patties.
On the fashion front, look for classic clothes to continue to be big, whether on Fifth Avenue or Main Street.
"I think we've entered a period in which classics are the way retailers make money," said Alan Milstein, publisher of Fashion Network Report, a publication that caters to the garment trade. "Things that are too way out or froufrou are really passe because it involves too much risk."

GRAPHIC: Photos: New products for 1998 include cars, cuddly toys and cans. Volkswagen will introduce its retro Beetle (a concept version is pictured above and an actual car is being shown this week in Detroit); Pepsi is changing its packaging, and Oddzon Inc. will be bringing out e.Baby, an electronic stuffed bear with a computerlike face that can frown or smile.

For a Change, Detroit May Feel Sticker Shock

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
The nation's auto makers and car dealers will probably find themselves working harder this year just to sell the same number of cars and trucks that they sold last year. For shoppers, that could mean lower prices.
Why? Partly because trends in the global economy have filtered back to car dealers on Main Street. The weak Japanese yen has made it painless for Toyota and Honda to lower prices, and the Big Three American auto makers have been forced to try to follow suit. Because auto makers around the world continue to build factories, there are more than enough cars to meet demand. And with economists predicting that the United States economy will slow slightly from last year, auto makers expect demand to ease a bit. 
 "The competition is clearly going to heat up," said Thomas T. Stallkamp, president of the Chrysler Corporation.
For the car makers, that could mean pressure to cut costs further if they are to maintain the profit growth of the last few years. Shoppers, however, may wind up with a rare bit of good fortune: some vehicles carry lower sticker prices than last year's models, and most come with offers of generous rebates or discounted financing or lease rates.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, predicts sales of 15 million cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, mini-vans and heavier trucks this year, about 300,000 fewer than last year.
Economists for the Big Three auto makers are somewhat more optimistic, because they do not expect the economy to deviate from its path of modest but steady growth. These economists predict that customers will buy 15 million to 15.5 million cars and trucks in the United States this year, as they have for the last four years. Last year, shoppers bought an estimated 15.4 million new vehicles -- final tallies will be released by Wednesday.
"There is no reason why the U.S. economy can't continue to grow at a steady pace" of 2.5 to 3 percent this year, said G. Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist for the General Motors Corporation. "There is no reason why consumers can't keep spending."
His counterpart at the Chrysler Corporation, W. Van Bussmann, said that the difference between his sales prediction last year and his prediction for this year is that last year, he expected sales closer to 15.5 million while this year he expects sales of about 15 million.
The Ford Motor Company's projection is also for healthy, if not spectacular, sales to continue. "It certainly can go on," said Martin B. Zimmerman, executive director of government relations and corporate economics at Ford.
Those sales will be driven in part by flat or lower prices. As recently as mid-1995, vehicle prices were rising faster than inflation. Since then, prices for new cars and trucks have increased more slowly than overall inflation. In the last two months, prices even began to decrease.
Of course, bargains can't be found on every new car or truck on dealers' lots. Though many cars, particularly small ones, are expected to be relative bargains this year, the outlook for truck prices is mixed. Mini-vans and medium-sized sport utility vehicles like the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee are likely to carry rebates and other discounts, but some of the largest and newest sport utility vehicles -- like the Lincoln Navigator and the Mercedes ML320 -- are selling at full sticker prices.
In part, the pressure on prices is caused by the strength of the dollar, which may help Japanese and European auto makers win market share from the Big Three this year.
Another factor in the expectation of flat or lower prices is simple supply and demand, which has been thrown off-kilter lately because the world's auto makers have been racing to build new factories, particularly in Asia and South America, where projections of further rapid growth now look highly questionable. "There is a lot of excess capacity in the industry, and there is a lot of capacity going in," Mr. Zimmerman said. "Our task is to make sure that the excess capacity is not ours."
To that end, auto makers have been cutting costs at the same time that they hold the line on prices, which has enabled them to continue earning strong profits. And though 1998 should be a good year for consumers, the expected decline in sales is not expected to be as large as some of the cyclical swings of the past.
Wall Street expects that earnings for G.M. and Chrysler will increase slightly this year compared with last year. Though analysts generally expect profits at Ford to edge down slightly from healthy levels last year, Ford's top executive has a slightly more optimistic view.
"If the industry can deliver another 15.5 million new cars and trucks, I think we can aspire to do as well in 1998 as in 1997," said Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman, president and chief executive.

Dollar's Gains Expected to Continue

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The collapse of Asian currencies against the dollar grabbed the headlines last year. But against other currencies, too, the dollar made remarkably powerful gains, and many analysts think the rise will continue.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose almost 13 percent. Against the German mark, it rose nearly 17 percent. More broadly, against 130 United States trading partners, the dollar rose strongly, too, after adjusting for the amount of trade this nation does with each country. 
 Some analysts think that the dollar will hit 140 yen at the end of 1998, up about 7 percent, and that it will reach 1.85 marks, which would be a jump of 3 percent. The Asian currencies that have plunged 30 percent to 40 percent are not likely to rebound sharply very soon.
Ravi Bulchandani, a currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter in London, says the dollar will continue to rally for several reasons. He expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to slow growth in the United States, and he believes that Europe will try to prevent any gain by the mark or other currencies because that would make its exports less competitive and hinder the economic rebound in Europe. He also feels, as do many strategists, that the plan to shift to a single European currency at the beginning of 1999 favors the dollar for the time being.
As for the yen, Karen E. Parker, the currency strategist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said that the sluggish Japanese economy, the expansion of opportunities this year for Japanese investors to buy securities abroad, the attractiveness of United States markets and the weakness of the Japanese financial system all pointed to a stronger dollar.
The stronger dollar is generally expected to cut into corporate earnings more than it has in recent years, but over all is bringing mixed blessings to United States companies, depending on where they do most of their business, where they manufacture their products and who their major competitors are.
"The dollar is something that will be another problem in a generally difficult environment," said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. He said the collapse of Asian economies and the ensuing decline in demand would have a significant effect on earnings for United States companies.
Mr. Steinberg estimates that 30 percent of corporate earnings in this country come from foreign sales. He is forecasting that these earnings will rise by 10 percent in 1998, half of last year's increase, while earnings from domestic sales will increase about 7 percent, down from 10 percent. Together, he says, the two will slow to an earnings growth rate of about 8 percent, down from 13 percent in 1997.
There are several ways in which the stronger dollar is expected to undercut earnings. First, it will make American exports more expensive and less competitive abroad. Second, when earnings from abroad -- whether from exports or from products made and sold abroad -- are translated back into dollars, a stronger dollar will reduce their value. And third, a stronger dollar will make goods from abroad cheaper in the United States. That means companies with foreign competitors, like the auto makers, will face pressure on prices at home, which could cut into earnings.
Some of these effects could be offset for companies that manufacture abroad -- especially in Asia -- because a stronger dollar will reduce the cost of overseas production.
Mr. Steinberg predicts that the effects could vary considerably by industry. At 43 percent, technology companies have the biggest share of overseas sales of any industry, and many of these companies have a high exposure in Asia. This means that the decline in buying from the region could have a major effect.
What sales and profits there are could be further reduced when translated back into stronger dollars if the company is not hedged against currency fluctuations.
While technology companies that price their products in dollars are hedged against this kind of translation loss, they are more vulnerable to sales declines from the increased cost in their products abroad as the value of the dollar rises. Other technology companies will face competition from products that are made in Asia and will now be cheaper when sold in the United States.
Ten percent of the products bought in the United States are produced in Asia, so competition from imports will also affect many other industries. Import prices over all are already down more than 2 percent in the last year, and prices of goods from Asia are off more than 4 percent and are expected to continue to fall this year.
But international exposure will not be all negative. While pharmaceutical companies, for example, depend heavily on foreign sales -- 36.5 percent of their total -- most of those sales are in Europe. This makes their prospects brighter, in part because many forecasters think that European growth will remain stable this year -- or even pick up a little -- while the United States slows down and the slump in Asia continues.
For investors, this is a reason not to lump companies into one large category, such as companies with large international exposures. For drug companies, and some consumer staples, the international exposure -- because it is concentrated in Europe -- could turn out to be a plus, not a minus.
At the other end of the spectrum are utilities and the communications sector, where international sales are less than 5 percent.
As for banking, while there have been reports of potential problems because of the exposure in Asia, only 12 percent of the sales of United States banks are from overseas, and that is concentrated among the money center banks. That means that investors in regional banks do not have much to worry about.

HEADLINE: Modern Refuses To Detain 2 Schieles

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Pleading legal restraints, the Museum of Modern Art has turned down appeals from two families to hold on to two Egon Schiele paintings whose provenance is clouded by Nazi wartime plundering, choosing instead to ship them as planned to their next destination in Barcelona, Spain.
But rather than laying the matter temporarily to rest, the Modern's response enraged the families and prompted them to step up their activities to reclaim the paintings with entreaties to the State Department and Government officials and possibly pleas in court. "We're going ahead with all guns flaring," said Rita Reif, an heir to one of the works. She said her family was seeking a meeting with the museum's director, Glenn D. Lowry. 
 The paintings were on view at the Modern as part of "Egon Schiele: The Leopold Collection," a hugely popular traveling exhibition that closed at the Modern yesterday. The works are owned by the Austrian-Government financed Leopold Foundation. It purchased them in 1994 from Dr. Rudolf Leopold, a 72-year-old Viennese ophthalmologist who amassed a collection of some 5,400 works of art, including 250 by Schiele, the Austrian Expressionist who died in 1918.
One painting in the show, "Portrait of Wally," is claimed by the family of Lea Bondi Jaray, a Jewish Viennese art dealer who was pressed by a Nazi art dealer to leave the work behind when she fled to London in 1938. The other, "Dead City," is claimed by Ms. Reif and her sister-in-law, the heirs of Fritz Grunbaum, a Jewish collector who died at Dachau in 1940. The families wanted the paintings kept in New York until their claims could be evaluated.
But the Modern demurred, citing its contractual obligations to return the paintings to the foundation. "The Museum is clearly not in a position to pass on the factual or legal foundation of your claim," said Stephen W. Clark, an assistant general counsel for the museum, in a letter faxed on Saturday night to Henry S. Bondi, the 76-year-old nephew of Mrs. Bondi. A virtually identical letter was faxed to Ms. Reif, a former reporter for The New York Times who now contributes a column to the newspaper.
Museum officials said they have had extensive discussions with their counterparts at the Leopold Foundation since the claims were lodged last week. "We explored all options with them," said Elizabeth Addison, the Modern's deputy director for marketing and communications. She declined to say whether the Modern had specifically asked to keep the paintings for the time being.
The Modern's letters nonetheless obliquely invited further action, most likely in the courts. "The museum intends to ship the painting to the lender on Jan. 8 or shortly thereafter," it said in closing. "The intervening period should afford you ample time to take such actions as you deem appropriate to protect your interests."
Neither family, however, seemed inclined to go to court now, partly because cultural properties on loan in New York are indemnified against seizure by state and Federal laws. "Going to court is a big decision," Mr. Bondi said.
The two families have other plans. They are asking Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, for help in getting the Leopold Foundation or the Austrian Government to post a bond for the value of the two paintings. The bond, held by a neutral third party, would insure that the paintings would be returned to the United States after their showing in Barcelona and pending an assessment of the families' claims.
The Reifs plan to present Mr. Lowry and the World Jewish Congress's Commission for Art Recovery with 14 documents supporting their claim of ownership. "The Museum of Modern Art is washing its hands of this matter based on a narrow, tight response to the situation," Ms. Reif said. "They are saying, 'Let the courts decide,' and that's not enough. The museum must make a moral determination on this."

HEADLINE: Jazz, Honors and Politics;
A New Museum Pays Tribute to Musicians but Stirs Criticism

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
To Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, the new Kansas City Jazz Museum, which opened in a historically important but long abandoned neighborhood here in September, is a symbol of optimism and hope. With a vivid, contemporary design and a collection centered on four jazz giants -- Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and Charlie Parker -- and a live jazz club included under its roof, it is the first major museum in the country devoted to jazz, intended to serve both as a monument to the music that flourished here in the 1920's, 30's and 40's and as a spur to redevelopment in the neighborhood that nurtured it.
"What this property has successfully done," Mayor Cleaver said in an interview, "is transcend the obstacles of race, geography and ethnicity. It is the kind of thing we need to replicate." 
 But to Eddie Baker, a local bandleader and a leading advocate for the recognition of jazz masters who calls the new museum an embarrassment, it represents nothing but a disappointment, not even a shadow of what it could have been. At a mere 10,000 square feet, Mr. Baker points out, it is too small. Besides, he says, its exhibits are too rudimentary, it excludes too many musicians, it is not interactive enough and it doesn't even have its own building, really. It shares the place with the Negro Baseball Hall of Fame.
"It's being run by politicians who don't even own a record player," Mr. Baker said. "It's evident jazz wasn't important to this Mayor or anybody else."
Mr. Baker, the president of the Charlie Parker Memorial Foundation, which provides music and dance classes for underprivileged children, is not alone in his dissatisfaction. At a time when cities all over the country are building arts centers to rejuvenate blighted neighborhoods, other people in jazz have also questioned whether museums should be built primarily to encourage economic activity.
Shouldn't the emphasis be placed on honoring and preserving artistic achievement? No one, not even Mr. Baker, thinks the new museum here is a bad thing. But it has aggravated the persistent wound felt by many jazz musicians, who say that theirs is an artistic contribution that has been too easily shunted aside and never adequately acknowledged.
Indeed, jazz, now about 100 years old, is among the signal contributions of 20th-century America to world culture. Yet there are few substantial music collections beyond those at the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University in Newark and the Marr Sound Archives at the University of Missouri at Kansas City, and until now there has been no real monument to the music and the musicians.
"We need all the help we can get, to say the least," said Max Roach, the legendary drummer, who was a consultant for the new museum and argued that this should be the first of many homes for jazz. "It's not supposed to have one home," he said. "Art Blakey used to say, 'Jazz is as American as apple pie.' We should have shrines all over the country."
Plans for such shrines have arisen before and continue to. Art D'Lugoff, for example, the former owner of the Village Gate, the Manhattan jazz club, is seeking financing for a complex on the Hudson River that would include a museum, a school, a store and a New Orleans-style cafe. The absence of any such center has long been a thorn in the side of jazz practitioners, particularly black musicians who regard their lack of recognition as a lingering reminder of racism.
 
Recognition Seen As Long Overdue
The sting has only been more acute since the opening of the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland in 1995, celebrating a younger and more widely popular musical form whose practitioners have, over all, included more whites than those of jazz.
"This is long overdue," said Leonard Brown, a saxophonist and professor of jazz history at Northeastern University in Boston, who was a consultant for the Kansas City museum. "It's wonderful to walk in there just to see finally that the contributions of some of those African-Americans are getting the recognition they deserve."
This debate is the source of Mr. Baker's objections to the new museum. Under his guidance, the Parker Foundation has long sought financial support to build a memorial to jazz music and musicians known as the International Jazz Hall of Fame. Since 1977, when Mr. Baker copyrighted the name, it has existed as an organization without an edifice, with a total of 75 inductees, having held its fourth induction ceremony in Tampa, Fla., in November. His dream has been to build, in Kansas City, an institution that would house not only a museum but also a jazz academy and a retirement community for jazz masters.
Indeed, all those elements were initially considered, but as the budget grew and the political squabbling over the project grew more vociferous, the plan shrank. "The city wanted to build a building and really wanted to capitalize on the entertainment we could bring to it," said Shakura A. Sabor, the executive director of the Jazz Hall of Fame. "That was the cart before the horse, as far as we were concerned. It should be of benefit to the artists first."
Supporters of the new Kansas City museum tend to dismiss Mr. Baker as embittered because he ended up with little or no influence in the development of the project. But over the years, Mr. Baker's own vision has had the active support of jazz legends like Dizzy Gillespie and Lionel Hampton. And, more pertinently, of Aaron A. Woodward 3d, the adopted son of Count Basie, the musician who, more than any other, was responsible for the style of jazz known as Kansas City swing.
Basie died in 1984, but the band is still active; it won its 16th Grammy Award last spring. Mr. Woodward is now its executive director, and in part because of his disappointment with the new museum, he has withheld permission for anything connected to Basie not in the public domain to be included in the exhibits.
As a result, there is a prominent hole at the center of the collection. "They had the opportunity to create the worldwide home of jazz," Mr. Woodward said. "I don't consider that to be a jazz museum. Why would you build something not comparable to the skill of those it was supposed to honor?"
There is no disputing that the museum as it exists is a result of political compromise. In 1989 the Kansas City Government, as part of a citywide redevelopment initiative known as the Cleaver plan, allotted $20 million to build a jazz museum at 18th and Vine Streets, the heart of the club district that produced not only Basie and Parker but other jazz greats like Jay McShann, Ben Webster and Benny Moten.
 
A Neighborhood Long Neglected
 But critics of the Mayor opposed the plan on the basis of its financing (a high-interest bond issue) and its location, a largely black area in the eastern part of the city that had long been in decline. Though Kansas City itself is in something of a boom time, having eclipsed St. Louis as the largest city in the state, the region east of Troost Avenue, which Mayor Cleaver described as "our Mason-Dixon line, unfortunately," remains somewhat neglected.
Indeed, though Sprint has opened an office across the street from the museum and Mayor Cleaver says 125 other businesses have applied for permits to open in the neighborhood, the immediate area is still empty enough that the museum itself has erected phony facades for the storefronts on the block. In addition, the film set used by Robert Altman for "Kansas City," his 1995 evocation of the neighborhood's jazz heyday, remains intact just around the corner, unlighted and undisturbed.
"I have long believed that until we are able to develop the east side, Kansas City could not boast of having its big inning," Mayor Cleaver said. By all accounts, the Mayor spent his political capital heavily to erect the museum on 18th and Vine, his determination symbolized in 1994 when he used $140,000 of public money to buy, at auction, the famous acrylic saxophone used by Charlie Parker, as a cornerstone of the museum's collection.
In the end, the Mayor prevailed, but much of the final budget, $26 million, ended up being used for the kinds of redevelopment amenities, like a visitors' center, that critics say detract from the artistic purpose of the museum.
Critics point out as well that an executive director, Rowena Stewart,was not hired until January 1996, when the Parker saxophone was still nearly the only artifact the museum owned, and that neither Ms. Stewart, a career museum administrator whose last post was as head of the Motown Historical Museum in Detroit, nor those who hastily assembled the museum's collection are musicologists.
Unfortunately, the saxophone turned out to be a hindrance to assembling the collection. Both Ms. Stewart and Lina Stephens, her assistant, who gathered most of the museum's 8,000 pieces, said collectors were loath to donate or lend memorabilia to an institution that they assumed, because of the notoriety of the saxophone purchase, had a great deal of money to spend. In reality, the collection budget, after that purchase, was only about $100,000.
The museum is small, to be sure, and its collection, assembled after the design was already complete, has a catch-as-catch-can feel to it. For example, Billie Holiday was initially chosen, by a panel of consulting musicians and scholars, as one of the four masters at the heart of the collection, but when memorabilia of Holiday's life proved difficult to collect, Ms. Stewart decided to replace her with Ella Fitzgerald.
Nonetheless, the museum includes a number of listening stations and an interactive exhibit that instructs neophytes on the fundamentals of jazz rhythms, orchestrations, improvisations and the like. In addition, the adjoining club, which features live performances by local musicians four nights a week, is adorned with memorabilia celebrating the tradition of jazz in Kansas City. And as part of the project, across the street, an old, once-segregated movie house, the Gem Theater, has been refurbished into a 500-seat performance hall.
"For its size and the materials they do have, they've done some remarkable stuff," Ms. Sabor of the hall of fame said. "But it just doesn't have the majesty of what the art form is about. It was too much of a compromise."
 
Making Promises, Seeking Support
 Ms. Stewart acknowledged that much of the criticism had merit; that in particular, having just four jazz masters is not enough -- there will be more, she promised -- and that "the place will not be complete until Count Basie is included." But she said she wished the critics would be patient and supportive; the growth of the museum depends on public support, she said, and on whether the neighborhood development plans are realized.
Some prominent local musicians have taken that attitude to heart, expressing the sentiment that the current museum is far better than no museum at all. Among these is Jay McShann, the pianist, now 82 (or so he said; according to "The Encyclopedia of Jazz," by Leonard Feather, he was born in 1909), who first came to Kansas City in 1937 and who played a concert at the museum on New year's Eve.
"If a guy does you a nice favor, all you can say is thank you," Mr. McShann said, referring to Mayor Cleaver. "Maybe things could've been done a little differently, but the fact is he got it done. Ain't nothing to do but go along with the scene, I guess."

Is Tokyo Ready, or Willing, to Take On a Broad Overhaul of Industries?

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
A decade from now, 1998 may be remembered as the Year of Reckoning for Japan.
The financial markets, empowered by the global movement of money, finally seem to have triumphed in their age-old battle with the Japanese bureaucracy and are moving much faster than the authorities to force bitter but much-needed medicine down the throat of the ailing Japanese economy. 
 "The financial markets have upped the ante, and the bureaucrats are being forced to bend to the pressure," said Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders Japan Ltd.
So it seems. In the closing weeks of last year, in an effort to regain credibility, the Japanese Government committed itself to spending more than 20 trillion yen, or about $150 billion, to establish safety nets for the debt-ridden financial system and the small- and mid-sized companies that can no longer get loans from it. The Government also moved forward with an economic stimulus plan worth nearly $40 billion.
In short, Japan did many of the things its critics, including the United States Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund, had been nagging it to do -- yet to little avail. Investors have remained skeptical, and private economists are stubbornly sticking to their prediction that gross domestic product will be flat this year or up only a few tenths of a percentage point.
So what can Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Government do? Experts now say that it must lead a broad reorganization of industry.
The Government spent the last seven years staving off the inevitable retrenchment that logically should have followed the collapse of the "bubble" economy. It shelled out 70 trillion yen, or more than $500 billion, for sometimes unnecessary bridges and tunnels and highways to keep employment chugging along. It kept interest rates at the lowest levels in the world and, since 1995, allowed the yen to fall against the dollar, which has made Japanese goods more competitive internationally.
"In any other country, if you depreciated the currency by almost 60 percent, allowed public-sector spending to go bananas and drove interest rates to rock bottom, you would expect the economy not just to recover but to explode," said Alexander Kinmont, a managing director at Morgan Stanley. "It hasn't, and the Government can now do very little. You basically have to restructure corporate Japan."
Reorganization is painful in any country. In the United States, which bit this bullet several years ago, there were plenty of reports about laid-off engineers working at Wal-Mart and headlines about endless rounds of job cuts at major corporations as companies wielded hatchets to cut costs. Now Europe is going through some of the same trauma, creating some hope that it, too, will soon enter a period of economic prosperity like the one the United States has recently enjoyed.
But the notion of widespread, wrenching dislocation is still unthinkable to most Japanese people. When the Yamaichi Securities Company collapsed in November, its president wept in front of television cameras as he spoke of the 7,500 workers who would be out on the streets.
In the United States, a 3.5 percent unemployment rate would be greeted with cheers. In Japan, it is cause for consternation, as it is the highest level since 1953, when the Government started compiling statistics.
Jesper Koll, head of economic research at J. P. Morgan in Tokyo, estimates that 10 percent of the workers in the securities industry alone lost their jobs in 1997, thanks to failures like that of Yamaichi.
Some private economists expect the overall unemployment rate to increase to at least 4.5 percent in 1998, as the credit crunch, brought on by banks struggling to bring their capital ratios up to international standards, tips more companies into bankruptcy and forces more mergers. The banks recently won a reprieve when the Government said it would not immediately press them to meet the higher standards, but the "big bang" deregulation of the financial services industry, which is expected to create more competition and greater openness for foreign firms, is still expected to get under way in earnest this year.
"What's good for Japan long-term would almost certainly lead to painful short-term restructuring like we saw in the United States," said Mr. Shipley of Schroders Japan. "The longer they wait, the more painful it's going to be."

Signs of Recovery, but the Hard-Hit Brace for 'Ugly' Year

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand

 BODY:
In a new ritual of Thailand's hard times, people who call themselves the "formerly rich" have been gathering every weekend in a carnival atmosphere to sell their status symbols: expensive cars, designer clothing, thousand-dollar watches, even a light airplane.
One week, a former employee of a closed finance company hung a "for sale" sign around his own neck, advertising his availability for work. 
 This curious spectacle, held in a parking garage in downtown Bangkok, may be an early sign of recovery: Thailand is emerging from a crippling stage of national denial.
In recent weeks, the other hardest-hit nations of Southeast Asia have also begun to grapple with the downturn that over the last six months ended a decade of sky-high growth.
Indonesia and Malaysia have taken their first sips of the bitter medicine of economic retrenchment, scaling back their growth plans, halting expensive building projects and announcing austerity measures.
That is the good news. The bad news, analysts say, is that recovery will take time, will cause both economic pain and social disruptions and will call for still-untested political will among the region's leaders.
This year "is going to be pretty ugly," said Stephen M. Taran, the managing director of Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong, voicing the nearly unanimous view of economic and political analysts. "They're dealing with a crushing burden of currency depreciation," he said. "They're looking at a much sharper deceleration of growth than was previously expected."
In a report last month, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Thailand -- perhaps the champion of Southeast Asia's decade of rapid growth and the epicenter of its crash -- could well slip into recession in 1998. Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines will also take years to recover their economic health, it said.
But by 1999, the report said, growth should begin to pick up, mainly as a result of these same drops in the value of their currencies, which will make their exports cheaper and more competitive. And, of course, many of the things that fueled Asia's economic boom in the first place -- well-educated and motivated work forces, for example -- remain in place, providing some optimism for the future.
But in the nearer term, there will be pain. In a separate report, the International Monetary Fund -- which has organized multibillion-dollar bailouts for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea -- cut its combined growth forecast for Southeast Asia to just 1.7 percent for 1998.
That figure marks a stunning fall for a region that over the last decade was the fastest-growing in the world, with an annual rate of close to 8 percent.
The boom transformed the lives of tens of millions of people, creating modern new city centers, fueling the growth of new industries and giving birth to an affluent and expanding middle class.
But it also fostered a proliferation of poorly run financial institutions, a rash of ill-conceived real estate and industrial ventures and a culture of corruption in which huge sums of money flowed like underground rivers among politicians and their friends.
"When economic conditions remain generally good and when private foreign capital is flowing at a record pace and on very attractive terms, it is easy to believe that the good times will continue," the I.M.F. said in its report.
In July, under intense pressure from currency traders, Thailand loosened controls on its currency, the baht, setting off a chain reaction of devaluations throughout the region.
"It's been quite shocking to see the situation deteriorate to the extent that it has," said Leslie Richardson, the managing director of the Asian Equities Division for SocGen-Crosby Securities in New York. "It has been one of those vicious cycles where doubts about the currency in one country lead to doubts in another country."
The fall of the dominoes has been all the more striking because of the sharp differences among the affected countries.
Thailand had benefited the most from foreign investment as Japan and other nations sought cheap labor for their industries. Thailand had also extended itself the most with foreign borrowing and easy credit, making it highly vulnerable when its bubble burst. It was also the nation with the weakest and least capable leadership, which allowed its problems to grow rapidly.
But this picture changed markedly last fall when a new Prime Minister, Chuan Leekpai, took office and undertook a tough economic reform program. One foreign businessman now calls himself "a guarded and perhaps naive optimist on Thailand" -- which is a great change from the tone of a few months earlier.
Malaysia, which at first set the standard for denial, now seems to have acknowledged its problems, paring down its growth forecasts and putting a hold on several building projects.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who at first blamed a colorful variety of foreign enemies for Malaysia's problems, has suddenly become his nation's chief cheerleader for austerity.
"If we are prepared to make sacrifices now, God willing, our nation's economy will recover within a short span of time," he said in December. "If we are to start accusing others, then we will have disagreements, and this will indirectly make us weak."
Economists say that with this attitude, his nation may be in a better position to recover than Thailand or Indonesia because Malaysia's banks are mostly healthy and its businesses and financial institutions never accumulated the huge foreign debts of these neighbors.
Indonesia impressed analysts by its quick move in October to call for help from the I.M.F., which stepped in to provide the major part of a $40 billion international aid package.
But there are serious questions about the firmness of Indonesia's commitment to deep-running reforms that would necessarily cut into the holdings of the family and friends of President Suharto.
Indonesian recovery is also the most dependent on political factors. New concerns have arisen about the health of the country's long-serving President, just a few months before he is to be endorsed by Parliament for a seventh five-year term.
The Philippines, which never quite managed to join in on the region's boom, has remained comparatively isolated from the region's crash.
Its currency and stock markets have slumped, but to a lesser degree than those of its neighbors, and its more modest growth has slowed. Analysts say the country, which suffered for decades under the label "sick man of Asia," could be one of the first to recover from the region's ailments.

Graphs: "The Pacific Rim By the Numbers"
A decade of economic boom imploded in Asia in 1997 under the weight of currency devaluations, stock market plunges and business failures. Growth slowed sharply, and considerably more short-term pain is expected. Still, if there is hope for the future, it stems from the fact that much of what fueled the tiger economies of Asia in the first place -- well-educated and motivated work forces and high savings rates, for example -- remains in place. Graphs show vital statitistics -- including population, illiteracy rate -- and economic indicators for Asian countries and the United States.

HEADLINE: Debate Starts Over Prospect of Budgets Without Deficits

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
With growing optimism that the Federal budget deficit can be eliminated within a year or two, the Clinton Administration and Congress are edging toward addressing the nation's longer-term fiscal problems, most notably the looming insolvency of the Social Security system.
White House officials said today that President Clinton wanted to put in place in two years a plan to shore up Social Security, which is otherwise expected to run out of money by about 2030, two decades after the baby-boom generation begins retiring in droves. 
 "The President is clearly sending out the message that passing long-term Social Security reform is something he wants to get done and that its best chances are to actually complete it within the next 18 to 20 months," Gene Sperling, the White House's economic-policy adviser, said in an interview.
Mr. Clinton and the Republican leaders in Congress are focusing increasingly, if tentatively, on other issues, like the soundness of Medicare. Medicare could also go broke within decades because more retirees are living longer and requiring increasingly expensive medical care.
Last week, administration officials floated the idea of allowing people between the ages of 62 and 65 to buy their way into the medicare system, in order to provide them coverage between their early retirement and the time they would normally become eligible. But today, the Republican chairmen of the House Budget and Ways and Means committees suggested that Congress was unlikely to go along.
"To add more people to this Medicare system would be a mistake, and I don't believe this will happen," Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said on NBC's Meet the Press.
Until now neither party has been eager to take on the woes of the Social Security program. But Mr. Clinton has made no secret of his desire to leave a strengthened pension and retirement system as one of his political legacies.
Aides said Mr. Clinton was studying a variety of policy proposals to address the problems in the retirement program, as well as strategies for how to deal with the immense political pressures that both Republicans and Democrats would face in tackling the issue.
Among the ideas under consideration at the White House is for Mr. Clinton to call Congress into special session to deal with Social Security after the midterm elections in November.
But Administration officials played down that possibility, which was first reported today by The Washington Post. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in an appearance on the CBS News program "Face the Nation" that a special session of Congress was not "necessarily a good idea," although other officials said it would be a serious option if there was bipartisan support for it on Capitol Hill.
Another idea with support at the White House is to use a Congressionally mandated conference later this year on how to increase the nation's savings rate as a way to focus attention on Social Security and other pension and retirement programs. And the White House and members of both parties in Congress continue to discuss creation of a bipartisan commission or a special Congressional committee to draft Social Security legislation.
White House aides said Mr. Clinton had yet to decide on any specific remedies. His advisers have long been skeptical of proposals that would turn over to individuals the job of investing for their retirements the money that would otherwise go into the Social Security program. And they have shied away from publicly endorsing or rejecting anything else from a menu of politically unappealing options that includes cutting benefits, raising the retirement age or raising taxes.
The Administration's decision to begin moving ahead on Social Security was welcomed by several influential Republicans. Mr. Kasich and Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, both said the problem would just get worse the longer it went unaddressed.
But Mr. Archer said Republicans would be wary if Mr. Clinton expected them to make politically painful proposals on their own, especially in the midst of a Congressional election this year. He suggested that Republicans wanted Mr. Clinton to make the first move in putting specific solutions on the table.
"The President should propose, he should send up what he believes is an appropriate solution and we should look at it," Mr. Archer said on the ABC News program "This Week."
The emerging debate over Social Security will join an already crowded economic policy agenda for the coming year. With the Federal budget deficit all but eliminated and the prospects for a budget surplus in the next year or two improving, the White House and members of Congress from both parties are scrambling to come up with plans for any financial windfall.
Improving the health of Social Security and Medicare, and other long-term problems, will be mixed into a broader set of issues this year, some of them of more immediate political interest to both parties. Republicans are pushing for tax cuts. Many Democrats are arguing in favor of increasing spending on education and anti-poverty programs.
The size and timing of any surplus, and how it is apportioned among the many uses to which it could be put, could have a substantial effect on how Washington deals with Social Security. One option for any surpluses is to pay down the $5 trillion national debt. Some of that is money the Government borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, so cutting the national debt would reduce the risk to Social Security.

HEADLINE: Pataki, Keeping It Simple, Gains the High Ground

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 4

 BODY:
When George E. Pataki took office as Governor three years ago this week, his Democratic foes derided him as a puppet of Republican kingmakers, an empty suit whose victory was a fluke, a programmed politician with no vision and no hope of winning a second term. A budget crisis here, a minor scandal there and he would be history, they said.
But the budget crises and minor scandals have come and gone. Now, as he prepares to open the State Legislature this week with a speech that will set the tone for his re-election campaign, Mr. Pataki is poised to make the Democrats eat their words. 
 Polls show he holds nearly double-digit leads over all Democratic challengers and commands approval ratings approaching 60 percent, up from the mid-30's in 1995. He has $10 million in his campaign coffers, nearly five times that of the closest Democrat. The state is expected to end its fiscal year more than $1 billion in the black, its third surplus in three years. He has fulfilled his spare 1994 campaign pledges to cut taxes, cut spending and re-enact the death penalty.
To Democrats, Mr. Pataki's strength results from things largely beyond his control. A thriving economy, an irrepressible bull market, a nationwide drop in crime and a rudderless, destitute state Democratic Party have made it easy for him to coast into a campaign year looking like a winner, they say. But they insist that a recession or a sudden uptick in unemployment will cause his poll numbers to drop like a stone.
But even his detractors have grudgingly come to admit that Mr. Pataki's governing style has been a factor in his success. By picking his battles judiciously, focusing on a few issues and fighting doggedly once he commits himself to a cause, he has controlled the Albany agenda, converted critics into allies and managed to win most of the battles he needed to win, while escaping unscathed from several he seemed likely to lose.
In a recent interview, Mr. Pataki talked at length about the importance of being focused, describing it as almost a guiding philosophy. He admired Ronald Reagan, he said, for being able to keep his agenda simple, clear and short.
"The strongest force in government is inertia," the Governor said. "You have to have a focused agenda if you are going to change things, because there are enormous forces that resist any change."
Sounding a theme that Republican officials say he will use again on the campaign stump, Mr. Pataki said that by sticking to a few issues, he had been able to fulfill his commitments to voters. As a result, he said, the public has come to respect him, and not view him as a typical politician with its negative connotations of empty promises.
"I think the overriding thing is that they understand that I mean what I say," he said. "And I think there is respect. Too often there is this enormous cynicism about politics and politicians. And I don't think it's hard to trace the origin of that cynicism. When a President Bush says, 'Read my lips, no new taxes,' then the next year passes a tax increase, people say, 'My goodness.' "
Mr. Pataki's governing style has been the source of much debate around the Capitol because, on the surface, he can seem so detached as to be not in full control of his own administration.
But Mr. Pataki's friends and advisers say there is a method to his laid-back ways. Though Mr. Pataki calls Theodore Roosevelt his political hero, he clearly lacks Roosevelt's impetuous nature, panache and bluster. Rather, Mr. Pataki has turned to biographies of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt for guidance, admiring the two Presidents' abilities to rise coolly above the personal rivalries and philosophical clashes of their advisers and make difficult decisions.
Once he makes those decisions, he does not waver, his advisers said. "When he focuses, he's a tiger," one friend said. That was the case in 1996, when Mr. Pataki held up the budget for weeks until Democrats accepted his plan for reducing workers' compensation rates. The fight was too arcane for most voters to pay much attention. But it won Mr. Pataki praise from business groups and the admiration of his enemies.
"Pataki is stubborn," one Democratic lobbyist said. "Cuomo would give up at the end. But with Pataki, we'd still be negotiating the budget if he hadn't gotten what he wanted on workers' comp."
In an interview last year, Michael C. Finnegan, Mr. Pataki's friend and former counsel, also compared the Governor with his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo. "Cuomo knew the details of everything, but he never got anything done. He was too immersed in the Albany politics, the details of what Line 27 of a bill would provide, as opposed to setting direction." Mr. Pataki's style, he said, is to give sweeping orders: "I want hospitals deregulated. I don't want window dressing. Go get it."
Mr. Pataki's critics say the downside of his style is that he seems to have a cramped vision of government and few ideas outside his narrow agenda. They also say he is so disciplined at sticking to a few messages that he can appear programmed, inarticulate, secretive.
Mr. Pataki says he believes that he projects a different self-image to the public than the one his critics see. "My nature is to let everybody know what I am thinking, including all the bad ideas," he said. "You can't govern without bad ideas, because no one has nothing but good ideas. But what is most common is that you don't have any ideas. I always have what I would call creative, others might call bizarre, ideas as to how we can move forward as a state."
He added that his advisers "are always trying to rein me in."
One advantage to appearing detached is that Mr. Pataki has not always been held responsible for contentious or unpopular decisions. For instance, Mr. Pataki deflected criticism about the secrecy of private corporations that raised $2.5 million to finance his inauguration by saying that he did not control them, even though they were run by people who were either his advisers or employees.
The Governor also managed to escape much political damage from last year's grueling fight over New York City rent regulations by allowing his fellow Republican, Joseph A. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, to take the lead in pushing for the elimination of rent protections. Although Mr. Pataki had supported Mr. Bruno's position in the past, he refused to take a position last year until late in the fight, and then accepted a compromise with the Democrats that kept the regulations largely intact.
Though Democrats had predicted that the rent fight would permanently damage Mr. Pataki with New York City voters, recent polls have shown him to be more popular in the city than ever before.
His allies say Mr. Pataki's handling of the rent fight shows one of his strengths: strong political instincts that tell him when to fight and when to retreat, what can be done and what is unachievable, what will improve his image and what will make him look foolish.
"He is very cautious and fears making mistakes," an adviser said. "But on the other hand, he just wouldn't ever sing 'Old McDonald' on the floor of the Legislature," as Mr. Pataki's patron, Alfonse M. D'Amato, once did on the floor of the United States Senate.
It is perhaps those same instincts that have helped Mr. Pataki silence some of his sharpest critics and broaden his appeal beyond his conservative base during the last two years.
Labor unions and environmentalists who had been adversaries became allies when he won passage of a $1.75 billion environmental bond act in 1996. His plan to reduce property taxes, which the Legislature enacted last year, will heavily benefit the elderly and suburban swing voters. His plan to offer unlimited monthly passes to New York City transit riders has made many urban commuters forget that he presided over the largest increase in the transit fare, in 1995.
Mr. Pataki clearly relishes holding the high ground for the first time in his often rocky first term. At a recent fund-raiser in Albany, he joked to the partisan crowd, "Any time I saw a crowd this size in 1995 or 1996, I knew it was protesters."
But the Governor bristles whenever it is suggested that there might be political motivations lurking behind his decisions. "If there is one thing I hope people have developed, it is a sense that I truly try to do my best and try to say what I believe and try to achieve the goals that we set out," he said. "Not because of a political campaign, but because of an honest belief that it is the right thing for the people."

HEADLINE: Korea Reported To Seek Billions In Bond Offers

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
The financially pressed South Korean Government is attempting on its own to secure as much as $35 billion in new financing, according to American commercial and investment bankers.
The move comes even as the Bank for International Settlements released a report yesterday pointing out that global bankers had stepped up lending to the country in early 1997 despite indications of "growing strains in Southeast Asia." 
 The South Korean Government, which declined to comment yesterday on its refinancing plans, has repeatedly bridled at foreign advice about how to get its financial affairs in order. By unexpectedly moving to sell bonds on its own, the Government would sidestep American commercial banks' efforts to lead the repackaging of the beleaguered country's mountain of troubled loans. Almost $40 billion in short-term South Korean debt will have to be restructured by the end of March to ease the crisis.
"Once you open up someone's eyes to the possibility of restructuring their debt, there's no reason for them to think they can't do it themselves," one American banker said yesterday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Meanwhile, South Korea's ambassador for international financial affairs, Inyong Chung, will meet with bankers today at the New York headquarters of J. P. Morgan & Company to discuss the commercial banks' plan to convert South Korea's short-term loans into longer-term bonds.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin will also be in New York today at the headquarters of the investment bank Salomon Smith Barney Inc. for what the Treasury described as a review of Salomon's reviewing child-care program. Salomon, along with Mr. Rubin's old firm, Goldman, Sachs & Company, is serving as a financial adviser to the South Korean Government.
Mr. Rubin has regularly emphasized the economic and national security issues at stake in Southeast Asia, and the calm with which diplomats and financiers are attempting to bail out South Korea belies the anxiety many still feel about the success of the effort. When Congress reconvenes next month, the situation will only grow more complicated.
"I think there's a certain spin on this in Washington that this is under control," a senior commercial banker said last week, adding that South Korea's financial problem was too complicated to be resolved neatly or quickly.
Some commercial banks, particularly smaller ones, have found it difficult to agree on extending payments on South Korean loans and even more so to arrange a complex pooling of the troubled loans as long-term bonds. Further aid for South Korea from the International Monetary Fund and others hinges on extending payment on the loans. On Dec. 31, the South Korean Government was forced to pay off about 10 percent of loans that came due, leaving only about $9 billion in foreign currency reserves.
The South Korean Government said yesterday that it repaid $10 billion of its debt in December, using more than half of the emergency money already provided by the I.M.F. Commercial banks deferred payment on only $3 billion to $4 billion worth of loans, far less than the Government had hoped.
Now the South Koreans themselves are considering seeking $15 billion by the end of January -- part of it in the form of a $5 billion loan to replenish the coffers of its central bank and part of it as $10 billion in new, longer-term bonds to replace some short-term debt that must be repaid at the end of January. After that, a second bond offering of $20 billion would be attempted to replace a large portion of the remaining short-term debt, according to American bankers.
Raising that much money will not be easy. South Korea's credit rating has been downgraded to "junk" status, meaning the Government will have to pay double-digit interest rates to attract large investors. But the South Korean Government has at its disposal Salomon and Goldman, Sachs, two of the world's biggest and most able bond houses, and the country is considered too important strategically and economically for anyone to consider letting it suffocate under the weight of its debt.
"If Goldman and Solly are telling the South Koreans that they don't need the commercial banks to do this deal for them, then I would assume they can pull it off," Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for the Thomson Financial Services Company, a Boston advisory firm, said. "It's just another sign of the loss of importance of traditional commerical banks to investment banks and the capital markets."
Goldman, Sachs and Salomon officials declined to comment. Jeffrey R. Shafer, the vice chairman of Salomon Brothers International, and Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International, traveled to Seoul yesterday to begin discussing financial options with the South Korean Government.
In an interview on Friday, E. Gerald Corrigan, a Goldman, Sachs partner and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said he was acting as an independent adviser to the South Korean Government. Mr. Corrigan, who just returned from South Korea, said that he got the job shortly before Christmas and that the terms of his retainer forbid him from discussing his work with colleagues at Goldman. But he said South Korea's immediate troubles were a result of a shortage of money, rather than a lack of creditworthiness.
"It's a difficult one, but I'm an eternal optimist on these matters," Mr. Corrigan said. "In all of these countries, there's a big problem in the private sector. The financial system is in difficult straits."
On Friday, American commercial bankers continued to discuss the outlines of their loan repackaging proposal, which includes initially swapping at least $7.5 billion in short-term loans for an equal amount of longer-term bonds and raising at least another $7.5 billion in bonds that would replenish South Korea's foreign exchange reserves.
American commercial bankers increased their lending to South Korea during the first half of the year, although less than their European counterparts, according to the Bank for International Settlements report.
B.I.S. noted that lending to South Korea by major international banks rose by almost $5 billion from Dec. 31, 1996, to June 30, 1997.
Of the $103.4 billion in outstanding loans to South Korea as of June 30, the Japanese held $23.7 billion, down from $24.3 billion at the end of 1996; Germany held $10.8 billion, up from $9.97 billion; France held $10.07 billion, up from $8.89 billion, and the United States held $9.96 billion, up from $9.36 billion.
Still, there are some signs that investors' nervousness about the South Korean economy may be diminishing. South Korean stocks rose 2.4 percent on Saturday. In early trading today, South Korean stocks advanced. The principal index was up 1.87 percent to 392.69.

HEADLINE: U.S. AUTO MAKERS SHOWING INTEREST IN FUEL EFFICIENCY

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Having fiercely but unsuccessfully opposed a global warming treaty and other environmental initiatives last year, American auto makers are stepping up their research into cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars and making ambitious plans for bringing their advanced designs to market.
The General Motors Corporation, until now skeptical about the demand for such vehicles, today unveiled several prototypes of mid-sized cars that would get 60 to 80 miles per gallon, and said that one of the designs would be ready for mass production in 2001 and another by 2004. The auto maker called for new Federal subsidies to speed the introduction of such vehicles, including tax credits and Government installation of equipment to recharge electric vehicles. 
 Harry Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman, said in an interview today that while the new vehicles were likely to be introduced first in Europe, where high gasoline prices made them more attractive, the auto maker was prepared to support a modest increase in American taxes on gasoline and other fossil fuels to make high-mileage vehicles more popular.
The Ford Motor Company plans a press conference on Monday morning to display its latest inventions, including a prototype for a mid-sized sedan weighing just 2,000 pounds -- 1,300 pounds less than a similar Ford Taurus. And the Chrysler Corporation plans on Tuesday to show off its latest design for a car powered by both diesel and electricity.
"No car company will be able to thrive in the 21st century if it relies solely on internal combustion engines," said John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, adding that the company was stepping up its research spending and focusing it on bringing to market.
Some of these moves may reflect a desire to answer criticism over the soaring sales of gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. Selling more high-mileage, advanced-technology vehicles would allow auto makers to sell more low-mileage gas guzzlers and still meet federally mandated averages for the overall fuel economy of the vehicles they sell.
The auto makers have been cautious, and Mr. Smith hedged a little today, about committing themselves to the massive production of fuel-efficient vehicles, insisting that they will not build advanced, high-mileage cars if no one wants to buy them.
But the tone of Detroit executives in talking about high-mileage vehicles has nonetheless been shifting in recent weeks. After years of dismissing advanced-technology vehicles as impractical and too expensive to build, the executives are beginning to show genuine interest.
The Detroit auto makers' sudden enthusiasm for cleaner cars partly reflects commercial realities. When the American auto makers joined forces last summer with oil and coal industries to set up a lobbying campaign against an international agreement to limit global warming, their Japanese rivals declined to participate. Then, in October, Japanese auto makers stunned the international auto industry by unveiling several very fuel-efficient, low-emissions cars at the Tokyo Motor Show. American and European manufacturers were caught flat-footed, still showing off high-performance gas-guzzling sports cars and sport utility vehicles.
Mr. Smith said today that the Tokyo Motor Show had made a profound impression, leaving him with the conclusion that G.M. would have to be a leader in high-mileage cars with extremely low emissions. "It crystallized in my mind we needed to do a good job on that," he said.
William C. Ford Jr., the powerful chairman of the finance committee at Ford, said the auto maker that reached the market first with a reasonably priced, alternative-fuel vehicle would win a significant competitive advantage.
"There's a compelling business case to be made," Mr. Ford said last month, after Ford announced that it would join Daimler-Benz of Germany in developing cars with fuel-cell engines, which produce power by chemical reactions rather than by burning fuel.
G.M. announced today that it hoped to have a car powered by a fuel-cell engine ready for production by 2004, and a car powered by both gasoline and electricity by 2001.
Thomas Gale, Chrysler's executive vice president for product strategy, said today that his company's latest prototype, to be unveiled on Tuesday at the North American International Auto Show here, would represent "the most pragmatic approach yet to future power trains." But Chrysler, which is just half the size of G.M. and Ford, has not been able to devote the same resources as its larger rivals to the development of advanced vehicles.
Cars produce gases that contribute to global warming in direct proportion to the gasoline they burn. So high-mileage vehicles produce few of these gases while gas-guzzlers produce a lot.
Ford already holds 95 percent of the nation's small market for alternative-fuel vehicles that run on natural gas, propane, alcohol or electricity. Almost of the buyers are Government agencies, which buy them because of Federal mandates, and utilities that have virtually free supplies of electricity or natural gas; the general public has shown little interest and may shun the latest planned offerings as well.
But G.M.'s decisions really set the pace for the global auto industry because the company remains the world's largest auto maker, selling a sixth of the world's cars and trucks. Even with heavy imports and growing production here, all of the European and Japanese auto makers combined still do not sell as many cars and trucks each year in the United States as General Motors, which holds nearly 31 percent of the American market. So G.M.'s increased interest in alternative-fuel vehicles could make a big difference in the long term.
Toyota has just begun selling in Japan the Prius, a hybrid-engine small car that runs on gasoline and electricity and gets 70 miles to the gallon. Toyota is charging $17,000, but industry experts say that the auto maker is only covering half its costs at that price.
G.M. has been leasing the world's first mass-produced electric car, the EV-1, with little success for the last year in Arizona and California. Robert Purcell, G.M.'s director of advanced vehicles, announced today that the company would introduce a battery this autumn that would double the car's range between rechargings, to 160 miles, and a new electric engine that would cost half as much and be half the size with a third fewer parts than the engine introduced a year ago.

HEADLINE: Kenya's Leader Wins a 5th Term, But Opposition Candidates Gain

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Jan. 4

 BODY:
President Daniel arap Moi was officially declared the winner of Kenya's presidential election today, giving a final term to a 20-year-old administration widely criticized for corruption and mismanagement.
The announcement came after two days of unofficial counts predicting Mr. Moi's victory. The chairman of the Kenya Electoral Commission, Samuel Kivuitu, announced that Mr. Moi was leading his nearest challenger, Mwai Kibaki, a former Vice President, by about 550,000 votes in official returns -- 2.4 million to 1.9 million. Though about 147,000 ballots from remote regions were still to be counted, Mr. Kivuitu declared Mr. Moi the victor. 
 "Daniel arap Moi has received the highest number of votes," Mr. Kivuitu said.
But when Mr. Moi is sworn in Monday morning for a fifth five-year term, he will have a mandate from only about 40 percent of the voters, hardly a ringing endorsement of his administration. Mr. Kibaki and other opposition leaders have demanded that the election be held again, asserting that Mr. Moi's agents orchestrated widespread ballot shortages and other irregularities to keep them from winning.
Yet international and domestic election observers say that Kenya's election, while flawed and chaotic, was not substantially rigged to favor Mr. Moi. Even though there were huge delays and ballot mix-ups on election day, forcing an extension of voting, a vast majority of registered voters managed to get to the polls and to cast confidential ballots without intimidation, the observers said.
"The results do on the whole reflect the will of the Kenyan voters," said the Rev. Mutava Musyimi, a spokesman for a church-run election-monitoring operation, consisting of a coalition of church groups and a pro-democracy group.
The truth is that Mr. Moi did not need to resort to crude methods to win, political analysts said. The wily 74-year-old veteran of Kenyan politics triumphed with tactics familiar to any machine politician from urban America -- gerrymandering, dividing his opponents along ethnic lines, and making sure voter registration favored his party.
Mr. Moi also enjoyed a hefty advantage as the incumbent. The state-run radio and television broadcasts, for instance, focused almost exclusively on his campaign during the last two weeks of the race, ignoring his opponents.
But while the playing field favored the governing party, the irregularities and logistical problems reported at the polls were not widespread enough to skew the results, international and domestic observers said. It was a measure of the election's relative fairness that about 60 percent of the vote went to opposition candidates, and the governing party lost more than a dozen seats in Parliament, including several held by Cabinet ministers.
"At the end of the day, the Kenyan voters were able to express their wishes," Mr. Musyimi said. He added that the general situation favored Mr. Moi's party, the Kenyan African National Union, "but that bias did not in any significant way determine or effect the final result."
Mr. Moi first became President in 1978, when the country's first President, Jomo Kenyatta, died. As Vice President under Mr. Kenyatta, he had been seen as a weak and unthreatening politician, but he surprised his critics during the 1980's, putting down a coup attempt and strengthening Kenya's one-party state. In 1992, he bowed to international pressure to allow multiparty elections. Though he has kept the peace for two decades, his opponents accuse Mr. Moi of allowing corruption and mismanagement to ruin the country's economy, roads, hospitals and schools.
The biggest reason for Mr. Moi's victory is the tribal nature of Kenyan politics, an analysis of the returns indicates. The anti-Moi vote was split among four main challengers, all of whom had strong support in their home regions but had made few inroads elsewhere.
In essence, the President faced four regional parties based on tribal loyalties. The major ethnic groups voted overwhelmingly for their kinsmen: the Kikuyu for Mr. Kibaki, the Luo for Raila Odinga, the Luhyia for Michael Kijana Wamalwa, and the Akamba for Charity Ngilu.
But Mr. Moi, who comes from a small Kalenjin tribe, has built up support in all of those communities through the deft use of patronage, appointments and government largesse. At the same time, he has kept intact his coalition of dozens of small tribes, mostly from the Rift Valley and the Coast, who fear that a president from one of the larger tribes would ignore their needs.
A result was that Mr. Moi ran a strong second in each of the provinces where his opponents won and easily defeated them in his strongholds. On the national level, the challengers split up the opposition vote, robbing the most formidable candidate among them, Mr. Kibaki, of the boost he needed to surpass Mr. Moi.
"Moi pulled it off by winning," said Charles Hornsby, an expert on Kenyan politics who is co-author of a book on the subject. "He's first or second in every province. Even though he's unpopular with a majority, he's run second almost everywhere. I am of the opinion that it was a fair win."
But even if the voting was fair, the campaign was dirty, political analysts say. To begin with, Mr. Moi and his party registered more than 2.1 million voters in the Rift Valley, the heartland of his support, and made sure a majority of those people made it to the polls, despite heavy rains and muddy roads.
Indeed, the sparsely-populated Rift Valley had almost twice as many registered voters as any other province -- including the heavily populated central highlands, where the Kikuyu are a majority, and Nyanza on Lake Victoria, the homeland of the Luo.
The turnout for Mr. Moi in his strongholds was also high, averaging about 75 percent, compared with the national average of 65 percent. Indeed, at least three constituencies reported impossibly high turnouts. In Mr. Moi's home district of Baringo North, for instance, officials recorded a turnout of 105 percent.
Mr. Moi's party also gerrymandered parliamentary constituencies to favor his strongholds. For instance, in Nairobi, where Mr. Kibaki's Democratic Party is popular, each district had about 91,000 voters, while in the Rift Valley, each district had about 44,000.
In a few parliamentary constituencies, agents of Mr. Moi's party were seen handing out cash outside of polling places, observers said. But opposition party agents were also seen buying votes and it was impossible to tell if practice affected the final tallies, the observers said.
Some of the ethnic violence that has erupted during the last six months may also have helped Mr. Moi, though there is no evidence that the governing party was behind it. For instance, the brutal attacks on people on the coast in August forced thousands of Luo and other inland people, most of them opposition supporters, to leave the Mombassa area, making it easier for Mr. Moi to win there.
When all the votes were counted today, though, it was clear the opposition had done much better than in the 1992 election and that Kenya had taken a few more steps toward full-fledged democracy, political analysts said. Mr. Kibaki, 66, allowed for the first time to campaign without interference from local officials, fared much better than expected, with 31 percent of the vote nationwide and even 20 percent in the Rift Valley. The other top 3 challengers had a total of almost 27 percent. The Democratic Party also upset Mr. Moi's candidates in at least two Rift Valley parliamentary races they had expected to lose.
But in other parliamentary contests, there is strong evidence that Mr. Moi's agents intervened to keep a slim majority in the legislature. In Nairobi's Westlands district, for instance, the race was razor close between the candidate of Mr. Moi's party, Fred Gumo, and the Democratic Party nominee, Betty Tett.
After votes were counted, observers from both sides agreed to the vote totals for each polling place, and when those figures were added up, it seemed Ms. Tett had edged Mr. Gumo by a bare 139 votes. But when election officials announced the final result on Saturday afternoon, an extra 800 votes had appeared in Mr. Gumo's column.
The election officer in charge, Rosemary Muraa, refused to do a recount and left the counting hall in a hurry, surrounded by police officers and governing party officials.
Several foreign observers said the were stunned at such a naked display of rigging. But as Mr. Gumo's supporters jubilantly marched through the streets of Nairobi, Mr. Moi's wafer-thin majority in Parliament got a little thicker.
"They cheated as little as possible and as much as necessary," Mr. Hornsby said.

Pataki Keeps It Simple And Gains the High Ground
Polls show that Governor Pataki holds nearly double-digit leads over all Democratic challengers and commands approval ratings approaching 60 percent, up from the mid-30's in 1995. And as Mr. Pataki enters his fourth year as governor, he has $10 million in his campaign coffers, nearly five times that of the closest Democrat. To Democrats, Mr. Pataki's strength results from things largely beyond his control: a thriving economy, an irrepressible bull market, a nationwide drop in crime and a rudderless, destitute state Democratic Party. But the Governor, in an interview, said his success was grounded in his ability to remain focused and to keep his agenda simple, clear and short. A1

South Korea Seeks Loans
South Korea is trying to obtain on its own as much as $35 billion in new loans, American commercial and investment bankers said. South Korea has repeatedly bridled at foreign advice about how to get its financial affairs in order, and by taking the unexpected move of selling bonds on its own, the Government would sidestep American commercial banks' efforts to lead the repackaging of the beleaguered country's mountain of troubled loans. South Korea's move came as the Bank of International Settlements released a report pointing out that global bankers stepped up lending to the country in early 1997 despite indications of "growing strains in Southeast Asia."

A Cautious U.S. Forecast
The United States economy has plenty to celebrate, but the boom is precarious. The odds are that the economic expansion that began in 1991 will last at least another year, in the view of all 52 forecasters surveyed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators. But the Asian crisis has raised alarms, and there are other threats: a consumer debt crisis, a sharp decline in stock prices and a punishing trade deficit. If corporate profits shrink, unemployment may rise. Some experts even raise the specter of deflation, which can pull down incomes as well as prices. D1

1997 HIGHLIGHTS

 BODY:
STOCKS
The stock market roared once again in 1997 - the third consecutive year of blockbuster gains - despite fears that the rapidly spreading turmoil in Asia would kill the great bull market of the 1990's.
 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 23 percent, ending the year at 7,908.25 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose even more. The Nasdaq composite index, with a concentration of technology stocks and smaller issues, rose nearly 22 percent, to 1,570.35 points.
 Analyst said that despite jitters about higher inflation, shrinking profit margins and a looming economic and currency crisis in Southeast Asia, investors continued to funnel money into the stock market in the belief that the American economy was nicely balanced, with little inflation. It wasn't just the United States that saw big gains. Except for Asia, many parts of the world register stellar increases, particularly in Europe.
BONDS
Bonds got off to a shaky start in 1997 but made a comeback as a healthy demand arose for United States Treasuries.
 In a brief stumble, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond rose as high as 7.17 percent after the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates in late March to try to stave off inflationary threats. But even thought the economy revved and labor shortages crept up, the inflation threat never materialized, and that helped drop the yield on the 30-year bond below 6 percent in December for the first time since early 1996.
 The rally was aided by a "flight to quality" as investors, concerned that the crisis in Asia would spread to other parts of the globe, parked their money in Treasuries. If an investor had bought a 30-year Treasury at the beginning of the year, by Dec. 31 the return, including price appreciation and interest, would have been more than 14 percent.
 THE DOLLAR
The dollar rose sharply against mot currencies last year, though the ascent was not without interruptions. The United States and its allies tried to put the brakes on the dollar early in February, as Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin switched from supporting a strong dollar to saying the dollar was strong enough.
 At the time, however, Mr. Rubin and his counterparts from Europe, Canada and Japan also acknowledged that exchange rates are determined by economic fundamentals. Those factors continued to favor the dollar through the end of the year as foreign investors were attracted to the United States stock and bond markets as Asian economies tumbled.
 So while the dollar dipped agains the Japanese yen in May, it rallied smartly afterward, touching five-and-a-half-year highs last month amid the financial turmoil in Asia. Agains the German mark, the dollar rose nearly 17 percent for the year.
GOLD
United States Treasuries and dollars seemed to replace gold as the world's safest haven for nervous investors in 1997, partly because the world's central banks have been threatening to dump their gold reserves.
 Gold has also lost osme of its luster as a hedge against price increases, particularly with inflation - at least in the United States - apparently dead, or at least in deep hibernation.
 The price of gold, which had soared as high as $850 an ounce in the 1980's, fell below $300 an ounce last autumn for the first time since 1985.
 The loss of gold's appeal as an inflation hedge reflects a greater faith in the ability of central banks to keep prices under control. That makes paper assets like bonds more attractive.
 And gold, once considered the safest investment, continues to sink; some analysts think it could go as low as $250 an ounce in 1998.

HEADLINE: Disneyland for Deadheads: Ultimate Nostalgia Trip;
Rock Group Lives in Memory and Master Plan

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

DATELINE: NOVATO, Calif.

 BODY:
If the red-brick warehouse in this Marin County town were open to the public, it would be a haven for one-stop shoppers. Its endless shelves are lined with everything from toothbrushes to golf balls, dog collars to stamps, skis to motorcycle parts, baby rompers to electric lanterns. But this is not a supermarket. It is the headquarters of Grateful Dead Merchandising, where the golf balls are tie-dyed and the dog collars are emblazoned with the head of Jerry Garcia. A thousand packages of Grateful Dead items are shipped from this warehouse each day, bringing in an annual gross of $50 million to $60 million.
But much more than the sale of memorabilia is involved here. There is a Grateful Dead master plan. Most of the revenue coming in is being earmarked for an enormous project, perhaps the biggest undertaking ever attempted by a single band. It is called Terrapin Station, to be built in San Francisco, a $60 million museum, amusement park, gathering place, concert hall, research center and possibly even a hotel for Grateful Dead fans who have lost their way since the band broke up after Garcia, its leader, died two and a half years ago. 
 "There's a way to keep this band going, even without Jerry, God bless him," said Dennis McNally, the band's press agent for 14 years. "Instead of dying, the Grateful Dead is morphing."
Rock-and-roll is a 50-year-old beast, and its founders and early innovators are just beginning to die off. With its pioneering musicians and bands gone, rock-and-roll is becoming a museum piece. Two years ago, the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame opened in Cleveland. And Paul Allen, a Microsoft entrepreneur, is in the process of developing a $60 million Experience Music Project rock museum in Seattle. But Terrapin Station, named after a 1977 Grateful Dead album, promises to be a different type of tourist attraction altogether.
"This is probably the first rock-and-roll museum dedicated to one artist," said Bob Grossweiner, the senior editor of the concert industry magazine Performance. "If kids traveled all over the country following the band when they toured, I'm sure they'll all go to San Francisco to see the museum. It will bring a lot of money into the economy, and it's very possible that Terrapin Station will outdraw the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame, because it's in a bigger city, and some people are going to be spending weeks there instead of just a day. Hopefully, they'll have smoke alarms in the bathrooms and the staircases."
In its 30-year existence, the Grateful Dead was transformed from a band into a cult, attracting and retaining a more loyal, obsessive and dedicated following -- the Deadheads -- than any other rock group. Its tours were among the highest grossing, regularly earning some $50 million in a good year. But when the band broke up in 1995, it left tens of thousands of fans with nowhere to go, no band worthy of following so slavishly around the country. One of the roles of Terrapin Station will be as a kind of shrine and meeting place for Deadheads. Its builders expect, in their most conservative estimates, that Terrapin Station will attract 1.2 million people in its first year.
Though a site has not yet been chosen, the band is considering two San Francisco locations and expects to close a deal by the end of the month. Meetings have already begun with city officials. Spokesmen for the band said that the city had pledged its support.
Phil Lesh, the Grateful Dead's bassist, said the idea first germinated in the late 60's when the band dreamed about becoming what he called "a rock-and-roll satellite" that would stay in one place and broadcast concerts around the world.
"The relationship between the band and the Deadheads needs to be nurtured because they are us, and we are them," Mr. Lesh said in a recent interview. "We'd been talking about Terrapin Station more seriously for the last five years, but the touring overhead and the number of employees we had were so great that we couldn't think of a way to generate enough time and energy, let alone money.
"With Jerry's death, everything changed. We are no longer a viable touring operation. We couldn't even support our entire staff. To make a smooth transition, we had to fall back on merchandising our music archives, and that became the cash cow for the whole organization."
"But we didn't want to just put out old live concerts until the material and interest dwindled away," he continued. "As big a draw as the music at our shows was the fellowship and community people had there with one another. We wanted to create a place that would be a presentation of what we did musically and culturally, and a place where people could gather, and new music could be showcased, and a nonprofit organization for music groups in the Bay Area could be developed."
The entrance to the 65,000-square-foot Terrapin Station, which Mr. Lesh said he hoped would be open by New Year's Eve 1999 for reunion of surviving Grateful Dead members, will be a parking lot, a re-creation of the place outside concert halls where Deadheads used to meet and sell food and crafts. Inside, there will be a 1,000-seat auditorium for concerts by Bay Area bands and by members of the Dead, most of whom have formed their own groups; rotating museum exhibits focusing on the Bay Area music scene since the 60's, world music and chapters in Grateful Dead history, and a store full of band merchandise.
 
Grilled Cheese Sandwiches
Plans also call for a roomful of percussion instruments for spontaneous drum circles and jam sessions; a multimedia theater that will recreate the experience of Grateful Dead concerts, and a restaurant tentatively called the Dancing Bear Cafe. (Expect the vegetarian burritos and grilled cheese sandwiches typically served up in a Dead concert parking lot.) Depending on the size of the site that the Grateful Dead buys, there may also be a theme hotel or apartment complex, named Mars Hotel after another Dead album.
Terrapin Station will not be a giant Hard Rock Cafe, those involved say.
"I want to put my entire legal and business files on display," said Hal Kant, the band's lawyer for 30 years. "The music industry is kind of new, and I was one of the first lawyers, so maybe my files can help teach people about the development of contracts and business practices from the beginning. A substantial part of the museum is intended to be a research center."
Deadheads seem to be behind the project and have already contributed $1.5 million. Unlike most rock corporate ventures, the Grateful Dead has a very elaborate business partnership in which the musicians are heavily involved. Each original member owns an equal share in Grateful Dead Productions and has an equal vote in approving merchandise and business decisions.
When Garcia died, in keeping with an agreement made 25 years ago, the remaining members of the band bought back his interest in the corporation while his estate continued to receive his royalties from music and merchandise.
Although it isn't involved in band decisions, the estate is behind Terrapin Station, said Garcia's widow, Deborah Koons Garcia. "It sounds like a really fun and imaginative project," she said. "I think it's a few years off, but my understanding is that people are most excited about it being a high-tech playground and looking toward the future, which is something Jerry was really interested in." (The estate still owes $4.6 million to Garcia's second wife, Carolyn Adams Garcia, known as Mountain Girl.)
The shock of his death, and the realization that with Terrapin Station the Grateful Dead would survive as a business entity long after its members were gone, has forced the rest of the band to set up a trust and start appointing trustees to take over their stock after their deaths.
 
Decisions Made By the Band
"Band members are the board of directors," Mr. Kant said. "They're not figureheads. They make all the decisions, and we don't do anything until everyone agrees, so we're not dragging along a reluctant party. We're among the first rock groups to have health coverage, pension plans and other employee benefits."
Grateful Dead Productions itself is a complex, rapidly growing machine fueled by the band's insistence on direct control over its products, enabling it to control its image and keep a greater share of the profits than most musicians who work through separate record labels and merchandising companies Besides the new company being established to run Terrapin Station, Grateful Dead Productions includes a retail arm, which develops products and runs a mail-order catalog for direct sales. A division licenses the Grateful Dead name and trademark to manufacturers (from multinational companies to entrepreneurs working out of the trunks of their cars) to develop and sell products.
There is a also a merchandising service, which works on product development, inventory control and concession sales not just for Dead-related concerts but also for other music acts like the Gipsy Kings and Maxwell, and sports teams like the Oakland Raiders. And there is Grateful Dead Records, which recently expanded, to compensate for some of the loss of touring revenue and merchandise, releasing albums by Crosby and Nash and the Allman Brothers as well as the Dead, whose rigorous and extensive archives of some 2,300 concerts and numerous studio sessions are kept in a vault in the Novato warehouse. In case of a fire, the vault has a security system that will pump the air out from the room, killing anyone inside but saving the music.
"Thanks to the archive that the band had the foresight to compile over 30 years, the music can be presented in different ways in the band's absence," said Peter McQuaid, the chief executive of Grateful Dead Productions. "With Terrapin Station, the Grateful Dead could theoretically go on and on performing without even having to show up and get on stage and play their instruments."

To the Editor:
The collapse of the empty 42d Street building and similar self-demolitions (Editorial Observer, Jan. 5) are not so much the fault of failed inspection as they are the fault of assessment laws. With city land underassessed and taxes on property and improvement high, an aging structure may be the best investment in a growing city, since the increase in its land value exceeds the relatively small tax on an old building. 
 Henry George, in his 1879 book, "Progress and Poverty," advocated taxing land more and buildings less to make urban renewal economically feasible. Only Pennsylvania has followed this initiative, permitting its cities a two-tier tax structure so the tax burden could be gradually shifted from property and improvement onto land. The result: less urban sprawl, easier city planning, increasing new construction and lower taxes. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani could learn from this.

HEADLINE: The Bad News About Bailouts

BYLINE: By Lawrence B. Lindsay; Lawrence B. Lindsay, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is a former governor of the Federal Reserve.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Suppose your brother-in-law announced to the whole family at Christmas that he had lost a bundle on Wall Street, couldn't meet his margin calls and didn't have the money to meet either his credit card bills or his mortgage. Would you bail him out?
Your answer would probably be, "It depends." While the issues involved in the international bailout of South Korea (and other countries) are complex, some of the questions you would ask yourself about your brother-in-law aren't much different from the ones we should be asking ourselves about South Korea. 
 First, how did the debt burden get so large? In South Korea's case it was a web of sham accounting standards. The reported size of South Korea's exposure has mushroomed over the last several months. Last month the Korean Government gave a "final" estimate of $160 billion, and that is just international debt; it doesn't include what Korean companies owe domestically. It is as if your brother-in-law lied to his broker about his assets, cheated on his mortgage application by misrepresenting his income and then used one credit card to pay off the other.
Second, was the money used for a good purpose? In South Korea's case the loans were used to finance economic development and build an industrial infrastructure. There is no question that this is worthy. Unlike other countries we have bailed out, South Korea did not go on a consumption binge. In 1995, only about 10 percent of its total imports were consumer goods. The rest were capital goods to build productive capacity and raw materials and energy to drive those factories. Furthermore, Koreans work very hard. The great majority work six-day weeks, and it is easy to be impressed with their dedication and sacrifice.
On the other hand, those investments were made without much thought about the risks involved. The job of the Korean banking system was to say "yes" if one of the giant chaebol that run the economy asked for money. Under a web of protectionism and cozy relations with the bureaucracy, none of these companies ever got into trouble, even though their profit performance was poor. The national purpose was rapid industrialization and growth; gaining market share was the objective.
Assume your brother-in-law did not buy fancy consumer goods with his money. He used the proceeds from his home refinancing and his credit cards to build a position on Wall Street, which he leveraged further by using his margin account. Like South Korea, he was trying to get rich quickly, but he ran into trouble.
Third, what signals are sent if you finance the bailout? The Korean bailout is all being done very publicly. The United States Treasury and the International Monetary Fund are telling the other nations of the world and their creditors that they will be the lenders of last resort. Consider Mexico, which is being touted as a success. The money that flooded into the countries now in trouble really started flowing after our bailout of Mexico. The interest rate markups were unusually low for the supposed risk on these loans, and the greatest financing binge in world history quickly followed.
Remember, it is not South Korea that pockets the bailout money, but the large multinational financial institutions that get paid back. They presumably lent this money in the expectation of making a profit. Their job was to make sure of the creditworthiness of the people they lent to. They could have insisted that the accounting standards of their customers be cleaned up. They didn't, and lost.
Interestingly, American banks that were forced by the Federal Reserve and other regulators to accept more careful risk assessment standards and build their capital base were much less exposed to South Korea than European or Japanese banks. When lenders are burned on bad loans, they become much more cautious the next time around.
Back to your brother-in-law. Since everyone will know that you bailed him out, what will be the effect on your siblings, aunts, uncles and cousins? Will they borrow more and assume that they can count on you? For that matter, will your brother-in-law have learned his lesson? And, if all of the lenders in the country know that there is someone in every family just like you, will they supervise the loans they make as closely?
Finally, what happens if there is no bailout? Unable to get their money, the creditors take possession of the companies, factories and machinery that their loans financed and look for a new owner. The new buyers aren't necessarily part of the same bankrupt crony system; they are the ones who will pay the highest price. They may be American entrepreneurs or Koreans who have been on the outside in the past.
If the creditors can't get all their money back, they will take the loss and be forced to be much more cautious the next time. In some cases these losses may be quite large, and the regulators of these banks may be forced to take some remedial action (though these same regulators let their wards get overextended in the first place).
However, this route is far preferable to a bailout; both the South Korean and the world economies will be much better off. In South Korea, there will be much more competition and a greater focus on the bottom line. New credit will flow to the new owners much more easily than it would ever flow to the old deadbeats. All the "conditions" supposedly negotiated by the I.M.F. will be forced on South Korea by the market.
The parallel to our home-front analogy is this: Not wanting to see your relations on the street, you might consider your brother-in-law's house a good asset, assume the mortgage from the bank and allow him to pay you back. Let the other creditors get burned.
Rest assured, though, that you will have a lot more control over your in-law's behavior when you hold the mortgage on his house than if you simply bail him out. Not to mention, the chances that Aunt Sally will need a bailout next Christmas will be substantially reduced.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Foreign Minister of Mexico Is Named Finance Minister

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 5

 BODY:
In a surprise appointment that gives Mexico's booming economy an energetic spokesman well known to international investors, President Ernesto Zedillo today named Jose Angel Gurria his Finance Minister.
By choosing Mr. Gurria, 47, an economist and experienced financial negotiator who served as Foreign Minister for the last three years, the President opted to continue the conservative fiscal policies he applied to pull Mexico out of a depression. 
 The appointment ended an uncomfortable stretch that began on Dec. 15 when Mr. Zedillo designated the former Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, to head the central bank, known as Banco de Mexico. Mr. Ortiz is highly regarded by foreign business leaders for helping rescue Mexico after the peso collapse of 1994. The delay in naming a successor to Mr. Ortiz at the Finance Ministry generated fears that Mr. Zedillo might appoint someone deemed to possess lesser skills.
But Mr. Gurria enjoys a reputation as strong as that of Mr. Ortiz among United States bankers and investors as a result of his role as lead negotiator in talks to resolve Mexico's debt crisis in the 1980's.
"This is a guy who really knows his stuff," said Ernest W. Brown, chief economist for Latin America at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, who said he first met Mr. Gurria during the debt negotiations. "He was a hard bargainer who always used every tool at his disposal, but he was always unfailingly politically gracious."
In a slightly stilted ceremony including both Mr. Gurria and Mr. Ortiz, broadcast on nationwide television from the President's offices, Mr. Zedillo said he had instructed Mr. Gurria to observe "unshakable discipline" in fiscal policy and to promote domestic savings.
Mr. Gurria, a gregarious man who appears to thrive in the fray of politics, was also chosen to help Mr. Zedillo move federal budgets through a Congress dominated by opposition parties. That opposition is likely to grow more contentious with the approach of highly competitive presidential elections in 2000.
Mr. Ortiz is an academic economist, not known for talents as a political bargainer, but he nevertheless succeeded in persuading Congress to approve a lean 1998 budget that was almost exactly as Mr. Zedillo had proposed it.
However, Mr. Zedillo decided to shift Mr. Ortiz to a six-year term in charge of the central bank as part of a larger plan to enhance the bank's independence and give it responsibility for virtually all monetary policy, while leaving only spending management with the Finance Minister.
The President's goal is to lock in mechanisms to keep the peso stable past the end of his term, officials said. For the last two decades the end of each six-year presidential term has brought devaluations and economic upheaval.
Under current rules of the Government party, Mr. Gurria cannot be a candidate for president in the 2000 race because he has never held elected national office. As a result, analysts noted, Mr. Gurria will probably not leave his post before the end of Mr. Zedillo's presidency.
The new Finance Minister "will be navigating on a considerably calmer sea" than Mr. Ortiz, said Sergio Martin, chief economist for ING Barings in Mexico. According to estimates released today, overall growth for 1997 is expected to be about 7 percent, and inflation is expected to come in on target at just under 13 percent. Consumer spending, which remained depressed long after the larger economy showed signs of recovery, was up 4.5 percent in the first half of 1997 over 1996.
Just as Mr. Zedillo was announcing Mr. Gurria's appointment this morning, protesters allied with the Zapatista rebels in the southern state of Chiapas surrounded the Mexican stock exchange and delayed the start of trading by 45 minutes.
They doused windows of the dome-shaped exchange building, on a central downtown boulevard, with red paint and cluttered the entrance with miniature coffins, symbolizing the 45 people who died last month in a massacre that has been linked to a pro-Government paramilitary gang in Chiapas.
"The power of money is stained with the blood of the Indians of Chiapas," read a banner the protesters waved.

HEADLINE: THE BALANCED BUDGET;
Excerpts From Remarks By Gingrich on the Budget

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks and questions and answers by Speaker Newt Gingrich to the Cobb County Chamber of Commerce yesterday in Marietta, Ga., as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company:
So in summary let me just say I believe if we have the courage to take where we are -- we passed welfare reform, we've passed a balanced budget plan, we passed tax cuts, we passed a program to save Medicare for a decade without raising taxes. Now we are at a magic moment where if we are willing to take on the dialogue and say, all right, let's have an honest conversation: Should America be formed around "We the people," or should America be formed around "We the government"? 
 Can we in fact take the ideas that are transforming productivity in the private sector and transform productivity in government? Can we set priorities? Can we rethink programs? And could we set these four goals: A drug-free safe America for our children, the best system of learning in the world at all ages, a retirement program that is better and safer for everyone, and not having the government take more than 25 percent of our income from any American?
If we could set those four -- it will take us 10 or 12 years to work them all out -- but if we focused and got those four done, we'd leave our children and grandchildren a safer, healthier and more prosperous America. And I think that's a conversation worth having. I think we're adult enough as a country to have it, and I hope the political system and the news media structure care. . . .
Q Mr. Speaker, I was curious about the budget surplus that you mentioned. There was a lot of talk over the weekend about what to do with it. What do you foresee occurring? . . .
A I want to make two points on this. First of all, I believe unequivocally our first goal should be to get to surplus and in peacetime, to stay in surplus, and I don't think we should do anything that threatens getting to surplus. . . .
A number of my friends believe we may be able to be in balance this coming year, and therefore let's go ahead and not have a tax cut and not do anything -- let's figure out how we get to balance this year. And I'm willing to be talked into that. But I just wanted to point out the original radical notion that was laughed at in Washington was balanced by 2002, which is almost guaranteed now, barring a war or a very deep, deep recession. But I think we ought to start with a surplus.
Second point: The surplus's first goal should be to pay down the debt; in particular to pay down the debt to take care of the trust funds. We can pay off the transportation trust fund, and we could gradually begin to monetize the Social Security trust funds so we could have a safe Social Security system as we develop a more modern personal system for our children and grandchildren. That can be taken care of.
But the third point I'd make -- I would like to see us as a goal to try to get to at least a small tax cut every year. And my reason is twofold. First I believe if you cut taxes a little bit every year over a generation, you'll get down to the 25 percent level, and I think that's the right level. I would argue that should be the goal of the state and local level, too. So we have got to find some model that says the Fed is going to shrink X amount, the state and local are going to have their burden shrink Y amount, but we are all going to get to a total combined burden of the three of us of no more than 25 percent.
The second -- and I just want to say I don't understand the reasoning of some people in Washington. My second reason is real simple: You have a $1,600,000,000,000 Government. You can't tell me that we ought to waste -- basically what those who are opposed to tax cuts are saying is: "Let's waste another $5 billion on the earned income credit next year, because we don't have the nerve to solve it." "Let's waste another couple billion dollars in food stamps, because we don't have the nerve to solve it." "Let's not look at every single department and make them downsize their bureaucracy, because we don't have the energy and discipline to do it." So rather than give you a tax cut we are going to throw the money away in Washington.
So I would argue, as we did in our original contract, we were for a balanced budget with lower taxes with a less expensive Government.

HEADLINE: THE BALANCED BUDGET: THE MARKETS;
Rosy Budget Forecast Is No News to Investors

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Wall Street greeted President Clinton's plan to propose a balanced Federal budget next year with a resounding yawn yesterday -- but that does not mean the financial markets are not interested in the size of the Federal deficit.
Rather, the lack of excitement on Wall Street reflects the fact that traders and investors have already decided that the Federal budget is likely to be balanced, and that the deficit is shrinking. The President merely confirmed what financial analysts and economists already believe -- and meeting investors' expectations does not move markets. 
 "Some of the stock market's strength recently is because of the attitude that the budget is no longer a beast out of control and the deficit is decreasing rather than growing," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm based in Greenwich, Conn. Concern about the Federal budget and deficit, he said, "is in the market's past."
The President's announcement that the deficit for the current fiscal year will be less than $22 billion came as no surprise to investors, either. "I think the market expects a lot better than $22 billion," said Joseph Liro, chief economist for the securities firm CIBC Oppenheimer in New York. "The market very much expects a balanced budget, if not a surplus."
Stocks did rise modestly yesterday -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 13.95, to 7,978.99, a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent. The gains were not attributed to Mr. Clinton's announcement, analysts said, but by a rally in the bond market, where investors had become more optimistic that the Federal Reserve might take steps to lower interest rates.
"It's no secret to the bond market that the budget is essentially balanced," said Scott F. Grannis, chief economist for Western Asset, which invests billions of dollars for pension funds.
Calling the President's announcement yesterday "irrelevant" to the market, Mr. Grannis said that investors were focusing on a speech given over the weekend by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in which he discussed deflation. Many analysts said the speech suggested that the Fed would lower interest rates.
It was not so long ago that Federal deficits loomed large among investors' fears, and Wall Street clamored for a balanced budget. Big deficits lead to high interest rates, many economists contended, because when the Government spent more money than it took in, it had to borrow from investors, at home and abroad, to make up the difference. Competition from the Government made it more expensive for other borrowers, be they companies or homeowners, to get loans.
But interest rates have been falling since 1995, and have dropped sharply in the last six months. Meanwhile, fears about the deficit have died down, in part because the size of the annual budget deficit has been shrinking since 1993, and because last year the White House and Congress agreed to legislation that would lead to a balance budget in 2002.
Because Wall Street is so sanguine about the prospects for a balanced budget and lower deficits, there is some danger that markets could fall sharply if Washington disappoints investors, analysts said. Some are already expressing concern that the Government will be tempted to spend any surplus, rather than paying down the national debt.
But in general, investors are not expecting that the Government will do much to give a lift to the financial markets, Mr. Birinyi said. "I don't think the market's looking for Washington to do much," he said. "There's not another shoe waiting to drop."

HEADLINE: THE BALANCED BUDGET: THE REPUBLICANS;
Gingrich Calls for Tax Cuts Tied to Any Budget Surplus

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich said today that any budget surplus produced this year should be used to reduce the national debt and to pay for the first of a series of annual across-the-board tax cuts.
Mr. Gingrich spoke before President Clinton's declaration today that the budget he will send to Congress later this month will indeed be balanced -- a situation that has not occurred since 1969. 
 The Speaker said it was important symbolically to return any surplus produced by the strong economy to taxpayers.
Mr. Gingrich told a breakfast meeting of the Cobb County Chamber of Commerce that the anticipated budget surpluses should also be used to lower the national debt. And he said his long-range goals for future surpluses were to eliminate the so-called death penalty -- high inheritance taxes -- and to reduce the capital gains tax.
"The surplus's first goal should be to pay down the debt," he said, especially on the trust funds for transportation and Social Security.
But he added that it was an important goal to "try to get to at least a small tax cut every year."
Even in the first year a surplus occurs, there should be an across-the-board cut achieved either by increasing personal deductions or reducing tax rates, he told reporters after the speech.
"We should take a step in the right direction, even if it's a small step," Mr. Gingrich said. Such an approach to cutting taxes, he said, was preferable to tax cuts for specific groups like those in last year's budget agreement, which were for families, especially those with children in college.
Mr. Gingrich said that the drastically changed Federal fiscal landscape, widely anticipated in the coming years, should be used to gradually reduce all taxes, including local taxes, to no more than a fourth of an individual's income.
"I would suggest that in peacetime, our goal should be that all three levels -- state, local and Federal governments -- should not take more than 25 percent," he said, adding that the average is now about 38 percent.
Although the gathering was not a prayer breakfast, many of the bankers, accountants, power company officials and others offered spontaneous and hearty "amens" to the Speaker's calls for reducing taxes.
Mr. Gingrich cautioned that he was as yet unsure about whether there would be a surplus in the current fiscal year and said that he would know better in coming weeks when both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget issue their projections for the deficit.
Mr. Gingrich also agreed with President Clinton's call to have Congress address changes in the Social Security system before the end of the century. But he questioned the view of most analysts, who believe that doing so would involve considerable sacrifice. He proposed that Congress establish a commission, made up of members who represented three generations, to consider ways to buttress the Social Security system.
While not offering any specific proposals, he rejected the view that painful choices are inevitable. "Anyone who thinks you're going to have to make painful choices doesn't understand the marketplace," he said.
Mr. Gingrich said that he believed that the best, if not the only, opportunity to change the Social Security system would be in the "the 12 to 15 months after the elections this fall." After that, he said, the crosscurrents of Presidential politics would be too strong to deal with the matter.
The first weeks of a new year have become the period in which the President and Congressional leaders compete in presenting new ideas and laying out plans for the legislative session. But Mr. Gingrich spoke largely in generalities today.
"Everywhere in America lie people who make long-term decisions and have long-term discussions, except in politics and government," he said. "I would like to propose that we have an adult discussion, as a country, about where we are going and how we are going to get there," using a 20- to 30-year time frame.
Still, Mr. Gingrich showed flashes of his penchant for tossing out ideas, declaring, for example, that bilingual education should be phased out and all pupils should be required to read in English by the fourth grade. He also said that equipping teachers with cellular telephones, as is being done in a pilot project in suburban Atlanta, would increase security and efficiency in schools.
He declined to comment on reports that Mr. Clinton would propose allowing people ages 62 through 64 to buy their way into the Medicare system, to provide coverage between their early retirement and the time they become eligible.

HEADLINE: Miami Hopes New Manager Is a Sign of Recovery

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 5

 BODY:
In the six weeks since he took over as Mayor of Miami, Xavier Suarez has moved, in his words, like "a meteor the size of Texas."
Mr. Suarez dismissed one city manager, tried to remove the police chief, sought the resignations or transfers of 70 employees and went to war with the board appointed by Gov. Lawton Chiles to oversee the city's recovery from a fiscal crisis. 
 But today, stability may have begun to take hold as Jose Garcia-Pedrosa was installed as city manager and pledged to stay for the long haul. He is Miami's fourth city manager since November.
Mayor Suarez also announced that his new financial consultants had discovered an error in the city's five-year financial projections, and that the city was less in debt than had been thought.
The prospects for stability got another lift last month from the prosecutor's office in Miami-Dade County. Prosecutors said Mayor Suarez's personnel changes had violated the city charter, which allows the mayor only to hire or to dismiss the city manager.
To avoid prosecution, the Mayor agreed in December to six months of judicial oversight. He also agreed to rescind the personnel moves, except those involving the city manager's position. If there are no further violations, the state attorney will dismiss the complaint after the six months.
Mr. Garcia-Pedrosa, a 51-year-old former city attorney with law and economics degrees from Harvard University, said he saw less need than Mr. Suarez had for challenging the state's oversight board, which Governor Chiles appointed about a year ago to oversee Miami's recovery from a $68 million budget deficit.
"I intend to work closely with the oversight board," Mr. Garcia-Pedrosa said. "My position is we need to earn our way out of the oversight process."
The board is expected to vote on the city's amended five-year financial recovery plan on Jan. 14.
Widely considered to be a professional and tough city administrator, Mr. Garcia-Pedrosa served as city attorney from 1982 to 1984. He quit to wage an unsuccessful campaign to unseat the Dade County prosecutor, Janet Reno, the current United States Attorney General.
After the election, Mr. Garcia-Pedrosa went into private practice. He left his law partnership in 1995 to become the city manager of Miami Beach. In moving to Miami, he willtake a pay cut, to $96,000 from $148,000, but he said he expected the benefits package to compensate for the difference. The benefits are still being negotiated.
Mr. Garcia-Pedrosa said he was ready to participate in the "rebirth" of Miami after 18 months of financial problems and corruption scandals, and added, "This city is going up, up, up, and 1998 is the year to do it."
Mr. Garcia-Pedrosa said his priorities included putting finances in order and streamlining city agencies. He estimated that one-third of the city government's 3,300 positions could be eliminated in the next two years, largely through attrition.
"The first thing I hope to bring and have begun to bring to the city of Miami is a lowering of our voices and a tranquility," he said. "Miami needs to get off the front pages of the newspapers and stop being the lead story on TV and radio."
The appointment of Mr. Garcia-Pedrosa follows a monthlong shuffling of city managers, as Mr. Suarez, the city's first mayor to have extended powers, sought to put his stamp on the government.
The Mayor said the reports of turmoil in his administration had been greatly exaggerated, and he described Mr. Garcia-Pedrosa as only his second city manager. City Manager Alberto Ruder resigned after 23 days rather than dismiss the police chief; Frank Rollason, who stepped down last week as city manager, was an interim appointee, and Ed Marquez, whom Mr. Suarez dismissed, was appointed by Mayor's Suarez's predecessor.
Though acknowledging that perhaps he should have moved more cautiously, Mr. Suarez said the taxpayers wanted change.
"This is a government that can really use reform," Mr. Suarez said.
As city manager of Miami Beach, Mr. Garcia-Pedrosa helped to improve the city's investment bond rating, something he also hopes to be able to do for Miami, whose bond rating has been lowered to junk grade.
Miami's government has been in turmoil for more than a year. In addition to the financial emergency and bribery charges that resulted in the removal of three officials in 1996, the city has had seven elections in 17 months, including a referendum on whether Miami, one of 30 municipalities in Miami-Dade County, should continue to exist at all.
The city survived that referendum, but voters decided to change its form of government, giving the mayor executive powers for the first time and having City Council members elected from districts rather than at large.
But the legal problems are not over. The commission chairman, Humberto Hernandez, remained under Federal indictment on charges of fraud and money laundering in a case unrelated to city business. Law-enforcement agencies have also been investigating reports of election fraud, and former Mayor Joe Carollo has filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Suarez's victory.
Commissioner Willy Gort expressed confidence today that Mr. Garcia-Pedrosa would stay on the job. The commissioners have warned Mr. Suarez that they do not want to see any more new city managers.

HEADLINE: THE BALANCED BUDGET: THE POLITICS;
Free-for-All, Driven by Ideology and Special Interests

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
As unpalatable as they may have been to big-spending Democrats and tax-cutting Republicans alike, the rules of the game in Washington have been clear since the Federal budget deficit began spiraling out of control in the early 1980's: consideration of nearly every issue would be limited by the politics of austerity.
President Clinton's announcement today that he could balance the budget next year, three years ahead of schedule -- and his implicit acknowledgment that the budget could show a surplus this year -- left the rule book shredded. The result is sure to be a free-for-all, a grab driven by ideology, special interests and old-fashioned pork barrel politics for any windfall that comes the way of the Government and taxpayers. 
 In economic terms, moving from the $22.7 billion deficit the Government recorded for the year ended Sept. 30 into balance or surplus over the next year or two is not terribly significant. The deficit has already come down from a peak of $290 billion in 1992, and at its current level is only a tiny portion of the nation's economic output.
But in political terms, closing the last of the gap not only allows Mr. Clinton and both parties in Congress to say that they completed the job as they maneuver for advantage in this year's mid-term elections, but it also gives them freedom to move into a less constrained new era.
"I welcome other people to the debate," Mr. Clinton said, effectively pronouncing a start to the politics of plenty.
Both Mr. Clinton and Republican leaders cautioned against a rush to abandon fiscal discipline, although the evidence suggests that it has been a stronger-than-expected economy more than any belt-tightening or political fortitude in Washington that led to today's good news.
Moreover, the nation will undoubtedly face fiscal challenges again, perhaps sooner than anyone in Washington has been counting on if the economy turns unexpectedly down. Asia's current woes stand as a reminder of how sharply high-flying economies can fall.
But judging by the almost unfettered rush among members of Congress over the last several months to stake claims to any budget surpluses, no one is much listening to the warning signals.
Hours before Mr. Clinton's announcement, Speaker Newt Gingrich said any surplus should first be used to help pay down the $5 trillion debt the nation has accumulated over the years. But he quickly added that some part of any surplus this year should go to an annual broad-based tax cut of the sort that Republicans have been pushing unsuccessfully for years.
Indeed, after coming to a wary truce with Mr. Clinton last year in order to put in place a plan to eliminate the deficit, Republicans now seem eager not just to battle for big tax cuts, but to reintroduce their ideological argument that cutting taxes not only puts money back in the pockets of citizens but helps starve, and therefore shrink, the Federal bureaucracy and Washington's influence.
"There's a difference between a big government with a balanced budget and a small government with a balanced budget," said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. "That's why it's important to reduce the excessive tax burden on the American people, which in turn reduces the size and power of the government."
For their part, Democrats, while pledging fiscal responsibility, have been asserting that there is pent-up demand for additional spending -- they prefer the term "investment" -- on health, education and social programs.
"We face a set of delayed or deferred choices for the country, particularly with respect to children, with respect to our schools and our infrastructure," Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, said on Sunday on the ABC program "This Week."
And both parties show signs of succumbing to old political habits. Representative Bud Shuster, a Republican from Pennsylvania who is chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has won support from both sides for plans to increase spending on road-building, the kind of tangible project that members of Congress can point to with pride when they go home to campaign.
Mr. Clinton has yet to specify how he would allocate any surpluses but White House officials have been particularly wary of efforts by Republicans to pass big tax cuts. They said their fear was that Republicans might push through big tax cuts during a period of prosperity -- and then demand big spending cuts in programs that Mr. Clinton has battled to protect at the first hint that the deficit might reappear.
The jostling for a piece of the surplus is likely to be somewhat tempered by an emerging consensus within both parties that the good fiscal news provides an opportunity to confront the problem of how to keep the Social Security and Medicare programs from going bankrupt in the first decades of the next century.
The Administration said this weekend that it wants to help forge a bipartisan solution to the problems of Social Security in the next two years. Mr. Gingrich endorsed that timetable today. And although there is still no agreement about how to go about shoring up the retirement program, White House officials and Republican leaders said the elimination of the budget deficit gives them added political and economic flexibility.
"The job of dealing with Medicare and Social Security is now teed up for the political process," said Franklin D. Raines, the White House budget director.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CREDIT;
Bond Yields At the Lowest In Decades

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates fell to their lowest level in almost 30 years yesterday as weekend comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve convinced investors that the prospect of falling prices could force the Fed to cut interest rates soon.
While the remarks by the chairman, Alan Greenspan, left room for a wide range of interpretations, his mere mention of deflation, or widespread price declines, caused the bond market to rally. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 5.74 percent, the lowest level since the Government began issuing the bond regularly in 1977. And yields on other long-term debt, like corporate bonds, hovered at about 6.6 percent, levels not seen since the end of 1968. 
 Market analysts attributed the decline in long-term rates, which were above 7 percent in April, to the continuing good news on inflation -- now below 2 percent -- and the hope that the relatively rapid pace of economic growth last year will slow by just the right amount in 1998.
The drag on United States growth from the economic collapse in Asia, a flight of foreign capital into what are considered safe American securities, and the prospect of less Federal borrowing also helped the credit markets.
"These low rates were earned the hard way," said Robert V. DiClemente, the chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney. "They were done without extremely low short-term rates and in the midst of good economic growth," he said, adding that the low rates may last a while.
But even with long-term rates at new lows, shorter-term rates have not fallen so far. In fact, they are well above their levels of October 1993, when the yield on the 30-year bond hit its previous low of 5.78 percent. The yield on the 10-year note, for example, dropped to 5.51 percent yesterday, but is still well above its 5.17 percent low in 1993.
This means that the kick for the economy from falling rates might not be as big as the drop in long-term rates would suggest. Many rates that consumers pay for borrowed money and the rates that they receive on their savings are tied to shorter-term rates.
Rates for many consumers and small businesses are pegged to the prime rate, which has not fallen in almost a year. Mortgage rates, which are most closely tied to the 10-year note, are coming down, but they have further to go to reach new lows.
According to Bank Rate Monitor, the national average rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped to 7.09 percent in the week ended last Wednesday. That was the lowest since February 1996, when the average was 6.88 percent. Given that the yield on the 10-year Treasury has dropped almost a quarter of a percentage point since Wednesday, this week's survey number should be lower.
What caught investors' notice yesterday was a speech by Mr. Greenspan to a meeting of the American Economic Association and the American Finance Association in Chicago on Saturday.
He spoke of deflation, a prospect that has arisen as inflation has fallen below 2 percent a year and a rush of goods from troubled economies in Asia appears likely.
Just the mention of deflation by a Fed chairman who has made his reputation by fighting inflation led to speculation about his intentions.
Some interpreted his remarks as an indication that the Fed would soon be cutting short-term rates, rather than holding them steady or raising them. In this view, the Fed will try to stimulate the economy to keep prices from falling precipitously.
Those who believe that the Fed will be cutting rates, though, are still a minority of Wall Street strategists.
Market participants, however, showed a different bias yesterday, pressing yields on the Treasury's two-year, three-year and five-year notes below the 5.5 percent target that the Fed has set for its shortest-term rate, the Federal funds rate for overnight borrowing between banks.
Some analysts said the market had overreacted to the Greenspan comments. "Just because he mentions deflation doesn't mean that he thinks it's a big risk," said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "That is a big leap of faith."
Joseph Liro, the chief economist at CIBC Oppenheimer, said he expected Mr. Greenspan "to stay very resistant to raising rates." But, he added, in reading the speech "I didn't get an easing out of it."
Mr. Greenspan's speech was mostly about the problems of measuring inflation, but deflation did come up. "For most purposes, biases of a few tenths in annual inflation rates do not matter when inflation is high," he said. "They do matter when, as now, inflation has become so low that policy makers need to consider at what point effective price stability has been reached. Indeed, some observers have begun to question whether deflation is now a possibility, and to assess the potential difficulties such a development might pose for the economy."
Yesterday's rally sent the price of the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction of the yield, up 1 1/4, to 105 1/2. The enthusiasm carried over into the Government's regular weekly bill auction. Following are the auction results:

HEADLINE: With a Delightful January Like This, Who Needs Spring?

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
It would be difficult to underestimate the general giddiness that has greeted the great heat wave of January.
"This weather is giving my clients spring fever," said Bonnie Kogos, a travel agent who took a flurry of phone calls for tours to the British Virgin Islands at McCord Travel Management in Manhattan yesterday. "They're as restless as a willow in a windstorm. They're saying it might as well be spring." 
 Right now, she said, the warm spell has brought balmy climes to the forefront of her clients' minds, and so plane tickets to the Caribbean are hard to come by. And indeed, the mild weather, which began last Friday and is expected to last until this Friday, has created its share of instant economic winners and losers in a metropolitan region momentarily freed from the prison of winter.
This unpremeditated outbreak of mild weather in the darkest days of winter, caused by an unexpected air mass that drew in warm, dry weather from the Great Plains, is a good time for golf driving ranges, ice cream stores and vendors on the suddenly crowded streets. But ski shops, heating-oil companies and outdoor stores are hardly sharing in the general euphoria.
"It is never a good time for warm weather in the ski business," said Richard Carp, general manager of the Princeton Ski Shops on East 22d Street in Manhattan. "But if it had to happen, this is a good week for it. We just finished our New Year's sale on Sunday, and we were absolutely mobbed. So we see this as a chance to catch our breath."
Since Saturday, the 150 member companies of the New York Oil Heating Association "haven't been busy at all," said John Maniscalco, the trade group's executive vice president. "The longer this goes on, the more the impact will be. But that's just Mother Nature, and we're certainly used to it."
For the region's department stores, "it's white knuckle time, because retailers have a very narrow window in which to sell outerwear, sweaters and boots," said Isaac Lagnado, president of Tactical Retail Solutions, a Manhattan-based marketing consultant. "They have to move it now."
Sales of topcoats, parkas, loden coats, hats, gloves and scarves were sluggish during the holiday season, Mr. Lagnado said, and the early weeks of January "would usually be a chance for a second wind for such items on markdown," he said.
Ironically, though, the weather is helping sell more pricey items at other department store counters. "It's putting people into the early spring state of mind, and increasing interest in full-price spring merchandise," said Jason Weisenfeld, a spokesman for Barneys.
Yesterday many workers, grimly returning to the January blues and the realities of employment after an extended holiday, found the balmy winter interlude an unexpected gift. "Hard to believe it's January," said Robert Alvarez, a management consultant, who headed into the Eddie Bauer outdoor store on Third Avenue in Manhattan.
In his pocket was a $60 gift certificate he had received from his grandmother. He strolled past the microfiber down coats, the thermal gloves and the fleece-lined skiers' goggle cases.
"It's hardly the day to buy ski poles," said Mr. Alvarez with a laugh. After looking over some wallets and keychains, he left the store, gift certificate unused.
Yesterday was the kind of day when "everybody said they wanted ice cream when I said I was going out to the bank," said Rebecca Simon, an administrative assistant at Feinberg & Associates, a Manhattan law firm.
So there she was in Tasti-D-Lite on East 45th Street, placing four orders for soft-serve frozen dessert with Jay Brenner, the owner.
"Today business is up 100 percent over a normal Jan. 5," Mr. Brenner said. "Winter is not our friend. Business drops off by half."
Instead of huddling in company cafeterias, Manhattan office workers strolled outside for lunch and stopped at street stands. "It's been so cold lately, I'd usually be home by now," said Said Azizi, proprietor of a street fruit stand at the Avenue of the Americas and 43d Street. But yesterday, business was up 35 percent.
Across the region the warm weather will likely cause an increase in construction that is usually stalled by the cold weather, said John L. Wieting, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York City.
January is the cruelest month for the Broadway theater, "when business can be off as much as 20 percent," said Jed Bernstein, executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers. "This weather will only bring more people into our theaters."
Indeed, it has already. During the palmy afternoons of Saturday and Sunday, 13,205 theatergoers lined up at the reduced-price TKTS booth in Duffy Square in Manhattan, "up 31 percent over the same days last year," said Jack Goldstein, executive director of the Theater Development Fund, which operates the booth.
And for restaurant owners, the pause in winter "represents found money," said Tim Zagat, publisher of the Zagat Restaurant and Hotel surveys. "There is no question that this weather will fill restaurant seats that would otherwise be empty in a very slow week."
Maple Moor Golf Course in Westchester County had an unusually busy weekend -- 421 players on sunny Saturday and Sunday -- and drew 212 players yesterday. But yesterday morning, a group of 4-year-olds taking their first lesson were the only skiers on the slopes of the Thunder Ridge Ski Area in Putnam County.
"If we can just get down in the low 20's it will be all right," said Bob Conklin, the resort's owner.
Yesterday's sullen, overcast January morning yielded to blue skies and a high of 50 degrees in Central Park at 2 P.M., on a day when normally the high is 38 degrees.
Such January weather "is uncommon," said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. The cause, he said, is an abnormally warm, humid air mass that has developed between Bermuda and the Southeastern United States. It has "strengthened southwesterly winds that are bringing warmer air to us from the Plains states," he said.
Mr. Gadomski predicted high temperatures in the 50's until Friday, when the mercury will slide to the freezing mark.
Until then, in Rye, N.Y., the Feinsod Hardware Store has available "500 winter-weather related items," said Carmen Braiotta, the manager. "The problem is, none of them are selling."

HEADLINE: German Churches, Ever Giving, Ask to Receive

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: MORFELDEN, Germany

 BODY:
When Gert Holle began to prepare to become a Lutheran minister more than eight years ago, he braced himself for arduous studies followed by hard work and modest pay.
But now, five months before he is supposed to take his vows, the 33-year-old seminarian faces the one prospect he did not anticipate: unemployment. For the first time in memory, the bishop here announced recently that the church has jobs for only a fraction of the 48 seminarians who will graduate in May. 
 So after spending years studying theology, Greek and Latin, Mr. Holle is now cramming for a backup career in public relations. "At least in public relations you are working with people," he said glumly, as he stirred a cup of tea in his sparsely furnished apartment.
Mr. Holle's problem stems not from a crisis of faith, but rather a crisis in tax revenues. Under an unusual century-old system, religious institutions in Germany get almost all their revenue from a 9 percent church surtax imposed on the income tax of every registered Catholic, Protestant and Jew.
Taxpayers are asked to declare their religion on their income tax returns, and churchgoers are pressed to register their religion with the Government. Those who are not members of the religions covered by the tax do not pay it, nor do those who have taken the bureaucratic step of revoking their registration.
Church taxes totaled about $11 billion in 1996, almost as much as the sin tax on cigarettes. In striking contrast to the United States, with its separation of church and state, Germany uses its religion taxes for the salaries of priests and rabbis, the construction of churches and a sprawling array of church-run social programs, from Christian day-care centers and kindergartens to drug-counseling clinics and hospitals.
But now the church-state partnership is cracking. With 4.3 million Germans, or more than 11 percent of the work force, unemployed, and thus paying no taxes, church revenue fell about 4 percent in 1996. It could have plunged as much as 10 percent in 1997. That would represent a combined drop in revenues for all religions of more than $1 billion.
Here in the state of Hesse, the Protestant hierarchy slashed $40 million out of its $500 million budget in 1997 and for each of the next five years. In Stuttgart, home of Daimler-Benz, struggling officials have cut money for social programs and international aid. In Saxony, in eastern Germany, the Protestant churches are gearing up to sell or rent as many as 200 empty church buildings.
"The problems will not end quickly," said Bishop Peter Steinacker, who oversees the Protestant churches in the west German region of Hesse-Nassau. "All the economic predictions call for more than four million unemployed over the next two, three or four years. As long as unemployment stays high, the financial situation will not get any better."
Germany's church tax supports three main religious groups: the Evangelical Churches, an umbrella organization of Protestants that oversees the Lutheran, Reform and United Protestant branches; Roman Catholicism, and Judaism. Protestants, most of them Lutherans, account for 45 percent of the German population, with Roman Catholics at 37 percent. Jews represent only a small percentage. Muslims and others are not part of the tax structure.
Much like German industry, German religion is now preaching the need to cut costs, become more efficient and refocus priorities. In Munich, Protestant leaders even got a free strategic analysis from the management consultants McKinsey & Company. And they are talking about trying to wean themselves, at least partly, from the tax system.
In early November, Protestant leaders in Hesse announced plans to cut 25 percent of spending on 19 programs, like psychological counseling and adult education. Pastors will also be sent into retirement as soon as they turn 60, while new seminarians will be kept out. In addition, the church will sharply reduce its extensive support for kindergartens and cut the number of religion teachers it sends to public schools.
Over the next five years, church leaders in Hesse seek substantial cuts in the ranks of pastors. Their numbers have kept pace through the years with the growing wealth of both Germany and its churches, swelling to about 1,800, from about 1,200 in 1970. Church officials say they want to reduce that number, probably by several hundred.
"We became, really, a little fat," said Joachim Schmidt, a spokesman for the Protestant church in Hesse.
Though revenues have been stagnant for several years now, church officials say they were blindsided by the decline in 1997. For the first time ever here, seminarians will have to choose between unemployment and a change in career.
"We have tried to avoid unemployment among ministers," Bishop Steinacker said, "but there were simply too many. We couldn't anticipate the development of the economy."
Mr. Holle and many of his classmates were shocked as well as infuriated by the news. Most of them have spent at least eight years preparing for the ministry -- at a cost to the church of more than $100,000 per person. After graduating from college, they often spent years in church-sponsored social work or serving as deacons in small parishes. Then there is a two-year program of theology and pastoral work, and students are normally not admitted to this last step unless the church is certain that there will be positions for them when they finish.
Now they are stuck. "They say that our training should make us good for many kinds of work," said Frank Albrecht, one of Mr. Holle's classmates. "But we are competing with all kinds of graduates in the arts and humanities, and we have a disadvantage -- we're older than most of them." Indeed, many of the seminarians are married, and some have children.
Many are hunting for jobs in other parts of the country. Horst Frank, another classmate, is looking in Austria. "The problem," Mr. Holle said, "is that the kinds of work we are most suited for, such as teaching or social work, are just as difficult to find as being a minister."
The financial crunch is causing religious people at all levels to rethink their partnership with the Government.
It began when the state took it upon itself to tax people who went to church and to funnel that money back to the denominations. In exchange, the churches assumed a range of nonreligious responsibilities in areas like adult education and social work as well as providing religious instruction in public schools.
Today, seminarians like Mr. Holle argue that churches have become as complacent as government institutions and have fallen woefully out of touch with the concerns of their members.
As Mr. Holle and fellow seminarians wrote in a dissident newspaper they recently started, "The greatest danger for the churches is not primarily financial, but rather the anonymity and unapproachability of its functionaries." Mr. Holle argues that if churches relied on direct contributions from parishioners, as they do in the United States, people would identify more closely with their churches and dig more deeply into their pockets. But many Germans view the idea of passing a collection plate as tasteless.
High-ranking Protestant officials have begun talking openly about the need to reduce their dependence on the tax system. They are also trying to improve the image of the church, and have even created a new logo.
"I prefer to describe this as a time of fundamental change, rather than a crisis," Bishop Steinacker said. "There are real opportunities here to renew ourselves."
But the churches cannot wean themselves so easily from the system. Officials of the Roman Catholic Bishops' Conference in Bonn noted, for instance, that while the church now pays the state more than $100 million a year for its tax collection service, that cost could triple if the job was privately undertaken.
Meanwhile, churches have begun to pull away from responsibilities not directly related to church life. In the case of kindergartens, Protestant officials want to force either the state or parents to pay more. Under the budget plan here in Hesse, the church's contribution to kindergarten costs would drop to 15 percent, from 40 percent in some schools.
And children who do not belong to the church will have to pay extra.
"Parishes are explicitly instructed to obtain higher contributions from parents who do not belong to a church," the church in Darmstadt recently alerted members.
Mr. Holle and his classmates, in an unusually scathing and public criticism, have accused the church leadership of succumbing to the "dictatorship of finance."
"Our church leadership is built on sand," the group of seminarians wrote in their newspaper. "No ideas, no heart, its eye on commerce."
Those are harsh words for people still trying to get a permanent job from the church they are attacking. But Mr. Holle is not worried.
"What can they do?" he asked. "Fire us?"

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Following is an excerpt of President Clinton's remarks on the budget and answers to reporters' questions today, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company.
 
Statement
We can begin the year with some good news. I can now say that we believe that the deficit this year will be less than $22 billion. That means that it will decline for the sixth year in a row, a truly historic event. Twenty-two billion dollars is a far cry from the $357 billion the deficit was projected to be this year when I took office, or the $90 billion it was projected to be when the balanced budget agreement was enacted. So we have come a very long way. I can also say that the budget that I present to the Congress in February will be a balanced budget for 1999. Again, this will be the first time in 30 years we've had a balanced budget. And that's good news for the American people and for the American economy. 
 It continues the successful economic policy that we adopted. Beginning with the budget in 1993, which was the first major step, we have followed a policy of investing in our people, expanding the sales of American goods and services overseas and practicing fiscal discipline. We reversed 12 years of trickle-down economics in which the deficit of this country exploded year after year and our national debt was quadrupled.
So we have taken a different course. And thanks to the hard work and productivity of the American people, it is working. And I'm very, very pleased about it.
Now what we have to do now is to build on it, first, with the balanced budget, to keep interest rates down and keep the economy growing; secondly, with other policies, which I will be outlining in the State of the Union. I welcome other people to the debate.
But let me say I want to caution everyone that I will do everything I can to prevent anyone from using a projected future surplus as a pretext for returning to the failed policies of the past. We do not want to go back to the terrible conditions that paralyzed our Government and paralyzed our own people's potential in 1992 when I took office. We have to go forward.
This is great news today. I'm very pleased by it. The American people should be pleased by it. But we should be determined to stay on the course and do what works. And that's my determination.
 
Questions and Answers
Q. Are you ruling out a tax cut, Mr. President, with this surplus?
A. I do not -- let me just say -- I want to say just exactly what I said. We don't have a surplus. We can project a surplus, but we don't have one. And we've waited 30 years for a balanced budget. Between 1981 and 1992, we projected all kinds of things and went out and spent the money, on tax cuts and spending, both. We spent the money. And we quadrupled the debt, drove up interest rates, put our country in a terrible hole. Now, we have dug ourselves out of that hole with a lot of effort and a lot of pain. In 1993 it was a very difficult dig, and a lot of people paid a very high price for it. Then we had the overwhelming bipartisan support for the balanced budget.
All I'm saying is that any policy we adopt must not, it cannot, run any risk of returning to the failed policies of the past. We got away from trickle-down economics. We're into investing and growing our future. We're doing it the old-fashioned way. I have been exhorting the American people for five years now to be responsible, to remember that we cannot have opportunity without responsibility. Well, that same rule applies to the Government. We have to set a good example. We have to create opportunity, and we can't do it unless we're also responsible. So, whatever policies we adopt has to be within the framework of the budget to the best of our knowledge. We cannot take risks with the future that we have worked so hard to build.
Q. Mr. President, are you going to call for cigarette tax increases to help pay for new initiatives?
A. I will -- first of all, on the tobacco issue generally, and I'll have more to say about this later, but keep in mind what my first priority is. My first priority is to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco, from the illegal dangers of tobacco. And I will propose a plan that I believe is best designed to do that; that will build on the settlement agreement that was reached earlier. And I will work with members of Congress, in both parties, in good faith to try to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation that I think will achieve that goal. And I'll say more about the details later.
Q. Mr. President, there has been some controversy today about whether the press invaded your privacy in St. Thomas. Do you feel your privacy was invaded? And where should the press draw the line, sir?
A. The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second question is that's why we have a First Amendment. You get to decide the answer to the second question. But --
Q. You didn't like your dancing picture? Everybody liked it.
A. Actually, I liked it quite a lot. But I didn't think I was being photographed.
Q. Was it off limits, sir?
A. That's a question that you have to ask and answer.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
One Word From a Corporate Ex-Wife: Half

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
A LOW point in the previously decorous life of Lorna J. Wendt came two Decembers ago, when she found some jottings from her husband and learned that he planned to divorce her after Christmas. Within days she was simultaneously interviewing her own divorce lawyers and meeting with caterers for the annual corporate Christmas party that her husband, a General Electric executive, had asked her to give one last time.
The question, of course, is not why the Wendts were divorcing, but why on earth Mrs. Wendt agreed to play hostess. 
 "My personality is, unfortunately, that I don't like to disappoint," Mrs. Wendt said yesterday, sheepishly, in an interview in her lawyers' office in Westport, Conn. She did think about canceling the event, she said, but her two daughters insisted, "Mom, that's not you."
Mrs. Wendt, 54, paused for a moment. "On the other hand," she said, "maybe it was dumb."
No one these days is likely to accuse Mrs. Wendt of stupidity. As the very recent Stamford, Conn., ex-wife of Gary C. Wendt, 55, the chief executive of GE Capital Corporation, General Electric's most profitable subsidiary, she has set off a debate about the economic worth of the corporate spouse. Last month, in a divorce settlement closely watched by nervous C.E.O.'s across America, a Superior Court judge in Connecticut awarded Mrs. Wendt $20 million -- half the Wendts' hard assets -- but a smaller part of Mr. Wendt's stock options and future pension benefits.
For Mrs. Wendt, who argues that as a full-time corporate spouse she contributed to her husband's success and half the economic value of the marriage, that wasn't enough. Late last month, her lawyers went back to court. The ultimate goal: half of an estate valued by her side at as much as $130 million. Although 50-50 divorce settlements are typical, and are the law in 11 states, American courts have been reluctant to give the wife half when an estate is worth more than $10 million to $15 million.
It's not the money, Mrs. Wendt says; it's the principle.
So don't ask her why she can't get by on $20 million. "Of course that's enough," she said.
"But I can turn it around and say, 'Well, what does he need all that money for?' He's out there working, and I've been fired."
Mr. Wendt was in meetings yesterday with Jack Welch, the General Electric chairman, and then heading out of the country on business, and was unavailable for comment, said his spokeswoman, Cathy Callegari. "Unlike Mrs. Wendt, he has a job to do," Ms. Callegari said.
In court, Mr. Wendt said that he was almost entirely responsible for the creation of the Wendts' assets. He has also said that he felt lonely in the marriage, and has given as an example Mrs. Wendt's refusal to take golf lessons. He is now seeing a retired, 65-year-old businesswoman.
UP close, Mrs. Wendt does not seem so much an angry woman as a potent one -- a formerly dutiful, pre-feminist-era spouse who has been empowered by both the public spectacle and private humiliation of her divorce. She grew up in Rio, Wis. (population 700), in the late 1950's and early 60's, a time when women were told that marriage and motherhood were the ultimate careers. Friends say that what has been most stunning to Mrs. Wendt is her realization that society does not necessarily view marriage as an equal partnership. "When I first met with one of my lawyers," Mrs. Wendt recalled, "he said, 'You're not going to get half.' And I said, 'What!' "
Mrs. Wendt says she began to see things differently about eight years ago, when she started going on wilderness survival trips run by Outward Bound -- first climbing Mount Kilimanjaro with her husband, but then heading out on her own for backpacking in Patagonia, living with native tribes in the Irian Jaya province of Indonesia and pitching a tent at 1:30 A.M. amid Costa Rican mudslides.
"I found within me a lot of strength I didn't know I had," she said. "I must have given up who I was as a person to my marriage."
Nonetheless, she still displays all the markings of a perfect hostess -- friends describe her as sociable, chatty, open. "May I take your coat?" she said yesterday in her lawyers' office. Then she inquired about coffee. "How do you take it?" she asked. One of Mrs. Wendt's lawyers, Sally Oldham, hung in the background, amused. "Lorna has made herself at home here," she said.
Mrs. Wendt trained as a corporate wife from birth. Her father was a Lutheran minister, and her mother a full-time wife devoted to the flock. "My mother was really a corporate spouse," Mrs. Wendt said.
She and Mr. Wendt were sweethearts at Rio High -- he the sports star, she the popular baton-twirler -- and went to the University of Wisconsin. After they married in 1965, Mrs. Wendt taught music and helped put Mr. Wendt through Harvard Business School (although Mr. Wendt's spokeswoman says Mr. Wendt's father paid the tuition). Then she quit to raise the children and support Mr. Wendt's corporate climb.
Mrs. Wendt said she bought and sold five homes, entertained heroically and found the schools and dry cleaners. Only once in 32 years, she said, did she tell her husband she was too tired to attend a business dinner.
"And he had a hissy fit," she said of an event in Warsaw in 1995. "He needed me for the social ability. He was not a schmoozer, and he didn't remember people's names."
This year Mrs. Wendt will be speaking for her new organization, the Foundation for Equality in Marriage. A piece of her advice: Get a pre-nup.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nagging Worries on Asia Deflate a Rally on Wall St.

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The first signs were bullish. The Dow Jones industrial average crept above 8,000 points early yesterday after European markets rallied overnight. Financial and technology stocks soared.
But before the day was over, investors were treated to another variation on what could become the theme of the year: Will or won't the Asian economic crisis take a bite out of one of the greatest bull markets in history? 
 The struggle between stock optimists and pessimists is not about whether a slowdown looms for corporate earnings; it is about about how much earnings growth will slow. Yesterday, victory went to the optimists, albeit just barely.
After an early rally carried the Dow average 70 points higher, heavy selling around midday pulled the blue-chip index 50 points lower, before it finally edged up to 7,978.99, a gain of 13.95 points in heavy trading.
Broader stock indexes were equally volatile. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, strong early in the day, finished up just 2.03 points, to 977.07. The Nasdaq composite index, up as much as 21 points in early trading, closed up 12.59 points, to 1,594.12.
Yet the earnings debate, as evidenced by yesterday's seesaw trading session, goes on. Some stock analysts say the slowdown will be muted by a healthy American economy, while others insist that weakening profits will eventually dismantle a record-setting three-year sprint.
The evidence would seem to be stacked against bullish investors. Largely because of the crisis in Asia, Wall Street strategists have tempered their forecasts, and analysts have trimmed earnings estimates.
History also suggests a slowdown is coming. For a record three consecutive years, the Dow average has risen 20 percent or more annually. The end of 1997 also marked the best 10-year period on record for the Dow. In the 1990's alone, the Dow is up 191 percent.
Even more, the economy is well into its seventh year of expansion, and although wage pressures have begun to rise, inflation has not.
This kind of economy, some stock analysts say, is inevitably followed by a slowdown and weaker share prices. But while many analysts are expecting a year of modest stock returns of, say, 5 percent to 8 percent, at least one stock researcher sees gains of up to 15 percent.
Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch, said the bull market had been powered by a period of incredibly stable inflation, creating an economy and stock market quite different from those in earlier periods.
Much of the credit, he said, goes to Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who has been a vigilant inflation fighter.
"You have to remember, the last 18 years are probably the first 18 years in history where the Federal Reserve was intent on killing inflation," Mr. Bernstein said yesterday. "And nothing kills the value of financial assets more vehemently than inflation."
Although the gains of recent decades are unusual, he said, they are exactly what should be expected in a noninflationary economy. One reason is that to bolster profits, corporations have had to overhaul themselves or increase productivity since they cannot easily raise prices.
For those reasons, the current economy and stock market do not easily yield to historical statistics. "The economy is fundamentally different than it was 25 years ago," Mr. Bernstein said. "Yet you don't have the universal acceptance that this is a different period."
At the other end of the spectrum is Barton Biggs, the global strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company and one of the most bearish of Wall Street bears.
Mr. Biggs says the stock market could fall as much as 25 percent this year, largely because the Asian contagion may spread.
"The U.S. economy is beginning to slow, the European economies are beginning to slow, and we're going to see less growth than is now expected," he said yesterday. "A loss of pricing power is going to continue and earnings are going to be disappointing."
A big decline in the market is likely, he said, because the stock market in the United States has been "priced for perfection."

HEADLINE: Panel Seeks H.M.O. Overseer For California, a Bellwether

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Grappling with the future of managed health care in the nation's most populous state, a special advisory commission recommended today that California establish a new agency to oversee the administration of health maintenance organizations and enact a wide range of measures intended to protect consumers and improve care.
The managed-care revolution has gone further in California than in any other state, with more than 70 percent of insured Californians now in some kind of managed-care plan. The public backlash against its shortcomings has been equally pronounced. The commission, the Managed Health Care Improvement Task Force, was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson and the California Legislature last spring after a raft of piecemeal legislative proposals for change. 
 At a time when states and the Federal Government are wrestling with how to assure that the financial savings achieved by managed care do not undermine patient care, the panel's recommendations are considered likely to carry weight nationally. In California, the immediate practical effect will be to give renewed impetus to some 70 pending bills -- some of which Mr. Wilson vetoed in the past -- that would guarantee patients easier access to care, including wider access to specialists and prescription drugs without administrative hurdles.
The commission's executive director, Philip J. Romero, who is also Mr. Wilson's chief economist, said its members, who are representatives of the health care industry and of consumer groups, had been "very aware of the national implications" of their work.
"More than 70-plus percent of Californians are in managed care, and nationally it's more like 40 to 45 percent," Mr. Romero said. "Eventually the nation will catch up, but we're probably four to five years ahead of the rest of the country right now."
The recommendations of the 30-member panel, headed by Alain Enthoven, a Stanford University economist regarded as a father of the managed-care movement, are nonbinding, and the commission itself did not attempt to list priorities among its more than 100 recommendations, or estimate the costs of the proposed changes.
But the debate here is likely to play out nationally as Congress struggles with the same issues this year. In a preview of that debate, those speaking for the industry today complained that the commission's recommendations amounted to costly micromanagement while those speaking for consumers said they did not go far enough.
As part of its work, the task force commissioned a poll, which found that while three-quarters of insured Californians were generally satisfied with their health care coverage, just over 40 percent had experienced a variety of problems in the last year, from being forced to change medications to being denied care or treatment they thought they needed, with the sickest residents reporting the most problems.
At the center of the panel's recommendations is the creation of a state entity to oversee managed-care plans, replacing the California Department of Corporations, a securities regulatory body that has been widely criticized as an inadequate overseer of H.M.O.'s over the past 20 years. But the task force disagreed over whether such an agency should be headed by a single gubernatorial appointee (as the health care industry wanted) or by a board with legislative and gubernatorial appointees (favored by consumer groups) and made no recommendation on that issue.
The panel also recommended a study of consolidating all health care regulation under the new agency, and establishing an "unbiased, independent, third-party" state review process for resolving patients' complaints over denial of treatments. This would include establishing uniform procedures for resolving complaints; for example, guaranteeing patients the right to appear in person at grievance hearings. It also recommended requiring health plans to collect and publish more detailed information on consumer complaints and to standardize their plan descriptions to make it easier for patients to comparison shop.
Representatives of both the health care industry and consumer interests today criticized the panel's final recommendations for falling short of the task at hand, albeit from opposite perspectives.
Myra Snyder, the president of the 40-member California Association of Health Plans, the state's largest organization of H.M.O.'s, insuring some 18 million people, said it was "disappointed that the task force really didn't take a systemic approach to the health plans and review what works and what doesn't," but had instead endorsed a grab-bag of proposals attempting to satisfy various interest groups.
"There are no priorities, by their own admission, and there are no cost estimates, so you're getting into extreme micromanagement of the health plans," Ms. Snyder said. "By the sheer volume of the recommendations, we anticipate that this legislative session will see another flood of bills."
Assemblyman Martin Gallegos, a chiropractor from the San Gabriel Valley who is co-chairman of the Legislature's conference committee on managed care and was also a member of the task force, agreed with that prediction. He has already vowed to reintroduce his own bill to allow a patient to continue to receive drugs for a chronic condition, even if the patient's health plan removes that prescription from its list of approved drugs. The task force endorsed a similar idea.
"In many very important instances, the recommendations of the task force fall very short of the types of reforms we really need to have for H.M.O.'s in California," added Mr. Gallegos, who has also proposed a ballot referendum for November that would make it easier for patients to sue health maintenance organizations for malpractice. "Nevertheless, I think you're going to see a push on the part of the Legislature for stronger reforms."
Mr. Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh, said that the Governor intended to use the task force report as a "resource" in evaluating possible legislative changes in the future, rather than embracing or rejecting any of its recommendations now.
"It's a repository that we'll go to as we deal with probably over 100 bills that'll be headed toward the Governor's desk this year," Mr. Walsh said.
Mr. Romero, the commission's executive director, said he believed its recommendation for adopting more sophisticated payment techniques intended to discourage health plans or hospitals from seeking to enroll only the healthiest patients could be especially significant. Under this proposed system, known as "risk adjustment," health plans would all pay a percentage of their revenues into a pooled fund, which would then be redistributed to plans whose patients are older and sicker than the insured population as a whole, to avoid punishing such plans for taking on that burden.
Such a process is highly technical, and there is debate about whether it is feasible, but the task force recommended that it be adopted by the giant California Public Employees Retirement System and then phased in for the University of California system and other large insurance purchasing groups.
Mr. Romero said managed care was now so widespread, and some problems with it so evident, that some changes were now inevitable.
"Even the most blue-blood, conservative Republican politicians, if they're not in managed care themselves, have friends and relatives who are," he said. "And they all have horror stories, whether they're true or not."

Samsung to Slash Its Overseas Production

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Tuesday, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Samsung Group, South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, said today that it would cut electronics production in China and Southeast Asia by 40 percent as part of a worldwide retrenchment.
The cuts reflect Samsung's anticipation of the slowest economic growth in South Korea for at least 18 years as the country seeks a way out of a crisis that has halved the value of the won, South Korea's currency, in the last three months. 
 The won's decline has made it far more expensive for South Korean businesses to repay foreign loans and buy imported materials. But South Koreans could benefit from the Samsung cutback because the retrenchment means the company will export more from domestic factories and create up to 5,000 jobs at home.
Samsung Group employs 260,000 people worldwide in businesses ranging from electronics to shipbuilding to finance. The 60-year-old company has about $45 billion in assets and about $5.2 billion in annual overseas sales.
Samsung's announcement coincided with a visit to the United States by South Korean officials seeking help in repackaging billions of dollars in short-term debts.
Optimism that Seoul will overcome the debt crisis helped South Korean stocks rise 1.17 percent by midday today after a 2.9 percent gain Monday.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in New York on Monday that a debt-restructuring agreement must be found to "enable Korea to return to a situation of stability."

Japan to Try to Save Banks By Buying Stakes in Them
The Japanese Government is drafting a law to bail out banks by purchasing a stake in them, akin to the way the United States Government rescued banks during the Depression years.
The legislation, which could be presented to Parliament next week, appears to be the core of an increasingly ambitious effort to strengthen Japan's frail banking system. The size of that effort, originally estimated at 10 trillion yen a month ago, has tripled to 30 million yen in the last few weeks, roughly $225 billion at current exchange rates. Page D4. 

Thailand Seeks Different Terms
The weakening of Thailand's currency, the baht, and its worsening economic crisis have led its Prime Minister to ask the International Monetary Fund to ease the terms of its $17.2 billion bailout package. D4.

HEADLINE: THE BALANCED BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON WILL SEEK BALANCED BUDGET IN '99 INSTEAD OF '02

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he would propose a balanced Federal budget for 1999, three years ahead of schedule, signaling a halt and perhaps an end to the deficit politics that have confined the dreams of a generation of Presidents and lawmakers.
Predicting that the deficit in 1998 would fall to less than $22 billion -- a virtual rounding error in a budget of more than $1.7 trillion -- President Clinton in effect marked the fiscal equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The deficit has governed domestic politics much as the Soviet threat defined foreign policy, curbing Democratic hopes for spending, and limiting Republican hopes for tax cuts. "We have come a very long way," Mr. Clinton said in brief public remarks in the Cabinet Room of the White House, where he met with his economic advisers today. 
 The budget was last balanced in 1969. The last time a President even proposed a budget he said would balance was in 1971, when President Richard Nixon did, but Congressional and economic facts of life thwarted him.
Crediting the "hard work and productivity of the American people" as well as his own policies with reducing the deficit, the President cautioned against "using a projected future surplus as a pretext for returning to the failed policies of the past." Excerpts, page A12.
But in acknowledging today what private-sector economists and Congressmen have believed for months -- that robust economic growth was cutting the deficit far faster than expected -- Mr. Clinton was sure to encourage what has already become politicians' favorite new parlor game here: how to spend the surplus.
Even some of the President's own aides, in predicting balanced budgets beyond 1999, indulged in a bit of the euphoria today. "You'll see surpluses as far as the eye can see," said Gene Sperling, the director of the President's National Economic Council.
Even so, Administration officials acknowledged that the nation faced serious long-term fiscal challenges, especially the looming insolvencies of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
In an appearance in Marietta, Ga., before the President's announcement today, Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had urged Mr. Clinton only two weeks ago to propose a balanced budget for 1999, also cautioned policy makers to keep the budget in surplus once it gets there. He said that the "surplus's first goal should be to pay down" the Federal debt, which is about $5.4 trillion. But he said that he also favored setting as a goal "at least a small tax cut every year." Page A13.
Asked today whether he ruled out a tax cut this year, Mr. Clinton repeated his exhortations about not spending money the Government does not yet have. "We cannot take risks with the future that we have worked so hard to build," he said.
Under the balanced budget agreement reached by the White House and Congress last year, the deficit was supposed to rise in 1998 and remain flat in 1999 before declining and then vanishing in 2002. As recently as Sunday, top Clinton Administration officials were refusing to discuss the idea that a surplus could come sooner.
The deficit in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 of this year was supposed to be $90 billion, although in August the Administration cut that estimate to $58 billion.
The Administration declined to disclose its assumptions about future economic performance, which are critical to any predictions about tax revenues and hence, deficits.
Even the finest economic model could prove disastrously wrong, if economic turmoil in Asia or an unexpected shock to the economy, like an oil shortage, surprised policy makers.
But Mr. Sperling said that forecasts of "both good and bad times" were "built into the budget assumptions." For five years, the Administration's forecasting has proved pessimistic, with revenues regularly exceeding expectations.
As a result, the robust economy has permitted Mr. Clinton to cut the deficit without causing undue pain to his most cherished programs. Tax revenues have been so healthy that both he and the Republicans have been able to finance new proposals.
But stricter fiscal discipline has played a role in shrinking the deficit. President Clinton arrived at that approach reluctantly, after taking office in 1993 with plans for substantial new spending on highways, health care and other programs.
Mr. Clinton never mentions it, but a tax increase signed at great political cost by President George Bush began the work of deficit reduction. While Mr. Clinton campaigned on pledges to cut the deficit and increase spending, he concluded after a battle among his economic advisers that he would have to put greater emphasis on deficit reduction before interest rates would fall. Then, further reining in his spending plans, Congress torpedoed his proposal to stimulate the economy by increasing financing for the nation's infrastructure.
Mr. Clinton's economic plan in 1993, which included a tax increase on wealthy Americans, passed without a single Republican vote in favor, as he frequently notes now at Democratic fund-raisers. Mr. Clinton's aides argue that that tax increase has substantially cut the deficit.
Since then, the President has been forced, according to rules governing budget negotiations, to find sources of revenue for each new program he proposed.
His aides say that as a result, he has been able to increase spending for his priorities, like medical research and education, while counteracting years of Republican criticism of big government.
Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Clinton's senior adviser, said that showing that "Washington can in fact be fiscally responsible does bring back a different vision of Government as an affirmative force, a force for good."
Mr. Clinton is expected to seek a raft of new spending initiatives in his budget, including money to expand child care and to encourage businesses to cut pollution. But Franklin D. Raines, the budget director, said the Administration was not using part of "any projected surplus to pay for initiatives."
"We are doing it the old-fashioned way," he said.
The Administration is also likely to try to close tax loopholes and take other measures to raise revenues, but the Republican-controlled Congress will probably reject such steps as tax increases.
Mr. Clinton is planning to seek substantial increases in tobacco taxes, as part of a broad effort to put into law the settlement negotiated last year between the tobacco industry and states attorneys general. Mr. Raines said that the tobacco revenue would not be used to help pay for Mr. Clinton's 1999 budget. "The tobacco legislation that we will be supporting will be self-contained and will have a net-zero impact on the rest of the budget," he said.
Mr. Clinton is expected to announce on Tuesday a proposal to permit younger retirees, age 62 through 64, to buy into the Medicare program by paying premiums. That proposal, which has been sharply criticized by Republican leaders, would be financed through further changes in Medicare, so it should have no impact on the President's budget plan.
For weeks, Mr. Clinton's aides have been leaking the President's forthcoming budget priorities, part of a time-honored political ritual in advance of the President's formal announcement of his budget next month. Mr. Clinton, who returned to Washington on Sunday after a vacation, appeared eager today to set the terms dramatically for the coming budget negotiations.
Mr. Raines said that it was only this morning that the Administration's budget planning became detailed enough that he could generate reliable deficit estimates for 1998 and 1999.
"People had been working all weekend on coming up with a number for what did 1998 look like, and what did 1999 look like," Mr. Raines said. "As soon as that number had firmed up so that I was sufficiently convinced of it, I communicated that to the President."

HEADLINE: Medical Research Funding

 BODY:
Only a year or two ago, the nation's research community was in despair over a potentially bleak future. Congress and the Administration had agreed to balance the budget by the year 2002, threatening huge cuts in science and other "discretionary" programs. But now champions of research in both political parties are vying to pump large sums into the politically popular biomedical sciences. It is a startling turnabout that could save American research from mindless cutting -- or dangerously distort its priorities.
The push for more medical research comes from two directions, as described by the Times reporter Robert Pear last Saturday. President Clinton's new budget will propose a $1 billion boost for the National Institutes of Health, the Government's chief medical research agency -- a 7 percent increase over the current $13.6 billion level. He will undoubtedly be outbid by Congress, where lawmakers from both parties have talked of doubling the agency's budget in five years, which would mean annual increases averaging 15 percent. 
 Biomedical research has always been a political favorite, given that every lawmaker has constituents who are ill and many have had medical tragedies in their own families. The fiercely aggressive medical lobbies have no trouble gaining attention for their favorite causes. But this year the drive for more funding is also fueled by a belief among the conservative Republicans who control Congress that research in general, and biomedical research in particular, help generate economic growth. There is also concern that the expansion of managed care has sharply reduced hospital revenues that were previously used to support research, suggesting that more Federal research money will be needed just to stay even.
If the bipartisan drive saves research from devastating cuts or actually increases overall spending, the nation is bound to benefit. But it would make little sense to force-feed biomedical research at 15 percent growth rates at the expense of other vital scientific areas, such as physics, chemistry, energy and environmental sciences, that may be just as worthy as medical research even though they lack its political appeal.

HEADLINE: Family and Police Seek Missing Times Square Reveler

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
For the last few years, Lawrence R. Andrews and a half-dozen or so of his friends have journeyed from Brewster, N.Y., to Times Square to ring in the new year. They followed a routine familiar to suburban revelers: Hop on an evening train. Go to some bars. Celebrate with the masses as the ball drops. Go home feeling merry.
But this year, Mr. Andrews -- who the police said was drunk -- somehow became separated from his friends just after midnight on the inhospitably cold night. And yesterday, five days into 1998, Mr. Andrews was still missing. 
 On Sunday and again yesterday, Mr. Andrews's family visited midtown Manhattan and plastered the area with 3,000 fliers that show a picture of Mr. Andrews and phone numbers for the city's Midtown South police station house. Family members said they would continue to hand out the fliers until they know what happened to Mr. Andrews, 22, an unemployed landscaper who is 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 190 pounds.
"It's been up and down," said Mr. Andrews's sister, Jennifer Andrews, 25, describing the family's emotions. "But we have to do what we have to do."
The case is reminiscent of that of Patrick McNeill, a 21-year-old Fordham University student who was last seen by friends leaving a bar on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The disappearance prompted a citywide search by Mr. McNeill's family and more than 1,000 volunteers. His body was found floating near a pier in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, in April, two months after he had disappeared.
But for Brewster, a working-class community of about 1,500 people in Putnam County on the Connecticut border, the story may seem like a continuation of what was already a very bad 1997.
In the last six months, the village lost its first firefighter in the line of duty, suffered through an explosion at a hotel that claimed two lives and mourned the death from a heart attack of a town councilman, Michael McEnery.
"It's just been one right after another," said Ruth Argo Mazzei, the clerk of the nearby town of Southeast, which handles some of Brewster's municipal business. "My kids watch TV and they say, 'We're on again, and it's not good news.' "
In Mr. Andrews's case, the police in New York City and Putnam County said it was too early to speculate on what had become of Mr. Andrews. But his friends and relatives said that Mr. Andrews was gearing up for a series of important family events -- including his sister's wedding next month -- and that it was unlikely that Larry, as he is known, would have just disappeared without calling anyone.
"I have my own phone line, and he calls me if he's in trouble, even if it's at 6 in the morning," said Ms. Andrews, who like her brother still lives at home. "So it's not like him not to call."
That evening, the family was not overly concerned about Mr. Andrews's itinerary: he was, after all, going to be with friends in a city he knew well, on a night he had celebrated before. They said the only thing that concerned them was the weather -- the low that night was a bone-chilling 16 degrees. So they asked Mr. Andrews to wear layers: a T-shirt, a black turtleneck, a black sweatshirt and a deep-blue ski jacket.
First, Mr. Andrews went to a friend's house to begin partying and drinking. The group then boarded a train, arriving at Grand Central Terminal around 10:30 P.M., said Daniel Stephens, senior investigator with the Putnam County Sheriff's Office.
Mr. Stephens said the young men went to two or three bars, all near Grand Central, before stepping outside and celebrating with the 500,000 or so other shivering souls crammed into Times Square.
But then, just after the ball dropped, Mr. Andrews apparently became separated from his group. "They turned around, and my brother was gone," Ms. Andrews said.
About 1 A.M., he was spotted at a bar inside Grand Central Terminal, where he bumped into some other Brewster residents and chatted about football and other subjects dear to him, his sister said. Then, somewhere between 2 and 2:30 A.M., he ran into two other Brewster residents -- but under more inexplicable circumstances, Mr. Stephens and Ms. Andrews said.
They said Mr. Andrews was last seen running in his T-shirt on 42d Street, heading west, away from the train station. He gave the other Brewster residents a Yankees cap -- which he did not have when he left Brewster. And he was no longer wearing the black turtleneck, sweatshirt or jacket.
Mr. Stephens said witnesses described Mr. Andrews as drunk, but not incoherent. "He was in control of his speech, he recognized people, so it wasn't like he was falling down or anything," Mr. Stephens said.
Mr. Andrews was not carrying much money, according to his sister. Nor did he have a bank card or any credit cards. And he may not have even had his driver's license because was arrested last year for driving under the influence and his license was being revoked, his sister said.
The family has checked with homeless shelters, hospitals and the city morgue. The only known medical problem that Mr. Andrews has is a slight asthmatic condition, which prevented him from joining the military. He is, however, a regular smoker.
On Friday, Mr. Andrews was supposed to go skiing with a friend. He had plans to watch the N.F.L. playoffs over the weekend to root for his beloved Pittsburgh Steelers. And yesterday, he was supposed to accompany his sister to the doctor. He even planned to start his own landscaping business.
But for now, all of these things must wait.

Video Center Is Set For West Harlem Site

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Broadway Video, a production company owned by Lorne Michaels, the producer of "Saturday Night Live," announced yesterday that it would open an 8,600-square-foot, $1.1 million video duplication center in West Harlem at 3280 Broadway at 132d Street.
The business, which is expected to open in March, will employ 20 people and will handle mass videotape duplication, packaging and distribution of broadcast videotape, fiber optic video transmission and videotape storage. It will expand Broadway Video's current video duplication complex in midtown Manhattan at 1390 Broadway, between 49th and 50th Streets. 
 Employees will come from the Strive/A.S.A.P. program, which teaches disadvantaged city residents job skills. Financing for the project is being provided by the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone and Citibank.
"What we are doing here is the right thing to do for our business and the right thing to do for New York," said Stephen Shippee, the chief executive officer of Broadway Video. "Not only are we providing area residents with employment and valuable training, but this opportunity allowed us an economically feasible expansion within the city." NICK RAVO

HEADLINE: SOCCER: NOTEBOOK -- METROSTARS;
Mondelo To Replace Parreira

BYLINE: By ALEX YANNIS 

 BODY:
The search for a head coach has ended for the MetroStars. They will announce in a day or two that ALFONSO MONDELO will be their fourth coach as they start preparations for their third season in Major League Soccer, which will release its 1998 schedule at noon today.
 Mondelo was hired last fall to be an an assistant to CARLOS ALBERTO PARREIRA, who left the MetroStars this past fall in order to coach Saudi Arabia in the World Cup finals in France next summer. Mondelo led the Long Island Rough Riders to the A-League championship two years ago. 
 RALPH PEREZ, who has worked as an assistant to all three MetroStars coaches -- EDDIE FIRMANI, CARLOS QUEIROZ and Parreira -- will stay on under the new coach. Perez, who coached at Old Dominion University for six seasons before joining the MetroStars, was an assistant to BOB GANSLER on the United States World Cup team that played in Italy in 1990.
 TIM MULGUEN will remain as the goalkeepers coach, a job he has had from the team's first day.
 The MetroStars' goalkeeper TONY MEOLA started working with the World Cup team in Orlando, Fla., yesterday. The goalkeeper for the Americans in the 1990 World Cup in Italy and the 1994 in the United States, Meola was recalled by Coach STEVE SAMPSON to replace BRAD FRIEDEL, who signed with Liverpool of England's Premier League two weeks ago and will most likely make his debut with Liverpool tomorrow in a game at Newcastle in the League Cup.
 Meola fell out of favor after the 1994 World Cup with BORA MILUTINOVIC, the United States coach at the time. Meola wanted to pursue other other career options, including acting and a tryout with the Jets of the National Football League as a place-kicker. He has been one of the top goalkeepers in M.L.S. the last two years.
 
WORLD CUP
 Iran is apparently desperate to do well in the first round of the tournament in France in its games against the United States, Germany and Yugoslavia. After they dismissed VALDEIR VIEIRA of Brazil as coach, the Iranians met with UDO LATTEK of Germany last week and offered him the job.
 Lattek, who is one of Germany's most successful club managers, with tenures at Bayern Munich and Borussia Moenchengladbach as well as Barcelona in Spain, said he was hesitant to accept the job because of the language barrier and having to leave his family behind for six months.
 "My main strength as a trainer is that I can motivate the players by talking directly to them," Lattek said. "If somebody has to translate what I say, then that's lost."
 
FIFA
 Soccer must be protected from exploitation by commercial and political forces, the FIFA general secretary, SEPP BLATTER, said yesterday in Singapore, where he opened the sport's first industry trade show. Blatter warned that the $200 million-a-year industry that soccer had spawned was in danger of consuming it.
 "There is a danger that our marketing partners are trying to take over the rights of football associations or clubs," Blatter told the 400 or so sponsors of soccer from some 50 countries that gathered for the show.
 Blatter also warned about political intervention and the dictating by sponsors of the times games are played in order to attract larger television audiences. He said that soccer's social, economic and political influence made it one of the most important parts of modern life -- and that it had to be defended against exploitation.
 
ENGLAND
 It took Chelsea 27 years to win the F.A. Cup, the most coveted prize in British soccer, for a second time, but it took only about 28 minutes to lose it again on Sunday. Six of the Chelsea players who beat Middlesbrough in the Cup final last May were in the lineup for the 5-3 drubbing by Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Sunday in Chelsea's first match to defend the trophy.
 Two goals from DAVID BECKHAM, after 23 and 28 minutes, two more from ANDY COLE, after 45 and 66, and a TEDDY SHERINGHAM header 15 minutes from the end of regulation time gave United a 5-0 lead. Two goals from the substitute GIANLUCA VIALLI and one from GRAEME LE SAUX in the last 12 minutes made it respectable for Chelsea.
 
BRAZIL
 The former Brazil captain CARLOS ALBERTO TORRES, who played for the Cosmos two decades ago, lashed out last week after he was dismissed as coach at Botafogo, accusing club directors of being dishonest and his replacement of being unethical.
 Torres, captain of Brazil's team in the 1970 World Cup triumph and the sweeper of the Cosmos in their glory days, was livid after GILSON NUNES gave a news conference confirming that he had been appointed coach before Torres knew he was dismissed.
 The country's so-called dance of the coaches has continued in full swing since the championship ended late last month and Botafogo did not make the playoffs. Along with Torres, EDUARDO AMORIM, who coached both Corinthian and Sport Recife in the Brazilian championship, became Portuguesa's third coach in two months -- and Portuguesa is generally considered one of the more stable clubs.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;
A Japanese Plan to Save Banks by Buying a Piece of Them

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Borrowing a chapter from America's rescue of its banks during the Depression, the Japanese Government is drafting a law to bail out banks in this country by taking a stake in them.
The legislation, described by officials in interviews today, appears to be the centerpiece of a Government effort to strengthen the banking system and lessen the risk of global financial crisis. 
 That effort, first announced last month, has grown in size and scope. The Government said on Christmas Day that it would set aside as much as 30 trillion yen to stabilize the banking system -- about $225 billion at current exchange rates -- and triple the original package of 10 trillion yen announced on Dec. 10.
Officials hope that the initiative will be welcomed by financial communities here and abroad, which have expressed growing anxiety over cracks in the financial system of Japan, the world's second-largest economy. They and financial-industry professionals share a nightmare that a Japanese banking collapse could ripple around the world with devastating effects.
To be sure, Japan in the 1990's is hardly a mirror image of the United States in the 30's. But many of Japan's banks have been badly strained by huge debts, and their frailty has helped stunt national economic growth here for years. The problems have only worsened as other Asian nations have suffered under debt burdens in recent months, most notably South Korea, one of the biggest foreign debtors of Japanese banks.
The bank-rescue legislation, as described today by officials in the Government and the dominant Liberal Democratic Party, would inject capital into banks in exchange for preferred stock, a plan modeled on the successful effort to salvage the American banking system in the Depression years. Officials said the legislation would be presented to Parliament as early as next week and could take effect in the next couple of months.
"The point is not the injection of capital itself," said Koji Yasuoka, head of the Liberal Democratic Party committee that is leading the effort. "The point is for the Japanese Government to show clearly the will to stabilize the financial system."
In the 1930's, the United States helped private banks increase their capital by buying preferred shares from both strong and weak institutions, which reinvigorated the banking system and helped pull the economy out of the Depression.
The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was created in the early 1930's to carry out the responsibility. But banks initially declined to take part out of fear that this would stigmatize them as weak and scare customers into withdrawing deposits.
Finally, Washington prevailed upon the J. P. Morgan Bank and Trust Company, the strongest institution at the time, to take the lead and issue preferred shares to the Government. After that, weaker banks thought that they could do likewise, and the plan succeeded.
The Japanese proposal has raised sensitive questions on the use of public money to help weak and strong banks alike. Some argue that bad banks should close rather than get a new life-support system. But anxiety about the banks and the fragility of the economy is so great that critics seem willing to accept the plan.
"Principally, I don't agree with the Government plan," said Satoru Yoshida, a professor of money and banking at Musashi University here. "As an emergency rescue plan, I must admit that it is necessary."
The financial markets have remained skeptical of the Government's efforts to help banks and invigorate the economy, as reflected in the languishing Japanese stock market and the diminished value of the yen. Today, Japan's currency touched the weakest level against the dollar since April 1992, and stocks dropped nearly 2 percent on pessimism about an economic recovery. On Tuesday morning, the yen was stable, selling at 133.73 to the dollar. Stocks declined by a further 127.17 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 14,829.67 at midday.
The bank-rescue legislation, which Finance Ministry officials have worked on through the New Year holiday, would empower a special Government-sponsored bank to buy preferred shares in ailing institutions. These shares would carry no voting rights so Tokyo would not, in theory, have a say in running the bank in which it took a stake.
While the plan would be used primarily to aid weak institutions, officials also hope to encourage strong ones, like the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, to issue preferred shares ahead of the others so that the plan would gain respectability -- just as J. P. Morgan lent respectability to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
Katsumi Tsuiji, a spokesman for the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said that while his company had been considering changes in its articles of incorporation to allow it to issue preferred shares, it had no specific intention to issue such shares yet.
According to the plan, a seven-member committee would decide which banks would be allowed to sell their preferred shares to the Government. Banks with a sound financial background that ran into sudden shortages of money would most likely be allowed to take part, as would banks that purchase hobbled institutions and would be weakened by such purchases.
But Tokyo does not want to be seen rescuing poorly run banks, so some would presumably be judged ineligible and would be shut down.
Those accepted under the plan would sell shares to the special bank, which would be managed under the Deposit Insurance Corporation, a Government entity somewhat similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States.
The Deposit Insurance Corporation would be given a total of 30 trillion yen to help support the banks, with 13 trillion yen of that going toward the preferred-share plan. The remaining 17 trillion yen would be used in part to buy assets of weak banks, though details about exactly how that money would be allocated remained unclear.
Talk about the legislation over the last few weeks has stirred intense debate. Will such a bailout encourage more unsound risk taking and sloppy management? Or will it impose strict conditions, in the way the International Monetary Fund attaches conditions to money used to bail out countries?
Critics have long argued that the Finance Ministry, and banking and other Government officials, have tried to save financial institutions that were insolvent or nearly so, rather than let them collapse.
A Finance Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that strict conditions would be imposed on banks accepted into the plan. "We know that people very much worry that the Government is going to extend its helping hands to ailing financial institutions who do not deserve public support," the official said.
At the same time, he acknowledged that it would be difficult to penalize managers of ailing institutions or to force them out, because few executives would take their banks to the Government knowing that they would lose their jobs.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 7, 1998, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about a plan to strengthen Japanese banks misidentified the country's biggest foreign debtor in some editions. It is Hong Kong; South Korea is the fourth-biggest.
Also because of an editing error, the article referred incorrectly in some editions to the Presidential administration that created the United States Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a 1930's effort similar to the Japanese Government's proposal. It was Herbert Hoover's, not Franklin D. Roosevelt's.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Boom, but Mostly for Planes

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Orders to American factories in November posted the largest increase in 14 months, but aircraft accounted for most of the gain and other industries showed signs of slowing.
The 2.5 percent advance to a seasonally adjusted $345.1 billion was the sixth in a row, after a revised increase of one-tenth of 1 percent in October, the Commerce Department said today. 
 Transportation orders surged 21 percent, the most since July 1991. For aircraft alone, orders doubled. Economists said airlines around the world need to replace their aging planes.
Excluding transportation, orders fell three-tenths of 1 percent in November, the second consecutive decline. And capital goods, like factory machinery used to make other goods, fell 1.5 percent excluding transportation and military orders.
"That may be one of the first signs that the Asian crisis is beginning to affect the U.S. markets, given that about half the capital goods produced in the United States are exported," said Cheryl Katz, an economist at Merrill Lynch.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Some newly issued stocks that flopped may deserve a second look.

BYLINE: By Reed Abelson 

 BODY:
NEW stocks seem more forlorn than neglected initial public offerings. Aimed at the moon, they fall with a thud, struck down by disappointing news or the sudden unpopularity of their business. They are left to languish in anonymity with few on Wall Street willing to give them a second look.
But some new issues may be prove to be worthwhile buys, according to Christian K. Stadlinger, a portfolio manager with Provident Capital Management in Philadelphia. Among the fallen offerings Mr. Stadlinger is considering is Ispat International N.V., a steel producer based in the Netherlands with nearly $2 billion in annual sales. Ispat is one of the fastest-growing steel companies. 
 Last August, the stock went public at $27. But the shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, dropped as low as $17.75 in mid-December after the company failed to win the bidding for a state-owned steelmaker in Venezuela. Falling steel prices have also scared many investors away from the stock, which traded yesterday at $19.125 a share, down $1.875.
Although further declines in the price of steel could make Ispat no bargain, Mr. Stadlinger wonders if investors are overreacting. At the stock's current price, Ispat has a price-earnings ratio of roughly nine times this year's estimated earnings, consistent with the other steel companies. But Mr. Stadlinger believes the company will be able to grow without going on a buying spree. "Fundamentally, it is a very, very nice company," he said.
The IRI International Corporation, a Houston-based maker of oil rigs and related equipment, is another example of a new offering that fell out of favor, Mr. Stadlinger said. Amid the enthusiasm early last year for oil-service companies, IRI went public in mid-November at $18 and quickly traded as high as $21.125.
Like other oil-service stocks, IRI was dragged down when oil prices fell. The stock, also listed on the New York Stock Exchange, traded yesterday at $13.1875, off 37.5 cents. Over the long term, IRI, which had sales of $242 million over the year ended last Sept. 30, should do pretty well, said Mr. Stadlinger, who is considering buying some shares.
Another new stock battered by sudden bad news -- its own -- is the National Research Corporation, a tiny company in Lincoln, Neb., that provides surveys of doctors and patients for health care organizations. Having sold 2.1 million shares in October at $15 each, the company announced less than two months later that it had lost its largest customer. That client, Kaiser Permanente-Northern California Region, accounted for 40 percent of its 1996 revenues of $12.6 million. The stock plummeted by nearly two-thirds, closing yesterday at $6.125, down 37.5 cents.
Linda Killian, an analyst and portfolio manager at the Renaissance Capital Corporation, a Greenwich, Conn., firm that specializes in the new-issue market, thinks National Research could a be a "very interesting" stock if "you still believe the company is viable, which it should be." The company's reliance on Kaiser had been declining and Kaiser had not been unhappy with National Research's work, Ms. Killian said.
The danger for investors in buying some of these stocks, she said, is that they may remain forever obscure. Wall Street analysts tend to focus only on those stocks that have already taken off.
National Research, for example, is largely covered by only two analysts at the two regional investment firms, William Blair and Robert W. Baird, which were responsible for taking the company public. Even IRI International is now followed by only one Wall Street firm, Lehman Brothers, also the company's underwriter.
Investors buying these stocks are also betting partly against the current market mood, which remains largely hostile to many small-company stocks.
For many investors, the strongest hint that new offerings had reached a peak came less than a month ago, when an investment banking company that specializes in taking other companies public went public itself -- and got a tepid response. The Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group, a company in Arlington, Va., that was one of the year's busiest underwriters, sold $220 million of its own shares in late December at $20 apiece. After a short spurt to $21.75 the stock has fallen, selling yesterday for $17.25, down 43.75 cents.
The doldrums in the new-issue market have quelled much enthusiasm for Friedman Billings and the stocks of other underwriters. Only investors willing to put all their money on the belief that the new-issue market will come roaring back should wager on Friedman Billings -- and investors are still refusing to pay much attention.

HEADLINE: Latin American Loans

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In contrasting the new hands-on government role in the Asian financial crisis with policy in the 1980's, a Jan. 1 Business Day article states that in the earlier period "the borrowers were Latin American governments, not the private sector." This is not entirely accurate.
In the earlier period, about 60 percent of Latin American loans were strictly private, but with the assistance of the United States Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund, the banks forced Latin governments to guarantee private loans as a condition of further lending. 
 The result was that Government-guaranteed loans rose from 40 percent in 1982 to 85 percent in 1987, adding $44 billion, or 25 percent, to the public foreign debt obligations of the region. This, of course, violated the spirit of free enterprise and the theory of the disciplinary role of private risk-taking as seriously as any later bailouts.

HEADLINE: Federal Express to Raise Shipping Rates

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Jan. 6

 BODY:
The Federal Express Corporation said today that it would increase rates for shipments within the United States an average of 3 percent to 4 percent on Feb. 15 and would expand its international service to include cheaper freight delivery.
The Memphis-based company said it would begin international economy shipping Feb. 2. 
 "For the first time we will offer a time-definite, cost-effective shipping option for international freight," said Greg Rossiter, a spokesman for the company, the country's second-largest delivery concern.
The new service will provide delivery within five business days to important markets in other continents and will offer tracking of shipments, Mr. Rossiter said. Federal Express has offered only international priority service, with delivery in one to three days.
Last week the United Parcel Service of America Inc., the nation's largest package-delivery company, raised its domestic rates 3 percent to 4 percent, depending on the method of shipment. The Atlanta-based United Parcel also said it would add to its international services, though those rates will remain unchanged.
The rate increases come as the companies race to expand internationally and at home.
Federal Express plans to open a new sorting hub in Paris, and it recently added 100 workers to its hub in Frankfurt. In addition, the company said in October that it would spend $50 million on a new hub in Miami to bolster its Latin American business.
Shares of Federal Express rose $2.75, to $63.875, today on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Seizing the Initiative

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
In his proposals to open Medicare to hundreds of thousands of people 55 to 64 years old, President Clinton has again found a way to appeal to voters while showing concern for middle-income families and putting Republicans on the defensive in an election year.
Republicans control both houses of Congress, but Mr. Clinton and his Capitol Hill allies still seem to set much of the agenda, especially on domestic policy issues like the minimum wage, health insurance and child care. 
 The basic Republican attack, renewed today, is that even if a program starts out with beneficiaries paying the full cost, subsidies will follow sooner or later, leading to a new, expensive entitlement.
Comments today by Administration officials showed why Republicans are concerned. While insisting that new Medicare beneficiaries would initially pay the full cost of their insurance coverage, the officials said Mr. Clinton might in the future propose Federal subsidies to help those unable to afford the cost, which would range from $3,600 to $5,000 a year.
The outlook for the President's proposals in Congress is more complex and uncertain than the simple partisan differences would suggest.
Labor unions and lobbyists for the elderly and near-elderly can put formidable pressure on Congress if they choose to do so. Business groups, especially the insurance industry, were generally cool to the President's proposals, but some employers may be glad to have their early retirees protected by Medicare. And the proposals for people 62 to 64 may be easier to enact than other parts of the package.
The costs of the new coverage may well exceed White House estimates, especially if -- as experts predict -- sick people are the ones most likely to buy Medicare coverage.
Republicans may ultimately be proved right on such points. But their warnings will probably not sway many voters this year unless the Republicans come up with alternatives to help older people who cannot obtain or afford health insurance because they have pre-existing medical problems or have lost their health insurance along with their jobs.
Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, asked today, "If the era of big government is over," as Mr. Clinton contends, "why is the President proposing all these Government expansions?"
Kevin P. Phillips, the political strategist and publisher of the American Political Report, said: "Clinton has a winning issue here for a number of different reasons. People feel there's so much money going to the affluent part of this society that they will support a program that helps those who need medical coverage just prior to reaching the Medicare eligibility age."
More generally, Mr. Phillips, who in recent years has strayed from his Republican roots, said: "Republicans are uniquely vulnerable on Medicare. Whatever they say, they really want to get rid of it. When Clinton forces them to deal with this issue, Republicans can't keep their eyes from blinking. Many of them look shifty."
Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, described the political potential of the issue today when he said the President's proposals would define the basic differences between the two parties. Republicans will eventually have to support major elements of the President's plan, Mr. Stark asserted, and if they continue to resist it, they do so "at their peril."
Mr. Thomas spoke for many Republicans when he described Mr. Clinton's proposals as "a crazy quilt patchwork system designed for political purposes."
The budget-balancing law signed by Mr. Clinton in August creates a bipartisan commission to study the future of Medicare and recommend ways of preserving it for baby boomers. The 17-member commission is supposed to issue its report by March 1, 1999, but has not begun work because Mr. Clinton and Congressional Republicans have been unable to agree on a chairman.
The commission is required to study the health insurance needs of people 62 to 64, but Mr. Thomas said Democrats wanted to use Medicare as a political issue in the next 10 months. "It's pure politics," he said.
Mr. Clinton's goals have not changed significantly since 1993, when he proposed an ambitious, unwieldy scheme to guarantee health insurance for all Americans. But his tactics have changed, as he pursues the same objective step by step.
"What I tried to do before won't work," Mr. Clinton conceded four months ago in a speech to the Service Employees International Union. "Maybe we can do it in another way. That's what we've tried to do, a step at a time until eventually we finish this."
E. Neil Trautwein, manager of health policy at the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, said, "We are acutely uncomfortable with piecemeal expansion of health coverage, especially when it's done through a huge Government entitlement program like Medicare."
And Richard P. Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America, expressed concern about the precedent.
"This is the camel's nose under the tent," Mr. Coorsh said. "Why stop at people 62 to 64, or 55 to 64? Some people will argue that Medicare should be even more inclusive."
Mr. Clinton promised that taxpayers would not bear any of the cost of expanding Medicare, but it is easy to imagine demands for Federal subsidies in a few years.
Deborah Briceland-Betts, executive director of the Older Women's League, which lobbies for women over 40, said today: "It's important that any new program have subsidies for low-income people, who tend to be women. The vast majority of older women who need health insurance protection cannot take advantage of the President's proposal because they are too poor to pay the premiums. Administration officials told us today that they were eager to work with us to provide some kind of a remedy to make the coverage affordable."
Gene B. Sperling, assistant to the President for economic policy, did not rule out such proposals in the future.
"If there are programs that help people, that don't have overriding negative incentives in the market, and are fiscally responsible and being paid for," Mr. Sperling asked, "who would be against that?"

Small-Stock Fans Hoping For a January Effect Rally

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Fans of small-company stocks are beating the drum once again.
For months, they said small stocks were poised for a rally. When the rally failed to materialize, they began to look expectantly to January. 
 The subject of their attention: the oft-discussed January effect, which refers to the habit of small stocks outperforming big stocks early in the year. Partly because once such patterns are identified investors respond to wipe them out, there has not been a real January effect in three years.
A few days into 1998, there is not much evidence of one yet this year either.
Still, small-company stock followers say the fundamentals remain in place for a comeback -- if not in the first days of the year, in the coming months -- and point to relatively attractive prices to buttress their case.
Last year investors saw less risk in big stocks than in small stocks, said Mary Lisanti, who manages portfolios of small and midsize stocks for the Strong Funds in Minneapolis. "When does the psychology change?" she asked. "I don't know, but at some point it will. I'm not sure about a January effect, but maybe there will be a February effect or a March effect."
In the first few days of many years past, investors have bought back shares of smaller-company stocks that they had sold in previous months to realize losses for tax purposes. During the selling, some stocks got beaten down so much that they became bargains. In recent years, the selling and buying spree began earlier and earlier, so that by late November or early December, investors had already sold and repurchased small-cap securities.
For that reason, small-company stocks have not outperformed larger- company issues during the first quarters of the last few years, explained Melissa Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities.
But this year, many stock analysts predicted the January effect could return with a vengeance. As the Dow Jones industrial average posted gains of more than 20 percent in 1997 for the third year in a row, the prices of many small stocks slumped. Furthermore, earnings growth is now expected to slow for many big, multinational companies because of the Asian financial crisis. Small companies, by comparison, typically have a domestic orientation.
And small caps are cheap. The price-to-earnings ratio on small-company stocks, usually higher than that on big-cap stocks, has fallen, creating a gap between small and big stocks' P.E.'s roughly near the 1990 and 1987 lows, said James Stoeffel, a vice president and emerging growth stock analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "I think you have some good names that are ripe for a bounce," Mr. Stoeffel said recently. "My sense is that you will have a January effect."
More than 50 percent of the 420 small-cap stocks tracked by Nationsbank Montgomery Securities finished 1997 off more than 30 percent from their 52-week highs. Michael Moe, director of growth stock analysis at the firm, predicts a comeback and favors companies that do business on the Internet, including E-Trade, Onsale and Preview Travel.
"You have a lot of beaten-down small stocks, valuations are compelling from a historical perspective and interest rates are low," Mr. Moe said yesterday, adding that he was not willing to give up on the prospect of a January effect just because of three poor trading days.
Broad market indexes suffered yesterday, amid concerns about the impact of Asia's slowdown on banks and on oil companies. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 72.74 points, to 7,906.25, erasing its gains for the first days of this year. The Standard & Poor's 500-company stock index fell 10.49 points, or 1.1 percent, to 966.58. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 13.98 points, to 1,580.14, while the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks edged down 3.96 points, to 433.10.
Since its big decline on Oct. 27, the Dow has rebounded by 2.5 percent and the S.& P. 500 has gained 2.6 percent. Still, the Russell 2000 is down 3.2 percent.
"When stocks are this cheap, it tells me the bulk of the damage has been done," said John Laporte, portfolio manager of the $5 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons fund. But "it doesn't tell me a turn is imminent. Small caps can remain cheap for a relatively extended period of time."
"My net outlook for 1998 is that small-cap growth will do fairly well," said Aasch Shah, who manages the $350 million Small-Cap Strategies fund of Federated Investors. But he does not expect a rally in the sector until the second quarter.

HEADLINE: News in U.S. Can Be 'Rumor' in Seoul, and Lead to Jail

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 6

 BODY:
What is most striking about Richard Choi is not so much that he is in a jail, wearing his prison uniform and wondering whether he will get the full five-year sentence for "spreading rumors."
Rather, it is that most people here seem to think it perfectly natural that a rumormonger should be behind bars. 
 The case of Mr. Choi, 49, an American journalist accused of broadcasting damaging rumors about Hankook Ilbo, a major Korean newspaper, marks the collision of two world views. He champions the notion of freedom of expression and aggressive reporting, while many South Koreans focus on the need for order, accuracy and responsibility.
"According to the mindset of the Korean people, anyone who fabricates rumors should be punished," said Park Jung Sam, an executive of Hankook Ilbo. "It is quite natural to punish someone like that."
Officials of Hankook Ilbo pressed to have him prosecuted for reporting, on a Korean-language radio station in Los Angeles, that it was in financial difficulty and would be acquired by a large conglomerate. Mr. Choi is expected to go on trial later this month.
In most countries an aggrieved party might file a civil suit for defamation and seek damages, but Hankook Ilbo filed a criminal complaint with the prosecutors, and so now Mr. Choi is in jail and has been indicted for the crime of spreading rumors.
Under South Korean law, there will be no jury trial. Instead, a judge will hear the case and will decide whether he is guilty and what prison term would be appropriate, up to a maximum of five years.
To critics, mostly abroad, the law underscores the problems that got South Korea into its present economic mess: a legal structure that protects crony capitalism and makes it risky to call attention to financial weaknesses. The imprisonment of Mr. Choi has enraged some people in Los Angeles and led to some calls for the United States to halt its bailout of the South Korean economy until he is released.
But in South Korea, no one seems to understand what the fuss is about.
"The American press is talking about freedom of the press and human rights, but ordinary people here are wondering what the issue is," said Mr. Park, the newspaper executive. He may be tough on rumors, but he is not just a caricature of an autocrat: in the 1970's he himself was imprisoned for his reporting about the dictatorship of the time.
The case comes as many Asian countries are still searching for the best place to put the fulcrum that balances free expression and social order. South Korea is growing more democratic, but it is fearful of North Korea and partly as a result has always put the priority on order and stability.
The law that Mr. Choi fell afoul of never attracted much notice until he, as an American citizen, was arrested for violating it. And even many South Korean liberals and former dissidents accept harsh national security laws that lead to the imprisonment of people who praise North Korea or even read North Korean propaganda.
In Mr. Choi's case, each side seems mystified by the attitude of the other.
"This is just like a bad dream," Mr. Choi's wife, Choi Young Yun, said today as she picked at a sandwich for her lunch at a Seoul hotel, her mascara smudged with tears. "If you steal, you go to jail. Or if you're a Communist, you go to jail. But nothing else. Even though I grew up here, I can't believe it."
Mrs. Choi said that since her husband's arrest, she had been able to see him, through a glass panel, for a visiting session of only seven minutes a day. So they touch their fingertips to the glass, to get as close as they can, and say, "I love you" -- in English, because it sounds strange to voice such intimacy in Korean.
The case arose when Mr. Choi, an American citizen who was born and grew up in South Korea, returned in December to cover the presidential election here. He is vice president of Radio Korea USA, the leading Korean-language radio station in Los Angeles, and thus a well-known figure in the Korean community in Los Angeles.
On Dec. 15, Mr. Choi made his report about Hankook Ilbo to his Los Angeles radio audience. Truth is a defense that under South Korean law can be used against charges of rumor-spreading, but Hankook Ilbo was not acquired, as Mr. Choi had suggested it would be, and the company said that although it was having financial difficulties, they were not as severe as Mr. Choi had reported.
When Radio Korea did not immediately retract the statement, Hankook Ilbo went to the prosecutors and filed a complaint. As it happened, the prosecutor's office was just cracking down on "rumormongering" under a statue that declares, "Anybody who makes false statements and thereby damages the credit or reputation of another person shall be subject to imprisonment of up to five years."
So the police burst into Mr. Choi's hotel room and arrested him on Dec. 19. He has been in jail since then, and his radio station and human rights groups have been organizing protests.
"I don't understand how an American reporter can be in jail for reporting the news," said Lee Jang Hee, the president of Radio Korea USA in Los Angeles. "This is a violation of his human rights."
"If this were a Caucasian journalist, this could not happen," Mr. Lee added.
The law apparently has never been applied to a foreign citizen before, although it has been used to imprison Korean reporters. Indeed, at the same time that Mr. Choi was arrested, the police seized two Koreans who work in the securities industry and charged them with the same crime of spreading rumors. Their plight has attracted no interest.
One complication in Mr. Choi's case is that his radio station's competitor is another Korean-language radio station in Los Angeles that is run by Hankook Ilbo. So Hankook Ilbo suggests that he was trying to destroy a competitor, while Mr. Choi's supporters say Hankook Ilbo is trying to manipulate the criminal law to punish its rival.
Many Koreans seem wary of coming across as authoritarians but still insist that the criminal libel law is needed to punish rumormongers.
"Korean businesses have no methods to defend themselves from the arrows of media attacks," said Oh Dong Su, a director of the Federation of Korean Industries. He said financial issues should be discussed in public with great delicacy.
"It is true that the Hankook Ilbo was experiencing financial difficulties," he said. "But this is not something that we can blurt out."

HEADLINE: Whitman Lures Builders to Tainted Sites

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: EDGEWATER, N.J., Jan. 6

 BODY:
As crews demolished the contaminated remains of an 83-year-old factory behind her, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed a bill today that is intended to entice developers to build on thousands of pollution-tainted industrial sites around the state.
The law, some developers and urban planners said, could spur urban renewal by shifting the construction of new commercial buildings and housing from suburbs to places like downtown Newark, Trenton or long-abandoned spots along the Hudson River waterfront. 
 The bill was opposed by some New Jersey environmental groups for giving too much control over the extent of a cleanup to the companies responsible for polluting a site and for limiting public access to cleanup plans.
But Mrs. Whitman rejected the criticisms and a call for a conditional veto, saying the bill would both protect the environment and help bring new economic activity to long-dormant so-called brownfields around the state. "Today hundreds of these sites lie fallow, a blight and burden to the state of New Jersey," Mrs. Whitman said. "We must make reusing brownfields truly worth the effort. Today we begin to do just that."
The bill creates tax incentives equal to up to three-fourths of the cost of cleaning a site and offers a cash credit to small developers who test new technologies for sealing off or eliminating pollution. But the most important provision of the new law, according to several developers and urban planners, exempts anyone who buys and restores one of the 8,800 tainted sites in New Jersey from any new cleanup costs once state environmental officials approve the job.
A buyer of a tainted tract can also be protected from private lawsuits related to past pollution problems if a cleanup is approved by the State Department of Environmental Protection and completed promptly.
The prospect of lawsuits and the lack of clearly defined costs in fixing a site -- whether heavily or lightly polluted -- have until now discouraged potential buyers, said Ronald Bruder, chairman of the Dames & Moore/Brookhill Corporation, a Manhattan real estate and engineering company that has bought tainted sites in dozens of states but until now not in New Jersey or New York.
"The issue has always been certainty -- to be able to say for certain to your lender that this cleanup is going to cost $5 million," Mr. Bruder said. Until the signing of the bill in New Jersey, there was always the prospect of new cleanup orders and more costs, he said, adding that New York and Connecticut still lacked similar laws.
"Now in New Jersey at least you have a rational way of going forward," Mr. Bruder said. "Our appetite there is much stronger than it was a week ago. Probably in a year we'll have some things going there."
Some representatives of private environmental groups said they planned to push for revisions to the law in the new legislative session, saying that too many controls and standards for cleanups of polluted tracts were weakened.
Under the new law, developers, without involvement by the community, can choose a level of cleanliness for a site depending on the planned new use. A site intended for an industrial or commercial building would not have to be as thoroughly cleaned as a site intended for housing.
"The bill ends existing legal requirements for community involvement and ends making cleanups consistent with local master plans," said Timothy Dillingham, the director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, a private group. For example, he said, a community might be trying to encourage the construction of housing, but a developer might decide to clean a site to a standard that is only sufficient for a commercial enterprise like a mall.
"Whenever the public is excluded from decisions affecting public health and the future of their neighborhood, we think that's bad policy," Mr. Dillingham said.
Robert C. Shinn, the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said that under the new law his agency could still require public hearings in the cleanup process. "There are lots of safeguards," he said. He added that if a company failed to meet standards set in a cleanup plan, it lost the advantages offered under the new law.
Mrs. Whitman pointed to the crews working to tear down the abandoned Alcoa factory behind her, which made toothpaste tubes and other aluminum products from 1914 until 1965, as an example of what could soon happen around the state.
Oil that contained PCB's, a toxic chemical, had permeated the concrete floors of the building over the decades, and the site lay fenced and forgotten for 30 years.
After months of talks with local residents and officials from Edgewater, Bergen County and the State Department of Environmental Protection, Daibes Brothers, a local developer, began the demolition and decontamination and planned to build a 460-unit complex of apartment buildings.
Fred Daibes, the company's chief executive, said that this kind of project would now be far easier.
"In the past, you'd get into the bureaucracy of the D.E.P. and it scared the hell out of the developers because they knew there was no end in sight," Mr. Daibes said. "Now you're going to have to abide by all of the laws, but at least you know there's an end."

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Journal;
Ban on Leaf Blowers Is Voted, and Noise Ensues

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 6

 BODY:
To the mostly Hispanic gardeners who use it, it is a labor-saving tool of their trade as vital as the truck or the telephone. To the mostly affluent Angelenos who have led a 12-year campaign to ban it, it is a noisy, filthy contraption that fouls the air and shatters the calm of their well-kept streets.
Whichever the case, the Los Angeles City Council today voted its final approval of an ordinance that would ban the humble gasoline-powered leaf blower from use in residential neighborhoods. The vote followed a bitter debate that ranged across issues of cultural imperialism, environmental correctness and economic elitism. It also left 11 people -- gardeners and their supporters -- continuing a hunger strike in protest on the steps of City Hall. 
 "We're all victims of these machines," the actor Peter Graves, whose wife, Joan, has crusaded for the ban, told the Council in solemn "Mission: Impossible" tones before the vote this morning.
But in protest, Adrian Alvarez, a spokesman for the Association of Latin American Gardeners of Los Angeles, formed last year to fight the ban, has been drinking only water and Gatorade in a three-tent encampment on the South Lawn of City Hall since last Friday. He said the ban was a severe blow to the livelihood of gardeners, many of them recent immigrants, who use the blowers to groom upward of a dozen yards a day and routinely receive as little as $70 a month for weekly visits to a house.
"We're all aware that leaf blowers make noise," said Mr. Alvarez, an artist who joined the gardeners' cause in sympathy. "We've never denied that. But do you deny us a vital tool, or do you pressure industry to come up with a better, quieter tool? This ordinance was exclusively designed to address the concerns of an elite minority of residents."
In fact, the leaf blower has long been a fixture in a place where residents pay almost as much attention to their perennially verdant lawns as they do to their perpetually spotless cars, though several neighboring communities, including Beverly Hills, have already banned it.
The Los Angeles Council first passed a ban in December 1996, then delayed enforcement until this Jan. 1 to give the city time to figure out how to go about issuing citations for misdemeanors that could draw a $1,000 fine and six months in jail.
Then, last month, just weeks before the ban was to take effect, the Council passed an amendment that reduced the offense to the level of a violation, with fines of $100, plus $170 in court costs, for gardeners or the property owners who hire them. Because that vote was not unanimous, however, the Council was required to vote on the amendment again today, and it passed by 9 to 6.
The bill now goes to Mayor Richard J. Riordan, who is expected to allow it to become law. But blower manufacturers have filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban, and Mr. Alvarez and his colleagues vowed to continue their fast in hopes of inspiring a mayoral veto.
Jack Allen, former City Attorney of Beverly Hills, who drafted its anti-blower ordinance in 1985, testified today that efforts to regulate the blowers by limiting their noise levels -- as the gardeners want -- had proved impractical, because an expert technician with a sensitively calibrated measuring machine has to catch an offender in the act. That is all but impossible.
"We tried to regulate it, but there was just no way," said Mr. Allen, who himself lives in the quiet Los Angles enclave of Pacific Palisades and gave his own gardener a raise for agreeing not to use a blower.
Joan Graves, who has lived with her actor husband in Pacific Palisades for 47 years, helped organize other celebrities to fight for the ban, among them Julie Newmar, the original Catwoman on the old "Batman" television show, and Meredith Baxter, who played the mother on "Family Ties."
Mrs. Graves said her gardeners had never used a blower.
"We have never allowed our gardener to use a blower," her husband corrected her.
But City Councilman Mike Hernandez passionately defended the blowers as "a vital tool" of the working class, and told the packed Council chamber, "You need to understand that it is an emotional issue to gardeners."
Indeed it was, as several hundred gardeners in baseball caps and work jackets filed quietly into the ornate Council chambers this morning, with scores more waiting outside. As the gardeners lined up to get in, one of their leaders addressed them in Spanish, explaining the procedures.
At that, an older gardener with a pronounced Irish brogue piped up: "This is America, you know! You're supposed to speak English!"
Whereupon a Hispanic gardener retorted: "This is a democracy! You can vote to speak whatever language you want!"

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Long Bond's Yield 5.72%, a New Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices ended higher for the fourth straight session yesterday, pushing yields further into record-low territory and inducing more corporate borrowers to sell debt.
Although the appetite for bonds was not as hearty as on Monday, investors were still motivated to buy on resilient speculation that the Federal Reserve's next adjustment of interest-rate policy might be down. Lower rates tend to enhance the value of bonds already in circulation. 
 The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond closed up 9/32, to a price of 105 25/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.72 percent, beating the record low of 5.74 percent set on Monday.
Long-term prices initially fell but rallied in the late afternoon after corporate debt sales were met with good demand, a sign that the broader pressures pushing up bond prices have not peaked. Securities dealers who had sold long-term Treasuries ahead of the uncertainty over those corporate sales bought them back.
"The initial selling came from large hedge funds," said Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. He also attributed some of the early selling to dealers who were taking profits from the recent rally on "perhaps a feeling that the bond market had overshot reality."
Among the $2 billion of corporate debt priced was International Business Machines' $700 million of 30-year debentures through Merrill Lynch, yielding 6.5 percent, about 79 basis points above the Government's long bond. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Following are results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 52-week bills:

HEADLINE: Message by Pataki to Outline Proposals to Improve Schools

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's annual address to the Legislature will offer an array of proposals intended to improve the academic performance of students, including intensive English courses for immigrants and remedial summer classes for low-achieving fourth-grade students, according to his aides.
He will also use his fourth State of the State Message on Wednesday to emphasize many of the major educational initiatives adopted during last year's legislative session, including some proposed by his Democratic rivals in the Legislature. They range from increasing financing for textbooks and computers to expanding the number of prekindergarten slots. 
 By focusing on education in his election-year address, the Republican Governor appears intent on deflecting some of the criticism he has endured over his efforts to cut funds for schools during the early days of his administration. It also may help him moderate an image that he has built with an agenda that has largely stressed cutting taxes, toughening penalties on criminals and putting welfare recipients to work.
He will also use his address to the Legislature's 211 members to propose initiatives covering a variety of other topics, from crime and taxes to economic development, his aides said. Mr. Pataki has spent the last week writing the speech, which lays out his legislative agenda for 1998.
Among his more ambitious educational proposals is a plan to offer a financial incentive for school districts to provide fourth-grade students remedial instruction in English during the summer. Though aides gave few details, they said the plan would generally compensate school districts for 80 percent of the cost of running a six-week summer program for students who do poorly on standardized English tests.
Mr. Pataki is also expected to make a pitch for a proposal to require the state to give school districts more money for remedial instruction for students who show limited proficiency in English between kindergarten and the second grade. His aides did not provide an estimate of the program's cost. Nor did they say how many students they expect to qualify for the program.
In his message, the Governor will also promote a plan that would establish after-school programs at schools for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The program, which would run between 3 P.M. and 7 P.M., would be paid for through a combination of state, local and private financing. Pataki aides did not say how much the plan would cost.
Mr. Pataki's aides said he would also push for two pieces of legislation that he has proposed in the past. The first would allow parents, teachers and community groups to create so-called charter schools that are financed by taxpayers but operate independently of local school boards.
The second would give teachers more control over their schools by allowing them for the first time to suspend disruptive children from their classrooms for up to 10 days. The suspension initiative did not survive the 1996 legislative session; the charter proposal failed last year.
Mr. Pataki's package of proposals drew qualified support from Sheldon Silver, the Democratic-led Assembly's Speaker. Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver, said he would take a serious look at the proposals once they were drafted in bill form. "But we will have to see more details," she said.
The Governor's aides said he would again call for overhauling the special-education program by eliminating financial incentives that have encouraged schools to place mildly disabled students in expensive segregated classrooms. That program has been widely criticized for years as an inefficient bureaucracy that shunts too many children, a disproportionate number of whom are black and Hispanic boys, into separate classrooms with virtually no prospect of returning to regular classes.
The Governor's aides said he intended to hammer out a plan with Richard P. Mills, the Education Commissioner, who has proposed his own plan for improving the program.

Faltering I.M.F. Bailouts Raise New Fears About Asia
With the International Monetary Fund's bailout plans for Thailand and Indonesia starting to fray, Clinton Administration officials are privately worrying about whether the tough I.M.F. prescriptions for rescuing the entire Asian region -- including South Korea -- will work.
In the last two days, the Thai and Indonesian currencies have plummeted to new depths on Thailand's effort to renegotiate easier terms for its I.M.F. bailout and Indonesia's continued resistance to austerity pledges it made to the lending agency months ago. One of the most significant challenges came yesterday from President Suharto of Indonesia, above, who announced big increases in Government spending in defiance of a key condition for the I.M.F.'s $40 billion rescue.

Indonesia proposed an optimistic budget with few cutbacks, avoiding the tough austerity measures analysts say are needed to restore confidence. D2.

HEADLINE: Despite Carnage, Algeria Shuns Aid Offers

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 6

 BODY:
As reports mounted that Islamic militants were committing atrocities against Algerian civilians, France and its European Union partners struggled today with Algerian Government resistance to any attempt to bring international pressure to bear to stop the killings.
The Algerian newspaper La Tribune reported today that "several hundred people" were burned alive on Sunday night in a village in Relizane province in western Algeria, where 412 men, women and children were reportedly slaughtered last week by Islamic rebels opposed to the country's military-backed Government. 
 La Tribune also said that 117 civilians were killed in a separate attack on Saturday night in the same area.
Germany's Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, called over the weekend for the dispatch of a European Union mission to Algeria to offer help to the Algerian Government in dealing with the crisis. France, Denmark and Portugal expressed support, and European officials will discuss the crisis in Brussels next week. But today, as it has in the past, Algeria rejected all outside interference in its internal affairs.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, welcomed the show of concern by European countries and the United States, which expressed support today for international inquiries into the massacres. But Algerian officials rejected the soundings about the possibility of sending a United Nations mission to Algeria, diplomats said.
France strongly condemned the massacres in a statement on Monday that called on the Algerian Government to do its duty to insure the security of the civilian population. The Algerian Foreign Ministry and much of the Algerian press responded by accusing the French Government of unacceptable interference in Algerian internal affairs.
"I don't say that there isn't anything that can be done," Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France said at a gathering at the Quai d'Orsay today, but he reminded interlocutors that by the end of the colonial war in Algeria not even 600,000 French and Algerian colonial soldiers were able to defeat the movement for independence in the 1950's.
Between 60,000 and 75,000 people are believed to have been killed in violence that began six years ago after the Government canceled an election that Islamic parties in the Islamic Salvation Front, since outlawed, were poised to win.
As the European colonial power that ruled Algeria for more than a century until it wrested independence from Paris in 1962, France is expected by its European allies to take the lead in diplomatic efforts to try to stop the new carnage.
But French officials say they are not sure that all the violence is the work of Islamic militants, and some suspect that the Algerian Government may have incited atrocities against villages sympathetic to the rebels or left them open to attack.
But there are other considerations for France as well. Today about five million Muslims, most from North Africa, live largely relegated to ugly urban development projects surrounding French cities, where members of the fundamentalist Armed Islamic Group, thought to be responsible for some of the worst violence in Algeria, recruited disillusioned youths in 1995 and 1996.
The group terrorized France with bombings of subway stations that killed a dozen people and wounded hundreds, with the aim of pressuring France to cut off relations with the Algerian Government. French police are still patrolling the Paris subways today because of those bombings, but the killings in Algeria never stopped.
With European aid and trade credits totaling only $300 million in 1996, European countries including France have little leverage over Algeria. Though American and European oil companies invest heavily in oil operations there, the idea of sending troops to stop terrorism strikes officials in both the United States and Europe as unacceptable.
"I'd like to see the first country that will send its military there," Belgium's Foreign Minister, Eric Derycke, said today.
The French Government statement condemned the massacres of more than 400 people at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan as "acts of barbaric savagery," but carefully avoided pinning them on Islamic militants.
"The French authorities, in the most absolute manner, condemn these terrorist crimes, which can have no justification, especially a religious one," the statement said. "They recall the legitimate right of the Algerian population to be protected. The duty of any Government is to allow its citizens to live in peace and security."
Calling on President Liamine Zeroual to continue changes that produced multiparty elections last year, even though the outlawed Islamic parties remained banned, France said, "It is essential that this process should lead rapidly to authentic democratization that would allow the integration into political life of all forces desiring to put an end to the violence and participating in the reconstruction of a peaceful Algeria."
The Algerian authorities, who have rebuffed past outside attempts to negotiate a reconciliation with the Islamic movement, reacted with indignation. "The French authorities have no right to remind the Algerian Government of its duties, and it is out of place that they suggest solutions while Algeria is carrying out its own approach to end the crisis," the Foreign Ministry in Algiers said today.

U.S. Envoy on Trouble Spots
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (By The New York Times) -- The State Department said today that it had dispatched an envoy to Paris for talks on Wednesday with French officials that will focus on Iran, Iraq and Algeria.
A State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said that the envoy, Thomas Pickering, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, will deal primarily with policy on Iraq and Iran but that the intensifying violence in Algeria may also come up.
On Monday, the State Department called for an international inquiry into the Algerian massacres, asking nongovernmental organizations and the United Nations to take charge of the investigations.
American officials said Mr. Pickering would also give French officials a detailed briefing on the results of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's trip to Africa in December. Before she left, she had discussed Africa with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, but she wanted them to have a better understanding of her views after the trip, the officials said.
Human rights groups welcomed the United States' support for an international inquiry into the massacres.

HEADLINE: Vallone Urges Lower Tuition for CUNY's Best

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The Speaker of the City Council, Peter F. Vallone, is proposing that the City University offer half-price tuition for two years to students who maintain at least a B average in high school and college, saying that such a policy would encourage academic excellence and hard work.
Mr. Vallone's plan, which he is to announce today in his annual address to the Council, represents his latest attempt to position himself for a gubernatorial run by concentrating on issues that he can use to criticize Gov. George E. Pataki. 
 Tuition at the CUNY system, whose governing board is controlled by the Governor, has risen since Mr. Pataki took office in 1995. Tuition is now $3,200 a year for the senior colleges at CUNY, up from $2,450 in 1994, and $2,500 for the community colleges, up from $2,100, CUNY officials said.
"The cost of higher education is one of the biggest burdens confronting the working class," Michael S. Clendenin, director of communications for Mr. Vallone, said yesterday. "Instead of support from Albany, the city and state universities find themselves under attack."
The cost of the plan would be about $38 million annually, which Mr. Vallone proposes to finance from the city's budget, his aides said. The current CUNY budget is more than $1.2 billion -- $110 million from the city, $620 million from the state, and $525 million from tuition payments, officials said.
Mr. Vallone, a Queens Democrat, is also expected to detail in the speech an ambitious proposal to keep all public elementary schools in the city open from 3 P.M. to 7 P.M. on school days for after-school programs. The proposal would eventually cost the city about $150 million annually, and Mr. Vallone wants the state and Federal governments, as well as private institutions, to pay most of the bill, his aides said.
Although student leaders applauded Mr. Vallone's CUNY plan, it comes just as a debate over grade inflation is roiling the system, with many of the trustees calling for stricter standards. About half the course grades given at CUNY are A's and B's, officials have said.
Some critics of CUNY, including aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, pointed out that if it was so easy to attain high grades, then qualifying for the tuition reduction would not be much of an achievement.
Mr. Giuliani, who has repeatedly assailed CUNY for what he says are lax standards, has the authority to block the proposal by refusing to approve the allocation of city money to pay for it.
"There is no way to know what a particular grade even means in that system," Randy M. Mastro, the deputy mayor for operations, said in a statement. "So rather than focus on givebacks, the focus should be on developing higher standards."
Aides to Mr. Pataki, who could also defeat the proposal, expressed little enthusiasm for it. "We don't hear a lot that makes sense that comes out of that office," said Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's press secretary, referring to the Council leadership. "But we are certainly willing to take a look at it."
Herman Badillo, who was appointed vice chairman of the CUNY board of trustees by Mr. Pataki, reacted more positively, saying that while he was concerned about grade inflation, the board should nonetheless consider the plan.
"I support the idea, provided that the grades earned are not given away through grade inflation," Mr. Badillo said.
Mizanoor Biswas, a student representative on the CUNY board, said a tuition cut could have a marked impact on the lives of some poor students. "I couldn't get better news for 1998 than this," Mr. Biswas said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON PROPOSES OPENING MEDICARE TO THOSE 55 TO 65

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton proposed a significant expansion of Medicare today, to allow hundreds of thousands of early retirees, laid-off workers and uninsured Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 to enroll in the Federal health care program for the elderly.
The proposal addresses the problem of a growing group of Americans who are at high risk of losing their health insurance through layoffs or reductions in corporate benefits. The three million uninsured people in this group, known by insurance statisticians as the "near elderly," are too young for Medicare and not poor enough for Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor and disabled. 
 Although the proposal was immediately criticized by many Republicans, the President said it would pay for itself and, for the first time, make health care coverage available for hundreds of thousands of people who could not otherwise find or afford it.
"This is an entirely new way of adapting a program that has worked in the past to the needs of the future," Mr. Clinton said at a morning ceremony at the White House. "For many Americans, access to quality health care can mean the difference between a secure, healthy and productive life and the enormous burden of illness and worry and enormous financial strain."
Individuals who choose to buy into the expanded Medicare program would pay $3,600 to $5,000 a year, depending on their ages.
The proposal represents another incremental step toward providing health insurance for the 41 million Americans who currently lack it. Since the Administration's universal health care initiative was rejected by Congress in 1994, Mr. Clinton has tried in less ambitious ways to extend health benefits to the uninsured, most recently in the 1997 budget agreement that extends Government-financed medical care to an estimated 5 million low-income children. News Analysis, page A14.
But enactment of the Administration's new Medicare proposal is by no means certain and the plan is likely to become a political issue in Congressional elections this year. Even before it was announced today, Republican leaders in Congress complained that the proposal would create a new Medicare entitlement at a time when the program already faces long-term financial strains.
"Before Congress considers expansion of a program that is already going bankrupt, several important concerns must be addressed," said Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who heads the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. "I'm cautious because every time Washington promises something for free, the taxpayers end up footing a bigger and bigger bill. In this case, the cost of the proposed expansion puts taxpayers at risk of seeing their taxes hiked and Medicare beneficiaries are at risk of having their benefits reduced."
Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Budget Committee, predicted flatly that the Republican-led Congress would reject the Clinton plan.
On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton plans to offer a major initiative to help working families obtain child care, with a variety of new Federal subsidies and tax breaks. Administration officials and Congressional aides said the package would cost $20 billion over five years.
Congressional aides said they had been told that the package would include more than $7 billion to bolster the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which provides money to states, mainly to subsidize child care for low-income families. The President will also seek an increase in the Federal income tax credit that parents can take for child care expenses, at an estimated cost of $5 billion over five years.
The President's plan will also include a new tax credit for businesses that establish or run child care centers for workers, or reserve places in existing centers. Mr. Clinton will also ask Congress for money to improve the training of child care workers, to finance care for older children after school and to expand the Head Start program for preschool children. The proposals are all subject to approval by Congress.
Administration officials said today that the Medicare proposal was designed to aid those who had lost jobs and health benefits in the corporate downsizing of the past decade. Private insurance for the healthiest people ages 55 through 64 costs $5,000 a year or more, while those with chronic illnesses like diabetes, high blood pressure, ulcers and kidney ailments often find they cannot buy private insurance at any price.
There are 22 million Americans ages 55 through 64; roughly 3 million of them now have no health insurance. Administration officials estimate that 300,000 people in this age group will take advantage of the Medicare proposal, if it is enacted.
But the plan is designed to deal with the baby boom bulge of people in that age group coming after the turn of the century. By 2010, there are expected to be 35 million such Americans, and if the current reductions in employee benefits continue, there will be many millions more without health care coverage.
The Administration plan would allow those ages 62 through 64, who want Medicare coverage, to buy into the program for about $300 a month. When they become eligible for full Medicare benefits at 65, they would then have to pay $10 to $20 a month above the premium for physician services, which is now $43.80 a month. Hospitalization for Medicare recipients is paid for by payroll taxes on current workers.
The plan would benefit those who lose health coverage sponsored by their spouse's employer, when their spouse qualifies for Medicare. It would also provide a reasonably priced option for those with existing medical conditions that make private health insurance unavailable or prohibitively expensive.
In addition, laid-off workers, beginning at age 55, could participate in a similar Medicare coverage plan, although they would have to pay the full cost of insurance from the time they enroll. Older workers who become unemployed often cannot find new jobs; half never work full-time again and few get company-paid health insurance. Officials estimated that individuals in this group could join Medicare for about $400 a month.
The President also proposed expanding the "Cobra" program that lets retirees buy into their former employers' health plans, to guarantee their coverage through age 64. Cobra health care continuation benefits now expire after a maximum of three years.
In recent years, the number of companies offering retiree health benefits has been shrinking. In 1993, only about half of retirees from medium-sized or large companies were covered by company plans; in 1985, the figure was 75 percent.
The proposal would allow companies to charge a somewhat higher premium for continued Cobra coverage. Workers now pay an average of 102 percent of their former employers' cost of health insurance to obtain Cobra coverage; the extra amount is used to cover administrative expenses. The Administration's extended plan would allow employers to charge premiums of as much as 125 percent of their cost.
The White House said that the $2 billion to $3 billion in start-up costs for the program would be financed by unspecified savings from reducing fraud and waste in the Medicare program. The proposal is designed to be fully self-supporting after five years, officials said.
"Americans aged 55 and above tend to need more health care services, and have higher health care costs than most younger people in our society," said Horace B. Deets, executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons. "For people who are younger spouses of Medicare enrollees; for those who retire and their former employer terminates their health insurance, and for people who are downsized out of their jobs -- this proposal could make a real difference."

HEADLINE: Budget Opportunities;
Mr. Clinton's Deficit Coup

 BODY:
President Clinton's surprise decision to propose the first balanced budget in a generation may not by itself have much impact on taxes, spending or the economy. But it was a shrewdly symbolic move to transform the way these issues are debated politically. By moving three years ahead of schedule to eliminate the Federal deficit, the Administration will be on firmer ground to oppose reflexive Republican demands for tax cuts. The prospect of a balanced budget has also cleared room for Mr. Clinton to promote disciplined plans for meeting neglected needs.
Since the first term of President Reagan, gaping Federal deficits have made it all but impossible for mainstream politicians to advocate new Federal spending, even for important programs. The budget is now close to being in balance because of recent spending restraint, a series of tax increases -- especially those under Presidents Bush and Clinton -- and, most important, a prosperous economy. The balance is temporary, however. In the next several years the growing cost of health and retirement programs is projected to throw the budget back into the red, and reckless tax cuts will only make the problem worse. 
 President Clinton has already signaled his willingness to spend some additional money in sensible areas, such as education, food safety and the environment. The Administration is also talking about limited tax breaks to reduce automobile emissions and pay for child care for working families. But the Administration is commendably avoiding the big new tax cuts that some Republicans have started advocating.
The end of Federal deficits, even if temporary, could remind Republicans to be careful what they wish for. The party faces infighting over whether to advocate tax cuts for the wage-earning voters it needs to attract or the affluent Americans who expect the Republican Party to deliver more Reagan-style windfalls. Some G.O.P. deficit hawks warn against any revenue decreases right now. Others welcome any tax cut that could force the Government to shrink in size.
As it burgeoned during the Reagan and Bush years, the deficit came to have a greater political than fiscal significance. Understanding his own and his party's vulnerability on that issue was one of Mr. Clinton's signal accomplishments. His bigger challenge, especially with a Republican Congress, will be converting this tactical coup into policies that will be remembered beyond his final term.

HEADLINE: Weaker Yen Pushes Stocks Higher in Tokyo

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Japanese stocks rose today, led by exporters like the Bridgestone Corporation that stand to benefit from the yen's weakness against the dollar.
Stocks also rose in South Korea, reflecting some modestly improved confidence that the nation will overcome its financial crisis and avert default on billions of dollars in overseas loans. 
 But plummeting currency values elsewhere in Asia, particularly in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, hurt several stock markets and reinforced pessimism about the region's economic outlook. Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index lost 472.02 points to close the morning session at 9,663.49, down 4.6 percent. Singapore's main index fell 3.83 percent, Malaysia fell 3.67 percent and the Philippines fell 4.02 percent.
The Japanese stock market's benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 62.04 points, or 0.42 percent, finishing the morning session at 14,958.44. The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index slipped 1.02 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,159.63.
Traders said the primary force strengthening Japanese stocks was the weak yen, which enables Japanese exporters to lower prices in overseas markets and expands dollar-denominated revenue.
The dollar cost 134.21 yen by midday in Tokyo, stronger than its 133.65-yen level in New York on Tuesday and the highest level in nearly six years.
Bridgestone rose 110 yen, to 2,930. Sony climbed 100 yen, to 12,000. NEC gained 30 yen, to 1,460. About 110 million shares traded as of late morning, roughly the same level as on Tuesday morning.
In Seoul, the main stock index rose 1.57 percent as investors bought shares of big companies that have been hurt in recent weeks. Analysts said foreign investors appeared to be turning somewhat positive on the market because of efforts by the International Monetary Fund and other creditors to accelerate disbursement of emergency loans.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
With the Focus on South Korea, Thai and Indonesian Aid Falters

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
As the United States has focused on rescuing South Korea, the emergency programs to stabilize Thailand and Indonesia have begun to unravel, raising new fears about the effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund's prescriptions for stabilizing large regions of Asia.
With investors still stampeding out of Asian markets, the currencies of Thailand and Indonesia have plummeted to new lows, defying months of efforts to restore confidence and making it far more costly for companies to repay crushing debts denominated in dollars and Japanese yen. 
 On Monday, Thailand announced that it would ask the I.M.F. to ease the terms of a $17.2 billion bailout package. Indonesia has so far refused to honor several key conditions of its nearly $40 billion rescue package. And today, President Suharto said his Government would increase spending by 24 percent next year despite pledges of austerity.
Clinton Administration officials insist it is premature to call the bailout efforts a failure, noting that Mexico fell into months of economic pain after a restructuring of its economy began early in 1995. But while the officials seem optimistic that Thailand has belatedly begun to honor its loan terms, they make no secret of rising tension with Indonesia.
At the end of December, the I.M.F. sent President Suharto, Asia's longest-serving leader, a strongly worded letter urging his officials to carry out economic changes. Members of the Suharto family and close friends of the President, who hold financial stakes in the country's most lucrative businesses, have sought to dilute or evade such reforms. Twice in the last week, the Indonesian military, projecting unemployment soon of two million workers, said it stood ready to suppress protests that "disturb national stability."
"There's no question that we're in deep trouble again in Southeast Asia," a senior adviser to President Clinton said today. "The political problems are getting a lot more complicated. And the markets are having trouble sorting out which countries are tackling their problems, and which are not."
Yet the economic magnitude of Thailand and Indonesia pale by comparison with that of South Korea, and all three pale in size compared with Japan. Washington's real fear is that renewed economic instability among the relatively small Asian countries could spread beyond control.
Early in July, Thailand's decision to abandon the longtime link between its currency and the dollar set in motion a domino effect that brought down the currencies of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and eventually South Korea. That cycle can accelerate because each devaluation makes a country's exports less expensive overseas, forcing other nations to devalue to stay competitive.
But it is less clear that a similar pattern is about to be repeated. Each country in the Asian crisis has distinct problems, and eventually, Administration officials and economists say, investors will recognize the differences.
"We are dealing with a self-reinforcing process," George Soros, the billionaire hedge-fund manager and a central figure in the three-dimensional chess game under way between investors, governments and the I.M.F., wrote last week. "Once it is reversed, it could become self-reinforcing in the opposite direction. The trouble is that the process is still moving away from equilibrium."
Mr. Soros's announcement on Monday that he would again start investing in South Korea temporarily reversed sentiments, and the currency and stock markets in Seoul rose. But many investors are still fleeing the major Southeast Asian currencies. Now, the Thai baht and the Indonesian rupiah have fallen lower than before the I.M.F. intervened.
The I.M.F.'s five-month-old economic plan for Thailand assumed that the baht would stabilize to a rate of about 32 to the dollar. Tonight, it traded at 53.65 to the dollar, a huge difference that makes it far more costly for Thais to pay their foreign debts. A company that owed $1 million at the I.M.F.'s projected rate would have to raise 32 million baht to pay it back. But if that $1 million loan was due now, it would require more than 53 million baht to repay it.
Unsurprisingly, such wildly off-the-mark forecasts have fueled criticism of the I.M.F.'s approach -- and by extension the Clinton Administration's approach -- to solving the Asian crisis. Equally unsurprisingly, the critics disagree among themselves about what Washington and the I.M.F. may be doing wrong.
The Clinton Administration and its backers say the mixture of high interest rates, economic austerity, more financial disclosure and closing weak banks will work, given enough time and the commitment of political leaders. "These programs work best when governments adopt them as their own," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said a few weeks ago. "That is the beginning of restoring market confidence."
Administration officials say that while Thailand agreed to the I.M.F. package last summer, it did not begin to honor the terms until November, after a weak and divided Cabinet was replaced. "We've really only seen a month or so of real action in Thailand," a senior Administration official said. "And you cannot blame the I.M.F. for worsening the problems in Indonesia," he said, where the Government has complied with only a few key conditions for its loan package. I.M.F. experts are planning to travel to Indonesia in two weeks, and its findings may result in a threat to cut off the next stage of aid.
The dominant group of I.M.F. critics is led by Jeffrey Sachs of the Harvard Institute for International Development. In opinion pieces widely reprinted and often endorsed in Asia, Professor Sachs has argued that the I.M.F. strategy of raising interest rates only worsens a nation's economic troubles, turning minor disturbances into panic.
He noted that in February 1995, the I.M.F. predicted the Mexican economy would grow 1.5 percent for the year; it shrank 6.1 percent. "The same is happening now," he said. "We're lowering the estimates of how much Thailand and South Korea will grow. And that turns into a self-fulfilling panic."
In contrast, Mr. Soros argues that high interest rates "are essential to prevent the currency from going into a free fall" and have forestalled disaster in recent months in Hong Kong and Russia.
He argues that the I.M.F. is failing to address a more fundamental problem: that banks and other international lenders "move in a herd-like fashion in both directions," lavishing cheap money on nations deemed promising, then fleeing at bad news.
In a long essay last week in The Financial Times, Mr. Soros advocated creation of an international organization to help allocate loans to countries. It would guarantee a certain number of loans in return for an insurance premium. The country borrowing the cash would be required to provide a range of data about its economy, and the authority would use that information to "set a ceiling on the amounts it is willing to insure." Beyond that, lenders would be taking their own risks. Neither the I.M.F. nor the United States would bail them out.
Such a system would outrage free-market advocates, who argue that if the market is working well, nations that handle their economies badly must pay more to borrow. But the Asian crisis has shown that countries are increasingly adept at hiding bad news -- both the Thais and the South Koreans misled investors about the size of their currency reserves.
A last school of critics argues that the United States should not signal that it will bail out countries and their creditors -- in this case some of the largest banks in New York, Tokyo and the capitals of Europe. The right course, they argue, is to allow some big defaults so that banks learn what it feels like to take a huge loss.

HEADLINE: Solving and Preventing 'Sick Building' Illnesses

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
THE bedroom is often the scene of the crime. Dr. Adrienne Buffaloe, a specialist in environmental medicine, reels off a list of innocent-sounding potential irritants: "There are the perfumes, the cosmetics, the hair-care sprays on the vanity; the synthetic carpet sprayed with a stain resistant." Then there are cedar closets, mothballs, leathers treated with tanning agents and dyes and even stuffed animals sprayed with flame retardants.
"People's bedrooms should be their oasis, but anything with a scent could be harmful to people breathing it in all night long," she said. 
 Dr. Buffaloe is part of an expanding range of specialists and consultants in Manhattan who are trying to cope with an increasingly borderless territory, the consequences of daily life in largely synthetic interiors. Dr. Buffaloe is the medical director of Healthcare for the 21st Century (212-355-2315), a two-year-old clinic in the Architects and Designers Building, Third Avenue at 58th Street. The clinic is one of only six in the country that is chemical-free, the doctor said.
There, in a high-tech detoxification chamber, if needed, patients can be treated for physical and mental ailments caused by allergies and hypersensitivities related to environmental conditions. (Even visitors are asked not to wear perfume when coming to the clinic, which has marble floors, metal chairs and wall coverings of 100 percent wool.)
Although the clinic's location in the Architects and Designers Building is coincidental, Dr. Buffaloe noted that designers often attend her public lectures on "sick house syndrome," among other subjects, and they drop in for advice regarding health-conscious products they might use.
For 25 years, Wayne Tusa, the president of Environmental Risk and Loss Control (212-369-5400), has helped companies with environmental risks, including "sick building syndrome." But in the last year, he said, more and more individuals have started hiring him to vet the homes and apartments they are thinking of buying or the plans for homes they want to build.
A house inspection with some elementary testing of air quality and recommendations for short- and long-term alterations might cost a few hundred dollars. More extensive testing for problems like asbestos, radon, lead paints, electronmagnetic fields and molds could easily run into several thousand dollars.
"I've noticed that more upscale residents these days just add the cost of extensive testing to their budgets as a matter of course," Mr. Tusa said. (Harold Evans and Tina Brown have been clients.) But rich or poor, Mr. Tusa says, everyone may be at risk, either at home or at work. A huge number of chemical-based products fill the home -- from chemicals used in construction materials, including the formaldehyde found in common plywoods, to the glues that join furniture, to the cleaners and pesticides found under the sink.
Paradoxically, the same energy efficiency that makes well-insulated buildings operate economically also seals in pollutants that can then build up to toxic levels. "Each person has to decide for themselves how much they can tolerate," Mr. Tusa said.
Environmental Construction Outfitters of New York (718-292-0626) is a kind of environmental Home Depot, said its owner, Paul Novack. He provides organic and nontoxic materials to architects and designers -- even homeowners who come to him saying, "I want a safe house." At a warehouse in the Bronx, Mr. Novack stocks paints, sealants, glues, strippers, carpeting, wall coverings, full-spectrum light bulbs and special insulation, everything but the bulkiest materials like plywood and wallboard. The products available at the five-year-old company are recycled, natural, hypoallergenic or are made from renewable resources.
"We supply everyone from the student who needs one can of hypoallergenic paint to the developer who wants 10,000 quarts," Mr. Novack said. "We went into business to supply the 10,000 quarts, but how can you say no to someone who comes to you saying they want to be healthy?"
The Human Ecology Action League is a national support group for people suffering from environmental illnesses. The 17-year-old New York chapter offers monthly lectures by experts in the field.

HEADLINE: In America;
Schumer's Big Challenge

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Twenty-four hours after Geraldine Ferraro's glitzy campaign debut at the Sheraton New York Hotel, Representative Charles Schumer sat in a quiet restaurant, not far from Madison Square, and talked over lunch about the legislative record he has compiled.
Mr. Schumer is running against Ms. Ferraro (and Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate) for the Democratic Senate nomination. The winner gets to engage in unrestrained warfare with the three-term Republican incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato. 
 When Ms. Ferraro walked into the hotel's Riverside Ballroom to announce her candidacy on Monday, news photographers surged forward and surrounded her as if she were a movie star. The cornerstone of her candidacy is her fame. It may have been years since Ms. Ferraro held elective office, but she is a celebrity and her supporters are betting that will be enough. Her announcement generated page-one headlines and live television coverage by her most recent employer, CNN. She begins the race well ahead in the polls.
If Mr. Schumer was bothered by the early excitement surrounding Ms. Ferraro, he didn't let on. "I am not the most glamorous person in the world, but I know how to legislate," he said. "I work hard and I have a record of getting things passed that have an effect. My challenge is to get that record out."
Politicians are programmed to blow their own horns. Somewhere Dan Quayle is bragging about all he has done for America. But even taking that into account, Mr. Schumer's legislative record is impressive:
* He is the principal author of the 1994 Crime Bill, which, among other things, provided funds for up to 100,000 additional police officers nationwide. The bill included the Violence Against Women Act, which was the first Federal law designed to protect women from domestic violence.
* He is the leading gun control advocate in Congress, author of the Brady bill and the ban on assault weapons.
* He introduced the bill that eventually forced credit card companies to disclose their interest rates on all solicitations.
* He was the principal author of a bill that guaranteed women the right to enter family planning and abortion clinics without being attacked or harassed. The number of violent incidents outside such clinics plummeted after President Clinton signed the bill into law in May 1994.
"I love legislating," said the unabashed Mr. Schumer. He spoke of the exhilaration and the satisfaction he experienced rounding up votes for the crime bill from liberals, moderates and conservatives. He described the difficulty of passing gun control legislation at any time, but especially in a Congress controlled by Republicans. He seemed almost to relive the tension that surrounded the final tally on the assault-weapons ban. It passed by one vote.
Mr. Schumer, a Harvard Law School graduate whose Congressional district encompasses parts of Brooklyn and Queens, believes in the old-fashioned notion that "government can and should be a force for good."
"That's why I'm running for the Senate," he said.
Pretty sentiments aside, the Congressman is hardly naive about how to get to the Senate. He already has more than $8 million in campaign funds that he can use to trumpet his record and increase his name recognition. That is a lot more than either of his Democratic opponents. Mr. Green has about $1 million and Ms. Ferraro has just begun her mad scramble after cash.
"We will spend the next several months showing my record to the voters," Mr. Schumer said. "By the time of the primary I will be as well known as Gerry."
Mr. Schumer would not criticize Ms. Ferraro during the luncheon interview. But his emphasis on his record (Mr. Green has adopted a similar strategy) inevitably draws attention to Ms. Ferraro's lack of same. In 1992 when she was beaten in a bloodbath of a Senate primary, she said that she would never again run for public office.
"I can't do that anymore," she said. "You know, I'm not a kid."
She has not actually held office since 1984. She has been a pitchwoman for Pepsi-Cola and a sparring partner for Pat Buchanan. For awhile she was the U.S. representative to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
But now she's back. And she's not just running for the Senate, she's the front-runner. Her claim to fame is that she's famous.

HEADLINE: Low Mortgage Rates Spur A Rise in New-Home Sales

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
New-home sales surged 5.1 percent in November, propelled by falling mortgage rates and the most buoyant consumer confidence in nearly three decades.
Economists said sales for all of 1997 probably hit a 19-year high and predicted the strength will carry over into early this year. 
 "We're working on all cylinders," said David Lereah, the economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. "You have cyclically low mortgage rates. You have a robust economy. The bottom line is that has given the consumer the financial wherewithal to go out there and buy homes."
New single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 830,000 in November, the most since April 1986, the Commerce Department said today.
Analysts predicted sales for all of 1997 will top 800,000, roughly a 6 percent increase over 1996 and the best since 817,000 new homes were sold in 1978. Sales should slacken to around 760,000 this year, still among the handful of best years during the last two decades.
In November, sales of new homes rose strongly everywhere but the West. They surged 23.4 percent, to a rate of 79,000 in the East, highest in six months. They jumped 14.9 percent in the Midwest, to a rate of 162,000, the most since December 1993, and 4.9 percent in the South, to a rate of 382,000, the most since February.
In the West, sales fell 6.3 percent, to a rate of 207,000. They were hurt by bad weather.
"We think the economy as a whole, home building included, will slow down a bit," said the economist Michael Carliner of the National Association of Home Builders. "But it still looks very positive. The slowdown in 1998 will be a fairly modest one."
Economists had expected home sales to slow late in 1997. Instead, they took off as interest rates fell.
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.2 percent in November and most recently have fallen to just under 7 percent, nearly the best in four years. That reduced the monthly payment on a $100,000 loan by about $17.
And new-home prices have remained affordable for many. The median price -- meaning half sold for more and half for less -- was $140,000 in November, down 2.4 percent from a year earlier.
The Commerce Department also said today that the supply of new homes for sale nationwide fell 1 percent in November to an annual rate of 285,000, the lowest since July 1993. When compared with demand measured by November's sales rate, the inventory of vacant new homes fell to a 4.2-month supply, matching the level in August 1971.
Economists are looking for home sales and related purchases of furniture and appliances to help the economy this year as export sales to Asia drop.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Korea will suffer, but the banks that lent the money won't.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
FIRST Mexico. Then Thailand and Indonesia. Now, South Korea.
If every emerging economy that reaches beyond its grasp is automatically eligible for a multibillion-dollar bailout from the International Monetary Fund, what incentive do borrowers have to play by the rules of the free market? 
 Second-guessing the South Korean rescue effort is certain to become a popular sport. But specialists in international finance argue that most criticism of the $57 billion package amounts to blaming the victim. For while South Koreans will pay long and dearly for their financial transgressions, the Japanese, European and American banks that provided much of their capital seem destined to leave the field of battle unscathed. "The only winners in Korea are the foreign banks, who will get their money back and then some," argued Richard Medley, the head of Medley Global Advisors, a New York-based consultant on risk management.
With hindsight, it is clear that growth-obsessed South Korean conglomerates borrowed rashly, secure in their belief that the Government would shield them from any debt difficulties. South Korean banks made little effort to assess the creditworthiness of large borrowers, since Seoul would always prop them up.
This led the banks to borrow tens of billions of dollars abroad and to economize on interest expenses by agreeing to repay the principal on just a few months' notice.
When currency instability hit Southeast Asia last summer, South Korea was vulnerable. Weakening markets for South Korean exports made it difficult for the financially leveraged conglomerates to service debts.
More important, the banks had all too often lent in South Korean won with funds borrowed in dollars. So the collapse of the won left many banks with dollar liabilities they could not repay.
It is difficult to argue, though, that what is casually termed a bailout will tempt any other country to act profligately. South Korea is obliged to close insolvent banks, open jealously protected markets to foreign competition, shut down the easy credit pipeline for financially pressed conglomerates and, of course, pay back the $57 billion package rescue loan with interest.
The I.M.F. is also demanding fiscal austerity that will drive the economy into recession, bankrupting many well-managed businesses in need of credit. "It's indiscriminate punishment that if anything will deter other countries from turning to the I.M.F. before their problems become intractable," argued Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Institute for International Development at Harvard.
Foreigners can expect an easier ride. To be sure, those who bought shares in South Korean companies or lent them money directly will take a bath. But the bulk of the foreign investment in South Korea is in the form of loans to South Korean banks. And as Jeff Uscher, editor of Grant's Asia Observer, says, "These lenders will get back 100 cents on the dollar."
Cash from the I.M.F. goes directly to the Seoul Government, which is relending the money to South Korean banks to pay maturing dollar-denominated debts. Foreigners will thus not be punished for ignoring risks in lending to overextended banks. Those who refuse to roll over funds can expect to be paid off with I.M.F. funds. Meanwhile, those now negotiating to extend their loans will be able to extract stiff fees or above-market interest rates in return for forbearance.
"Foreign banks are in the position of monopolists since nobody is rushing to replace them as lenders," said Guillermo Calvo, an economist at the University of Maryland.
And while the South Korean Government is now trying to raise as much as $35 billion by floating bond issues of its own, thereby giving the banks an alternative means of staying afloat, the expected cost will be a big five percentage points above interest rates paid by risk-free borrowers.
The inequity of this outcome has not been lost on the officials at the I.M.F. and the Treasury, who had wanted the lenders to feel some pain but feared causing panic in the currency market.
Mr. Sachs is not impressed by this reasoning. "Looking back," he allowed, "it's hard to imagine that the Korean won would have fallen any further if the I.M.F. had punished the lenders rather than the borrowers."
But most specialists are looking forward, wondering whether the I.M.F. can continue to play the role of global lender of last resort without doing more harm than good. "Foreign banks will be there with cheap money as long as the I.M.F. is waiting on the sidelines to bail them out," Mr. Calvo worries.
The answer, he suggests, is less reliance on bailouts and more on domestic regulation limiting flows of hot money. Mr. Calvo cites the example of Chile, which has avoided currency gyrations by discouraging short-term borrowing abroad.

Only in Albany Is a Surplus Reason to Fret

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
IT'S an election year. There's a budget surplus. What could be more dangerous?
In his annual address to the Legislature yesterday afternoon, Gov. George E. Pataki offered lots of lofty if vaporous pronouncements about the state of the state. 
"Yesterday's job losses have dissipated behind us like a dark cloud passing," the Governor declared at one point.
"We have emerged from the mist to the endless, enduring dream," he said at another.
Such vague pronouncements are a staple of State of the State addresses, and most of Mr. Pataki's 63-minute speech was given over to them. Still, the Governor did manage to include calls for speeding up tax cuts for the elderly, accelerating tax cuts for farmers and adding new tax cuts for what he referred to as "job production."
In so doing, the Governor joined a long list of politicians, both in the state and out, intent on giving away the largesse that prosperity has provided. At this point, experts say, tax cutting plans are under discussion in roughly half the states.
Here in Albany, even before the legislative session began, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, had proposed new tax cuts for large corporations, small businesses and financial service firms, as well as reductions in motor vehicle registration fees. Meanwhile, the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, had already weighed in on the side of huge increases in the state's education budget.
All of which goes to show that excessive fiscal prudence has surely ceased to be considered good electoral policy, if it ever was.
For all of the state's recent prosperity and all of Mr. Pataki's talk of "our destiny, which lies before us like a land of limitless opportunity," it is important -- though not exactly in the spirit of yesterday's festivities -- to point out that New York is still tied with Louisiana for lowest bond rating in the country.
This does not mean that fiscal analysts doubt New York's ability to pay its creditors. It means they are horrified by the state's budget-making process.
And who can blame them?
Over the years, the state's fiscal monitors have watched in horror as Albany has flouted just about every conceivable tenet of sound budgeting, selling its prisons to itself and then leasing them back, for example, or, more recently, deciding to issue bonds for unspecified pork barrel projects. Despite a near-record stretch of economic growth and a Wall Street boom that has produced a flood of unanticipated revenues, New York continues to have the largest debt of any state and some of the smallest reserve funds.
What fiscal watchdogs fear this year is that the happy event of a budget surplus, estimated by the Governor yesterday at more than $1.4 billion, will, in the months ahead, be transformed by that old Albany magic into a liability. They worry not only that the surplus will be spent -- a sad but pardonable act of prodigality -- but that it will be spent many times over.
"It's the surplus that keeps on giving," said one such watchdog, Andrew Rein, who is a research associate at the Citizens Budget Commission.
ONE problem is that Albany has a habit of treating any bit of good fortune, no matter how fleeting, as if it will be permanent. Last month, for example, when Mr. Bruno offered his plans for spending the surplus, he didn't just propose tax cuts for the coming fiscal year, but for every year after that, too.
Another problem is that a surplus triggers all the ancient, vexatious Albany rivalries.
To be fair, the plans that Mr. Pataki outlined yesterday for spending the surplus appear, at least by Albany standards, to be relatively conservative. But already it seems that the Republican Governor's plans overlap with the Republican Senate majority leader's plans only in part, and with the Democratic Assembly Speaker's hardly at all. And it is easy to anticipate where this conflict will lead.
Eventually, there will be three separate plans for spending the same surplus. All parties will acknowledge that the plans can't all be enacted, yet none will want to give in. And so after endless bickering and grandstanding and secret meetings that pass for budget negotiations -- who knows what they are really doing in that room? -- the Governor and the legislative leaders will agree that actually the surplus was all along larger than they thought.
Then, not long after that, the state will be scrounging around, looking for another stretch of highway to mortgage to itself.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Robust Sales News Snaps 4-Day Bond Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds snapped a four-day rally yesterday, falling under the weight of robust housing and auto sales data, a weaker dollar, a growing corporate-debt supply and talk that the market's ebullience may be overdone.
The 30-year bond fell 29/32, to a price of 104 23/32. Its yield, which moves inversely to price and had fallen to record lows over the prior two days, rose to 5.78 percent, from 5.72 percent Tuesday. 
 While a pullback had been expected, it nonetheless erased nearly a third of the price gains over the last week made in the bond market, which had been surging on signs that the economy is slowing and interest rates may decline. The weekend comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, about possible price deflation also contributed to the market's euphoric mood.
"The favorable market climate produced by this outlook hit a stone wall today," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
While market participants still believe the economy is slowing and inflation remains tame, he said, the rally was snapped by the Commerce Department's strong November new-home sales report, healthy December sales by auto makers and "a growing perception that Chairman Greenspan's recent comments may have been misconstrued to some extent."
Mr. Fine said the home-sales report was significant because housing leads the overall economy and there is no sign the growth trend is ending -- in fact new-home sales are at the highest level in more than a decade.
While statistics on housing activity do not negate the prospect of a slackening economy in 1998, he said, the bond market nevertheless is likely to await more concrete data on the future direction of business activity before prices rally further.
"But bond market psychology is most certainly not bearish," he said. "With the Fed on hold and inflation acquiescent, the market's performance today appears to be much more a matter of curbing bullish enthusiasm."
Aside from the home and auto sales data released yesterday, the dollar's pullback against the yen also weighed on the bond market. The United States currency fell nearly 2.5 yen on fears that the United States and Japan may jointly sell dollars in the foreign-exchange market to curb its strength. A lower dollar would tend to diminish demand for securities denominated in dollars.
At the same time, the prospect of a supply glut from more corporate bond sales hangs over the market. Many companies view the decline in the yield of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond as an opportunity to raise money by selling debt themselves at relatively low financing costs.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Asia Turmoil Seen Leading To Stormy Times for Stocks

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Investors, after having thrived for three years on a great bull market, may be in for a little more turbulence.
There is a growing consensus among Wall Street experts, and perhaps even Main Street investors, that the crisis in Asia and its potentially deflationary effects on the rest of the world are not going away anytime soon. And with each passing day comes a little more confirmation. 
 Yesterday, it came with another batch of warnings about disappointing corporate profits in the United States. That was quickly followed by several downgrades on Wall Street -- warnings that investors ought to be cautious about certain stocks.
Then there was evidence that several large banks, technology companies and, yes, even Wall Street brokerage firms may find it much harder in 1998 to keep pace with last year's growth.
So it was no surprise that banking, technology and brokerage firm stocks plunged early in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average soon followed, tumbling 111 points by mid-day, before mounting a late afternoon rally.
Even though the Dow survived with just a few nicks, closing down 3.98 points, at 7,902.27, a hair below where it began the year, the broad market remains under siege.
"There's a growing recognition that Asia is a long-term problem that can't be easily solved by the I.M.F. or private lenders," Charles Pradilla, a market strategist with Cowen & Company, said, referring to the International Monetary Fund. "And so the odds are very high that for the next two quarters the earnings surprises are going to be disappointments."
To get a sense of the turmoil, investors need only look to Asia, where stock markets in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore continue to slide. Overnight, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong plummeted nearly 6 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225-stock index is down 2.6 percent this year.
European markets are better off, but they also weakened yesterday. And stock prices in Mexico and Brazil are down 3 and 5 percent this year, as the world braces for the possibility of a global slowdown.
In the United States, the latest earnings warnings came from Atmel, a computer-chip maker, and Rainforest Cafe, a restaurant chain. Both are rather small companies, but analyst fears seem to build with each profit warning.
Two large Wall Street houses -- Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover -- reported huge fourth-quarter profits. But brokerage stocks fell yesterday, perhaps on the fear that the new year would be stingier.
While the Dow's fall yesterday seemed minor, the broader market offered a clearer reflection of the day. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index lost 1.2 percent, and smaller stocks, as catalogued in the Russell 2000 index, dropped eight-tenths of a percent; both suffered heavier losses early. Bank and brokerage issues fell more than 2 percent.
For the Dow, which climbed 115 percent between the end of 1994 and August 1997, the last five months have been unnerving. Ignoring the day-to-day and week-to-week moves, the Dow has gone basically nowhere. It rests about 350 points below its Aug. 6 high of 8,259.31, and suffered its first quarterly loss in three years in the fourth quarter, when it dipped five-tenths of 1 percent.
The weakness is centered on fears the Asian crisis will spark deflationary pressure and depress corporate profits in America.
Edward Yardeni, the Deutsche Morgan Grenfell economist who not too long ago was parading the notion of a Dow at 10,000 by the year 2000, now frets about a market whose "days are numbered."
"The Asian crisis threatens to slow the global economy," he said. "The world economy desperately needs yuppies, and we thought we'd have yuppies in Asia to sell to, but now the outlook is grim."
As a result, Mr. Yardeni has slashed his United States profit forecast from 10 percent gains in 1998 to 5 percent, and he even talks about the possibility of profits being flat to down this year.
Charles Hill, director of research at First Call Inc., which tracks earnings estimates, said he had received lots of disappointing news on fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, and that analysts continued to trim their fourth-quarter forecasts, already down to 8 percent from expectations of 13 percent.
There are some bright spots. Interest rates are near a 30-year low, making stocks appear less expensive, and yesterday, when things looked dour, investors rushed in at the close and bought about $200 million worth of stock, according to Birinyi & Associates, a research firm.

HEADLINE: Billionaire Selling 60 Broad St. Tower

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Only a few years ago, lower Manhattan was devastated by layoffs, bankruptcies and a recession that left empty one out of every four floors of the district's office towers.
But in yet another indication that the city's financial district is on the rebound, Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire, is selling the 1 million square foot tower at 60 Broad Street for $62 million to investors. The new owners, who plan to spend $60 million more on renovations, are spending $122 a square foot in an area where buildings were going for as low as $30 a square foot just three years ago. 
 The 39-story tower, once home to the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank, is being bought by a joint venture of Kennedy-Wilson International, a publicly traded real estate company based in Los Angeles, and Pioneer Holdings, a Hong Kong investment company. The deal is scheduled to close next week.
"We are extremely bullish not only about the future of New York's financial district but on the role that 60 Broad Street will play in its continuing revitalization," said Richard Mandel, president of the commercial division of Kennedy-Wilson. "We've already started work on upgrading the building to modern standards."
The deal also illustrates just how fast conditions have changed and how rival developers are battling to buy potentially lucrative properties while the market is hot.
Francis Greenburger, chairman of Time Equities Inc., has sued the owner of 60 Broad Street, claiming that it reneged on a year-old agreement to sell him the top half of the tower, which he planned to convert to 400 condominium apartments; Mr. Li would have retained the lower portion of the tower as office space. Mr. Greenburger said he had worked for a year negotiating the terms of the deal. Suddenly, last September, the owners told him that the deal was off because the entire building was to be sold to a different buyer, Mr. Greenburger said.
"We feel they were obligated to deal with us exclusively and in good faith until the deal was completed, Mr. Greenburger said in an interview yesterday.
A spokesman for the owner declined comment.
"I think it's a reflection of how hot the market is," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a civic organization. "There is a competition for buildings and a competition for uses that's affecting the market now."
Much had changed downtown while Mr. Greenburger planned his conversion. Developers had transformed about 16 vacant office buildings downtown into apartment houses. Then, the long dormant office market revived, with the downtown vacancy rate falling to 17.6 percent in December, from 25.1 percent in 1995, according to the Insignia/Edward S. Gordon Company. Tenants were looking downtown because of the lack of large blocks of space in midtown.
Property values escalated so rapidly that the investor, Steven C. Witkoff, was able to sell the 29-story tower at 100 Wall Street last October for $58.5 million, or $128 a square foot, only five months after buying it for $37 million, or $81 a square foot.
With office space in demand, some developers switched plans. Mr. Witkoff was framing out apartments at 10 Hanover Square last spring when Goldman Sachs & Company agreed to lease the entire building for a unit of the investment bank.
"The office market has gotten to the point now where it rivals the residential market downtown," said Peter Hauspurg, president of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a real estate investment banking firm in Manhattan.
"Office rents have moved quickly to close the huge gap that existed with residential rents."
Some real estate brokers question how long the boomlet will last, given the wave of consolidation in the financial services industry and the fact that the industry has yet to reach employment levels of 1987. But Mr. Mandel is betting that he will have little trouble in leasing out 60 Broad Street.
"The market is moving upward in a very straight manner," he said.
Built for RCA during a real estate boom in 1961 by the developers Percy and Harold Uris, 60 Broad Street has served as a barometer for the downtown real estate market. The Reichmann family's Olympia & York company bought the Uris properties during a recession in 1977, the first step in establishing itself as the largest commercial landlord in New York. The Reichmanns had a $160 million mortgage on the building in 1990, when the principal tenant, Drexel Burnham Lambert, went bankrupt.
Mr. Li bought the mortgage and a 50 percent stake in the building for $57.5 million in 1991, when Olympia & York was unable to cover the monthly mortgage payments. Olympia & York, which eventually went bankrupt, defaulted on the mortgage. Mr. Li ultimately took control of the building.
In the last year, Mr. Li spent $25 million renovating the lower half of the building and leasing the space to three state agencies.
After considering a sale of the top half, Mr. Li, who lost millions on the building, decided to sell the entire property to Kennedy-Wilson and Pioneer, which had invested with Mr. Li in the mortgage.
"In the current market, they have a chance to do well with the building," said Jonathan Coven, vice president of Concord Properties, Mr. Li's company.
"Li is getting out because it doesn't fit his global strategy."

HEADLINE: Federal Deficit Will Fade Away in '98, Budget Office Predicts

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office projected today that the Federal budget deficit would be all but eliminated this year, continuing a deluge of good fiscal news that has both political parties eager to begin dividing the spoils.
The budget office said the deficit for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 would be just $5 billion, down from $22.7 billion last year and so small in a $1.7 trillion budget as to be almost meaningless. 
 Its analysis showed even smaller deficits for the next two years, and then steadily larger surpluses running out at least to 2008.
The $5 billion figure for this year was far more specific than President Clinton's announcement on Monday that White House budget analysts expect the 1998 deficit to decline to below $22 billion, and it is the latest evidence of how the strong economy is propelling Washington into an era of fiscal plenty far faster than almost anyone anticipated. As recently as last September, the budget office was predicting a $57 billion deficit for this year.
Mr. Clinton and the Republican leadership agreed on a plan last summer to balance the budget by 2002. The President said on Monday that he now expected to balance the budget next year, three years ahead of schedule.
But the budget office's projections, which in recent years have proven considerably too pessimistic, confirmed the predictions of many private analysts that the deficit could be wiped out this year, well before most of the spending cuts called for by the budget deal take effect.
"From where we're sitting now, it does look like it's possible there could be a surplus, although at $5 billion the deficit is so small it's indistinguishable from balance already," said June E. O'Neill, the budget office director.
With the specter of huge deficits now eliminated, both parties have begun maneuvering to use any surpluses to address their priorities. Republicans have been agitating for big tax cuts, while Democrats have been calling for new spending on programs like education and health care.
"I hope our friends on the other side won't plunge into the debate with a broad-based tax cut program," said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, who said the big Republican tax cuts of the early 1980's were what led to the sharply rising deficits in the first place.
Mr. Lautenberg's Republican counterpart, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the Budget Committee chairman, warned against abandoning the spending restraint that had been imposed by efforts to curb the deficit.
"Now is not the time to open the Federal spending floodgates," Mr. Domenici said.
The improved outlook seen by the budget office encompassed both higher-than-expected tax revenue and lower-than-planned spending.
The budget office said Federal revenue this year should be $1.665 trillion, or $30 billion higher than it was expecting in its last forecast in September. Spending for entitlement programs like Medicare, Social Security and welfare is now forecast by the budget office to total $950 billion this year, $18 billion less than it expected in September.

U.S. Warning To Indonesia: Comply on Aid

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that it was "crucial" for the Indonesian Government to begin complying with terms of its $40 billion financial bailout. Several officials said emergency aid to help the country escape its crisis could be cut off if President Suharto ignored the warnings.
The statement came a day after President Suharto, Asia's longest-serving leader, announced a budget for the next year that failed to comply with several requirements set by the International Monetary Fund when it agreed to huge loans to the country in October. The United States committed $3 billion to aid Indonesia in a "second line of defense" if the I.M.F.'s own funds proved insufficient; none of the American money has been disbursed. 
 "It will be crucial for Indonesia to carry through on policy commitments it has made in the context of the I.M.F. program," Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary and a central figure in the American efforts to contain the Asian financial crisis, told reporters late today. Mr. Summers specifically pointed to "measures to reform and clean up the financial system, to adjust monetary policy, and to control public infrastructure spending."
Mr. Summers's statement came as the Clinton Administration appeared headed for an unusual collision with Mr. Suharto, with whom President Clinton has gone to some lengths to build a relationship. Mr. Suharto has ruled the world's fourth-most- populous country for 32 years, and his power was unquestioned until recent months. But the combination of the financial crisis, increasing social unrest, signs of dissension in the Indonesian military, and evidence the 76-year-old leader is ailing have led to concerns about how a transition of power may unfold.
The American commitment to join the Indonesian bailout -- after it had pointedly declined to join an earlier rescue effort of Thailand -- was intended to show confidence in Indonesia's ability to right itself. Since then its currency, the rupiah, has plummeted, as it has become clear that Mr. Suharto and his relatives, who are deeply involved in the country's most profitable businesses, were resisting I.M.F. strictures.
Now the Administration is joining the I.M.F. in sending Mr. Suharto a blunt message: If Indonesia does not fulfill its reform commitments, the money will be cut off.
"We've tried the quiet approach," one official said last week. "Now the message is being sent through the markets."
In fact, before Mr. Summers spoke today, the markets began imposing their discipline on the Indonesian Government. In the first week of 1998, the Indonesian currency has fallen by more than a third, touching 8,400 rupiah to the dollar today. In trading on Thursday, the rupiah weakened to as low as 10,000 to the dollar.
At such levels,, many Indonesian companies cannot afford to repay huge loans from Japanese, American and European banks that are denominated in dollars or yen.
Indonesian officials insist they are committed to reform. "The loss of confidence and loss of trust is becoming irrational," the country's Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, told a news conference today. But that loss of trust was intensified by Mr. Suharto's budget, which was based on economic projections considered wildly unrealistic. For example, the budget assumes an exchange rate of 4,000 rupiah to the dollar, or twice as strong as the currency's current levels. Mr. Suharto also projected that the Indonesian economy would continue to grow; most economists believe it is headed for a major recession and double-digit inflation.
Within the Clinton Administration, a debate has already begun over how to handle Indonesia in coming months. Treasury officials have made clear that unless Indonesia complies with terms of the I.M.F. accord, continuing financial support would undercut the credibility of the I.M.F. bailouts around the world. Other nations might circumvent politically difficult reforms, especially those that result in bankruptcies and layoffs. Indonesian military authorities have said publicly in recent days that they expect two million people may soon be unemployed in their once-booming country, and they have vowed to suppress protests.
At the State Department there is growing concern that the financial crisis not turn into a series of street confrontations, or that it inflame the touchy issue of who will succeed President Suharto.
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, was a bit softer than Mr. Summers today, telling reporters: "President Suharto and other Government officials have expressed their willingness to undertake reforms outlined in the I.M.F. program. Some steps have been taken, including the closing of 16 banks. But far more remains to be done, especially if markets are to have confidence that Indonesia is fully committed to implementing the letter and the spirit of the program."
Military officials are also concerned, and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen will be stopping in Indonesia during an 11-day tour of Southeast Asia. He will likely be delivering a version of the warning Administration officials offered today.
Mr. Summers also said today that the United States would not provide $1.7 billion in speed-up aid to South Korea -- part of an $8 billion package of accelerated aid from many nations -- until commercial banks agree on extending payments for about $25 billion in short-term loans to South Korean banks.
European, Japanese and American banks are meeting Thursday morning at Citicorp headquarters in New York to negotiate such an agreement, which may include an accord to extend the loans for 90 days while new agreements are worked out. Such agreements are necessary before any of the short-term loans can be converted into more manageable long-term debt.
Mr. Summers also met this evening with Japan's Vice Finance Minister, Eisuke Sakakibara. That meeting, which followed a session between Mr. Sakakibara and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, prompted market speculation that the United States and Japan would intervene to prop up the yen by selling dollars.
The dollar plummeted 2.4 yen today and settled at 131.25 yen in New York on fear of such intervention. Mr. Summers would say little about the meeting, but American officials are clearly concerned that Japan has done too little, to reform its own ailing banking system, an underlying cause of yen weakness.

Stocks Fall Worldwide As Asia Tremors Linger
Stock markets around the world continued to be weakened by concerns over Asia's financial crisis and its potential deflationary effects. The Dow Jones industrial average recovered from an 111-point deficit to end down 3.98 points, at 7,902.27, but broader market barometers fell sharply. The Nasdaq composite index fell 18.44 points, or 1.17 percent, to 1,561.70. 
 Financial and technology companies were especially hurt, reflecting investor fear that their earnings will suffer as a result of decreased demand from Asia. Page D8.
 
Citing the rapid buildup in short-term foreign loans as the major cause of the Asian crisis, American, South Korean and Japanese economists have called for new ways to curb such lending and borrowing. D4.
 
The currencies of Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines again touched record lows against the dollar on investor skepticism that Asian nations were committed to economic change. D4.
 
Bonds Fall After Four-Day Rally
Long-term Treasury prices fell yesterday under the weight of robust housing and auto sales data, a weaker dollar, a growing corporate debt supply and talk that the market's strength may be overdone. The decline came after four days of gains that had pushed yields on the 30-year bond to record lows. D8.
 
Morgan and Lehman Earnings Rise
Two of Wall Street's biggest firms reported surprisingly strong fourth-quarter earnings. The results from Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. suggested that big brokerage firms have not been hurt by turmoil in Asia markets, at least not yet. D2.
 
Criminal Case in Tobacco Inquiry

It is the first criminal action brought by the agency in its long investigation of the tobacco industry. A16.
 
Camry Is Top Seller in 1997
The Toyota Camry, left, was the best-selling car in 1997, beating the Honda Accord by 12,547 autos. It is the first time a Japanese nameplate has captured the No. 1 spot in five years. The Ford Taurus, which had held the title, came in third. Auto makers sold 15.2 million cars in the United States last year, up from 15.1 million in 1996. D9.
 
New-Home Sales Rose 5.1%
Falling interest rates and rising consumer confidence sent new-home sales surging 5.1 percent in November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 830,000, the most since April 1986. Analysts predicted sales for all of 1997 will top 800,000, a 6 percent rise. D23.

Clinton Seeks to Expand Child Care
President Clinton proposed a $21.7 billion package of grants and tax breaks to help working families find affordable child care.

HEADLINE: Pataki Says He Delivered on Promises; Experts Aren't So Sure

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki used his election-year address to the Legislature today to remind New Yorkers that he had delivered on the major campaign pledges he made four years ago: creating jobs, reducing crime, cutting taxes and shrinking the welfare rolls.
But interviews with experts in each of those areas raise questions about some of the Governor's claims. Here are some of the victories Mr. Pataki touted, and the experts' assessments:
 
Crime 
 Mr. Pataki boasted that the streets of New York State are far safer today than they were three years ago, when, he said, the state led the nation in violent crimes. But according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York's rate of violent crime three years ago was really seventh, behind Florida, California, South Carolina, Nevada, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.
Mr. Pataki also claimed that the tough anti-crime measures he pushed through the Legislature, particularly the enactment of the death penalty and the elimination of parole for violent offenders convicted for a second time, had contributed to the state's plummeting crime rates.
But most experts say that a direct link between enacting the death penalty and deterring crime is difficult to prove, and that the parole change, enacted in 1995, is too new to have had any effect. They also say that the state's drop in crime has been driven by trends in New York City, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has employed new and aggressive police strategies.
For instance, there were 1,171 fewer murders in New York City in 1996 than in 1991; statewide, there were 1,214 fewer murders in 1996 than in 1991.
"No one attributes the drop in crime in New York City to policies coming out of Albany," said Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of New York. "Rather, it's a result of demographic patterns, new police strategies and a truce among rival drug gangs."
 
Job Creation
 Jobs will surely be a major campaign issue this year, and Mr. Pataki today touted New York as a leader in job creation since he took office. "When I was elected, New York State was 49th in the nation in creating jobs," he said. "Now we are sixth."
But economists said the numbers Mr. Pataki cited were a bit misleading. New York did indeed create more jobs in absolute numbers, 236,400, between 1994 and 1997. But in terms of percentages, New York went from 48th to 42d in job growth during those years, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute.
"Counting jobs is inappropriate for state-by-state comparisons," said Jennifer McCormick, an analyst with the Fiscal Policy Institute. "Using this measure, the third most populous state, New York, has to eke out a 1 percent increase to beat out the 38th most populous, Nevada's 6 percent employment increase."
 
Taxes
 One of the Governor's least disputed claims was his assertion that New York State had become a leader in cutting taxes. "We've cut so many taxes -- in so many different ways and so many times -- that it would take me 10 minutes just to read you the list," he said.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, New York has led other states in cutting taxes for the three years that Mr. Pataki has been in office: $944 million between 1995 and 1996; $1.9 billion between 1996 and 1997 and $803 million between 1997 and 1998. In all, New York's tax cuts amounted to more than 38 percent of the $10 billion in tax cuts enacted nationwide in the three years.
"Those are very impressive figures," said Ronald K. Snell, the director of the economic and fiscal division for the conference of legislatures.
 
Welfare
 The Governor said his administration had succeeded in freeing many people trapped in a culture of dependency fostered by old welfare programs. He said the number of people on public assistance had been reduced by 456,000, to 1,191,000 from 1,647,000, since he took office.
The numbers have indeed plummeted, but many experts contend that the numbers have been largely driven by experiments in welfare overhaul by local governments, though some of those programs required approval by the state.
In New York City, the rolls have declined by 338,000, to 822,117 from 1,160,593 three years ago. "The city's welfare program has driven the state decline," said Tony Coles, Mayor Giuliani's welfare adviser. "But the Governor has been helpful in advocating legislation that has been helpful to our program."

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Welfare Chief Chosen for New York City

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
The architect of a Wisconsin welfare program that has pushed more people off public assistance than in almost any other state in the country was selected yesterday to run New York City's sprawling social service agency.
Jason A. Turner, 44, who instituted some of the nation's most radical welfare changes, which abolished cash assistance and will soon require almost every able-bodied welfare recipient to work, will take over in February, city officials said. As Commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration, Mr. Turner will oversee the largest workfare program in the country. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani introduced his new social services chief at a news conference at City Hall yesterday and emphasized Mr. Turner's national reputation and his commitment to making work "part of the centrality of people's lives."
"We're very, very pleased that he's willing to take on this challenge," Mr. Giuliani said. "We're very fortunate to have him."
With the selection of the well-known policy maker, who replaces Commissioner Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, Mr. Giuliani clearly hopes to burnish his own welfare reform efforts.
More than 300,000 people have left the welfare rolls in the last three years, although city officials have not followed them to see if they have found jobs.
Some advocates for the poor fear that Mr. Turner's approach may be too harsh, but others see his appointment as a sign that Mr. Giuliani, who is often criticized for failing to move people into private-sector work, may soon be shifting strategy to offer more support services for welfare recipients struggling to find jobs.
If the Wisconsin program is one of the toughest in the nation, it is also in some ways among the most generous. Last year, for instance, Wisconsin provided day care to all 9,600 children whose families wanted it. In New York City, 12,000 families are on waiting lists for child care.
While the number of families on welfare rolls has fallen 58 percent in the last five years in Wisconsin, the state has increased its spending on those families 62 percent in the last year alone, offering child care, health care and training designed to move mothers into the workforce.
But in New York City, the sheer scale of the task easily dwarfs that of Wisconsin. Mr. Turner, who left his state job to work as a consultant last year, now confronts an infinitely more difficult job.
In Wisconsin, he had to put only 31,000 mothers to work in a state with an unemployment rate of about 3 percent. New York City, on the other hand, has the second-largest welfare caseload in the country, with 314,000 mothers on welfare and only 15,326 currently participating in workfare, and an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent.
It is also a city where human resources commissioners working for Mr. Giuliani typically have little autonomy to make their own decisions or initiate new programs. Welfare policy, according to city officials, is generally run directly from City Hall.
But Mr. Turner, a ruddy, blue-eyed welfare policy expert who said he has been dreaming about reforming the system since his junior high school days in Darien, Conn., says he relishes the opportunity to work in one of the nation's largest social laboratories.
"For somebody in the welfare community, New York City is it," Mr. Turner said. "This is the place where it's possible to make large amounts of difference in many people's lives and I look forward to that."
When asked if he could replicate his reforms in a city with a much larger caseload and a tighter job market, Mr. Turner said, "The kinds of things that you need to do to get somebody a job is the same in Milwaukee as it is in New York City."
Mr. Giuliani declined to outline his plans for welfare reform in his second term, saying only that he would like to place more emphasis on moving people directly from workfare into private-sector work. He said he had lobbied the state government for increased funding for day care and would continue to do so.
But Mr. Giuliani did reject two planks of the Wisconsin program, saying he opposed the privatization of the welfare system and the cutting off all benefits to mothers who failed to comply with work rules. In New York City, those women lose only a portion of their welfare checks.
"I have great resistance to any sanctions that will impact on children," he said.
Reaction to Mr. Turner's appointment was mixed among advocates for welfare recipients. Some were troubled, noting that the number of homeless and hungry people increased during Mr. Turner's three-year tenure as director of the Welfare Replacement Project in Wisconsin. And officials in Wisconsin, like those in New York City, made no effort to track the progress of the people who vanished from the rolls.
"The bottom line is that we're nervous," said Don Friedman, a senior policy analyst at the Community Food Resource Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.
But Allen Kraus, a former deputy commissioner in the city's social service agency, said he thought the appointment might signal a shift in a program that has focused on workfare.
"If you take what happened in Wisconsin and bring it here, you have to do more than we're doing now, you have to do more than just workfare," said Mr. Kraus, who is the co-chairman of a civic group called the Task Force for Sensible Welfare Reform. "It means a workfare program that actually moves people toward work. If that's what the Mayor wants to do, that's good."

HEADLINE: Council Speaker Proposes Cut to City's Income Tax

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The Speaker of the City Council, Peter F. Vallone, called for a $500 million cut in the city's personal income tax yesterday, seeking to bolster his candidacy for governor by portraying himself as a champion of the middle class who gives "money back to the people."
But in a role reversal, the proposal by the Democratic Speaker immediately ran into opposition from his Republican counterpart across City Hall, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who labeled it an election-year ploy that the city could not afford. 
 The sudden flare-up over the proposed tax cut underscored how the city government is increasingly being pulled into the gubernatorial race, with Mr. Vallone, a candidate for the Democratic nomination, trying to tailor his agenda to insure that he has programs to promote on the stump. Mr. Vallone unveiled the proposal in his annual address to the Council, a speech that included a glimpse of some of the themes that he plans to stress in his statewide campaign. He also took several jabs at Gov. George E. Pataki.
Mr. Vallone said the city should cut taxes by $500 million by letting a 12.5 percent surcharge on its personal income tax expire at the end of the year. He also called for changing some tax rates so that working- and middle-class people receive more of the benefits of the cut.
The moves would lower the annual tax for a family of four with earnings of $25,000 to $199, from $270, a drop of 26 percent. For a family of four with earnings of $60,000, the tax bill would decline to $1,448 from $1,677, a drop of almost 14 percent. For a family of four with earnings of $200,000, it would go to $7,115 from $7,825, a drop of 9 percent.
City and state officials first approved the surcharge in 1990 to help the city close a budget gap caused in part by the recession. It was reauthorized the following year, with the money dedicated to pay for the hiring of police officers as part of the "Safe Streets, Safe City" program, which was adopted after a surge in violent crime in the city.
In his speech yesterday, Mr. Vallone said that with the recession over and the economy rebounding, the surcharge should lapse.
"The people of this city made the sacrifices that we asked of them," he said. "We were their representatives. Now it's up to us to pay them back -- with tax relief and tax reform and tax equity."
At a news conference soon after, Mr. Giuliani emphasized that while he generally favored cutting taxes, the city could not handle the loss of $500 million in revenue at a time when its finances are finally stabilizing after several years of austerity. "You're getting to the point where you are creating some degree of fiscal irresponsibility for the position of the city," he said of the proposal.
Mr. Vallone's aides said that by seeking to end the surcharge, he would help insulate himself during the gubernatorial campaign from accusations that he supported high taxes. If Mr. Vallone wins the primary, his fiscal record is almost certain to come under attack from the Pataki campaign, which would likely publicize a list of instances when he voted for tax increases.
The Speaker did not say in his speech how the city would make up for the lost revenue from the tax cut. The city is already facing a projected budget gap of $1.2 billion for the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
In an interview after the speech, Mr. Vallone said city tax revenues continued to exceed expectations because of strong profits on Wall Street, so the city should not have trouble balancing its budget after the surcharge expires. Nor would the city have to reduce the number of police officers, because it would use other sources of revenue to make up for the police financing from the surcharge.
Mr. Vallone also said he was open to compromise with Mr. Giuliani. "I think that it's a very responsible proposal, or otherwise I would not have made it," he said. "That does not mean that we cannot sit down and modify it."
In his speech, Mr. Vallone formally announced two other proposals that his aides first disclosed on Tuesday. One would give half-price tuition for two years at the City University to students who maintain at least a B average. The other would keep all the city's public elementary schools open on school days from 3 P.M. to 7 P.M. for after-school programs.
All three proposals, he said, would revitalize the city's middle class, a theme he repeated in his speech.
Mr. Giuliani, though, derided the three proposals as exorbitant, saying that they would cost more than $1 billion a year. He questioned whether the tax cut would force the city to reduce the size of the Police Department just as he was planning to hire 1,600 police officers, bringing the total to 40,000, the highest ever.
Mr. Giuliani said he would strongly oppose the tax cut, but he is in a difficult position. Approval by the Governor and the State Legislature is required for the surcharge to be extended, yet it would be very unlikely that they would agree to do so without the assent of Mr. Giuliani and the Council. So Mr. Vallone could force the surcharge to lapse simply by blocking approval by the Council.
Mr. Giuliani called for doing away with the surcharge in January 1996. But he abandoned that proposal, and in the last two years, he has focused on eliminating the sales tax on clothing, which he said would provide more benefits to poor people than reducing the personal income tax.
The city and state have agreed to eliminate the sales tax on clothing under $100 next year.
In recent years, the Mayor and the Council have also cut the commercial rent tax and a tax on the earnings of unincorporated businesses.

HEADLINE: Government by Increment: Pataki Speech Takes Few Chances

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 7

 BODY:
President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign showed that for an incumbent blessed with a healthy economy and strong poll numbers, an election year is the season for government by increment, not bold action. And Gov. George E. Pataki has learned the lesson well.
In his annual State of the State Message today, the Governor hewed to the core conservative ideas that got him elected, attacking high taxes and crime, but with nothing like the striking proposals of his first three years in office: the death penalty, deep cuts in income and property taxes, and smaller budgets. 
 Instead, as he begins the election year, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, cast a broad net of smaller, highly popular ideas, like allowing victims' relatives to testify at the sentencing of murderers and accelerating a tax cut for family farms. Where Mr. Clinton talked during his campaign about school uniforms and "portable" health insurance that an employee could carry from one job to another, Mr. Pataki today offered renovation of a Niagara Falls tourist center and a pilot after-school program.
Early in his 63-minute address, the Governor said that "today is truly a time for reflection," and sure enough, the speech was more a litany of past accomplishments than a blueprint for the future.
It was a signal that in the coming campaign, Mr. Pataki will take no chances because he believes that he does not have to. Mr. Pataki has huge leads in the polls over the Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls and a huge campaign war chest, and his advisers have figured that the heavy work of carrying him to a second term has already been done.
The tax cuts are in place, capital punishment is state law, and the welfare overhaul that the Governor sought in his first two years in office was delivered by Congress and Mr. Clinton. Wall Street's boom has left state government flush, allowing for pet programs, rather than spending cuts, to be the order of the day. And seven years into an economic expansion, New York's economy is finally growing at something approaching the national rate.
Taking another page from Mr. Clinton's re-election book, Mr. Pataki seized on issues that have been more commonly associated with the opposition, areas where he might be politically vulnerable.
In the past, Mr. Pataki repeatedly proposed sharp cuts in education and health care spending, cuts that were largely beaten back by the Legislature. Today, he proposed several new education programs and said he wanted to provide health care to all uninsured children.
The Governor boasted of a law enacted last year that will make prekindergarten classes available to most 4-year-olds, but that was the Democrats' initiative, and Mr. Pataki accepted it only in trade for property tax cuts. The kind of after-school program he proposed was a favorite of his Democratic predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, has been approved in other years by the Assembly and is already in place in several places, including New York City.
"Pataki started out as Newt Gingrich, and now he's Nelson Rockefeller," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat. "Next, he'll be Bill Clinton."
Mr. Pataki has always made a virtue of simplicity, choosing a few themes and playing them to the hilt. Yet today, speaking from the comfort of incumbency and lacking any dramatic plans, he proposed no fewer than 28 pieces of legislation.
But they mostly had the distinct ring of familiarity. Some, like ending parole for all violent felons or passing a hate-crimes law, were proposals he has made in previous years that died in the Legislature. Others involved expanding programs or delivering tax cuts that are already set in law a year or two ahead of schedule. And the Governor, who used to chide Mr. Cuomo for his frequent use of pilot programs rather than broad initiatives, even proposed a few of his own pilot programs.
Pataki aides have said for months that the Governor would have no appetite this year for the kind of big, bruising fights with the Legislature that have marked his term so far. His speech today contained just one potential point of confrontation with the Democratic-controlled Assembly -- his renewed call for ending parole for all violent felons. But that idea is so widely popular with the public that many Democrats say they will be unable to resist going along with it this year.
Although Mr. Pataki has often railed against the dysfunction of state government, embracing ideas like term limits and ballot initiatives that put him at odds with the Legislature, today he mentioned none of them. "This speech was good political theater," said the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a Democrat who considered a run against Mr. Pataki this year. "It didn't take any chances and it showed George Pataki taking credit for the accomplishments of New York."
State Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Republican from Binghamton, put a kindlier spin on the same conclusion."There's no new direction because we don't need a new direction," Senator Libous said. "This is a great direction he's already put us in."

TAX CUTS -- More than double the $500 million in tax cuts that had been set for 1998 to $1.2 billion.

HEADLINE: Dueling Campaign Speeches

 BODY:
The biggest question raised by Gov. George Pataki's State of the State speech yesterday was what he saved to say when he announces for re-election. This speech was supposed to be about the challenges New York State has yet to meet, but its agenda was both modest and overly focused on campaign headlines.
The Governor failed to make a single mention of campaign finance reform. He did not speak of rebuilding the crumbling and overcrowded schools in many parts of New York. There was no offer of support for the drive by New York City's Schools Chancellor, Rudy Crew, to end tenure for public school principals. The Governor talked about creating jobs, but overlooked infrastructure -- the subway and rail service improvements needed to get workers to those jobs in New York City. 
 One important exception to the trivial tone was the call for making health care coverage available to every uninsured child in the state. Assembly Democrats say the plan should cover more types of treatment. That may be a desirable goal, but the most important priority, as Mr. Pataki seems to understand, should be making basic coverage universal for the state's children.
The Governor is at his best when he takes this statesmanlike stance between the Democratic-led Assembly's desire to spend and the Republican Senate's obsession with tax cuts. But when he begins to pander, he simply makes the normal partisan gridlock in Albany more hopeless. Mr. Pataki's call for expanding the death penalty laws before the state's first capital case has even come to trial was a tipoff that his law enforcement plans have more to do with winning in November than defeating crime.
He restricted his call for tax cuts to proposals that the Legislature speed up previously approved property tax relief for senior citizens and farmers. That restraint is welcome, since even the tax cuts already scheduled could create a fiscal crisis if another recession occurs.
This points up a problem in the State of the City speech yesterday by the New York City Council Speaker, Peter Vallone, who plans to run against Mr. Pataki. Mr. Vallone criticized the Governor's tax cuts as fiscally dangerous, but then proposed a $500 million reduction in the city's personal income tax and expensive new after-school programs without any balancing spending cuts. The Speaker's call for giving A and B students a huge tuition break at public colleges was less a serious idea for education reform than a sure-fire invitation to grade inflation. It was yet another sign of how election-year politics can wreak havoc on rational government.

Indonesia Leads Deeper Dive of Asian Currencies

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Indonesia's battered currency plumbed new depths today and its stock market tumbled after the nation drew blunt criticism from the United States for not doing enough to reform its economy and satisfy conditions for a $40 billion International Monetary Fund aid package.
The decline of the currency, the rupiah, weighed on other Asian currencies and stock markets. 
 Japanese shares were flat, dipping six-hundredths of a percent. Stocks in Hong Kong fell but rose 3.5 percent in South Korea.
Traders said the dominant theme in the markets was growing tension between the United States and Indonesia and the possibility that American displeasure might result in a cutoff of emergency relief.
"The Indonesians have gotten into the wrong side of the book of the U.S.," said Chia Woon Khien, head of Asian research at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in Jakarta. "It's not going to do Indonesia any good."
The rupiah tumbled 19 percent today, to as low as 10,000 to the dollar, its lowest since the currency began trading in 1971. It has fallen to record lows on each trading day this year. In 1997, the rupiah was the world's worst-performing currency, falling 56 percent against the dollar.
The Thai baht lost 2 percent this morning, declining to 54.10 to the dollar, its fifth drop in a row.
The Bank of Thailand is considering a return to a managed float of the baht, a daily newspaper reported today. The Nation quoted the bank's senior assistant governor, Siri Ganjarendee, as saying that under a proposal the central bank would form a consortium with commercial banks and big companies to quote the baht-dollar rate, effectively setting the exchange rate. The baht has lost 51.3 percent of its value since it was floated last July.
In Malaysia, the ringgit weakened as much as 2.7 percent, to 4,704 to the dollar, before recovering as the central bank bought the currency.
The Philippine peso and the Singapore dollar were little changed. The peso traded at 44.97 to the dollar compared with yesterday's settlement price of 45.35. The Singapore dollar was little changed at 1.7445 to the American dollar compared with 1.7535. Those declines contributed to a 5.8 percent tumble in Indonesian stocks, a 6.9 percent fall in Philippine shares and a 1 percent drop in Singapore stocks.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues fell despite an earlier rally by shares of exporters like Sony and the Toyota Motor Corporation, which are expected to benefit from the yen's depreciation against the dollar to the lowest levels in six years.
The Nikkei fell 8.99 points, or six-hundredths of a percent, to 15,019.18.
Hong Kong stocks continued to fall after a deep drop yesterday; the Hang Seng index was down 4.5 percent at midday. The market remained unsettled by news that Peregrine Investment Holdings might revise a deal with Zurich Center Investments Ltd. giving the Swiss group a stake in the company.

HEADLINE: U.S. Leaders Plan to Grapple A Hot Potato: Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
To one camp, Social Security is an inviolable promise to provide all workers the foundation of a comfortable retirement, and the program's looming financial problems should not be an excuse to dismantle what is in many ways the Federal Government's premier antipoverty program.
From another perspective, Social Security's obligations to future retirees so greatly exceed its projected receipts that the system cannot and should not be maintained as a mammoth Government entitlement. It should instead be remade to push more responsibility -- and risk -- into the hands of individuals. 
 Somewhere within that ideological gulf, the Clinton Administration, the Republican leadership and Congressional Democrats say they have begun looking for a politically and economically feasible way of assuring that the Social Security system does not become insolvent in the decades after the huge baby-boom generation begins retiring around 2010.
The White House and Speaker Newt Gingrich both said this week that they wanted to begin tackling the issue, one of the most politically explosive on Washington's agenda, and wanted to reach a final deal sometime between the mid-term Congressional elections in November and the start of the 2000 Presidential race a year or so later.
Because the problems in Social Security have been apparent for years, there is no shortage of proposed solutions bouncing around Washington. But while many politicians, economists and public policy experts say there is room for a compromise, there is little consensus on which of the competing and often painful proposals should be adopted.
"Substantively, the ground has been plowed," said Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee's task force on Social Security. "The question of whether anything is going to grow is one of political leadership."
Also unresolved is just what process President Clinton, Republican leaders and Democrats in Congress will use to hash out their differences and avoid turning Social Security into a bitterly partisan issue subject to demagoguery by both sides.
And all sides are still trying to gauge public opinion, both among retirees receiving Social Security benefits now and later generations who face the prospect of making bigger contributions to finance their parents' retirements while receiving little when they reach old age.
"We have to try to raise the sense of national urgency," said Gene Sperling, the White House's economic policy adviser.
The revenue raised for Social Security by payroll taxes on workers and employers currently exceeds what the system pays out in benefits, allowing the Government to accumulate a surplus. But after the baby boomers start to retire in droves around 2010, benefit payments will begin to exceed revenue, and under current projections the program will run through the surplus by 2029. After that, revenue each year would be sufficient to pay no more than about 75 percent of promised benefits.
Those who favor maintaining the Social Security system more or less in its present form include many Democrats, unions and the big groups representing the elderly. They advocate relying on financial changes to increase revenue or limiting benefits to avoid big changes in the system's structure or obligation to make guaranteed payments based on lifetime earnings. Most White House officials lean toward keeping a system that guarantees a defined amount of money to retirees.
"We need to also encourage private savings, but that should not come at the expense of the Social Security system that provides a base, a floor of support for millions and millions of Americans," Franklin D. Raines, the White House budget director, said on Sunday on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
To keep the current system intact would require choosing among options including a reduction in benefits, an increase in taxes and an acceleration in the already scheduled increase in the retirement age.
There is also support for trying to increase the amount of money the Government makes investing the pool of funds it holds to pay future benefits. That trust fund is now invested entirely in Government bonds, which have generated only a fraction of the returns from stocks in recent years. Many analysts say the Government should invest part of the money in stocks.
The other general approach, favored by many conservative Republicans, calls for reducing the level of payment guaranteed by the Government but putting more of the taxes paid back into the hands of individuals to invest.
The most modest of these proposals would allow individuals to allocate some fraction of the money they contribute to Social Security to particular investment vehicles. The most radical approaches call for largely replacing the system with mandatory retirement savings accounts.
After two years of work, a Federal advisory panel reported last year that it was deeply split about which approach to take. Six of 13 members supported bolstering the current system, in part by allowing the Government to invest part of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market. Five favored creating mandatory savings accounts managed by individuals, reducing the current program to a minimum safety net of assured payments.
Two of the panel's members, however, advocated a middle-ground approach that many analysts think could point the way to a compromise: retain the current system but offset a decline in benefits with a mandatory savings account that would be financed by an increase in the payroll tax.
Many of the proposals circulating on Capitol Hill seek to strike a similar balance between fixing the current system and taking a more market-oriented approach.
But powerful groups representing the elderly are wary of substantial changes. "We feel that retirement should be built on the foundation of a defined benefit plan you can count on," said John Rother of the American Association of Retired Persons.
There are some measures that could prove politically palatable. Nearly four million employees of state and local governments are not covered by Social Security, and bringing them into the system would generate more revenue.
Many analysts think there will be no way to avoid unpopular steps. The retirement age for full benefit eligibility is already set to rise gradually to 67 from 65 between 2003 and 2029, and some Congress members believe it will be necessary to speed that timetable considerably.
The tax levied to finance Social Security might have to be increased. Currently, a 6.2 percent payroll tax, matched by the employer, is paid on wages up to a cap of $68,400. One option sure to be considered is substantially raising or eliminating the cap, placing a higher tax burden on people with higher incomes. Other options include reducing benefits for the wealthy and cutting cost-of-living increases.

HEADLINE: PATAKI PROPOSING HEALTH CARE PLAN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Positioning himself for a re-election campaign this fall, Gov. George E. Pataki today proposed a major expansion of health insurance for young New Yorkers as well as an acceleration of tax cuts and an expansion of anti-crime measures that he said had already enabled him to lead the state to "the dawn of its greatest day."
In his fourth annual State of the State address, a speech notably devoid of contentious initiatives, the Republican Governor cautiously previewed the economic and social themes that he is likely to use if, as widely expected, he runs for a second term: reducing taxes, cutting welfare and fighting crime. 
 At the same time, while playing up his successes over the past three years in those areas, he strove to shore up potential electoral weaknesses elsewhere by offering a cheery, upbeat review of New York's job picture -- an outlook that his potential challengers insist is particularly dim because of a lack of gubernatorial leadership.
In this same context, by proposing the youth health insurance plan, he may also have been seeking to soften the oft-held perception that he is too rigid on social programs, especially welfare revision. The health proposal, he said, would guarantee access to comprehensive health coverage "for every single child of New York through the age of 18."
The proposal drew some of the loudest applause of the day, even louder than the applause drawn when earlier in the speech he proposed to more than double the size of the scheduled 1998 tax cut, to $1.2 billion.
"No child should be denied medical care," he said, though he offered no further details, particularly as to how much Federal money might be available for such a program.
At the start of his hourlong speech, delivered to both houses of the New York Legislature but aimed more at voters beyond the Capitol's ornate Assembly chamber, Mr. Pataki proudly asserted that "in just three years, we have restored the dream." As delivered, it sounded like a line that could well be heard many times over before November.
"We have reduced the size and cost of government," he said, his voice flat and carrying little emotion. "We have returned power that was for the people back to the people. We have restored sanctity to the idea that every New Yorker has a sacred right to choose and shape their own destiny."
The Governor had good reason in his speech to play up the tax cuts, education programs and anti-crime measures that he strongly supported, for, in the view of many political professionals, his support for them has enabled him to achieve approval ratings of close to 60 percent in the polls. In addition, those ratings have won him some recent mention as a possible Presidential or Vice-Presidential candidate.
In one of the several areas in which the Governor seemed to go out of his way to shore up his political fences in an area where he has been perceived as somewhat weak, job creation, he called for aggressive recruitment of high-technology firms by the state.
"Make no mistake," he declared. "New York will lead America into the high-tech age of the 21st century."
Arrayed around Mr. Pataki on the legislative dais as he spoke were most of the top elected officials in the state, including the leaders of both the State Senate and State Assembly, as well as Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, his running mate three years ago, who has since defected to Democratic ranks and now plans to challenge him in November.
The speech was received with enthusiastic support from Republican legislators, who repeatedly interrupted it with applause.
"In just three years, Governor Pataki has turned around New York State, pointing us towards greater economic prosperity," the Senate Majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno of Rensselaer County, said as he and other Republican lawmakers dispersed after the Governor's speech.
Democratic lawmakers mostly were polite but restrained.
"I never reject anything out of hand," said Speaker Sheldon Silver of the Assembly, a Democrat of Manhattan.
Beyond Albany, where most of the Governor's potential re-election challengers live, the rhetoric often took on a sharper, more partisan tone.
"Today's speech shows New Yorkers that George Pataki is letting the ship of state float aimlessly toward the 21st century," said Peter F. Vallone, the Democrat who is Council Speaker in New York City and who has said he plans to run for Governor.
Mr. Pataki saw it otherwise, of course, in his speech.
He asserted that because of his leadership, New York is now "the undisputed tax-cutting capital of America." A "vast majority" of New Yorkers, he contended, now pay taxes at rates at least 25 per cent lower than they did when he first took office. "In the budget I send you in two weeks," he added, "I will propose more than doubling this year's tax cuts, to $1.2 billion."
The new cuts, he went on, would be written in particular to reduce property taxes paid by farmers and retired people. The votes of both played an important role in Mr. Pataki election victory in 1994, especially in upstate New York, a major base for him.
Turning to crime, another major issue in the 1994 Pataki victory -- he favored restoration of the death penalty -- the Governor said that the drop in the state's crime rate had been so drastic in the years since he took office that "the rest of the nation is looking at New York with awe." Then he called for passage of even tougher crime measures, including allowing juries to hear evidence about a defendant's criminal history, as well as allowing them to hear testimony from relatives of murder victims about the impact of the slaying on their lives.
The Governor also proposed giving apartment tenants and community organizations legal power to evict drug dealers from their neighborhoods. He called for an end to parole for all violent felons. And he said that drug offenders who are convicted repeatedly for "minor" offenses should eventually be charged with a felony, though he did not say how many convictions should result in the heavier charge. "Our mission is not to stem violent crime but to eradicate it, " Mr. Pataki declared.
On education, the Governor called for expanding the state's pre-kindergarten programs, urged setting up more charter schools and suggested increased efforts to improve reading and English-speaking skills.
"Nothing in our future holds more promise than the vivid dreams of a child," he said. "And no obligation is more fundamental -- for us, as parents -- than the obligation to give them a clear path to those dreams. Let's tackle the real-life problems that we know are preventing our children from learning."

HEADLINE: Canada's Indigenous Tribes Receive Formal Apology

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Jan. 7

 BODY:
For the first time, the Canadian Government has formally apologized to its 1.3 million indigenous people for 150 years of what Indian groups have charged were paternalistic assistance programs and racist schools that devastated their communities as thoroughly as any war or disease.
Along with the formal apology, the Government promised today to establish a $245 million "healing fund" for the thousands of Indians who were taken from their homes and forced to attend the schools, where they were sometimes physically and sexually abused. 
 Some social and economic development programs were also outlined.
The Government was responding to a report last year that condemned its treatment of indigenous people, but fell far short of fulfilling the report's recommendations. Indian leaders have long demanded an apology but federal officials refused to give one until now because of fears of setting a legal precedent.
Just as soon as the apology was read, it exposed a rift among Indians. Some leaders called it a historic step but others invited to the ceremony in the Parliament Building here today said the apology and the offer of compensation did not go far enough.
"The federal Government is insulting aboriginal people with this response," said Marilyn Buffalo, president of the Native Women's Association of Canada. Leaders representing the Inuit, as Eskimos are called here, were upset that forced relocations of their people were not mentioned. And the Metis, people of mixed Indian and European ancestry, said the Government's actions were insincere.
Indian leaders also pointed out that the compensation package is less than the $350 million that the Government acknowledged it wasted when it canceled a fleet of rescue helicopters. On Monday, it reordered essentially the same helicopters.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a former minister of Indian affairs who has not made Indian affairs a priority in his Government, was criticized for not having personally endorsed the apology by signing it.
Still, the formal "Statement of Reconciliation" represents a significant reversal and a difficult acknowledgment for a Government that prides itself on its compassion.
Speaking after an elaborate ceremony punctuated by drumbeats and traditional dances, Phil Fontaine, the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, referred to the officials present as partners. His conciliatory attitude is thought to have played an essential part in getting the Government to act. He said it took courage for officials to take a "historic step to break with the past and to apologize for the historic wrongs and injustices" committed against Indian people.
Jane Stewart, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, who also is considered a moderate voice in Indian affairs, said, "History cannot be changed." She said, however, that "it must be understood in a way that reflects that people today are living out the legacy of decisions made in a different time."
Indigenous people are among the poorest and least healthy of Canadians. Rates of infant mortality, youth suicide and unemployment are significantly higher than those for other Canadians, and most live below the official poverty line.
The apology, read by Ms. Stewart, specifically mentions abuses that took place at the residential schools. The system began in 1849 but was most active earlier this century. The Government took thousands of youths from their families and forced them to attend schools where they could not speak their languages or practice their customs or beliefs.
"To those of you who suffered this tragedy at residential schools, we are deeply sorry," the statement said.
Several religious orders that ran the schools have already apologized for abuses, and a number of individuals who were victimized during the 1950's, in the waning years of the schools, have filed lawsuits.
Residential schools were also operated in the United States, and similar abuses took place. The closest the United States Government came to apologizing was a 1969 Senate investigation, initiated by Senator Robert F. Kennedy, that documented abuses.
In addressing the broader pattern of historic injustices and prejudices here, the Canadian Government seems to have managed to avoid inviting new claims for reparation by expressing regret rather than admitting guilt: "The Government of Canada formally expresses to all Aboriginal people in Canada our profound regret for past actions of the federal Government which have contributed to these difficult pages in the history of our relationship together."
The Government also tried to reverse an emotional source of tension involving Louis Riel, the Metis leader of a rebellion who was hanged for treason in 1885. The statement of reconciliation pledges the Government will "look for ways of affirming the contributions of Metis people in Canada and of reflecting Louis Riel's proper place in Canada's history," but it stops short of revoking the treason charge, as indigenous people have demanded.
Gerald Morin, president of the Metis National Council, also criticized the Government's apology because it did not resolve the question of the group's status, which prevents them from pursuing land claims and some support programs.
Ms. Stewart said today's declarations were the Government's formal response to the November 1996 report by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, established by the federal Government in 1991 after a violent confrontation between Indians and the police on the Oka reserve in Quebec.
While supporting the commission's conclusion that Canada's Indian policy for the last 150 years has been wrong, the Government's actions do not come close to meeting any of the 440 recommendations the commission made. Among those were establishing a separate aboriginal parliament, abolishing the current Department of Indian Affairs and increasing annual spending on Indian affairs by about $1.4 billion by the end of the century. Current federal spending exceeds $4 billion.

HEADLINE: DINER'S JOURNAL

BYLINE: By Ruth Reichl 

 BODY:
In New York City, 1997 was an extraordinary year for restaurants. It was a time when talented chefs and restaurateurs had the courage to reconsider the notion of what makes a restaurant great.
On the one hand, we got Jean Georges. In his determination to make food the star of his establishment, Jean-Georges Vongerichten created a cool atmosphere and a menu filled with fireworks. He wanted his restaurant on Central Park West to be the antithesis of a celebrity spot, a place where people gathered to eat great food rather than to be surrounded by famous people or flattered by a famous chef. He succeeded, brilliantly. 
 Meanwhile, just across town in the Palace Hotel, Sirio Maccioni was recreating Le Cirque 2000, making it bigger, more opulent and more daring than before. He built what may be the world's most spectacular kitchen for his chef, Sottha Khunn, and surrounded it with a giddy, gaudy room to cater to the rich and famous. This time, however, he went one step further; although this social circus is dedicated to glamour, it is now a place where anyone can feel comfortable.
Downtown another great chef was creating a different sort of experience. At Bouley Bakery, David Bouley designed a small and intimate restaurant where he could experiment with flavor. The result is an ambiance of casual elegance that is utterly rewarding.
But high-stakes players were not the only ones who pleased us by pleasing themselves. Greek food finally got its due when the Livanos family, which owns a string of restaurants, decided to pay tribute to their native country. Molyvos is a midtown Greek restaurant where the food of the islands is cooked with enormous respect. At the same time, Francois Payard, who had been the pastry chef at Daniel, was also returning to his roots. At Payard Patisserie on the Upper East Side, the chef, Philippe Bertineau, is turning out wonderfully focused bistro food. The flip side of the same coin? Balthazar, the big bold SoHo bistro that is so celebrity-packed it is easy to overlook how good the food is.
This was also a year when a handful of talented younger chefs opened new Manhattan restaurants. With Katy Sparks (Quilty), Seen Lippert (Across the Street), Gary Robins (Aja), John Schenk (Clementine), Laurent Manrique (Gertrude) and Rocco DiSpirito (Union Pacific) around, we can be certain that the future of food in our town is very bright. These are all expensive restaurants, but an extremely encouraging trend also emerged in inexpensive eating places. Soup restaurants opened in droves last year, offering affordable, healthy, home-style cooking as an alternative to fast food.
But here's the best news of all: 1998 could turn out to be even better. The economy is good, everyone's eating out, and this year promises a spate of interesting upscale ethnic establishments. There are great French, Indian and Korean restaurants on the horizon. Doesn't that whet your appetite?

HEADLINE: POP AND JAZZ GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.
 
* BO DIDDLEY, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. The first innovation Bo Diddley devised was to take what he'd learned playing classical violin -- "choking the strings," as the critic Robert Palmer once called it -- and apply it to playing guitar. Thus, some say, funk was born. And Mr. Diddley's innovations just kept propagating. He designed and built his own instruments, experimented with amplified distortion, mixed urban myths and African-inspired legends in his lyrics and made the maracas a major part of rock-and-roll. Most famously, he created an approach to rhythm that is one of rock-and-roll's foundation stones. And he's still the master of the form. Johnny Allen also performs. Tonight at 7:30 and 10:30; tickets are $20 (Ann Powers). 

REGINA CARTER, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Ms. Carter is a magnificently gifted violinist who loves her blues phrases. She's had momentary lapses of sense, venturing into instrumental pop music, which is a bit like having Michael Jackson digging post holes. She'll be backed by Kenny Barron on piano, Peter Washington on bass, Rodney Jones on guitar and Lewis Nash on drums, a jazz rhythm section that takes the back seat to no one. Let's find out what Ms. Carter, in the right context, can really do. Sets through Sunday night at 9 and 11 with a 12:30 show tonight and tomorrow. Admission is $17.50 with a $10 minimum (Peter Watrous).
ELIANE ELIAS, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. The pianist's latest record, "The Three Americas" (Blue Note), unites the Americas: North, Central and South; her quartet reflects that vision, with bass, drums and flute. Tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover of $25 at the table with a $10 minimum and a cover of $20 at the bar (Ben Ratliff).
JERRY GALANTE, Latin Quarter, 2551 Broadway, at 96th Street, (212) 864-7600. Colombian salsa has its own rhythm, and its own lightness, and Mr. Galante, from Colombia, is a good improvising singer. He's relocated to New York and uses a local band, and he knows how to make a dance hall swing with his orchestra. Tomorrow's show starts at 10:30 P.M.; there is a cover of $20 for men and $15 for women (Watrous).
* GREG GARING, the Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Plaintive, countryish songs about being lost and lovelorn grow even more disoriented in arrangements permeated by eerie electronic sounds; the hybrid may be trendy, but somehow it doesn't sound forced. Tonight at 9:30; admission is $7 (Jon Pareles).
BRENDA KAHN AND JOHN S. HALL, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. It makes sense that singer-songwriters from the Lower East Side would be more likely to focus on their decrepit apartments and the strange folks they end up taking home from the local bar than on other, more rustic versions of Americana. These two performers have been offering cockeyed observations of various urban myths for more than a decade. Mr. Hall made a splash with his band, King Missile. Ms. Kahn has never hit heavy rotation on MTV, but even if she did, she probably wouldn't lose her sarcastic edge. With Fisherman Stew. Tomorrow at 8:30 P.M.; tickets are $8 (Powers)
* B. B. KING, the Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. After all his years on the road, B. B. King can still wring pain and grit and desperate love from his familiar songs, as Lucille, his guitar, wails in sympathy. This is a rare club engagement. Tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11:30, but early shows are sold out. There is a $65 cover and a $5 minimum at tables or a $45 cover at the bar (Pareles).
* THE KLEZMATICS, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. The Klezmatics love the laughing, moaning melodies of traditional klezmer music. They also love jazz, rock and downtown improvisation, and they bring all of them to bear on their music, which can be raucous, hypnotic, reverent and dizzying, sometimes all in one quick-changing piece. They carry klezmer's itinerant, idea-gathering spirit all the way into 1990's New York City. Sunday at 8 and 10:30 P.M.; admission is $10 (Pareles).
JOE LOVANO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The saxophonist is almost surreal in his inventiveness: where does all this knowledge come from? His solos billow with ideas, and giving him another half an hour to finish won't stop the flood. He surrounds himself with all sorts of groups, and this week he's showing some of them off. Tonight he'll be playing with the large band that he used on a Sinatra tribute; it's a bit precious. Tomorrow and Sunday he'll be performing with the Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba; they've recently released an album, "Flying Colors." Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30, 11 and midnight; no third set on Sunday. There is a $17.50 cover and a $5 minimum (Watrous).
MASTERS OF THE NEY, Washington Square Church, 135 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 545-7536. The World Music Institute is presenting two ensembles led by players of the ney, a reed flute used across the Middle East. Tonight at 8, Hossein Omoumi, from Iran, and two percussionists are to play Persian classical music: thoughtful, spiraling improvisations on ancient modes and melodies. Tomorrow at 8 P.M., Omar Faruk Tekbilek will lead his ensemble, which includes oud, bass, keyboards, guitar and percussion. Mr. Tekbilek is from Turkey, where he worked as a studio musician and studied to be a Sufi priest; his music draws on folk, pop and jazz influences. Tickets to each concert are $15 (Pareles).
CHRISTIAN McBRIDE, NICHOLAS PAYTON AND MARK WHITFIELD, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. The trumpet-bass-guitar trio got together last spring to make a recording of Herbie Hancock tunes, "Fingerpainting" (Verve). That's right, no pianist. And with this pared-down instrumentation, they even tackle funk tunes like "Chameleon." Sets tonight are at 9 and 11; cover is $25 at tables and $10 at the bar (Ratliff).
* FRANKIE NEGRON, Latin Quarter, 2551 Broadway, at 96th Street, (212) 864-7600. Perhaps the hottest of the young salsa singers, Mr. Negron, from New Jersey, is being primed as the next Marc Anthony, the assumption being that Mr. Anthony is leaving salsa for economically richer pastures. Certainly Mr. Negron's hits, produced by Sergio George, have him chasing Mr. Anthony, which means nothing less than a good singer singing good material with great arrangements. The show tonight starts at 10:30; there is a cover of $15 for men and $10 for women (Watrous).
CHICO O'FARRILL, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. Having orchestrated modernist Afro-Cuban jazz fantasias for be-boppers in the 1940's, and 50's, Mr. O'Farrill has a more important place in jazz history than anyone probably yet recognizes. His 18-piece band, starting a regular Sunday night gig at Birdland, provides a good demonstration of how jazz harmony can mesh with guajira and guaganco rhythms. The music represents both a basic recipe for modern jazz as well as a highly developed side road of it. Sunday at 9 and 11 P.M. Cover, $15; minimum, $10 (Ratliff).
* PACHORA, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The musicologist-improvisers of the Knitting Factory scene have been venturing deeply into Eastern European music for some time now, and this excellent quartet -- the saxophonist and clarinetist Chris Speed, the guitarist Brad Shepik, the bassist Skuli Sverrison and the drummer Jim Black -- are the most flexible among them. Tonight through Sunday in the club's comfortable new basement lair; sets are at 8 and 9:30, and a $10 cover includes a $5 drink minimum (Ratliff).
JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO, Internet Cafe, 82 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 614-0747. Mr. Pilc, a French jazz pianist in his mid-30's who arrived in New York two years ago, seems to have dropped from the sky fully formed, with technique and ideas in place. He is a physical and densely harmonic player, a splashy stunner who also has a Rubik's Cube mind for chord substitutions. His own songs, as well as his versions of Monk and Coltrane, make you dizzy with their key changes and sudden, pulled up short rhythmic effects. Tonight and tomorrow at 10 and 11:30; admission is $5 (Ratliff).
POLVO AND TRANS AM, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 544-1666. In bands like Polvo and Trans Am, the instrumental excursions of progressive rock have made an inconspicuous resurgence by using the scruffier, more modest trappings of alternative rock. Polvo's songs barely contain the dissonant clangor of their unconventionally tuned guitars; Trans Am plays instrumental rock with clear-cut song forms and arrangements that trace long arcs from delicacy to grandeur to noise. Tomorrow at 9 P.M., with Spatula opening; tickets are $10 (Pareles).
SHIMMY DISC 10TH ANNIVERSARY EXTRAVAGANZA, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Throughout the 1990's, this Lower East Side-based label, run by the resolutely eccentric artist Kramer, has been home to some of underground pop's wackiest and most charming acts. Less active now than it once was, Shimmy Disc still garners loyalty from enough iconoclasts to make this a promising bill. Performers include Kramer himself, Ikue Mori, Semi-Beings, Blue Whales, Glen or Glenda, King Missile II and Drazy Hoops. Tonight at 7; tickets are $10 (Powers).
SIMENTERA DE CABO VERDE, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Newark has a large Portuguese population, and in its first year, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center is presenting performers from Portuguese-speaking countries. Among the former colonies is Cape Verde, a group of islands off the coast of Senegal, which has produced a kind of song called morna that's both lilting and wistful. Simentera de Cabo Verde blends morna with Brazilian and African pop and touches of Portuguese classical music. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $25 (Pareles).
* STEVE WILSON, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. At Chick Corea's recent show at the Blue Note, Mr. Wilson, a saxophonist, walked away with the awards. He's a musician's musician: young players flock to him. And he's been playing better than ever recently, mixing odd harmonies with a rhythmic sense and poise that's dancelike. He's playing with his great partner, the drummer Leon Parker, along with the pianist Kevin Hays and the bassist Ed Howard. Tonight through Sunday, there are sets at 8, 10 and midnight, with no third set on Sunday. There is a $20 cover and a two-drink minimum (Watrous).
STEVE WYNN, RICHARD LLOYD, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. A hero of the mid-1980's post-punk rock revival, Steve Wynn has made a career of taking the advice of his hero, Bob Dylan, not to look back. For a traditionalist, he is steadfastly experimental, always trying new settings and structures for his basic, rootsy guitar rock. Richard Lloyd is a groundbreaking guitarist with a strong sense of the old-fashioned song. Amanda Thorpe opens the show. Sunday at 8 P.M.; tickets are $7 (Powers).

HEADLINE: Aston Becomes a Lab For Ford's Technology

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
SOMETHING about Aston Martin seems to foster experimentation. Modified by Q, the gadget guru in Her Majesty's Secret Service, a model DB5 often saved Agent 007's hide with an ejector seat, wheel hubs that shredded villains' tires, machine guns hidden behind the lights and a screen that deflected bullets.
But Q could never have oictured an Aston Martin like the Project Vantage, a concept car shown by the tiny British car maker this week at the North American International Auto Show here. It can reach a top speed of 200 miles an hour but delivers a respectable 20 miles a gallon, making it an ideal getaway car for James Bond (who has defected to BMW in his two latest movies, perhaps because that auto maker has far more money to spend on advertising tie-ins). 
 In unveiling the Project Vantage, the Ford Motor Company, which bought Aston Martin in 1987, said it planned to use the small sports car company as a lab for new technologies that might eventually find their way into other Ford products.
"We take several approaches to test new technologies," Jacques A. Nasser, president of Ford Automotive Operations, said. "Our involvement in Formula One racing is a test bed for some new technologies, for instance. Concept vehicles are another. With Aston Martin, we can test technologies with low investment and low volumes."
In addition, buyers who purchase Aston Martins, which start at $126,000, are able and willing to pay for expensive new technologies. "Our customers want to make a statement about themselves," Bob Dover, chairman and chief executive of Aston Martin, said. "They enjoy driving their cars, so we have to integrate technology to be useful to them."
The technologies used in the Project Vantage's V12 engine hold the most promise for power plants in more mundane Ford products. The prototype six-liter, 48-valve engine was developed by Ford, Aston Martin and another British company, Cosworth Engineering, which builds engines for Formula One cars.
The Project Vantage, a two-seater with the engine up front and the driving wheels in the rear, can deliver blistering, race car performance. Engineers calculate that it will accelerate from 0 to 60 in a scant four seconds and reach more than 140 m.p.h. in a quarter-mile. But unlike most high-performance V12 engines, which are notorious gasoline hogs, fuel consumption is on a par with many of the sport utility vehicles popular with Americans. The Project Vantage's low emissions should meet or exceed the world's strictest standards, its developers say.
"Whether we're developing a V12 or an in-line four-cylinder engine, we should be able to take some of the lessons and technology we are developing with the Project Vantage's engine and feed it back through the Ford system," Mr. Nasser said.
Ford has no plans to put the prototype vehicle into production, he added, but company executives will gauge worldwide public reaction this year to determine whether a feasible market exists for the car.
 In addition to the V12, another feature of the Project Vantage that could find its way into other Ford products is its transmission. The six-speed can shift gears automatically, or it can be shifted manually, without a clutch, using finger tip paddles on the steering wheel. The system, similar to Porsche's Tiptronic, is borrowed from Formula One race cars.
Such clutchless automatic transmissions are gaining momentum in the marketplace and are of interest to car companies like Ford because of their fuel efficiency. Unlike Europeans, Americans favor effortless automatic transmissions, particularly when driving in stop-and-go traffic. But automatics use more fuel than manuals do.
"The question is how can we make manual transmissions more accommodating but provide efficiency improvements?" said Neil W. Ressler, Ford's vice president for advanced vehicle technology. "An automatic transmission you can shift seems an attractive alternative."
The Project Vantage's suspension components are also borrowed from race cars. Their small size and light weight could provide useful lessons for production vehicles, Mr. Ressler said.
The Project Vantage uses advanced lightweight materials, including aluminum and carbon fiber, throughout its structure and in its interior.
The Project Vantage's structure is similar to that of a Formula One car in terms of occupant protection and structural rigidity. The passenger compartment is like a safety cage, constructed from aluminum in a honeycomb shape, with carbon fiber reinforcements. Chassis sections and roof pillars are made of extruded aluminum. The roof is made of carbon fiber as well. The result is a saving of 50 percent in weight from traditional materials, like steel, but a 100 percent increase in the rigidity of the structure. In addition, the Project Vantage is designed to be as stable as a race car.
Inside, the Project Vantage is trimmed not with wood, like most luxury cars, but with brushed aluminum and carbon fiber. Still, the upholstery is luxurious Connolly leather with suede. Each of the two seats is equipped with four-point safety harnesses. Matching tailored luggage fits in the trunk and interior niches.
The styling is readily recognizable as an Aston Martin, with a newly aggressive, racy look. The Project Vantage was created by Ian Callum, the Scottish designer who also developed the look of the Aston Martin DB7, introduced last year.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Although the V12 Project Vantage concept vehicle is relatively economic on fuel, neither the Aston Martin's exterior nor interior brings to mind the simple life.
