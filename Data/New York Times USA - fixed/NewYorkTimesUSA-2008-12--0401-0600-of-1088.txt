HEADLINE: Obama Team Faces an Early Test of Its Ability to Weather a Storm

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, began exploring whether she might fill Barack Obama's seat in the United States Senate, she called Rahm Emanuel. They served in the House together and, more important, he had just become chief of staff to the newly elected president.
 But Mr. Emanuel was uncharacteristically circumspect. If Mr. Obama had a favorite, Mr. Emanuel was not saying. And to Ms. Schakowsky, he seemed wary about Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, who would be making the appointment. ''Rahm always has good intelligence,'' she recalled. ''In this case, he really didn't. It was not clear to him what the governor was going to do, or at least he didn't share it with me.'' 
 For the Obama team in the days after his election to the presidency, the question of who would succeed him in the Senate was a sensitive one. With a new administration to build and a financial crisis worsening by the day, Mr. Obama and his advisers had bigger issues on their plate. Moreover, they wanted to keep their distance from Mr. Blagojevich, who was already known to be under federal investigation into possible corruption. But many still assumed that Mr. Obama's voice would be critical if he chose to weigh in.
 Exactly what role he or his team played will be a focus of intense scrutiny in the weeks to come after the arrest of Mr. Blagojevich on accusations that he was plotting to trade or sell the Senate appointment. In that sense, the furor could be the first test of the Obama team's ability to manage a growing scandal in an era when intense media scrutiny and partisan attack machinery can escalate any flap into a serious political problem.
 Mr. Obama said Tuesday that he had never spoken with the governor about the seat, and prosecutors have not implicated Mr. Obama or his advisers. At the same time, Mr. Obama's team has declined for two days to answer questions about what discussions they had about the seat and whether intermediaries had any contacts with Mr. Blagojevich's advisers. 
 Republicans have raised questions about Mr. Obama's refusal to say more and about his past ties with the main characters. Even if Mr. Obama remains untouched by the investigation, it shines a light on the corrupt politics of the state he emerged from and takes attention away from the agenda of change he would rather emphasize. 
 ''This is a huge distraction at the worst possible moment,'' said Lanny J. Davis, a former White House special counsel who did damage control for President Bill Clinton. 
 And it can grow if not handled properly. ''It's like the whirlwind,'' said Chris Lehane, another veteran of the Clinton teams. ''You get pulled into the vortex more and more.'' 
 Mr. Obama stayed out of sight on Wednesday, calling for Mr. Blagojevich's resignation through an aide and only after other Democrats had done so. Aides were told by transition lawyers not to comment. But Mr. Obama plans to hold a news conference on Thursday on health care during which he presumably will be asked about the inquiry.
 By the account of several Democrats close to him, Mr. Obama did not try to insert himself into the selection of his successor, at least partly because of his own strained relationship with Mr. Blagojevich and partly because he had long since grown restless with the Senate. He discussed it with allies, like fellow Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, but not with some others involved. 
 Ms. Schakowsky, one of many interested in the Senate seat and probably not a front-runner, said she had never talked with Mr. Obama about the seat. Likewise, the president-elect never brought it up with another potential candidate, Tammy Duckworth, the director of veterans' affairs in Illinois, when the two participated in a Veterans Day ceremony, an aide to Ms. Duckworth said.
 Neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Durbin was invited by Mr. Blagojevich to offer advice, the Democrats said. ''We all have varying levels of cooperation with the governor. Mine was extremely limited,'' Mr. Durbin said in an interview. ''I believe President-elect Obama could say the same.'' He added, ''I knew there was a process in place in the governor's office, but I had no idea what it involved.''
 Mr. Emanuel was among the few people in Mr. Obama's circle who occasionally spoke to Mr. Blagojevich. He declined to answer questions on Wednesday, waving off a reporter who approached him as he walked across Capitol Hill.
 A Democrat familiar with Illinois politics and the Obama transition, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there probably were calls between the Blagojevich and Obama camps about the Senate seat. It was not clear if any calls were recorded by federal agents, who had tapped the governor's phones.
 Mr. Blagojevich was largely keeping his own counsel on the selection process, several Democrats said. One aide close to Mr. Obama and Mr. Durbin said it seemed Mr. Blagojevich was ''on an iceberg,'' far removed from most party leaders. The governor did not return telephone calls from Mr. Durbin for nearly two weeks, Democrats said. Ms. Schakowsky said he took days to answer her messages, too. When he did call back, he spoke with her for less than 10 minutes as she made her case for the seat.
 ''I see in retrospect,'' Ms. Schakowsky said, ''I probably wasn't in contention -- he didn't ask me for anything.''

HEADLINE: The Good News From Illinois

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
These are troubled times when people yearn for diversion. We like stories about a simple crisis in which somebody does something incredibly stupid that will not cost 100,000 people their jobs. Yet Hollywood starlets and pop singers have been unhelpfully quiet. Then, suddenly, there was Rod Blagojevich seeking bids for Barack Obama's Senate seat with all the subtlety of a tobacco auctioneer.
 That's the ticket! Now, if only we could indict the economy ... 
 Feel free to indulge in a little schadenfreude at the expense of the governor of Illinois. Sure, the last couple of months have been tough. But at least you didn't have to spend your birthday listening to the nation debate whether you were the most corrupt elected official in living memory or simply out of your mind.
 Some people might wonder why Blagojevich chose to say potentially incriminating things like ''I want to make money'' over the telephone at a time when he knew he was the subject of multiple federal investigations. Perhaps his legal problems sent him off into his own little world. There he was, sitting around the house in his blue jogging suit, dipping into delusions of grandeur in which the empty Senate seat becomes a magic key to a Cabinet post, a big-money job for the missus, the presidency in 2016. 
 Lord knows we've all been tempted to retreat into fantasyland when things get rough. Really, the only thing saving us from succumbing was the lack of a Senate seat to sell.
 Those of us who do not live in Illinois had generally not given much thought to Rod Blagojevich until this week. We had never wondered how a person with a 13 percent approval rating ever managed to get elected in the first place, though now I am personally leaning toward the theory that it was the hair. Blagojevich tossed his thick brown mane and the voters told each other: ''Yes, he sounds a little dumb. But truly, this is the hair of a reformer.'' 
 Illinois is not the only place going through empty-Senate-seat turmoil. In New York, the departure of Hillary Clinton for the Cabinet has set off an unseemly scramble, the like of which you usually see only when someone drops a pound of hamburger in the middle of a pit bull convention. 
 Still, as far as we know, nobody has actually tried to trade anything other than political advantage, the hope of future campaign contributions and the gratitude of one or more special interest groups. You know, the normal stuff. On behalf of my state, I would like to thank the governor of Illinois for making us feel as if this is a good record.
 The Senate seat sellathon is actually not the most damaging thing Blagojevich is accused of trying to do. There are, after all, 100 senators, and we know from several centuries of experience that the nation can survive quite nicely even if a sizable minority are brain-dead bank robbers. 
 Worse, he's upped the already hearty level of cynicism in Illinois voters. He ran for governor as an antidote to the culture that had sent an average of one Illinois chief executive to the clink every 10 years. (''Our state has been adrift. Corruption has replaced leadership,'' Rod and his hair said in early campaign commercials.) Now look at him. It's the sort of experience that sets the public wondering if there's a way to get reform while avoiding reformers. 
 In New York, of course, we elected a reform governor two years ago, and he was driven from office by some unpleasantness involving the Emperor's Club V.I.P. escort service. Now, post-Rod, all that seems kind of petty -- especially since, as far as we know, Eliot Spitzer even used his own money.
 That's something else we have to hold against Blagojevich. He's definitely driven the bar of acceptable political behavior below sea level.
 Look at Delaware, where the election left yet another Senate seat vacant and Gov. Ruth Ann Minner quickly announced that she'd be appointing Joe Biden's longtime aide, Edward Kaufman, to the job. Given the fact that Biden wants his seat to eventually go to his son, Beau, who is currently serving in Iraq with the Army National Guard, some observers found it a tad convenient that Minner happened to choose a person no one has ever heard of who is intensely loyal to the Biden family and has already promised not to run in the next election.
 But now Delaware is looking like the gold standard. It was only political expediency! The State Legislature isn't going to have to set up an emergency election so the governor won't have time to barter the seat away. And everybody in Washington knows the aides do all the real work anyway so nobody will even notice Biden is gone. Good work, Governor Minner!
 One thing is clear. We cannot have any more vacant Senate seats hanging around, creating temptation. Next time we have a presidential election, let's try to limit the candidates to governors, retired generals and failed movie stars. Much safer.

HEADLINE: Mary Beth Maxwell

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
As he prepares to take office, President-elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of his administration. Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration. 
 Name: Mary Bath Maxwell
 Being considered for: Labor secretary
 Would bring to the job: A record as an outspoken advocate for labor unions and low-wage workers, and the enthusiastic backing of many union leaders. As founding executive director of a pro-union group, American Rights at Work, she has helped lined up support for the Employee Free Choice Act, a bill that would make it easier for workers to unionize. A lesbian, she has strong support from gay and lesbian groups.
 Is linked to Mr. Obama by:David E. Bonior, the former House Democratic whip and a member of the president-elect's economic transition team. Mr. Bonior, said to have been Mr. Obama's first choice for labor secretary, has been vigorously pushing Ms. Maxwell's name for the post since saying he was not interested. 
 In her own words:''The American people are tired of old-school conflict and fear mongering. They want us to sit down at the table and talk to each other to find real solutions so we can have strong, thriving businesses and invest in working families -- it begins with the Employee Free Choice Act.'' (Speech at American Rights at Work awards dinner, June 24, 2008)
 Used to work as: National field director for Jobs With Justice, an advocacy group for low-wage and other workers, from 1996 to 2003: helped quadruple its number of chapters nationwide. Deputy field director of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (now known as Naral Pro-Choice America) from 1992 to 1996, directing electoral, legislative and fund-raising programs for local affiliates. Field director for the United States Student Association from 1989 to 1992, helping mobilize thousands of students to push Congress for more generous Pell Grants for low-income students. 
 Carries as baggage: She is likely to face intense business opposition because she is a vigorous advocate for unions who has aggressively supported the Employee Free Choice Act, legislation that business stoutly opposes. Some union leaders worry that she does not have the stature to hold her own in a fight with Mr. Obama's centrist economic team. 
 Biography: Born May 22, 1965, in Omaha. ... graduated from Marquette University with three majors: English, philosophy and political science. ... serves on the board of directors of the Partnership for Working Families. ... an active member of Sacred Heart Catholic Parish in Washington. ... has a 7-year-old son, Coleman Charles. ... She says: ''I'm a person who bridges lots of things. I'm gay, and I want my little boy to go to church.''

HEADLINE: As Money Tightens, Scaling Back On Jobs and Fun

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
A short cab ride from the lavish suites of the Bellagio hotel, where major league baseball executives and agents discussed multimillion-dollar contracts for players here this week, a much more nervous group of baseball officials and job seekers gathered.
 At the minor league job fair and trade show, the topic on many minds was the floundering economy, which was expected to have a far more pronounced effect on baseball's lower levels than on the major leagues. Many minor league teams are searching for creative ways to save money but keep fans heading out to ballparks, and job seekers are finding few openings. Some of the cost-saving measures will affect fans, and others will reach the field. 
 In the St. Louis Cardinals' minor league system, many players will wear last year's uniforms. Buddy Bates, the organization's minor league equipment manager, said it was difficult to find items to cut on the field because the teams still needed catcher's equipment, helmets and baseballs. But, he said, reusing uniforms was something his organization could get away with. 
 ''We'll just fill in the things we need,'' Bates said.
 Many other organizations have come to the same conclusion, said Mike Gentz, the team uniforms promotion manager for Wilson Sporting Goods. 
 ''Most teams always replace them, but this year it is not nearly as much,'' he said. ''From the minor league side, I've talked to 15 to 20 team representatives, and most were going to try to just fill in a few things they need and reuse their old uniforms.''
 Some teams needing new ones, Gentz said, have decided against the traditional jerseys with the logo sewn on the front. Instead, they have chosen a less expensive option in which the team logo is pressed onto the jerseys. ''You can't notice it unless you are up close,'' he said. ''It saves anywhere from a third to half the cost.''
 Teams are looking beyond uniforms for savings. The Round Rock Express, the Houston Astros' Class AAA affiliate, has often bought new in-game entertainment features for fans from one season to the next. Next season, however, the team plans to run the same video entertainment on the outfield screen between innings.
 ''It will be the same cap shuffle video instead of changing the whole thing, like we've done in years past,'' said Clint Musslewhite, the team's director for ballpark entertainment. ''We are not going to have them redo it. We're going to strategically change our entertainment; the number of inflatable things we'll rent will decrease.''
 Because many teams at lower levels of baseball played their last games in late summer, they had not yet fully experienced the brunt of the economic downturn. Since Sept. 1, the Dow Jones industrial average has dropped nearly 25 percent, and the broader economic outlook for next year has worsened.
 At the job fair, a group of 20-year-olds sat around a round table lamenting their chances of landing jobs with full benefits. They and others had paid hundreds of dollars in travel and hotel expenses to get here, just so they could pay another $225 to register for the fair, which helps them put their resumes in front of minor and major league officials.
 ''I was in Nashville last year for this same fair, and there were a lot more jobs and a lot less people looking,'' said Adam Gleich, 25, of York, Pa., who hoped to land a job in ticket sales.
 On the other side of the table, Mike Pilch, 29, of Warren, Ohio, said he wished he had tried to break into broadcasting years ago, when teams had more money and fewer people were interested in his line of work.
 ''One significant difference is that the play-by-play jobs now are seasonal instead of being full-time jobs with benefits,'' Pilch said. ''Although you may get a gig, you now need a job for the other five months of the year.''
 A weak economy is harder on minor league teams, which have budgets from $3 million to $10 million and often rely on companies like car dealerships to buy advertising and sponsorships. Shawn O. Reilly of the Alexandria Beetles, a team in Minnesota that plays in the Northwoods League, which is for college players with N.C.A.A. eligibility remaining, said working on sponsorship deals accounted for three-fourths of the staff's time.
 ''That is why I am here,'' Reilly said. ''We have to be more creative with our sponsorships. We are finding that sponsors no longer can afford to sponsor one thing, and we are now having to find multisponsors for one thing.''
 Reilly plans to buy a massive inflatable jersey for his team for about $6,000, but he wants the manufacturer to install Velcro strips on the outside so he can swap in different sponsor logos.
 Another executive said he was skeptical about what sponsors were saying.
 ''I feel like it's an excuse to give for not wanting to do certain advertising,'' said Vern Stenman, the general manager of the Madison Mallards, another team in the Northwoods League. ''It's easy to point to if they don't want to do something.''
 He added: ''As gas prices were high over the summer, people stayed around home and our attendance was up. If we are being affordable and keeping our prices down, a turndown in the economy should be good for us because we provide a less expensive option for family entertainment.''
 But officials with the Buffalo Bisons, the Mets' new Class AAA affiliate, are examining every cost. ''One of our concession stands next season will be special deals like McDonald's,'' said Bob Free, the team's food service director. He was referring to the Dollar Menu concept. ''We hope it will keep people coming out. We're preparing for people with less discretionary spending.''
 In some cases, though, fans will simply get less for their money.
 ''We are also reworking all of our food and beverage sales,'' Free said. ''Like instead of six ounces of fries, we'll sell five ounces for the same price.''

HEADLINE: California Adopts a Plan On Emissions

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
California regulators on Thursday adopted the country's first comprehensive plan for curbing emissions of heat-trapping gases. The plan establishes the broad outlines of a system of trading pollution permits and allocates among various industry sectors -- transportation, smokestack industries, housing and others -- the responsibility for cutting emissions to 1990 levels in the next 12 years. 
 The plan also commits the state to a goal that many industries in California have resisted: auctioning all the pollution permits created under the new plan, rather than giving some away to the industries that produce emissions. But the California Air Resources Board, the agency that voted unanimously to adopt the plan, stopped short of setting a timetable for reaching that goal.
 The plan affects a broad swath of the state's economic life, including how people get to work and how they build and heat their homes. 
 Mary Nichols, the chairwoman of the Air Resources Board, said in a statement that the plan would spur the development of new technologies.
 The California plan is in many respects a work in progress -- akin to a house that has a roof and walls, but with an interior not yet finished. And the plan approved on Thursday still leaves open the most contentious issues, particularly how the costs and the revenue associated with the new plan will be allocated.
 Under the plan's estimates, the state's total emission of heat-trapping gases would be the equivalent of 596 million tons annually in 2020 if business continued as usual. The plan is intended to reduce that total by more than 170 million tons. It would do so by capping 85 percent of those total emissions, then requiring a significant reduction in those emissions.
 The three largest components of the cuts would be these:
 The state's new restrictions on automobile emissions of heat-trapping gases that have not received required federal approval (31.7 million tons);
 Increases in energy efficiency (26.3 million tons);
 Getting one-third of the state's electricity from renewable sources (21.3 million tons).
 The centerpiece of the plan is a system whereby the state allocates credits for all the emissions under the new cap and then institutes a system whereby these credits can be traded among all the members of the seven-state Western Climate Initiative.
 David Nahai, the chief executive of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which is heavily dependent on coal-fired power, said he appreciated the board's deliberate approach. Mr. Nahai said he did not oppose a market mechanism, ''but we all have to engage very fully to make sure it's equitable and doesn't end up with a double whammy to rate payers.'' 
 He added, ''And we have to make sure it really ends up accomplishing the goals.''

HEADLINE: South Korea Cuts Interest Rate to 3%, a Record

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
South Korea's central bank on Thursday announced the deepest cut in interest in its history in an attempt to cushion its economy from the global downturn.
 The announcement followed China's disclosure that its economic indicators for November showed the country's economy slowing much more rapidly than expected, increasing expectations that Beijing will accelerate efforts to bolster growth. 
 The Bank of Korea's cut on Thursday was its fourth in two months, and took its key interest rate down a full percentage point to 3 percent, a much bigger cut than economists had predicted. The bank's governor, Lee Seong-tae, said South Korea was ''on the verge of an emergency situation that may need more drastic policy,'' Reuters reported. 
 Central banks around the world have delivered a cascade of cuts as the speed of the economic slowdown -- and outright recession in the United States, Canada, Japan and much of Europe -- becomes apparent. 
 In Taiwan, the central bank cut its main rate by 0.75 points, to 2 percent, on Thursday, the fifth such move in two months. The rate cut, which was announced after the close of the market, was the biggest in 26 years. 
 In China, data for November showed a sharp fall in consumer price inflation -- to 2.4 percent, from 4 percent the previous month -- as demand fell in line with slowing growth. On Wednesday, trade data showed import growth dropping sharply and exports shrinking for the first time in years as domestic and overseas demand shrank. 
 The Chinese data added to the sense of worry about the extent to which Asia's economies are being affected by the economic downturn that was set off last year by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. It also dashed hopes that China's economy could act as a buffer by taking up the slack from the slumping United States, Europe and Japan. 
 China's double-digit growth is expected to slow to around 8 percent next year, and growth across the region is also forecast to decline as demand in Europe and the United States and within the region shrinks. 
 The Asian Development Bank on Thursday said it expected growth in Asia's developing nations to slow to 5.8 percent next year, from 9 percent in 2007 and a projected 6.9 percent this year. The estimates echoed those issued by the World Bank earlier this week. 
 Jong-Wha Lee, head of the Asian Development Bank's s office of regional economic integration, said that ''2009 is likely to be a very difficult year for developing Asia.'' 
 The bank called on governments to step up efforts to bolster their economies. ''While the region's economies and financial systems are fundamentally sound and appear better cushioned to withstand the immediate effects of the crisis than in other parts of the world,'' the bank said it was concerned ''that the global credit crunch is now spilling over into domestic banking systems, squeezing funding resources for corporate investment.''

A Subtle Thaw
 In Credit Freeze
 Verizon Wireless has found a crack in the iced-over credit markets. The mobile phone service has tapped banks for $17 billion in loans to complete its purchase of a competitor, Alltel. It's not quite the breakthrough it appears. But it shows there are substantial cracks in the lending freeze -- at least for borrowers with good credit.
 If any company was going to succeed in borrowing such a large sum, it was Verizon Wireless. Its cellphone operations generate an avalanche of cash, and it isn't heavily indebted. The combination with Alltel should result in substantial savings. And its parent, Verizon Communications, has hinted in the past that it would like to buy out its British partner, Vodafone. 
 Even so, the new Verizon Wireless loans are not quite the throwback to the credit boom that the headline number suggests. Alltel was the target of a leveraged buyout in November 2007. Verizon Wireless bought some of Alltel's debt at a discount, but the banks that financed the initial buyout, Citigroup, Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland, still held a chunk. 
 The new $17 billion deal, led by the Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, refinances the remaining Alltel debt. So it does not quite mean the banking system has created new lending capacity. It's more a shuffle among lenders.
 Moreover, the loans are not cheap. The expected interest rate is the London interbank offered rate plus a 3 percentage point margin. That margin steps up as the loan ages. By the standards of a year or two ago, the rate is steep for a company rated single-A by Standard & Poor's.
 The important thing, though, is that the deal -- the largest syndicated loan this year -- was done at all. Numerous relatively healthy companies have been sniffing around weakened competitors. As long as the syndicated loan market remained closed, deals were hard to do, especially in capital intensive sectors like utilities. Signs of a credit thaw could lead to a stronger flow of merger and acquisition activity.
 A Test for China 
 For such a big country, China moves surprisingly fast. So do the numbers that preoccupy its economists. 
 Data this week showed that annual inflation swung from a too-high 10 percent in August to a lower-than-expected 2 percent in November. Exports fell sharply, as did imports. And the true figures could be even worse than the official ones. 
 Trying times lie ahead for China's policy makers. In a sense, declines in exports should be healthy. China's exporters have gratified foreign consumers with too much stuff, too cheaply, for too long. As the United States and the European Union, which buy 40 percent of that output, reduce their spending, prices are slashed on Chinese products intended for export. In time, manufacturers should turn toward higher-value products for domestic consumers. That's fine for the long term. 
 But China has a short-term problem. 
 Domestic demand is still too weak to replace exports. And it's widely believed that if annual economic growth stays below a certain level -- often quoted as 8 percent -- social unrest will follow. That connection has not been tested, despite a few minor incidents. But unemployment is already a threat. A Communist Party think tank has suggested the real unemployment rate could be 12 percent, three times the official figure. 
 Widespread bankruptcies in industries like toys, shoes and electronics aggravate the problem by sending disgruntled workers back to the countryside. 
 There are levers the state can pull. One is to hold down China's currency, the renminbi, against the dollar, making exports more competitive. But that effect is likely to be marginal. 
 Another is to cut interest rates, already hacked four times since September, to stimulate demand. But Chinese borrowers don't seem terribly responsive to rates so far. 
 That leaves fiscal stimulus. The government has already announced a four trillion renminbi ($585 billion) package, but it's too early to see how -- or if -- it will work. If it doesn't, the state will have to square a vicious circle. At worst, it should be thinking how to respond if the ''slow growth equals unrest'' theory proves valid.

HEADLINE: Reading the Recession For Signs of the Future

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
Frank Braconi seems comfortable working in a monotone office without basic accessories like lamps, a coat rack or photographs of loved ones. But what he sorely lacks these days is a crystal ball.
 Mr. Braconi, the chief economist for the comptroller of New York City, has been trying to explain why the city's fortunes have reversed so suddenly and, more important, how much worse conditions will be next year. The implosion of Wall Street that has claimed tens of thousands of the city's highest-paying jobs this year caught most economists -- Mr. Braconi included -- by surprise.
 Now he and his peers are hurriedly revising their forecasts of employment and tax revenue and reconsidering their belief that the financial services industry will keep powering the local economy through boom and bust. Already, the prognosis has gone from grim to grimmer: the comptroller's office now expects the city to lose 165,000 jobs by August 2010, about double what it projected at midyear.
 On Thursday morning, the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., updated his office's outlook, saying the economy should hit bottom in the spring, then start recovering slowly. Wages paid to workers in the city will decline by more than 5 percent in 2009, according to an excerpt from the comptroller's coming report on the city budget. 
 And the ratcheting may not be over yet. A more recent projection from the state comptroller's office was even bleaker, estimating that 225,000 jobs would be lost in the state -- 175,000 of them in the city -- by the end of next year.
 ''We've underestimated how bad this crisis would get,'' Mr. Braconi said, sitting behind a wooden desk in his brown-on-brown workspace a block from City Hall. ''That's what we're trying to explain.'' 
 A few minutes before, his supervisor, Marcia J. Van Wagner, the deputy comptroller for budget, had appeared in his doorway to discuss the report on the shrinking city budget that they must deliver by Dec. 15. During the brief interchange, Ms. Van Wagner pressed him to spell out how the global slowdown is affecting the city and ribbed him about his more optimistic nature.
 ''I'm always on the ledge,'' Ms. Van Wagner said, describing her outlook. ''Frank is always trying to pull me in, and I'm always trying to get him to come out on the ledge with me.''
 The precipice is getting crowded as the financial crisis drags on, leaving even the optimistically inclined with no silver lining to cling to. At a gathering last month at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, economic analysts tested several projections on computer models of the regional economy. The models spat back estimates of job losses in the metropolitan area during this recession that ranged from about 325,000 to nearly one million. (The latter result would be far worse than in any other recession in the last 30 years.) 
 With such a wide spread of possible outcomes, it is no wonder that John Kenneth Galbraith, the famed economist, once said that ''the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.''
 Still, a core group of economists like Mr. Braconi are paid to try their hands at this mixture of art and dismal science. Their forecasts are predicated on mounds of data and established patterns. 
 But some long-held notions have proved faulty in the last couple of years, like the idea that there would never be a nationwide housing slump or that investment banks would prosper whether times were good or bad.
 Now that some of the biggest firms on Wall Street have failed or received federal bailouts and the prices of apartments in Manhattan and houses in Queens are tumbling, the old rules do not necessarily apply. 
 ''These historical relationships, which is fundamentally what the models are based on, break down when there are structural changes in the economy,'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the Independent Budget Office, which also forecasts how the city's economy will perform. ''It's not just that New York City is entering into recession, but also that the driving industry in our region seems to be in the midst of longer-term structural changes that we're going to have to take into account as well.''
 Like the Independent Budget Office, the office of the city comptroller serves as a check on the budgets drawn up by the mayor's staff. After every revision to the city's plan for collecting taxes and spending money, the comptroller responds, telling the City Council where his projections differ from the mayor's.
 Though Mr. Braconi says politics do not influence their economic calculations, his staff must, of course, weigh the economic impact of political decisions and government policies. For example, in the report due out this month, the comptroller will question the mayor's assumption that the city would not send out $400 rebate checks that had been promised to homeowners -- a position that Mr. Thompson, who plans to run for mayor next year, has challenged. 
 Believing that the City Council is likely to prevail in insisting that the checks go out, the comptroller will note a $256 million ''risk'' to the mayor's plan, a gap that may require a corresponding cut in spending to balance the budget, Ms. Van Wagner said.
 During the heady years that followed the last recession, the comptroller's reports tended to underestimate the surge in city revenue, from corporate and personal income taxes as well as taxes on real estate transactions. Now, with the boom over, Mr. Braconi and a team of four analysts are taking extra care to hone their estimates. ''The consequences are much greater now,'' he said. ''The purposes to which our forecasts are being put have real consequences to real people.''
 Mr. Braconi, who has a doctorate in economics from the City University of New York, is sensitive to the potential impact of budget cuts, having spent more than a decade as an advocate for affordable housing. He served as the executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council before Ms. Van Wagner hired him in 2006. A Queens native with an accent to prove it, he has spent his whole life in the metropolitan area and vouches for the city's ability to recover from recessions.
 Some other forecasters, like those at the Independent Budget Office, have sophisticated computer models that at a cost of several thousand dollars a month, produce estimates of employment, income and tax revenue. Mr. Braconi and his team have not purchased such a model, so they instead use arcane formulas to test hypotheses about how the recession will play out.
 They begin with a forecast for the national and global economies that is teased out of available data, including a consensus of widely followed economists. Feeding that number into a formula known as an input-output model produces an estimate of how much the city's economy will grow or shrink. And -- here is where art sometimes supplants science -- if that estimate seems to defy reality, Mr. Braconi will tweak it using other data, or his instincts.
 None of that, of course, can ensure accuracy. In July, the comptroller's report estimated that the gross city product would increase by 1.2 percent this year and that about 85,000 jobs would be lost in the subsequent downturn. But that was before the Lehman Brothers investment bank failed and the federal government rescued several big banks and insurance companies. Since then, Mr. Braconi said, there has been no denying that New York is headed into a ''sharp recession.''
 Now, the comptroller's office is estimating that the city's economy did not grow this year and will shrink in 2009 and 2010. It estimates that job losses will reach 165,000 before the economy bottoms out. A higher share of the layoffs will come from outside the financial services industry -- almost three-fourths compared with the estimate of 60 percent in July -- because the outlook for the overall economy has worsened, Mr. Braconi said.
 He said he had been paying more attention to the pronouncements of Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University, who has gained fame for his early predictions of financial doom. But he said he had resisted the temptation to adopt such a dire view.
 ''There's a certain seductiveness to the notion that things fall apart, whether it be in economics or other walks of life,'' Mr. Braconi said. ''At a time like this when the chorus of doom is particularly loud, it's important to brace yourself. There would be disastrous consequences for city agencies to fully embrace the worst scenarios.'' 
 Overstating a slowdown could lead to cuts in government programs that turn out not to have been necessary, he said. On the other hand, failing to spot a sharp drop in tax revenue can lead to drastic midyear cutbacks, like those Gov. David A. Paterson has called for in recent months.
 The recovery from this recession may be slow, but it will happen, Mr. Braconi said. He placed himself in the same camp as Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who is a champion of cities as hubs of creativity and dynamism.
 ''I can't necessarily predict the next big thing for New York or Boston other than to say that there will be a next big thing,'' Mr. Braconi said. ''I do have that kind of faith in New York.''

HEADLINE: Such a Fuzzy Description For Such a Big Auto Job

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Over the last three decades the American automotive industry has turned to many would-be saviors: bold chief executives, quality-control gurus, advocates of just-in-time manufacturing techniques from Japan, proponents of new factories where union leaders and corporate managers would operate arm in arm.
 Some of their approaches worked for a while, some never took off. But over the last two days, in a frenzy of bill-writing and arm-twisting with $14 billion of taxpayer money at stake, a crucial issue facing Congress was whether a car czar with uncertain authority will be able to accomplish in a little over three months what no one has accomplished in a little over three decades. 
 Whether that strategy had a chance depended partly on the powers that this as-yet-unnamed person could wield to force the kinds of changes that Detroit, its unions, its suppliers and its creditors have resisted since the Chevrolet Caprice convertible rolled onto car lots in the mid-1970s.
 Negotiations over the rescue appeared to have collapsed late Thursday, but if the proposal were to resurface, it would not be the first revival of a presumably dead issue in Washington. A car czar might also be possible next month when Barack Obama is sworn in. 
 Officially, no one is using the shopworn word ''czar.'' In the words of the legislation, the autocrat of the assembly line is formally termed the ''president's designee,'' a phrase that skips over the fact that in this delicate dance, there are two presidents involved, one with 39 days of authority remaining and little influence, and one with lots of influence and no legal authority. 
 ''Whoever gets this job isn't going to have the luxury of time to reinvent the car industry,'' Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California and the former head of the national economic council under President Clinton. ''He or she is going to have to take a number of approaches to this problem that are already known, that have been discussed endlessly, and force it through. It's going to take someone with huge stature.''
 It is also going to take someone with imagination. 
 The bill passed by the House late Wednesday is so vague that it is not clear whether he or she is supposed to be an accountant, a convener of meetings in hotels around Detroit or Washington, or someone with Henry Ford's ability to reinvent the concept of car manufacturing. It sets out a host of goals -- ''a viable and competitive domestic auto industry that minimizes adverse effects on the environment,'' the development of new, energy-efficient ''advanced technology vehicles,'' preserving health plans and pensions and jobs -- but it does not say how those are supposed to figure in a restructuring of the industry that must be under way by March 31.
 But it may depend even more on the personality and the political skills of the person appointed to the job. The name of the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker has been bandied about by all sides. But there is no indication that Mr. Volcker, already heading Mr. Obama's economic advisory team, is interested in pursuing what some consider a kamikaze mission.
 Republicans in the Senate, in rebellion over the bill, are trying something vastly more specific: they would force General Motors and Chrysler (Ford has opted out of federal assistance for now) to lower their debt by two-thirds over the next few months, lower worker compensation to the levels earned by workers in Japanese factories in the United States and force creditors to accept repayment at 30 cents on the dollar.
 But even that is something of a short-term solution: it addresses the immediate crisis but not the long-term one. The main problem, almost everyone agrees, is that Detroit is building the wrong kinds of cars, and doing so inefficiently. There are not many other bottom-line explanations for why G.M.'s market share in the United States has fallen from to around 20 percent today from more than 50 percent four decades ago.
 ''The problem here is that the politicians want to talk about short-term fixes, but those fixes just prolong the inevitable,'' said Bill George, a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School and former chairman of Medtronic. ''If G.M. was a normal corporation, they would hire someone to sell off the unhealthy parts of the company, and just keep the rest. Because the bottom line here is that G.M. needs new technology and it needs to get out of Detroit,'' where the immense costs of its contractual obligations to workers and retirees haunt it. Mr. George has proposed cutting G.M. into two firms -- one made of Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet, and the other holding all the remaining brands, all the less profitable factories and dealers. They would be liquidated under his plan, much the way a bankruptcy court might liquidate an unprofitable enterprise. The first firm would be committed to average fuel efficiency of 40 miles per gallon by 2015 and 50 miles per gallon by 2020, and would retain only the most profitable factories -- many abroad.
 But in the waning days of his tenure, President Bush does not want to be anywhere near that specific; his legacy is complicated enough, his aides say, without going down in history as the man who dismantled the American car industry in the last month of his presidency.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Grew in October as Exports Slowed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit widened in October for the first time in three months as exports fell 2.2 percent, with big declines in sales of products like automobiles and consumer goods, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.
 The growth in the trade gap comes at a time that American manufacturers had come to rely on exports to make up for declines in spending by domestic consumers. 
 But American-made goods are less attractive now that the dollar has strengthened against major world currencies. And the economic downturn is taking a toll on foreigners' willingness to pay big shipping costs for American goods.
 The impact on American businesses and workers could be significant. 
 ''There is clear evidence that the falloff in global demand is having a direct impact on top-line revenue growth at multinational corporations,'' said Steven Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Securities USA. ''That is going to help exacerbate the layoff problem. You're already starting to see it show through in the labor numbers we're getting.''
 With global demand for American-made goods falling, domestic businesses could be forced to cut back on production and lower their revenue projections for the new year -- moves that would probably mean more layoffs.
 ''If you looked at the U.S. economy in recent quarters, exports and government spending were about the only things in positive territory,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief domestic economist at MFR, a research firm. ''In general, that demand is falling apart. That's always been the driving force for trade.'' 
 He described the declines in exports as broad-based, affecting nearly every type of industry, ''pretty much soup to nuts.'' 
 Domestic demand has slackened as well; the only increases in imports in October came in crude oil -- the price of which fell sharply over the course of the month -- and consumer goods. Sales of foreign-made automobiles and machinery fell sharply. 
 The disappointing trade figures may lead to a more significant contraction in economic growth for the final three months of 2008. ''Trade is now starting to subtract from G.D.P., and subtract in a big way,'' Mr. Ricchiuto said.
 The trade deficit, the difference between what Americans import and export, rose 1.1 percent in October, more than economists had expected, to $57.2 billion, from $56.6 billion in September. It was the first report since the stock market cratered in October.
 Imports fell 1.3 percent, to $208.9 billion, for the month. Purchases of foods, beverages and consumer goods rose slightly. 
 October exports totaled $151.7 billion, a 2.2 percent drop from September. Sales of American-made cars and car parts fell $236 million; consumer goods exports dropped $156 million; and industrial supply sales fell $1.4 billion. The trade deficit with China widened to $28 billion, from $27.9 billion in September. Growth in China has slowed and the government has stepped up its efforts to bolster the economy. Chinese exports dipped 2.2 percent from November 2007 to November 2008, the biggest annual decline since the end of the last century and a far sharper downturn than analysts were expecting. 
 In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said that import prices fell 6.7 percent in November, led by the significant decline in oil and energy prices. It was the biggest decline in one month since monthly records began in 1988.
 On the labor front, new applications for unemployment benefits rose 58,000 last week to 573,000, a 26-year high, the Labor Department said.

HEADLINE: Auto Suppliers Share Anxiety Over Bailout for Big Three

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
With Congress failing to agree on a bailout for Detroit, the odds that General Motors and Chrysler will be insolvent by year's end are growing rapidly.
 The companies have been warning that they would run out of money for some time, but crushing bills from their suppliers are coming due. It appeared unlikely that they could hold on until President-elect Barack Obama takes office next month, when he and a new Congress might be able to provide a lifeline, as a Congressional rescue this year looked increasingly unlikely. 
 As a result, the hypotheticals about the domino effect of the companies' troubles through the vast network of auto supplier firms -- which employ more than twice as many workers as the carmakers -- are becoming real.
 General Motors and Chrysler, for example, owe their suppliers a total of roughly $10 billion for parts that have been delivered. G.M. has held off paying them for weeks, and Chrysler is paying in small increments. But the cash shortages at G.M. and Chrysler are getting more severe, according to their top executives and other officials. 
 A bailout seemed unlikely Thursday afternoon, as Republican Congressional leaders indicated they would not agree to the plan offered by Democrats and the White House. And late Thursday, an alternate plan urged by Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, fell apart. It would have required steep concessions by the United Auto Workers union and by creditors to General Motors and Chrysler. 
 G.M. has said its cash reserves are falling by more than $2 billion a month, and the company has hired bankruptcy advisers, including Harvey R. Miller of the firm Weil Gotshal & Manges. Chrysler is a private company, but its sales are falling faster than any other company in the industry, and has acknowledged it will run out of money soon, too. 
 Many of their suppliers are teetering on the verge of bankruptcy themselves, and do not have the luxury of extending credit much longer. 
 ''I don't think that suppliers will be able to get through the month without continued payments on their receivables,'' said Neil De Koker, chief executive of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association in Troy, Mich., a trade group.
 When suppliers big and small start failing, the flow of parts to every automaker in the country will be disrupted because as suppliers typically sell their products to both American and foreign brands with plants in the United States.
 ''There's no question it will hit Toyota, Honda and Nissan too,'' said John Casesa, principal in the auto consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group.
 ''Many of the small suppliers will simply liquidate because they don't have the resources to go reorganize in Chapter 11 bankruptcy,'' Mr. Casesa said. ''They'll just go away.''
 It is the dire scene laid out at the first set of Congressional hearings on an auto bailout in mid-November by Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally.
 ''Should one of our domestic competitors declare bankruptcy, the effect on Ford's production operations would be felt within days, if not hours,'' Mr. Mulally said. He has said his company has enough cash to last through 2009, even if the current sales environment for new vehicles -- down 16 percent over all so far this year -- continues.
 In years past, suppliers have often been able to assist a troubled automaker by extending payment periods to get through tough times.
 But by Mr. De Koker's estimation, hundreds of suppliers no longer have that flexibility. They cannot borrow money in a frozen credit market, and they cannot buy raw materials without first being paid for parts they already shipped.
 The Big Three, along with their foreign competitors, are what most people think make up the entire auto industry. But the car manufacturers are just the top of the pyramid.
 While G.M., Ford and Chrysler employ 239,000 people in the United States, the country's 3,000 or so auto suppliers have more than 600,000 workers.
 Suppliers range from large, publicly held companies that make car seats and axles, to much smaller firms that provide clamps, hoses and stamped metal parts.
 Like the Big Three, most of the bigger suppliers have been restructuring their operations drastically to match the shrinking demand for new vehicles.
 For example, Dura Automotive Systems, which makes brake pedals, doors and glass parts, has cut 2,600 jobs in the last 60 days and consolidated seven corporate divisions into four, and cut travel expenses and subscriptions. 
 ''We're operating as if we don't know where the bottom is,'' said Timothy D. Leuliette, Dura's chief executive. ''It's as if we are hungry all the time, and we don't know where things are going.''
 Dura, a global company with sales of $1.8 billion, is in better shape than many other suppliers. Even so, Mr. Leuliette joined other supplier executives on a trip to Washington last week to knock on Congressional doors in support of federal aid to the automakers. 
 ''Most of the suppliers are not highly waged; they have no big pensions,'' Mr. Leuliette said. ''People affected by all this are just the average Joes. Washington has a myopic view of the auto industry. They just think of the Big Three and don't think of us.'' 
 Suppliers make most of the 15,000 parts that go into a single car. More than 70 percent of a car's value -- from the seats to the chassis, from the electronics to the bumpers -- are sold to the automakers by suppliers. 
 Since 2004, the supplier workforce has fallen by 23 percent from 783,000, according to the Original Equipment Suppliers Association. 
 The thousands of auto suppliers operating today -- most along a line stretching from Detroit down to Kentucky close to assembly plants -- are expected to shrink by half, to around 1,500, over the next three years, according to estimates from Plante & Moran, a consulting firm in suburban Detroit.
 At Dura, tough times seem to be the order of the day. The company emerged from bankruptcy this year, which allowed it to cut $1.2 billion from its debt load and close 16 manufacturing facilities out of 48 worldwide. Still the company has been able to land $1 billion in new orders and still has around 13,000 employees worldwide -- with foreign operations in Brazil, Europe, China, Japan and India. 
 Some 27 percent of Dura's revenues come from Ford, 9 percent from G.M. and 9 percent from Chrysler, according to the company's federal filings. Volkswagen and Japanese automakers also represent a large portion of its business. 
 And, like others, Dura cannot get any bank to lend it money while it waits for payments from the Big Three, who are holding off paying their bills. 
 ''For suppliers there is no place to go, no place to hide,'' Mr. Leuliette said. ''The automakers are not paying, so we have to carry them. They are forcing the suppliers to loan money to Ford and G.M. Until G.M., Ford and Chrysler are viewed as financially stable, the worldwide spigot is turned off to suppliers.'' 
 Mr. Leuliette said that he has worked through five previous downturns in the auto industry, but the difference with this one is the lack of bank lending. ''In a normal recession, we could have gone to the capital markets, but the capital markets are closed to us,'' he added.
 The same is true for companies further down the supply chain like TNT-EDM, a precision tool and die shop in Plymouth, Mich., that provides parts used by larger suppliers like Dura. 
 ''It's like the dog chasing the tail,'' said Tom Mullen, the company's chief executive. ''When G.M. isn't paying the tier one guys, they are not paying us. It's like a spoke on a hub that keeps falling off a bit. Normal course of business, we'd get paid in 35 to 45 days, 60 days max. Now, if you get paid in 120 days, you are doing good.'' 
 Mr. Mullen has seen his revenues fall from $15 million a year over the last few years to around $10 million, while saying that his plant has capacity to run at $20 million a year. He has held off investing the $1 million to $2 million he spends annually in new equipment and he has cut back on the hours of his 35 employees to avoid layoffs. 
 ''Everyone is stretched like a bungee cord,'' he said. ''We are waiting to hit the bottom of the river and waiting to be slingshot back up, hopefully.'' 
 ''We still sell 80 percent to auto,'' he added. ''I'd love to sell that much to aerospace. But automotive, it's in our blood.''

HEADLINE: Inhaling Fear

BYLINE: By MARTIN LINDSTROM. 
Martin Lindstrom is the author of ''Buyology: Truth and Lies About Why We Buy.''

DATELINE: Sydney, Australia 

 BODY:
 TEN years ago, in settling the largest civil lawsuit in American history, Big Tobacco agreed to pay the 50 states $246 billion, which they've used in part to finance efforts to prevent smoking. The percentage of American adults who smoke has fallen since then to just over 20 percent from nearly 30 percent, but smoking is still the No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United States, and smoking-related health care costs more than $167 billion a year. 
 To reduce this cost, the incoming Obama administration should abandon one antismoking strategy that isn't working.
 A key component of the Food and Drug Administration's approach to smoking prevention is to warn about health dangers: Smoking causes fatal lung cancer; smoking causes emphysema; smoking while pregnant causes birth defects. Compared with warnings issued by other nations, these statements are low-key. From Canada to Thailand, Australia to Brazil, warnings on cigarette packs include vivid images of lung tumors, limbs turned gangrenous by peripheral vascular disease and open sores and deteriorating teeth caused by mouth and throat cancers. In October, Britain became the first European country to require similar gruesome images on packaging.
 But such warnings don't work. Worldwide, people continue to inhale 5.7 trillion cigarettes annually -- a figure that doesn't even take into account duty-free or black-market cigarettes. According to World Bank projections, the number of smokers is expected to reach 1.6 billion by 2025, from the current 1.3 billion.
 A brain-imaging experiment I conducted in 2006 explains why antismoking scare tactics have been so futile. I examined people's brain activity as they reacted to cigarette warning labels by using functional magnetic resonance imaging, a scanning technique that can show how much oxygen and glucose a particular area of the brain uses while it works, allowing us to observe which specific regions are active at any given time.
 We tested 32 people (from Britain, China, Germany, Japan and the United States), some of whom were social smokers and some of whom were two-pack-a-day addicts. Most of these subjects reported that cigarette warning labels reduced their craving for a cigarette, but their brains told us a different story.
 Each subject lay in the scanner for about an hour while we projected on a small screen a series of cigarette package labels from various countries -- including statements like ''smoking kills'' and ''smoking causes fatal lung cancers.'' We found that the warnings prompted no blood flow to the amygdala, the part of the brain that registers alarm, or to the part of the cortex that would be involved in any effort to register disapproval.
 To the contrary, the warning labels backfired: they stimulated the nucleus accumbens, sometimes called the ''craving spot,'' which lights up on f.M.R.I. whenever a person craves something, whether it's alcohol, drugs, tobacco or gambling. 
 Further investigation is needed, but our study has already revealed an unintended consequence of antismoking health warnings. They appear to work mainly as a marketing tool to keep smokers smoking. 
 Barack Obama has said he's been using nicotine gum to fight his own cigarette habit. His new administration can help other smokers quit, too, by eliminating the government scare tactics that only increase people's craving.

HEADLINE: As Draft Ends, Polish Military Faces Struggle To Modernize

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: RADOM, Poland 

 BODY:
Freshly shorn recruits craned their necks shyly, trying to find their names on the rows of metal bunk beds at the air base here last week. Like young Polish men for generations before them, they had been drafted to serve their insecure and often-conquered country.
 ''I think it is an honor to be a Polish soldier, or to try to be a Polish soldier,'' said one recruit, Krzysztof Lepkowski, 20, who was working as a mechanic on truck engines when he was drafted.
 He and the other arrivals, tugging at the unfamiliar camouflage uniforms issued to them barely an hour before, taking their first tentative steps in their high-shine black boots, will be the last of their kind.
 As part of the wholesale effort to modernize its military, the Polish government has officially brought a close to conscription, making last week's class of drafted recruits the final one after 90 years of compulsory military service on this soil, which felt the tremors of some of the worst the last century's wars could offer. 
 The decision has come at a difficult time. Russia's incursion into Georgian territory in August awakened real fears, catching policy makers and citizens off guard. Poland's attempt to transform its military into a smaller, modern integrated force this fall is occurring in a season of turmoil, as its soldiers have left Iraq and are expanding their presence in Afghanistan.
 Analysts say there are not enough funds and not enough men without the conscripts, while Poland is trying, in essence, to do it all at the same time. Supporters of the decision called it an overdue step toward matching the quality of the military forces of the country's chief NATO allies in Western Europe and across the Atlantic. Critics called it a hasty and expensive move during an economic crisis, more a product of politics than of sound planning, and a lower priority than badly needed new equipment.
 After a history in which Poland was conquered by Russia and Germany and at times disappeared from the map, Poles worry more acutely than people in many other countries, particularly European ones, about questions of national defense. The fight for independence, of giving life and limb for the country, is an ingrained part of the national narrative.
 And with a newly assertive Russia making threats against it, Poland desperately wants guarantees of safety and security. At the same time, Poland's leaders seem to have realized that the country's security derives not from the largest possible standing army, but from bolstering the multilateral organizations that have bound it closely to the rest of Europe and provided strong allies, in particular the United States. 
 ''It is really in our interest to keep a strong NATO -- and to keep a strong European Union -- because it is the real guarantee of our security,'' said Lech Kosciuk, director of the transformation department at the Ministry of Defense. ''In our case, it is the problem of the limitation of the money, the limitation of resources.''
 Total Polish defense spending was some 22.6 billion zloty in 2008, about $7.4 billion, or 1.95 percent of the country's gross domestic product, making it one of the biggest military spenders in Europe relative to its size, but relatively small in absolute terms. Personnel and pension costs ate up roughly half of that amount, and the Defense Ministry estimates that the swiftly executed professionalization will cost 1.4 billion zloty (about $460 million) in 2009 and 2.5 billion (about $820 million) in 2010. 
 ''I cannot be too optimistic about the currently proposed sudden speeding-up of this program,'' Wladyslaw Stasiak, head of the National Security Bureau, which gives military advice to President Lech Kaczynski, wrote in an article. ''It coincides with a lack of a thorough action plan, solid calculation, indication of sources of financing, as well as a motivation system for volunteers willing to put on uniforms.''
 The decision has been a point of contention between President Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who attracted young voters in last year's parliamentary elections in part by promising to end the draft.
 Poland has received high marks so far from Western military experts for its efforts to modernize its forces and is known as an eager participant in European Union defense projects as well as in NATO missions and programs. But experts at home say that the country has overstretched itself with deployments abroad, including roughly 1,600 troops in Afghanistan, up from around 1,200 in September, and five years of playing a supporting role in Iraq, which it recently completed. 
 The Polish Navy desperately needs to be upgraded. The defense minister, Bogdan Klich, has said updating the country's air defenses is also a priority, as are new helicopters. 
 ''All these programs cannot be executed at the same time,'' said Andrzej Karkoszka, a defense expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Warsaw and former deputy minister for defense policy at the Polish Ministry of Defense. ''They have to be phased in, one after another, according to the urgency and the availability of funds.'' 
 The biggest test for the new professional military will be whether it can fill its ranks, by attracting volunteers as well as by holding on to the recruits, now that the government will have to work to attract candidates rather than just calling them up. The Defense Ministry in August began an advertising campaign featuring billboards and television commercials with scenes of helicopters and rappelling soldiers that could easily run during the Super Bowl. 
 ''Honor, challenge, brotherhood,'' the narrator intoned. ''Live with the passion. Join the best.'' 
 For Poland, moving to a professional army is just one step among many in a process over several years to revamp its military from a 450,000-member force aimed westward as part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to a lean, well-equipped military that can quickly deploy to the world's trouble spots on multinational missions. 
 By the end of this year the military will have whittled its manpower down to 130,000, a figure expected to fall to a goal of 120,000 after professionalization. But with close to 38,000 draftees cycling out next year, that still leaves a significant shortfall, requiring up to 20,000 additional professional soldiers to make up the difference.
 The average professional private makes 2,200 zloty a month, about $720, which will increase to 2,500, or about $820, on the first of the year. There is a proposal to raise salaries 13 to 26 percent on top of that. Women were not drafted, and only 1,500 serve in the military, a number expected to rise as more are attracted to the professional ranks.
 Jakub Padala's parents drove him from their home south of Lublin, in Krasnik. Mr. Padala, 21, was unemployed and living with his parents when he was called up. Asked why he chose to serve when friends had wriggled out, he said: ''Discipline. It's the school of life.'' He said he hoped to get training and high-technology experience in particular, believing that he would find work more easily after serving. 
 To a man the recruits expressed calm and confidence, but their sweaty palms gave away their nervousness with a simple handshake. For 21 days they will undergo combat and fitness training, practice for chemical warfare and learn the military's rules and regulations. On Dec. 30 they will take their oath and on Jan. 9 disperse to units around the country. When their mandatory nine months are up, Poland will have -- ready or not -- a professional army.
 ''I would show up just to work here,'' said Radek Kedziora, 24, who had a brother in the military and was working as an emergency medical technician in an ambulance when he was called up. 
 ''I want to stay and it depends if they want me,'' he said. That sentiment is music to the ears of Defense Ministry officials, and a tune they need to hear many times over to reach their goals.

HEADLINE: TIMECRIMES

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.
Directed by Nacho Vigalondo
In Spanish, with English subtitles
1 hour 29 minutes
Proof positive that a naked hottie and whiz-bang pacing can disguise the most gaping narrative cracks, ''Timecrimes'' makes sci-fi lemonade out of low-budget lemons. 
Tackling time travel with zero special effects, one location and only four speaking roles requires nerve -- and in this case an exorbitant faith in full-frontal nudity -- but the Spanish writer and director Nacho Vigalondo has audacity to spare. Constructing a looping, economical plot and directing like a fire marshal in a flaming building, he conjures urgency and disorientation from the thinnest of air.
All the more admirable when his instrument is the stolid, paunchy Hector (Karra Elejalde), a well-fed husband whose idly scanning binoculars snag on an impromptu striptease in the woods near his new home. Compelled to investigate, he discovers a dead beauty and a lurking attacker; fleeing to a nearby laboratory, he is hidden in a tank by a nervous scientist (played by Mr. Vigalondo), emerging to discover that an hour has passed -- backward.
Unlike Shane Carruth's incomprehensible ''Primer'' (which shares a central plot device), ''Timecrimes'' never abandons momentum: like the audience, Hector has no time to think. His resolute acceptance of his bizarre situation is central to the movie's success. Whatever happens, no naked girl or crazy scientist is going to keep him from his dinner. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS
''Timecrimes'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). A little blood and a lot of skin.

HEADLINE: JOB LOSSES IN CITY REACH UP LADDER

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Christine Haughney contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Well-paid professionals like lawyers, accountants and architects are joining the rapidly expanding unemployment rolls in New York City, as the effects of the financial crisis have spread beyond Wall Street not only to other white-collar industries but also to the construction and retail trades, a new report shows.
 The number of white-collar workers outside the financial industry receiving unemployment checks was up by more than 40 percent in October from the same month last year, and the number of college graduates collecting benefits was up by 50 percent, according to the report by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit research group. 
 ''Unemployment is starting to shoot up in New York City, and it's affecting a spectrum of workers, both professionals and blue-collar,'' said James Parrott, the institute's chief economist and author of the report. ''It's hitting young workers and older workers, and it's poised to rise dramatically in the weeks and months ahead.'' 
 The report comes amid continued bad news in the financial industry. On Thursday, Bank of America said it planned to cut 30,000 to 35,000 positions over the next three years as it digests its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. 
 The report, based on state and federal unemployment statistics, provides hard data confirming a trend that was until now best understood anecdotally. It also showed that New York entered the recession much later than the rest of the country, largely because hiring by law and accounting firms, media companies and tourism-related industries remained strong through the first half of the year.
 As recently as July, the number of new claims for unemployment benefits in the city was only about 10 percent higher than it had been a year earlier. But since employment peaked in August, the city has lost about 10,000 jobs. And in the 12 weeks between late August and late November, first-time unemployment claims increased by more than 40 percent over the same period the year before, the sharpest year-over-year increase since February 2002. 
 Mr. Parrott said that the figures understate the severity of unemployment because many laid-off workers have not started collecting checks and many others do not qualify for benefits. In October, fewer than one-third of the 225,000 unemployed residents of New York City were collecting benefits, he said. 
 That portends an upsurge in the city's unemployment rate for months to come, Mr. Parrott said. Most forecasts project that the city will lose more than 150,000 jobs during this recession. The Fiscal Policy Institute report estimates that job losses will average about 10,000 a month from November 2008 through the end of 2009.
 The city's unemployment rate was 5.7 percent in October, up from 5.2 percent in October 2007. The national unemployment rate was 6.5 percent, up from 4.8 percent the year before.
 The growth in New York's ranks of the well-educated unemployed seems to parallel a national trend, said Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Since March 2007, the number of college graduates who are unemployed has risen at a faster rate, 75 percent, than has the number of all unemployed Americans who are 25 and older, 62 percent, Mr. Mishel said.
 ''This is very strong evidence that this recession is very hard on college grads, more than usual,'' Mr. Mishel said. 
 Mr. Mishel's organization works with Mr. Parrott's to promote the concerns of organized labor and low-wage workers. 
 Kenly Lambie, an architect who lives in Brooklyn, joined the ranks of the unemployed this summer after she was laid off by a firm where she had worked for a year. The dismissal caught her by surprise, but she said other firms have also cut back as construction loans have dried up.
 ''It's really grim, and almost everyone I know who was at my level is unemployed,'' Ms. Lambie, 29, said. She said she hopes to land at another firm in the city, but added, ''If a really interesting opportunity came along in, say, Argentina, I'd jump on it.''
 In the meantime, Ms. Lambie is trying to get by on a weekly unemployment check of $405, which she said is ''definitely not enough.''
 A separate report released on Thursday by the city comptroller's office echoed the central findings of Mr. Parrott's study, doubling the city's projection of the number of people who will lose their jobs by August 2010, to 170,000. 
 The comptroller's report also estimated that total Wall Street bonuses this year will be less than half what was paid last year, making it the smallest amount since 2002. Largely as a result, city tax revenue will fall by 4.3 percent in the next half year, the comptroller concluded. 
 The layoffs in New York are following a traditional recessionary pattern by radiating out from the big financial companies to other professional services and to lower-paying businesses like retailing, according to the report, which uses the latest data available from the state's Labor Department. 
 In October, 6,428 people who had worked in professional, technical and scientific services were receiving unemployment benefits, up 42 percent from October 2007. That total -- which includes the fields of law, accounting, consulting and engineering -- exceeded the 5,935 people from the finance and insurance industries who were receiving benefits, the report showed. 
 The number of blue-collar beneficiaries was up 50 percent, driven mainly by a jump in laid-off construction workers.
 Among those collecting benefits in the city, the smallest increases have come in management and from the fields of health care and social services and arts, entertainment and recreation, the report found. Health care and businesses that benefit from tourism have helped to bolster the city's economy as the financial crisis has worsened. 
 But with the dollar strengthening against other currencies and foreign economies faltering, tourism has already begun to decline, threatening employment in that sector.
 Not every unemployed person has a tale of woe. Lynne Figman, a real estate lawyer, said that she was given only about five minutes to clean out her desk at Phillips Nizer when she was laid off on Nov. 5. Her boss said he was letting her go because the firm expected its real estate practice to plummet next year, she said. 
 But Ms. Figman, who is receiving unemployment benefits now, has already begun setting up her own practice from her Upper West Side apartment and expects to have a healthy list of small businesses and homeowners as clients. On Sunday, she turns 50. 
 ''I'm still going through with the plan to party,'' Ms. Figman said. ''My parents insist.''

HEADLINE: Energy Group Sees First Fall In Use of Oil Since 1983

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Global oil consumption will drop this year for the first time since 1983, as an economic downturn in the West and slower growth in China cut fuel demand, according to the world's main energy forecaster.
 The International Energy Agency, an adviser to industrialized nations, said on Thursday that it projects worldwide demand to fall by 200,000 barrels a day, to 85.8 million barrels a day, in 2008. The new forecast is 350,000 barrels a day less than the agency's last monthly report, which is widely read among energy experts. 
 Oil demand may recover somewhat next year, although at a much slower pace, as the global economy turns the corner in the second half of 2009, according to the energy agency. It sees consumption growing by 0.5 percent, or 400,000 barrels a day. That is still 260,000 barrels a day less than was expected last month. 
 ''Clearly, if we are now heading for a prolonged and global outright recession, then the 0.5 percent global oil demand growth we now envisage for next year may not materialize,'' according to the report.
 Many other energy forecasts have painted a far bleaker picture of the oil markets for the next 12 months. Many analysts had already predicted lower consumption this year, and some also expect demand to drop next year. 
 The Energy Department said earlier this week that global consumption would probably fall by 450,000 barrels a day in 2009, the first time in more than 30 years that demand will decline for two consecutive years.
 As a result of the global recession, the price of oil has fallen more than 70 percent since its peak this summer as demand dropped in the United States and other industrialized countries. Oil fell to $40 a barrel last week, after rising as high as $147 a barrel in intraday trading in July. 
 On Thursday, oil futures in New York surged $4.46 to $47.98 a barrel, after the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said that his country had cut its production to 8.5 million barrels a day, down more than 1.2 million barrels a day from its August peak. 
 The agency's report could add grist to the view that producers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries must reduce their output to prevent a complete price collapse. The oil cartel is meeting next week in Algeria to consider reducing its output and stem the price drop.
 The world's idle production capacity has risen to its highest level in six years, and now stands at nearly five million barrels a day. Tight spare capacity, which had fallen to a low of a million barrels a day, was a big factor in the price surge in recent years.
 OPEC's efforts to stabilize prices may be getting some assistance from other producers. Russia suggested on Wednesday that it would coordinate a possible production cut with the cartel, while President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia said on Thursday that the country could not rule out joining OPEC, according to local news agencies.
 Other producers that have cooperated with OPEC in the past, like Norway or Mexico, have so far ruled out cutting production.
 Oil demand in the United States has been particularly hard-hit this year, especially when gasoline prices exceeded $4 a gallon nationwide over the summer. 
 Consumption is expected to fall by 6.3 percent this year compared with 2007, to 19.4 million barrels a day, and again by 1.4 percent in 2009, the energy agency said.
 But as gasoline prices have fallen back to a nationwide average of $1.66 a gallon, there are preliminary signs that consumption may be picking up again. Last week, gasoline demand rose for the first time in 33 weeks, according to a survey of national sales conducted by MasterCard.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE SEDUCTION OF LIGHT,' through March 29. Comparisons may be invidious, but they can also be illuminating. Consider this small, tightly focused exhibition of portraits by the 19th-century American folk artist Ammi Phillips and paintings by the 20th-century Abstract Expressionist Mark Rothko. The presentation reveals parallel ways of dealing with surface, color and light. It also reveals two painters who were, each in his own pragmatic yet metaphysically resonant way, distinctly American artists. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
 ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'ART AND CHINA'S REVOLUTION,' through Jan. 11. The splashy party that was the 2008 Olympics is yesterday's news, but one-party rule in China remains. New China is still, in significant ways, Old China. The obvious question is: What comes next? To help answer it, Asia Society asks a different, equally timely post-Olympics question: What came before? This exhibition of paintings, drawings, posters and Maoist souvenirs produced in the years leading up to and during the Cultural Revolution gives complicated answers. It lays out the conflicted loyalties that have shaped contemporary China, and finds them in the work of artists who anticipated the current art boom and are part of it. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
 * ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'TRACES OF THE CALLIGRAPHER: ISLAMIC CALLIGRAPHY IN PRACTICE, CIRCA 1600-1900,' AND 'WRITING THE WORD OF GOD: CALLIGRAPHY AND THE QUR'AN,' through Feb. 8. These side-by-side exhibitions, perfect in size and carefully thought out, approach Islamic calligraphy from two perspectives. The first show is basically a manual in techniques of fine penmanship and luxury book-making, illustrated by superb examples of tools of the trade and finished products. The second is an array of hand-written Koran pages for total-immersion contemplation. Gorgeous. (See above.) (Cotter)
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,' through Jan. 25. If to you ''street life'' means noise-lights-action, you'll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it, from Robert Frank's unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today's streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GILBERT & GEORGE,' through Jan. 11. Dynamic duo, gruesome twosome or just plain geeks in ties and tweeds, the British artists Gilbert & George don't seem to care what you call them as long as you pay attention, which you couldn't avoid doing if you tried in their suffocating and disordered wraparound survey at the Brooklyn Museum. In no particular sequence, we see the shadowy early black-and-white photographic pieces they did while living in a falling-down section of London in the 1970s, and the huge Pop colored murals filled with flowers and crowds of dishy young men, which decrease in number during the most devastating years of the AIDS epidemic. The newest work in the show, from 2005 and 2006, is crazy, end-of-time stuff. Terrorism and religious fundamentalism are the themes, and Gilbert and George themselves, partners in art as in life, are in the picture, mugging, moralizing, unembarrassed and all but unendurable, in art that's right for right now. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'JESPER JUST: ROMANTIC DELUSIONS,' through Jan. 4. An enchanting show of four short films exhibits most of the qualities for which Mr. Just has become known since completing his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 2003. Melodramatic but never campy or over the top and made with Hollywood-quality production values, his brief musicals explore vulnerable, ordinarily well-armored zones of the masculine psyche, like grief, same-sex love, Oedipal conflict and spiritual desire. The singing is wonderful. (See above.) (Johnson)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HOUSE PROUD: 19TH-CENTURY WATERCOLOR INTERIORS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION,' through Jan. 25. The 70 or so jewel-like renderings of rooms and their furnishings here are delightful, mordantly signifying artifacts. They track the domestic effects of exoticism and nostalgia (chinoiserie, Gothic Revival); uncover glimmers of modernity (Biedermeier, smaller rooms); and witness the birth of the contemporary genre known as shelter porn. Accompanied by relevant examples of furniture, decorative objects and books, they also reveal that rooms seen whole, with light and space as well as decor carefully depicted, are among painting's most appealing subjects. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)
 * FRICK COLLECTION: 'ANDREA RICCIO: RENAISSANCE MASTER OF BRONZE,' through Jan. 18. Scholars say that Andrea Riccio was one of the greatest sculptors of the Italian Renaissance. Cast in dark bronze and resembling Roman antiquities, Riccio's small-scale statuettes, reliefs and oil lamps seem unremarkably modest at first. But let your eyes adjust to the formal subtlety, expressive urgency and almost supernatural aliveness of his art and you will fall in love. Sculpture does not get much better than this. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM:
 'THEANYSPACEWHATEVER,' through Jan. 7. The innately sculptural Guggenheim mounts the first major exhibition in this country about relational aesthetics -- probably the most radical art to emerge in the 1990s -- and comes up looking, well, remarkably empty, which is also extraordinarily beautiful in its own Wright. The more or less interactive works by 10 artists invite you to experience in a new way time, space, the art-viewing world and the museum itself. Even if you never want to see the museum going this far out again, the Guggenheim must be credited for bringing the latest art remarkably intact to a larger public. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CATHERINE OPIE: AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER,' through Jan. 7. Catherine Opie is many artists in one. Best known in the 1990s for her striking portraits of gay, lesbian and transgendered men and women drawn from a circle of friends and intimates, she is also a photographer of landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, still lifes and lifestyles. She is an insider and an outsider: a documentarian and a provocateur, a classicist and a maverick; a trekker and a stay-at-home; a lesbian feminist mother who resists the gay mainstream. It's all here in a fine retrospective. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AMERICA AND THE TINTYPE,' through Jan. 4. This show about the tintype, an early form of photograph made by exposing a lacquered iron plate to light, includes some 200 examples from the museum's collection. Most of the artists, and subjects, are unidentified. These works form a group portrait of Americans, mostly working- and middle-class, struggling to adapt to the rapidly shifting social and economic conditions during the four decades after the Civil War. The exhibition makes the most of the tintype's range of subject matter and emotion, from postmortem shots to vaudevillian caricatures, freedmen to minstrels. It does not dispute the daguerreotype's superior potentials for artistry but simply asserts that tintypes have been unfairly overlooked because of their ubiquity, affordability and anonymity. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'SUSAN MEISELAS: IN HISTORY,' through Jan. 4. A certain moral quandary runs throughout this fascinatingly problematic exhibition: how do you reconcile the demands of professionalism and those of human compassion? To her credit, Ms. Meiselas -- whose coverage of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in 1978-79 made her one of the world's most celebrated and criticized war correspondents -- does not duck the question. Tension between opportunism and conscience emerges as the show's main interest -- to the point that it trumps its ostensible subjects, which include strippers in traveling carnivals and forensic investigations of Saddam Hussein's campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'CHAGALL AND THE ARTISTS OF THE RUSSIAN JEWISH THEATER, 1919-1949,' through March 22. A fascinating tale of two vanguard theater companies that flourished in Moscow for a few years after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 is told by this big, walk-in scrapbook of a show presenting more than 200 pieces of art and ephemera. Exploring the histories of the Hebrew-speaking Habima theater and the Yiddish-speaking Moscow State Yiddish Theater, the exhibition includes drawings, paintings, photographs, posters, sheet music, costumes and clips from vintage films. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART AND LOVE IN RENAISSANCE ITALY,' through Feb. 16. With the most cherished of all human emotions as its central theme, this exhibition examines 14th- and 15th-century marriage rituals in Italy in terms of the many sumptuous objects and artworks they generated. The show includes ceramics, paintings, a cradle, wedding portraits and childbirth trays. Its many images mix happy endings and cautionary tales (some of the most gruesome intended for bridal chambers). Profane love is acknowledged with a choice display of erotica. The commodification and adoration of women run on parallel tracks, right up to and including two majestic paintings by Titian. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE MET: 'BEYOND BABYLON: ART, TRADE, AND DIPLOMACY IN THE SECOND MILLENNIUM B.C.,' through March 15. This big, prescient, concentration-taxing exhibition is the latest in the Met's line of investigative archaeological shows, and it is not geared to quick-take viewing. Many of the objects are small and intimate; made to be worn, handled and easily transported. A proliferation of wall texts gives the show the pace of a lavishly illustrated book. Patient viewing is rewarded by a fascinating story of a proto-global world in formation nearly 4,000 years ago. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'THE ESSENTIAL ART OF AFRICAN TEXTILES,' through April 5. This show presents 19th-century African textiles, many lent by the British Museum, alongside relevant contemporary artworks from the Met's collection. One of the most spectacular pairings matches El Anatsui's ''Between Earth and Heaven,'' a recent acquisition, with a kente prestige cloth from Ghana. The Met's 2005 exhibition ''Matisse: The Fabric of Dreams'' hinted that textiles had been undervalued in the Western canon; while the current show may not have the same blockbuster appeal, it goes deeper into the techniques and traditions that make the fabrics so striking and seductive. A related show, ''The Poetics of Cloth: African Textiles/Recent Art,'' is at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 THE MET: 'EARLY BUDDHIST MANUSCRIPT PAINTING: THE PALM-LEAF TRADITION,' through March 22. Practical features like resilience and portability help explain why books written on dried palm leaves were popular with Buddhists in eastern India between the 10th and 13th centuries. But another factor, surely, was the quality of the illustrations that accompanied the texts: exquisite figures of divinities or scenes from the Buddha's life. And few of these are as finely done and pristinely preserved as the examples in this small selection. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LANDSCAPES CLEAR AND RADIANT: THE ART OF WANG HUI (1632-1717),' through Jan. 4. The Met's first solo show devoted to a Chinese master is gorgeous and revelatory; its focus is the landscape virtuoso Wang Hui, star of the 17th-century Chinese art scene. Wang could do anything and did, synthesizing and transforming disparate strands of almost a millennium of Chinese painting, but also making exact copies of earlier masterpieces. Distinguished by a Mozart-like ease and perfection, his work unsettles Western notions of copy, original and originality. It is aided in this by displays of works by 16 earlier artists dating to the 10th-century -- his mentors, his mentors' mentors and the artists they all revered -- which form a dazzling introduction to Chinese painting in general. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'THE PHILIPPE DE MONTEBELLO YEARS: CURATORS CELEBRATE THREE DECADES OF ACQUISITIONS,' through Feb. 1. As the title implies, the show is a tribute to Mr. de Montebello, who is leaving the Met after being director for more than 30 years. For the occasion, curators in 17 of the museum departments have chosen objects in their fields of expertise from the permanent collection. There are marvelous things here, from Chinese scrolls, Greek vessels and Oceanic effigies to Byzantine icons and an 18th-century American pickle-holder. In short, a wonder-cabinet situation. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DRAWING BABAR: EARLY DRAFTS AND WATERCOLORS,' through Jan. 4. The first and most brilliant Babar book (''The Story of Babar'') gets its own gallery in which Jean de Brunhoff's familiar story is illustrated by his sketches and drafts -- a room bound to fascinate children and the adults who read to them. Another is devoted to the first Babar book by Jean's son, Laurent (''Babar's Cousin''), who first heard about the elephant in the green suit in bedtime stories. In this compact, elegant exhibition, we don't learn a lot about the reasons for Babar's appeal. Speculation is restrained, and simple demonstration preferred, an approach in keeping with Jean's spare, precise narrative and laconic illustration, in which diverging lines of dots become tears; angled eyebrows signal anger; andthe varied curves of an elephant's trunk evoke an inner life. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Edward Rothstein)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: JOHN MILTON'S 'PARADISE LOST,' through Jan. 4. To honor Milton's quadricentennial, eight of the pages of the only known surviving manuscript of Book 1 of ''Paradise Lost'' are on view, along with other Miltoniana, including a first edition and a miniature portrait believed to be of the poet. The handwriting is a scribe's; Milton, who was blind, composed the work orally. (See above.)
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY,' through April 19. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design's jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a loveseat, a view of the ''Mona Lisa,'' a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim's beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'PARIS/NEW YORK: DESIGN FASHION CULTURE, 1925-1940,' through Feb. 22. This compact yet kaleidoscopic exhibition celebrates the romance that flourished between New York and Paris in the 1920s and '30s, when French Art Deco was the style, American jazz was the music, and skyscrapers and sumptuous ocean liners were among the symbols of the age. Selected and installed to extract maximum wattage from every juxtaposition, object and image (including many surprisingly effective digital reproductions), it tracks the exchange of goods as much as of ideas, and the roles played by both department stores and museums, knock-offs and originals, businessmen (especially developers) and designers and artists. Most memorably, it clarifies a golden age of design and building, when New York became the world capital of Art Deco architecture. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'I AM A MAN,' through Jan. 18. The words that make up the title of this strong, timely group show were emblazoned on placards carried by striking black workers in Birmingham, Ala., in 1968. But the show turns the original assertion into a question: what does it mean to be an African-American male today? A smart, Pop-style painting by Fahamu Pecou sends up stereotypes of sexual prowess; a video by Lorenzo Steele Jr. looks at prison life from the inside; Jefferson Pinder casts his sights back to the Civil Rights movement's espousal of passive resistance in a video piece that illustrates that ideal in action. The written statements by each artist are well worth reading. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'JOAN MIRO: PAINTING AND ANTI-PAINTING 1927-1937,' through Jan. 12. When, in 1927, Joan Miro said, ''I want to assassinate painting,'' he wasn't saying anything new. What was new was the way he carried out his self-assigned, cut-throat task. And that process is the subject of this invigorating, absorbing and -- Miro would be mortified -- beautiful show. It illustrates, step by step, how he stalked and attacked painting -- zapped its conventions, messed up its history, spoiled its market value -- through distinctive groups of experimental works produced over a decade. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'LOOKING AT MUSIC,' through Jan. 5. This exhibition of about 40 works from the museum's collection emphasizes the experimental nature of both art and music in the late 1960s and early '70s. The lines dividing art, music and film were blurry enough to allow Laurie Anderson, Bruce Nauman and Yoko Ono, among others, to shift from object making to performance and back again. The show, which includes audio recordings and small-press publications alongside more conventional mediums, is accompanied by an extensive film and video program. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 2008: JOSEPHINE MECKSEPER AND MIKHAEL SUBOTZKY,' through Jan. 5. Josephine Meckseper, a German-born artist in her 40s who was trained at the California Institute of the Arts, makes sleek-looking installations that mix photography and film -- often scenes of political protest -- with consumer objects. The South African artist Mikhael Subotzky, who at 26 is the youngest photographer to have been invited to join the Magnum Group, explores his country's prison system in vivid color and unflinching detail. If Ms. Meckseper finds glossy, consumerist fantasy infiltrating our political consciousness, Mr. Subotzky reminds us that some people don't yet have the luxury of fretting about the commodification of dissent. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT,' through Jan. 5. This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh's special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs -- including masterpieces like ''The Potato Eaters,'' ''The Starry Night'' and ''Night Cafe'' -- in intimate galleries is thrilling. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'GEORGE TOOKER: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through Jan. 4. George Tooker has painted some of the 20th century's most memorable images of angst. With its lost souls haunting the New York underground, ''Subway'' (1950) envisions modernity as a spiritual prison system. The Kafkaesque ''Government Bureau'' (1956) pictures an office of seemingly infinite dimensions, where people wait like penitents at the windows of terminally unresponsive bureaucrats. Both paintings are included in this richly affecting five-decade career retrospective. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Johnson)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'ALFRED KUBIN: DRAWINGS, 1897-1909,' through Jan. 26. You would never guess that the Viennese artist Alfred Kubin was a contemporary of Gustav Klimt; he is closer in spirit to the Belgian James Ensor and the Norwegian Edvard Munch, visionaries who expressed modernity's spiritual toll and anticipated some of the horrors of the 20th century. Executed in black-and-white pen, ink and spray on heavy paper used for cartography, Kubin's drawings map the shadowy corners of the unconscious. Playing to the art's dark themes, the Neue Galerie's third floor has been made over in the sensationally macabre style of a Tim Burton movie. The walls are painted black and brown; red crushed-velvet curtains hang in the doorways; and Kubin's death mask is displayed in a coffinlike glass case. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
 NEW MUSEUM: 'LIVE FOREVER: ELIZABETH PEYTON,' through Jan. 11. This lush midcareer survey pays tribute to an artist whose diminutive, irony-free, boldly colored portraits of friends, artists, rock stars and other historic figures, living and dead, have exerted considerable influence over the last 16 years. The reason is a complex, highly effective fusion of the painterly, the personal and the Conceptual, as well as a kind of reverse appropriation, wherein photographs and snapshots are given a new permanence, substance and most of all feeling by being re-engineered into unique art objects. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'MARY HEILMANN: TO BE SOMEONE,' through Jan. 26. Over the past four decades Ms. Heilmann has been painting with an infectious, unabashedly hedonistic joie de vivre. Working with big brushes and generous quantities of paint, she continues to produce wildly colorful abstractions that riff with irreverent verve on basic elements of Modernist painting: the grid, the monochromatic rectangle, stripes, organic forms, linear webs, spots, checks and drips. This exhilarating retrospective presents works dating from 1967 to the present. (See above.) (Johnson)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through April 13. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: BARKLEY L. HENDRICKS: 'BIRTH OF THE COOL,' through March 15. He did not birth the cool -- that was Miles Davis -- but Mr. Hendricks's suave portraits from the 1960s, '70s and early '80s give him the right to use this title for his five-decade retrospective. Mixing realism, abstraction and Pop, Mr. Hendricks's life-size paintings of beautiful black people in extravagantly fashionable outfits captured a period sensibility with uncanny acuity. Today, with portrait painters like Kehinde Wiley, Elizabeth Peyton and Chuck Close enjoying great popularity, Mr. Hendricks's work is back in style. 144 West 125 Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Johnson)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALEXANDER CALDER: THE PARIS YEARS, 1926-1933,' through Feb. 15. Is art glorified child's play, extending into adulthood, through a lifetime, picking up ideas and gaining finesse as it goes? That's one way to think of this exhibition, which focuses intently on one artist's child-within embodied in toys, cartoons and wire figures, with the Whitney's famous ''Calder's Circus'' as a centerpiece and a grown-up modernist surprise at the end. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WILLIAM EGGLESTON: DEMOCRATIC CAMERA,' through Jan. 25. When William Eggleston's color, snapshot-like photographs of his home territory in the American South were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in 1976, critics squawked that the work was vulgar and haphazard. But these pictures quickly became influential classics. And that's how they look in this 40-year retrospective at the Whitney, the artist's first New York museum solo since his seditious debut. The show includes a recently edited version of Mr. Eggleston's cruel, unusual and ultimately revolting video epic ''Stranded in Canton.'' (See above.) (Cotter)
 Galleries: Uptown
 'FRANKENTHALER AT EIGHTY: SIX DECADES'Helen Frankenthaler's longtime gallery is throwing her an 80th-birthday party. With nine large-scale works from the artist's personal collection, covering more than five decades, the show takes the form of a mini-retrospective. (A more substantial museum survey is long overdue.) The earliest work is ''Western Dream,'' a maelstrom of lavender-and-coral stains on unprimed canvas; the newest is ''Warming Trend,'' a near-monochrome field of indigo with fiery undertones. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Jan. 10. (Rosenberg)
 'NEIL JENNEY: NEW PAINTINGS' With the works in this beautiful show, his first exhibition of new paintings in New York since 1998, Neil Jenney continues to create idiosyncratic, magic realist landscapes with heavy black frames. Most surprising are two paintings of luminous blue skies with puffy, animal-shaped clouds in them and the word ''Atmosphere'' neatly lettered on each frame. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, bmathesgallery.com, through Jan. 24. (Johnson)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 IRVING NORMAN: 'A SELECTION OF PAINTING AND DRAWINGS' The ambitious, mordantly satiric, social-surrealist paintings by this little-known San Francisco-area artist, who died in 1989, envision modernity as a labyrinthine nightmare. Painted with a neat, illustrative touch, they project cartoonish allegories of awesome complexity in which ordinary people are regimented in factories, warehoused in towering prisons and stored in endless phalanxes of hospital beds, while evil capitalists and fascist dictators pictured as overblown grotesques control the machinery of power. Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, michaelrosenfeldart.com, through Dec. 20. (Johnson)
 Galleries: SoHo
 CHARLOTTE POSENENSKE: 'PROTOTYPES FOR MASS PRODUCTION (1965-1967)' The works in this exhibition -- simple geometric forms made of folded sheet metal and painted in black and primary-colored enamels -- were intended to be mass-produced, sold at cost and displayed in public. Ms. Posenenske quit making art in 1968 when she concluded that it could not make enough of a political difference in the world, but her sculptures still have a bright, Pop Art-like punch. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through Jan. 10. (Johnson)
 KEHINDE WILEY: 'DOWN' Mr. Wiley is known for paintings of young African-American men dressed in fashionable street wear posing against richly patterned backgrounds like heroic figures in Renaissance paintings. This exhibition presents eight enormous paintings of young men in reclining positions. The biggest, called ''Sleep,'' which measures 11 by 25 feet, depicts a muscular man lying back like the dead Jesus, naked but for a snowy white cloth swaddling his hips. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through Dec. 20. (Johnson)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 STAN DOUGLAS: 'HUMOR, IRONY AND THE LAW' This show's main attraction, an almost entirely silent film called ''Video,'' combines ponderous academicism and cinematic intrigue. It follows a young woman caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare in which she is harassed by men in trench coats, put on trial, abducted and forced into a final, desperate act. David Zwirner, 533 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)
 CHARLES GAINES: 'MANIFESTOS' The politically charged texts scrolling up flat-screen monitors in this poetically resonant and conceptually intriguing exhibition are manifestos from movements like the Black Panthers and the Zapatistas. The minor-key music that accompanies them -- composed using a John Cage-like system of chance and played by a piano quintet -- is beautiful and soothing. Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 627-3680, kentgallery.com, through Dec. 20. (Johnson)
 AL HELD An awesome blast of light, color, space and geometry awaits visitors to this exhibition of six paintings dating from 1979 to 1985 by Mr. Held (1928-2005). Rendered in richly saturated and incandescent colors, these expansive, hard-edged pictures of grids, boxes, wheels and serpentine loops, interpenetrating and receding into infinite, Euclidean distances, are like visions of a Neo-Platonist on acid. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com, through Jan. 10. (Johnson)
 CINDY SHERMAN After years of vamping behind caricatures or actual masks, Ms. Sherman gets closer to her own skin and to actual photography than she has since the beginning of her career. The convention under scrutiny is the social portrait: women of some sort of stature. Aging, delusion and pretension are touched on, but they are usually superseded by an aura of determination, discipline and pride -- in other words, parts of the engine that has driven Ms. Sherman's own relentless career. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Dec. 23. (Smith)
 Galleries: Other
 ERNST CARAMELLE: 'DOUBLE VISION' Mr. Caramelle partly covers sheets of ordinary colored construction paper with straight-edged pieces of paper, bleaches them in the sun and then removes the masking elements. The resulting geometric compositions have a beguiling luminosity. Tracy Williams Ltd., 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212) 229-2757, tracywilliamsltd.com, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)
 NASREEN MOHAMEDI: 'THE GRID, UNPLUGGED' This show of large, abstract drawings is the third New York solo of work by the Indian artist Nasreen Mohamedi (1937-1990), and the most beautiful yet, which means it's as about as beautiful as gallery shows get. Born to a Muslim family, Mohamedi studied art in London and Pazxris and was fully conversant with contemporary art in the West. Her major influences, though, were Islamic architecture, the modern urban landscape and fellow South Asian artists working in abstract, linear styles. This deeply moving show also includes digital excerpts from her poetic notebooks. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com, through Dec. 20. (Cotter)
 'ZERO IN NEW YORK' This gorgeous museumlike exhibition displays works by members of the Zero Group, a loose association of '60s-era European avant-gardists. It features works dating from 1957 to 1966 by about 20 artists, including Piero Manzoni, Arman, Yves Klein and Jean Tinguely. Founded in the late 1950s by two Germans, Heinz Mack and Otto Piene, the Zero Group rejected personal expressionism in favor of radically new forms of abstraction. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com, through Dec. 20. (Johnson)
 Out of Town
 MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, BOSTON: 'RACHEL WHITEREAD: PLACE (VILLAGE),' through Jan. 25. This exhibition, the centerpiece of the museum's mini-survey devoted to the British sculptor Rachel Whiteread, may strike the artist's admirers as a bizarre and kitschy departure. Viewers who have never seen one of her room-size casts won't really get a sense of her work from this installation, which is making its United States debut. Still, the show, which includes drawings and a few smaller sculptures, reveals the more emotive side of an artist who can come off as somber and humorless. 465 Huntington Avenue, (617) 267-9300, mfa.org. (Rosenberg)
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'JAN LIEVENS: A DUTCH MASTER REDISCOVERED,' through Jan. 11. Although not a household name now, Jan Lievens once was famous throughout Northern Europe for his portraits and his religious and history paintings. A child prodigy, he was a friend and colleague of Rembrandt's. Early in their careers, the two painters worked closely together, and many of Lievens's paintings later were misattributed to Rembrandt. Lievens was not Rembrandt's equal, but he had his moments, especially in remarkably precocious paintings that he made as a teenager. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Ken Johnson)
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'POMPEII AND THE ROMAN VILLA: ART AND CULTURE AROUND THE BAY OF NAPLES,' through March 22. This show about the opulent lifestyle of the Roman elite before the A.D. 79 eruption of Vesuvius includes recent discoveries on view in the United States for the first time, as well as finds from excavations dating to the mid-18th century. The galleries unfold according to the floor plan of a typical villa, and the installation -- which includes decorative columns, wall borders, living plants and reproductions of mosaics -- works hard to maintain the illusion of classical architecture. The exhibition moves from artifacts reflecting ancient Romans' infatuation with Greek culture to the rediscovery of Pompeii by 18th-century Europeans, suggesting that every culture finds affirmation of its taste and sophistication in a previous golden age. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Rosenberg)
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'SUN, WIND AND RAIN: THE ART OF DAVID COX,' through Jan. 4. Watercolor was all the rage in early-19th-century England, and one of its most admired practitioners is the subject of this expansive, engaging show. Cox had a particular knack for picturing windy days, and the liveliness of his scenes is reflected in his vigorously realist style. Many of his most affecting pictures show ordinary travelers making their ways toward distant, unseen goals within the picture. Life is a journey. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, (877) 274-8278, yale.edu/ycba. (Johnson)
 Last Chance
 ROBERT CUMMING: 'RECOLETA' An exceptionally inventive painter, sculptor and photographer, Mr. Cumming has hand-cut a series of intricate, faux-Victorian silhouette pictures from sheets of black paper. Packed with eccentric storytelling and intriguing symbolism, they were inspired by a visit to La Recoleta, a vast cemetery in Buenos Aires. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at West Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, janetbordeninc.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 TESSA FARMER This imaginative British sculptor has created a hideous race of ant-size ''fairies'': teeny, black humanoid skeletons equipped with insect wings. She has documented their activities, which include hunting, killing and eating bugs much bigger than themselves, in riveting stop-action videos. You also will find them populating sculptures revolving around a mummified dog, a stuffed crow and a dead mouse. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3455, spencerbrownstonegallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 ZAHA HADID It is hard to think of a living architect who also makes interesting fine art. Ms. Hadid, the world-famous, London-based designer, is no exception. The big, shiny, molded fiberglass works in this two-part exhibition (organized by the London curator Kenny Schachter) resemble flimsy pieces of decor and furniture for one of her aerodynamic, retro-futuristic buildings. Sonnabend, 536 West 22nd Street, and 169 10th Avenue, at 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-1018, rovetv.net; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 'ISABEL AND OTHER INTIMATE STRANGERS: PORTRAITS BY ALBERTO GIACOMETTI AND FRANCIS BACON' The artist-muse relationship inspires a museum-quality exhibition, inaugurating Gagosian's new fourth-floor exhibition space. The woman singled out in the title is the model Isabel Rawsthorne, whose chiseled cheekbones inspired several paintings by Bacon and sculptures by Giacometti. Other captivating figures in the exhibition include Lucian Freud, in Bacon's portraits, and Giacometti's wife and mistress (in separate, and markedly different, paintings). The show was organized by Veronique Wiesinger, the director of the Giacometti Foundation in Paris, and Martin Harrison, who is overseeing Bacon's catalogue raisonne. Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, near 77th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com; closes on Saturday. (Rosenberg)
 'LOOKING BACK' This annual assessment of the previous year in New York art includes a scary sound installation by Paul McCarthy; a pair of funky wooden sculptures of pianos by the playwright Richard Foreman; a sculpture of a white cube with eccentric additions, by Liz Craft; and a satiric videotaped conversation from 1977 between the critic Gregory Battcock and Marcia Tucker, the founding director of the New Museum. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street), West Village, (212) 924-4212, whitecolumns.org; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 LIZA LOU It's no coincidence that Liza Lou's first New York appearance since a 2002 solo in SoHo takes place in an uptown town house and a Park Avenue lobby. Ms. Lou, a sculptor who makes hand-beaded versions of everyday objects and environments, has shifted from immersive installations (like the ''Kitchen'' and ''Back Yard'' exhibited at the New Museum in the mid-'90s) to highly marketable sculptures and relief paintings. The transition isn't all bad. Ms. Lou's beadwork is still dazzling, and she is certainly experimenting with different genres. The showstopper is ''Security Fence'' (2005-7), a shimmering 10-foot-square enclosure of barbed wire and chain-link steel completely covered with silver beads. L & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Rosenberg)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GIORGIO MORANDI, 1890-1964' Aspirants to the role of painter as poet are many. Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964) was the real thing. And this Morandi retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is something that anyone who loves painting and its very specific poetry will want to see. Morandi's still lifes are beautiful, but with a distinctive kind of beauty. And despite their small size and plain components -- bottles, jars, boxes, pots, seashells, vases -- they are emotionally audacious. This isn't because of what they say outright, but because of what they don't say; because they are so evidently shaped by self-restraint, and the passions that produced it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)
 KELLEY WALKER One of the most interesting painters of the moment makes handsomely self-referential expanses of red and white brick walls using a combination of silkscreen, labor-intensive digitalization and collage. The postmodern romance with mechanical reproduction is maintained yet betrayed. The bricks represent with imposing solidity the bare-bones element (walls) needed to display paintings. Yet up close these works are surprisingly delicate; the mortar, represented by cut-out newspapers of different kinds, is laid on top. There are more paintings than needed to make the point. Perhaps Mr. Walker's vacuous installation with mirrors and a disco ball is the counterargument: resistance to business as usual. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Fury Builds Over Crisis At Banks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
The Wall Street backlash is under way. If it grows strong enough, it could end with some bankers facing criminal trials.
 As with most searches for scapegoats, the process will not be entirely fair. But efforts by the big banks to point the finger of blame elsewhere -- to Fannie Mae for guaranteeing bad loans, or to the accountants for forcing the banks to admit they owned assets that were not worth much anymore -- seem to be failing at the same time public anger is growing. 
 One precipitating event is the failure of the huge bank bailouts to do much for the economy. ''Lenders who receive public funds should use those funds to lend,'' said Christopher Dodd, the Senate Banking Committee chairman. He complained that banks are ''hoarding capital'' and buying other banks, rather than lending it. 
 The Bush administration had good reason not to impose strong restrictions on the recipients of bailout money; it had to find a way to recapitalize the banking system without putting a stigma on those that took the money. Strict requirements on how the money could be used would have scared away too many healthy institutions.
 But the bankers should have known that there was a risk of backlash. Few Americans ever dreamed of making what most investment bankers took for granted. In a year when red ink is flowing, why should there be any bonuses at all for executives? Talk of the need to keep valued executives does not play well when those are the same executives who got the banks into this mess.
 A functioning banking system is necessary for a modern economy to grow, but it is not sufficient. The bank bailout was not intended to rescue the economy, but that fact was not exactly emphasized by advocates. 
 Washington took longer than it should have to realize the depth of the economic troubles, treating this as an American credit crisis rather than the worldwide recession it was fast becoming. The bailout was the only action in town, and people not unreasonably assumed it was supposed to make life on Main Street better. It hasn't, and that has roused resentments.
 If public pressure rises to prosecute one or more bankers, there is the not-unimportant question of what charges could be proved. The bosses at Tyco stole from the company, and those at Enron put out false financial statements that violated accounting rules. WorldCom lied about the nature of its spending, and thus turned losses into profits.
 In this mess, on the other hand, there is every indication that many top bankers did not understand the risks they were taking, and were stunned when the losses materialized. That may have been stupid -- another reason to think bonuses are inappropriate -- but stupidity is not a crime. As a federal judge wrote this month in considering claims against Countrywide Financial's officers and directors, ''the federal securities laws do not create liability for poor business judgment or failed operations.''
 But that same opinion, by Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles, offers a road map for any prosecutor who wants to make such a case, even if there is no proof that company executives knew their financial statements understated the losses and risks they were facing.
 The Countrywide complaint, she wrote, presents ''the extraordinary case where a company's essential operations are so at odds with the company's public statements that many statements that would not be actionable in the vast majority of cases'' can form the basis of a complaint.
 ''For example,'' she wrote, ''descriptions such as 'high quality' are generally not actionable; they are vague and subjective puffery not capable of being material as a matter of law.''
 But in this case, she said, the complaint claims ''Countrywide's practices so departed from its public statements that even 'high quality' became materially false and misleading; and that to apply the puffery rule to such allegations would deny that 'high quality' has any meaning.''
 It should be noted that the judge's opinion did not find Countrywide had violated securities laws. She just kept alive a suit claiming that the company's executives had acted illegally when they falsely claimed to be following tough underwriting standards in making mortgage loans.
 She was not making new law. Responding to the last banking crisis, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected a bank's puffery defense that had been accepted by a lower court judge. ''If a defendant represents that its lending practices are 'conservative' and that its collateralization is 'adequate,' the securities laws are clearly implicated if it nevertheless intentionally or recklessly omits certain facts contradicting these representations,'' the court wrote. ''By addressing the quality of a particular management practice, a defendant declares the subject of its representation to be material to the reasonable shareholder, and thus is bound to speak truthfully.''
 That opinion was written about what a bank said in 1990, shortly before its loan losses went through the roof and its stock price went through the floor. But it has a 2008 ring to it. 
 All these cases were civil cases brought by private parties. So far it is not clear that the Securities and Exchange Commission would bring a civil case on such routine-sounding puffery as claiming that lending practices are conservative and cautious, let alone that the Justice Department would file a criminal case with no more evidence of misconduct than that.
 But if the anger against Wall Street grows large enough, that could change. The executives may not have understood how badly they were hurting their banks, but perhaps it can be proved they knew, or should have known, that claims of disciplined and high-quality lending practices were woefully wrong.

HEADLINE: Whitney Chooses Biennial Curators

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Although the art world can grow quiet as the holidays approach, there have been a number of developments this week, like details about the next Whitney Biennial and acquisitions including a Matisse at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
 First, the Biennial. Although it seems as if there just was one (there was, ending in June), officials at the Whitney Museum of American Art are already plotting the sequel, scheduled to open in March 2010. This week they are announcing the choice of curators, who in years past have consisted of all-Whitney teams, groups of outsiders, or variations in between.
 This time the museum has paired Francesco Bonami, 53, a seasoned Italian-born curator with an international reputation, and Gary Carrion-Murayari, 28, a homegrown senior curatorial assistant. Mr. Bonami will serve as curator for the Biennial, with Mr. Carrion-Murayari acting as associate curator. 
 ''It seemed like a good fit on a lot of levels,'' said Donna De Salvo, the Whitney's chief curator. ''Francesco is well known to the Whitney'' -- he helped organize the Rudolf Stingel retrospective in 2007 -- ''and he has been thinking about and looking at biennials. Gary is about investing in a younger generation of curators. Not youth for youth's sake but tapping into the way they see.'' 
 These Biennials are ''a monster to wrestle,'' as Ms. De Salvo put it, but the Whitney also wanted a young eye involved; thus an experienced curator was matched with a greener one. 
 In 2007 Mr. Carrion-Murayari organized ''Television Delivers People,'' which focused on video works from the 1970s and '80s and newer examples that examined the relationship between television and the viewer. A five-year Whitney veteran, he also worked on the 2004 and 2006 Whitney Biennials and helped Mr. Bonami and the Whitney curator Chrissie Iles on the installation of Mr. Stingel's show. 
 This year the Biennial spilled over into the Park Avenue Armory for part of its run. At other times it has spread into Central Park. The 2010 edition, it seems, will be a more concentrated affair, occupying only the museum's landmark Marcel Breuer home. 
 Unless the curators find a special project that requires another sort of space. ''I want to stretch the building's dimensions,'' Mr. Bonami said. ''Sometimes Biennials go all over the place. This one will be more specific.'' 
 Although the curators won't start visiting artists' studios around the country until January, and at this early stage they haven't decided whether the Biennial will have a particular theme, they are already starting to focus on certain ideas. 
 ''I grew up around the world of globalism,'' said Mr. Bonami, who in 2003 became the first American citizen to direct a Venice Biennale and who recently organized ''Italian Art Between Tradition and Revolution: 1968-2008,'' which is on view through March 22 at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice. ''It was a time, around 1992-93, when there were no boundaries. But now my challenge is to reflect on the idea of Americanness. Setting these parameters, these limitations could be an advantage.'' 
 Mr. Carrion-Murayari said the notion of globalism, which was important in past Biennials, feels dated. ''We've gotten beyond that,'' he said. ''It's not so much an argument anymore.''
 Both curators said that their decision to concentrate on the Breuer building rather than consider other locations was not about keeping budgets low because of the current economic climate, adding that there might actually be a benefit to being focused and in one place. 
 The two men also said they were considering weaving works from the Whitney's holdings into the Biennial, which would be a departure. 
 ''We have talked about using the permanent collection,'' Mr. Carrion-Murayari said. ''We definitely want to consider it.'' 
 TWO MET ACQUISITIONS
 Two paintings, executed three centuries apart and each considered surprising in its own way, were recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
 The earliest, by the 17th-century French painter Valentin de Boulogne, depicts a full-length, seated man playing the lute and singing. It recently went on view in the Met's 17th-century French paintings gallery. 
 ''For the last 25 years, any time a dealer asked me what I was looking for, Valentin was the first name I mentioned,'' said Keith Christiansen, curator of Italian and French paintings at the Met. ''He's an artist we've wanted for a long time.'' 
 Although born in France, Valentin spent his entire career in Rome and died at just 41. So paintings by him are relatively rare.
 Like Ribera and Velazquez, he was inspired by Caravaggio. ''But Valentin took his style one step further,'' Mr. Christiansen said. ''Both artists painted directly from a posed model. However, Valentin captured more movement in his canvases.'' While most of his subjects were ordinary people playing cards or drinking or having their fortunes told, ''The Lute Player'' (from about 1626) is the only painting of a single figure playing a musical instrument. 
 In 1624 Valentin joined the society of northern artists living in Rome, where the members adopted nicknames. Valentin's was Amador, Spanish for lover boy. ''The painting may be emblematic of his nickname,'' Mr. Christiansen said. ''Indeed in the 17th and 18th century the painting is sometimes described as in Spanish costume. But we don't know who the sitter is.''
 The theme of the painting relates to two other famous canvases in the Met's collection, Watteau's commedia dell'arte figure ''Mezzetin'' and Manet's ''Spanish Guitar Player. ''It's not impossible that the two artists knew this picture and were inspired by it,'' Mr. Christiansen said.
 The Met purchased ''The Lute Player'' for an undisclosed price with the help of various funds and several individual donors. 
 The second acquisition, ''The Three O'Clock Sitting,'' a painting by Matisse executed in Nice, France, in 1924, is a gift from the family of Roderick H. Cushman, a commercial real estate investor from Mill Neck, N.Y. His mother, Cordelia Cushman, bought the painting in 1948 from the New York collector Stephen C. Clark. 
 It went on view this week in the museum's second-floor Lila Acheson Wallace Wing for modern art. And if the image looks familiar that may be because it was included in the exhibition ''Impressionist and Early Modern Paintings: The Clark Brothers Collect,'' at the Met last year. 
 ''After we requested it for the Clark show, the Cushmans called out of the blue and asked if we wanted a donation,'' said Gary Tinterow, chairman of the Met's department of 19th-century, modern and contemporary art. 
 Set in Matisse's third-floor apartment two blocks from the beach, it depicts a female artist seated at her easel painting an androgynous model. The artist is Henriette Darricarrere, his favorite model at the time. 
 ''The painting could almost be read as a commentary with twists on the artist's own studio pictures of the first decade of the 20th century,'' Mr. Tinterow said. ''In a reversal he shows his model as the artist, whereas in the past she was always the subject.'' 
 Although the Met already has several Matisses from this period, including the paintings ''Girl by a Window'' (1921) and ''The Goldfish Bowl'' (1921-22) as well as four odalisque paintings, this is its first multifigured studio interior. 
 CLEVELAND'S SMALL GEM
 Curators at the Cleveland Museum of Art have been shopping in London recently. Last week at Sotheby's they spent $91,262 for ''Mars, Minerva, Venus and Cupid,'' an early-16th-century rock crystal intaglio by Valerio Belli, the Italian gem engraver, goldsmith and medalist. ''We have great ancient cameos and an impressive collection of medals and plaquettes, but until now we had no example of Renaissance gem carving,'' said Jon L. Seydl, Cleveland's curator or European painting and sculpture. 
 The pendant, which measures 2.3 by 1.6 inches, depicts a man thought to be Mars with a bare breast and a helmet next to his foot. Opposite him are two goddesses, Minerva, who is in full armor, and Venus with her son Cupid, representing antithetical choices for Mars: wisdom and responsibility on one side and lust and pleasure on the other. 
 The museum also bought an alabaster sculpture of a virgin and child by the late-15th-century sculptor Gil de Siloe. ''These works are exceptionally rare,'' said Stephen Fleigel, Cleveland's curator of medieval art. So when he saw the sculpture in June at Sam Fogg, a London dealer, he urged the museum to buy it. (The price is undisclosed.) There are only four others in the United States, one in the Cloisters and three that are attributed to the workshop of Gil de Siloe in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. 
 ''It has been suggested that the face of this particular virgin resembles Isabella, Queen of Spain, who was the patron of Gil de Siloe,'' Mr. Fleigel said. ''It's not impossible, but we have no documentation to prove it.''

HEADLINE: Growing, and Gambling

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: SAKAI, Japan 

 BODY:
Despite the rapidly slowing economy, an army of cranes still moves busily above the archipelago of factories that Sharp is building in this gritty port. 
 The $10 billion complex, row upon row of hangar-size buildings, will produce up to 13 million flat-panel LCD televisions a year by 2010. 
 If consumer demand does not rebound by then -- and if prices for sets using liquid-crystal display do not stop falling -- industry analysts say the project could end up being little more than the world's most expensive industrial art installation. But the Japanese television maker calls it something else: one of the keys to its survival, particularly in hard times. 
 ''We need to take a longer-term view,'' said Nobuyuki Sugano, an executive at Sharp. ''If other companies slow down spending, we can stay ahead.'' 
 Across the globe, companies are battening down the hatches -- reducing spending, laying off workers and pulling back on apparent luxuries, like research and development and expansion. In the United States, many seemed to support letting the American automobile industry collapse under the weight of its own lethargy. 
 Of course, Japanese companies are also cutting back -- on Wednesday, Sony announced it would eliminate 8,000 jobs. But, armed with the lessons of their past, many Japanese companies are cutting back less than their competition, investing instead for the day the downturn ends, however long that takes to happen. 
 ''Unless our sales dry up completely, we have to continue investing,'' said Kumiko Makino, a spokeswoman for Sanyo Electric, which has refused to cut investment in new battery and solar panel factories. ''If we stop, our rivals and competitors will quickly catch up.''
 That urgency stems from the bitter lessons of the stagnant 1990s. Low on cash, Japanese companies cut back on new factories and development, only to lose ground to hungry Taiwanese and Korean competitors.
 While it is too early for numbers to be available, many economists and industry analysts say Japanese companies have so far maintained higher levels of investments in production, research and development than companies in other countries. 
 Instead of huge layoffs or cuts in operations, companies here are cutting part-time staff members. (Layoffs of full-time workers remain taboo.) Companies are also delaying or canceling fewer new factories than elsewhere. 
 One reason is that Japanese companies have war chests of cash built up during Japan's recovery earlier this decade. Another is that unlike in the United States, shareholders lack the power to demand that cash be paid out as dividends. Indeed, if Japan's powerful manufacturing sector has a secret to its success, it may be this willingness to reinvest a big share of profits back into new plants and research. 
 Japan's drive to build bigger, more advanced factories fueled an industrial construction boom that propelled the economic recovery earlier this decade. It also equipped the nation with the most advanced factory production lines to try to defend its technological lead over the rest of Asia. 
 Japanese innovation also helped keep American stores and showrooms stocked with ever cheaper and more sophisticated gadgets and vehicles.
 ''Japan sees its future as more dependent on capex than Americans or Europeans do,'' said Robert Feldman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in Japan, using the industry jargon for ''capital expenditure,'' investment in new factories and equipment.
 Innovation grew from necessity, too. Mr. Feldman noted that with Japan's shrinking population, companies are more likely to try to fill the gaps by investing more heavily in labor-saving machinery, like robots.
 To be sure, the global slowdown has hammered Japan's corporate profits and sent its $5 trillion economy, the world's largest after the United States, into recession. And economists say harder times lie ahead, with America's crucial Christmas shopping season looking to be one of the weakest in memory. 
 That has led to spending cuts. Toyota, which earlier this month predicted its first annual earnings decline in nine years, has said it will cut capital spending 5.4 percent this year. Blue-chip companies including Fujitsu and Canon have also announced cuts in capital expenditures.
 Meanwhile, Sony, which announced job cuts and that it was reducing its electronics investment by a third, has become the General Motors of Japan. Creator of the Walkman and PlayStation, the company lost its reputation as an innovator to competitors like Apple and Nintendo. At the same time, it is being challenged on price by rivals from China and South Korea for cheaper goods.
 Over all, government figures released last month reported that corporate spending on factories and other facilities fell 2 percent in the three months ending September from the previous quarter, for its third consecutive quarterly decline. The declines were a major factor in Japan's sliding into recession. 
 Tetsufumi Yamakawa, chief Japan economist at Goldman Sachs, estimates that such investment will shrink 1.8 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2009 before growing slowly.
 ''The pace of the slowdown in capex has been much sharper than we expected,'' Mr. Yamakawa said.
 Still, Mr. Yamakawa and other economists say they expect corporate Japan to keep outspending America on new factories, even during the current downturn. 
 Last year Japan spent 16 percent of its gross domestic product on new factories and production, Mr. Yamakawa said. While that is down from Japan's high-growth 1980s, when it spent closer to 25 percent, the figure is still high when compared with 11 percent by the United States, he said. 
 But Japan also knows all too well the dangers of overcapacity. A crucial cause of the deflation, chronic price declines, that racked Japan's economy in the 1990s was an oversupply of production capacity, which forced companies to keep cutting prices. Also, electronics industry analysts warn that if the global consumption keeps falling, even Japanese companies will eventually run out of cash.
 ''They can't keep this level of spending up forever,'' said Koya Tabata, an electronics analyst in Tokyo for Credit Suisse. But Mr. Tabata said that for now, corporate Japan continues to outspend Asian rivals, like Taiwan and South Korea. 
 Nowhere is that still formidable appetite for factory investment more apparent than along the shores of western Japan's Osaka Bay. This former rust-belt region has seen a boom in construction of large electronics and television plants, earning it the nickname Panel Bay. 
 Panasonic is building what it calls the world's largest plasma TV factory in Amagasaki, a $2.9 billion plant that will produce 12 million TVs a year when finished next year. Sanyo is also expanding two plants for lithium-ion batteries, the type used in laptops and cellphones. 
 Nor has the army of busy construction cranes missed a beat at the largest of the Panel Bay projects, Sharp's complex on the site of an abandoned steel furnace. Despite reducing its overall capital budget this year by 10 percent, to $3.2 billion, Sharp says it is not slowing construction of the complex, which will also make solar panels. Sharp expects global demand for flat-panel TVs and solar panels to remain firm even during the global downturn, as global consumers replace their old tube TVs and embrace renewable energy. 
 When opened, the complex is expected to employ 10,000 people and add $11 billion a year in new economic activity. But there are growing fears in the city of Sakai itself that the complex could go the way of the steel furnace that preceded it. Many here are afraid the current economic downturn might end thecity's brief revival before the plant even opens. 
 ''Sharp tells us not to worry, so we remain hopeful,'' said Takayuki Kanemoto, manager of Sakai city hall's investment promotion division. ''But we can't even tell anymore what will happen next week, much less in two years.''

HEADLINE: Hope for a Racist, and Maybe a Country

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
Twice in the last decade, just as the holiday movie season has begun to sag under the weight of its own bloat, full of noise and nonsense signifying nothing, Clint Eastwood has slipped another film into theaters and shown everyone how it's done. This year's model is ''Gran Torino,'' a sleek, muscle car of a movie Made in the U.S.A., in that industrial graveyard called Detroit. I'm not sure how he does it, but I don't want him to stop. Not because every film is great -- though, damn, many are -- but because even the misfires show an urgent engagement with the tougher, messier, bigger questions of American life. 
 Few Americans make movies about this country anymore, other than Mr. Eastwood, a man whose vitality as an artist shows no signs of waning, even in a nominally modest effort like ''Gran Torino.'' Part of this may be generational: Mr. Eastwood started as an actor in the old studio system, back when the major movie companies were still in the business of American life rather than just international properties. Hollywood made movies for export then, of course, but part of what it exported was an idea of America as a democratic ideal, an idea of greatness which, however blinkered and false and occasionally freighted with pessimism, was persuasive simply because Gene Kelly and John Wayne were persuasive. 
 While it's easy to understand why the last eight years (or the last 50) have made it difficult to sell that idea to the world or even the country, it's dispiriting that so many movies are disconnected from everyday experience, from economic worries to race. Pauline Kael used to beat up on Stanley Kramer, the director of earnest middlebrow entertainments like ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' but at least these movies had a connection to real life or an idea about it. Ms. Kael also famously branded Don Siegel's ''Dirty Harry'' as ''deeply immoral,'' even fascistic, but the film became a classic because of its ambiguous engagement with American violence and masculinity. Mr. Eastwood and a .44 Magnum did their bit too. 
 Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in ''Gran Torino,'' not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind, adjectives that Mr. Eastwood, in his performance as Walt Kowalski, expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls. A former auto worker at Ford, Walt has just put his longtime wife in the ground when the story opens. From his scowl, it looks as if he would like to join her.
 Instead he sits on his front porch chugging can after can of cheap beer in the company of his yellow Labrador, Daisy, watching the world at a safe distance with a squint and a stream of bitter commentary. Kept at bay, the remaining members of his family -- including two sons with big houses, big cars, big waistlines -- have no choice but to let him stew alone. Yet the rest of the world refuses to leave Walt be, despite his best efforts and grimace. The world first creeps into his peripheral vision, where a family of Hmong immigrants live in the rundown house next door; and then, through a series of unfortunate events, some artful and others creaking with scripted contrivance, it stages a life-altering home invasion.
 Written by a newcomer, Nick Schenk, the story eases into gear with an act of desperation.Under violent threat from some Hmong gangbangers, the next-door neighbor's teenage son, Thao (Bee Vang), tries and fails to steal Walt's cherry 1972 Gran Torino, and in the bargain nearly loses his life to its angry, armed owner. Thao's family, led by his mouthy, friendly sister, Sue (a very good Ahney Her), forces the teenager to do penance by working for Walt, an arrangement that pleases neither the man nor the boy. No one seems a more unlikely (or reluctant) father surrogate than Walt, a foulmouthed bigot with an unprintable epithet for every imaginable racial and ethnic group. Growling -- often literally, ''Grr, grr'' -- he resists the family's overtures like a man under siege, walled in by years of suspicion, prejudice and habit.
 Walt assumes his protector role gradually, a transformation that at first plays in an often broadly comic key. Mr. Eastwood's loose, at times very funny performance in the early part of the film is one of its great pleasures. While some of this enjoyment can be likened to spending time with an old friend, Mr. Eastwood is also an adept director of his own performances and, perhaps more important, a canny manipulator of his own iconographic presence. He knows that when we're looking at him, we're also seeing Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name and all his other outlaws and avenging angels who have roamed across the screen for the last half-century. All these are embedded in his every furrow and gesture. 
 These spectral figures, totems of masculinity and mementos from a heroic cinematic age, are what make this unassuming film -- small in scale if not in the scope of its ideas -- more than just a vendetta flick or an entertainment about a crazy coot and the exotic strangers next door. As the story unfolds and the gangbangers return and Walt reaches for his gun, the film moves from comedy into drama and then tragedy and then into something completely unexpected. We've seen this western before, though not quite. Because this isn't John Wayne near the end of the 20th century, but Clint Eastwood at the start of the still-new 21st, remaking the image of the hero for one more and perhaps final time, one generation of Americans making way for the next.
 That probably sounds heavier than I mean, but ''Gran Torino'' doesn't go down lightly. Despite all the jokes -- the scenes of Walt lighting up at female flattery and scrambling for Hmong delicacies -- the film has the feel of a requiem. Melancholy is etched in every long shot of Detroit's decimated, emptied streets and in the faces of those who remain to still walk in them. Made in the 1960s and '70s, the Gran Torino was never a great symbol of American automotive might, which makes Walt's love for the car more poignant. It was made by an industry that now barely makes cars, in a city that hardly works, in a country that too often has felt recently as if it can't do anything right anymore except, every so often, make a movie like this one. 
 ''Gran Torino'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has some exceedingly foul language, a great many racist slurs and bloody violence.

HEADLINE: The Simple Life

BYLINE: By SHIVANI VORA

 BODY:
IT began at 4:30 on a Saturday morning. 
 The three dozen participants started out with two half-hour Buddhist meditation sessions before dawn. They then spent the next two hours doing what's called work practice, which consisted of scrubbing toilets and raking leaves, all in silence. An afternoon of instruction on the essentials of Buddhism led to more meditation, cleaning the dinner dishes, and sleeping in dorm-style accommodations. Sunday was an abbreviated version of the day before. 
 Perhaps what was the most unusual aspect of this austere weekend at Zen Mountain Monastery in Mount Tremper, N.Y., was that many of the attendees were not adherents of Eastern religious practices, but were part of an increasing number of nonbelievers who are seeking stress-free, spiritual and often inexpensive weekend breaks at local ashrams (isolated communities formed around a guru who follows Hindu philosophy) and Buddhist monasteries (residences for monks). 
 Philipp Malkmus, a 30-year-old consultant for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the rigorous agenda at Zen Mountain Monastery over the Halloween weekend actually left him refreshed. ''It wasn't fun in the traditional sense, but it was the opposite of my life in New York City and a return to a very uncomplicated way of living,'' he said. ''It gave me the rest and relaxation I was looking for.'' 
 Zen Mountain is just one example of an ashram or monastery in upstate New York that promises to recharge the mind and spirit of its guests with a combination of simplicity and meditation, served up on a tight schedule. At least half a dozen of these spiritual retreats are tucked away among the Catskill Mountains. 
 Most have been around for several decades, but until recently their visitors were mainly practicing Buddhists, serious yoga students or devotees of an ashram's guru. Today, these spots are attracting clientele from the surrounding metropolitan areas who've had limited interaction with Eastern religions, yoga or a spiritual guru. Like Mr. Malkmus, who spent several months before his trip clocking 60-hour workweeks, more nonbelievers are coming to experience the rigors of an ashram or monastery as a way to escape.
 At Vivekananda Retreat, Ridgely, an ashram in Stone Ridge founded in 1997 on the principles of Swami Vivekananda, for example, Pravrajika Gitaprana, the minister in residence, estimated that half of the roughly 100 guests the ashram sees every year aren't followers of the swami. Five years ago, she said, almost all were.
 Jennifer Schmid, the marketing director for Ananda Ashram in Monroe, said that many of the guests in the past few years had no knowledge of the ashram's guru, Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati, before visiting. ''It used to be that most of the people coming to stay here had read our guru's writings or had studied with him,'' she said. ''Today, people are realizing that we're a place they come to for refuge. They don't necessarily know anything about our guru or know that we even have a guru.''
 Mr. Malkmus had no prior knowledge of Buddhism or meditation before his stay at Zen Mountain. He discovered the monastery when he was searching the Internet for a weekend getaway in the Catskills. He chose to stay there, he said, because it represented the antithesis of his life of technology overdrive and constant action. ''I've done lots of local trips to places like Fire Island and the Jersey Shore,'' he said. ''The scenery changes, but the vibe doesn't. This has a back-to-the-basics approach that's unlike anything I've ever done.''
 It's the spartan living style and firm scheduling at these retreats that make them increasingly popular as an alternative vacation option. Harried urbanites can spend whole days without making a decision or facing a crisis, without trying to find a cab in the rain or worrying about a client. The activities are predetermined and tightly scheduled: meditation, chanting religious verses, doing chores around the property and silent self-contemplation. 
 The retreats' accessibility to several metropolitan areas and their affordability also enhance their appeal at a time when the economy is weak. 
 Ms. Schmid said that Ananda Ashram has been booked to its capacity of 50 guests nearly weekend, even in the winter, for the past two years. It is a marked change from when the ashram was not even half full during colder months. And the Introduction to Zen program that Mr. Malkmus participated in at Zen Mountain currently attracts 35 to 40 guests most weekends, up 25 percent from 10 years ago, said Ryushin Osho, a resident monk.
 It's generally stress -- whether personal or job related -- that drives guests to choose one of these spiritual getaways, according to surveyed clientele and the staff at ashrams and monasteries. Melissa Poller spent a weekend at the Dai Bosatsu Zendo monastery in Livingston Manor last May in an effort to ease her incessant worrying about her job in technology services. Its routine is similar to Zen Mountain's, but with communication limited to only essential talking during much of the retreat, since activities such as eating and chores are viewed as a form of meditation. Ms. Poller said it was mentally and physically challenging to sit still and not talk for such long periods but that she felt free from stress for the first time in several months. ''You push yourself to a limit,'' said Ms. Poller, a 30-year-old Brooklyn resident, ''but the experience gave me a lot of clarity and peace and helped me cope with my constant anxiety.'' 
 Stays at monasteries such as Dai Bosatsu tend to be stricter than those at ashrams. At Sivananda Ashram Yoga Ranch, a picturesque 77-acre spot surrounded by woods in Woodbourne, for example, days begin at 6 a.m. with meditation and chanting, a two-hour yoga class and an hour of chores around the property. In the afternoons, ashram residents or outside speakers usually present workshops on topics such as ''The Essentials of Yoga'' and conduct question-and-answer sessions on meditation. But guests also have free time each day to go on staff-guided nature walks or relax in a 12-person wood-burning Russian sauna.
 Grace Lee, a 32-year-old from New York City working in pharmaceutical research, stayed at Sivananda in October when a breakup with her long-term boyfriend, on top of an already stressful three-hour commute to and from work every day, began to affect her mental and physical health. ''I was tense and fatigued all the time,'' she said, ''and the massages I was getting at fancy spas were doing nothing for the knots in my neck.''
 Ms. Lee remembered the handful of yoga classes she had taken at various gyms as being relaxing and thought a few days of intense practice might be her ticket to unwinding. She came across Sivananda while researching yoga vacations, and though she's an avid globetrotter who has visited 32 countries, she said that the ashram's proximity to home was a deciding factor. ''It's stressful to go to the airport and worry about lost luggage and the other negatives of flying,'' she said. ''This is close to home, but it feels so far away and gives you the feeling that you've really disconnected from everything.'' 
 The days are lush with spiritual offerings, but the accommodations at Sivananda and other such sites are in line with the most barebones European youth hostel. At Ananda Ashram, for instance, housing is either dorm-style, single-sex quarters that sleep four to six or semi-private rooms with two single beds. Bathrooms are shared. 
 What they lack in deluxe lodgings, however, ashrams and monasteries more than make up in meals, which can rival those at an upscale spa. They're almost always buffet style vegetarian affairs and incorporate locally grown produce and organic products. On a recent Wednesday afternoon at Ananda's high school-like dining hall, lunch featured six varieties of breads, including spelt and sprouted, roasted herbed potatoes, a vegan tomato bisque, orzo salad, pineapple-and-vegetable stir-fry, lemon bars, and apples and pears from a nearby farm. Nearly everything is made from scratch, including the ketchup, salad dressings and even tempeh. 
 Stays at ashrams and monasteries are all-inclusive and usually include accommodations, activities and three meals a day. Prices are as low as $60 a night for dorm-style rooms. Ms. Poller said the $200 cost for her weekend trip to Dai Bosatsu made the decision to go that much easier. ''In the current economy, I worry about money,'' she said. ''I'm trying to find ways to go away without spending so much money, and this is really inexpensive.'' 
 Although they're in vacation settings, the residents emphasize, these are not hotels for travelers looking for a cheap place to stay for a few nights. Pravrajika Gitaprana said anyone making a reservation at Vivekananda Retreat was told that participation in the meditation sessions and classes was encouraged. And Jokei Kyodo, a resident at Dai Bosatsu, said the monastery is not a resort for guests looking to put their feet up. ''I had a lady who called me recently and said she had a few extra vacation days she needed to use up,'' she said. ''We want people to come here and make a commitment to our Zen practice, which isn't exactly comfortable.''
 And while all the monasteries and ashrams surveyed said they weren't attempting to convert guests to any particular religion or guru and only wanted to provide spiritual solace, many guests find the getaways alluring enough to make a second trip. Ian Reclusado, a 28-year-old project manager in account sales from Brooklyn, stayed at Zen Monastery over a weekend in October and intends to go back for an intense weeklong session that involves 10 hours of meditation a day, and both Ms. Poller and Ms. Lee found their visits to Dai Bosatsu and Sivananda so beneficial that they've already returned for more stays.
 Still, some say one visit is sufficient to give them what they were searching for. ''It's not like I'm a die-hard Buddhist after this,'' said Mr. Malkmus of his weekend at Zen Mountain. ''I wanted to get away from the permanent noise in New York City and get a break, and that's exactly what I got.''

HEADLINE: At the Last Subway Stop, a New Exit Strategy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
It's not the cry of the dodo bird, but it's about to vanish forever, and it goes something like this: ''Passengers, you must be in the first five cars in order to exit at South Ferry.''
 It is the cry of the No. 1 subway train conductor. Hundreds of times a day for decades -- sometimes garbled, sometimes virtually inaudible, sometimes ringingly clear -- it has serenaded downtown-bound straphangers as they approached the line's terminus at the tip of Manhattan: the anachronistic, 103-year-old South Ferry station, where the truncated and sharply curved platform has room for only half the cars on the train. 
 But one day next month, the last cry will die upon a conductor's lips as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority opens a new South Ferry station directly beneath the old one, a $530 million project largely paid for with money supplied by the federal government for the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan following the Sept. 11 terror attack. 
 The new station will be spiffy and a bit sterile (a tour for reporters on Thursday evoked comparisons to a new hospital wing). It has thousands of white tiles, two sets of tracks, two elevators, seven escalators and 96 security cameras. But best of all, it has full-length platforms. 
 That will eliminate the confusion that accompanies the rush to the front of the train, and it will cut travel time for riders, because trains will no longer have to slow down to negotiate the old station's hairpin turn. It will also mean no more unplanned trips back uptown for stragglers or inattentive riders. 
 All the same, when the new station opens next month (officials have yet to set a date), another piece of old New York will go extinct. 
 South Ferry is a relic. It opened in the second year of subway service, 1905, as tracks were extended south from City Hall, the previous southern terminus. At that time, local trains ran with four cars and express trains had seven cars, according to Robert A. Olmsted, a subway historian. But in the 1940s and 1950s, most stations were enlarged so that they could accommodate 10-car trains. 
 That never happened at South Ferry, which was built as a loop so that trains could turn around and head back uptown. The loop presents problems of its own. Because the turn is so sharp, the center of each car is far from the platform edge, necessitating retractable platform extensions. And the tight turning radius causes the wheels to squeal, creating quite a din. 
 Today, as No. 1 trains head south into Lower Manhattan, conductors start to make announcements telling passengers that if they want to get off the train at South Ferry, which is the last stop, they must be in one of the first five cars. Some conductors are even kind enough to tell passengers that those are the cars in front of the conductor's position. 
 The announcements become more adamant as trains reach Rector Street, the last station before South Ferry. That often occasions a mad dash as surprised passengers pour out of the rear cars and rush forward.
 But many passengers who do not hear or understand the announcements wind up stuck in the rear cars, watching in exasperation as the train stops and the doors do not open. Their confusion and frustration mount as the train pulls around the loop and heads back uptown. Many are tourists or immigrants who do not speak English, but some are regular riders absorbed in a book or simply not familiar with the station.
 ''That is horrible!'' said David Devera, 40, who was stuck in one of the rear cars on Thursday morning as he watched the station slide by from behind on the other side of the closed car door. Mr. Devera and a friend, Mike Schevitz, 42, unemployed former Bear Stearns workers, were in Lower Manhattan for a job fair. They are from New Jersey. On this particular train, the public address system was faulty and the conductor's announcements had come across as little more than a whisper.
 ''I didn't hear anything,'' Mr. Schevitz said as the train swung around and headed north. ''Did you hear anything?'' The two men got out at Rector Street and walked back downtown. 
 Joe Gilmore has been a conductor on the No. 1 train for 18 years. Asked how many times he has told riders to move to the front of the train, he thought for a bit.
 ''Three trips a day, five days a week, minus vacation,'' he said. ''I don't know. A lot.''
 He said he makes the announcement repeatedly at Chambers Street and Rector Street and sometimes goes into the sixth or seventh car to tell passengers to move up. ''You get tired of saying it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Procter & Gamble Says It Will Meet Its Forecast

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Procter & Gamble said on Thursday that it was on track to meet its earnings forecasts in the current quarter and fiscal year, but that sales would be weaker than expected this quarter because of the recession. 
The company also said it might get out of the pharmaceutical business as it focuses on products like toothpaste and feminine care items.
While other industries like auto and apparel retailers felt a big hit from consumers cutting back during the recession, ''the picture isn't nearly as bleak in fast-moving consumer goods,'' the chief executive, A. G. Lafley, told analysts at a meeting in New York.
The company, which is based in Cincinnati, said commodity costs would still rise, but not as much as it had thought a few weeks ago. However, it expects the stronger dollar to hurt sales more than previously expected.

HEADLINE: Title, but Unclear Power, For a New Climate Czar

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Charlie Savage contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Much remains unknown, and perhaps undecided, about Carol M. Browner's new position as White House coordinator of energy and climate policy.
 How much real authority will Ms. Browner wield? Will her office have the same bureaucratic clout -- the ability to knock heads together at other agencies -- as the National Security Council and the National Economic Council? Will she be able to hold her own against the two powerhouses that will lead those established councils, James L. Jones, a retired Marine general, and Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary? Will she outrank the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council? Will she have office space in the West Wing? How big will her staff be?
 But this much is known. Ms. Browner's thinking on climate change, environmental regulation, energy conservation and new technology are very much in line with those of President-elect Barack Obama and the other members of his environmental team. Ms. Browner, who has close ties to Mr. Obama's transition chief, John D. Podesta, started laying the groundwork for the handover with him back in August. 
 Aides said Wednesday that Mr. Obama intended in the next few days to announce the nominations of Ms. Browner, Steven Chu as secretary of energy, Lisa P. Jackson as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and Nancy Sutley as head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. But the scope of Ms. Browner's job remains under discussion, the aides said.
 Her views and government record are well known.
 Long an acolyte of Al Gore, she has called climate change ''the greatest challenge ever faced'' and echoed Mr. Obama's call for a cap-and-trade system to control carbon dioxide emissions. Before leaving office in 2001, she set out to give the E.P.A. authority to regulate the carbon emissions that cause climate change, a power the Bush administration subsequently refused to use despite a Supreme Court ruling endorsing it. She supports California's ambitious global warming law, which will force automakers to cut tailpipe emissions deeper and faster than current federal law.
 After leaving the Clinton administration, Ms. Browner became a founding partner at the Albright Group, an international consulting firm. It has helped Coca-Cola and Merck with foreign operations, but a spokeswoman for the firm declined to identify other clients.
 Ms. Browner's work with the Albright Group attracted attention in early 2006, during the controversy over a Dubai firm's takeover of a company that operated several American seaports. In February 2006, Ms. Browner and a lobbyist for the Dubai company met with the staff of Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a vocal opponent of the deal. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Schumer told a reporter at the time that the visitors had been ''unpersuasive.'' Neither Ms. Browner nor the Albright Group registered to lobby Congress about the deal. The firm's spokeswoman said Thursday that the meeting ''was for informational purposes only'' and that ''the Albright Group does not lobby.''
 Ms. Browner also sits on the board of APX, which specializes in handling cap-and-trade emission credits, as well as several environment groups. 
 Her most notable accomplishment in the Clinton years came when she pushed through tough air quality rules over intense opposition from industry groups and from some in the administration who viewed them as too costly. But even as she pressed ahead, her favorite slogan was ''common sense.'' How far she will be able to go in pursuit of vastly more comprehensive and costly energy-conservation goals remains to be seen.
 The transition team is still trying to draw the increasingly complex White House organization chart, with a proliferation of top-rank positions with as-yet-undefined roles. On Thursday, Mr. Obama designated former Senator Tom Daschle as not only his secretary of health and human services but also the White House ''health czar.'' Ms. Browner is informally known within the transition and in the environmental community as the ''climate czarina,'' a title that conceals as much as it reveals.
 She showed her bureaucratic muscle in one of the critical environmental battles of the Clinton era, the drive to write tough rules for permissible levels of ozone and fine particles of air pollution. The rules, drafted at Ms. Browner's E.P.A., set strict standards that industry groups and scores of members of Congress said would be too costly to meet.
 Mr. Gore, then the vice president, was Ms. Browner's top ally in the administration, but the president's economic advisers and Office of Management and Budget officials were wary of the supposed economic and political costs of the new regulations.
 Ms. Browner stood her ground and eventually persuaded President Bill Clinton to support her. The rules went into effect and survived determined challenges in the courts and in Congress. In navigating that maze, Ms. Browner stepped on many toes, and she remains unpopular with assorted industry groups and conservatives in Congress.

HEADLINE: The Ambassador's Report

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
Your Excellency,
 Your humble ambassador requests the honor of your time so that he may apprise you of the mood and conditions in Washington. Seeking nothing for himself, but only seeking to serve your most Serene Majesty, your ambassador has been working tirelessly to understand the spirit of the American capital.
 Your ambassador discerns three emotions. At the most obvious level, the U.S. capital is enjoying a season of rebirth. Sixty-seven percent to 75 percent of Americans have positive feelings toward Barack Obama and his transition. Perhaps up to four million people will attend the inauguration, possibly filling the entire space between the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial. 
 Washingtonians do not speak of this as a political transition. They speak of the inaugural as a cultural, psychological and historic event. It seems to have become, in their minds, like an ancient tribal rite -- the purging of sin, the elevation of the pure, the moral regeneration of the nation's soul. It would not surprise your ambassador if the Americans were to throw a sacrificial goat into a volcano as part of the primal offerings.
 Second, there is a feeling of audacity sweeping the ruling circles. America's rulers have widened their eyes, enlarged their perspectives. 
 For example, zeros have lost their meanings. The amount of consideration once devoted to a proposal costing $3 billion is now devoted to a proposal costing $300 billion. Americans have entered the age of budgetary infinity.
 Once a $100 billion stimulus package was large, but now the stimulus proposals have passed through $300 billion to $500 billion on their way to infinity. Some Americans believe the automakers should be bailed out even without the reforms proposed by Senator Bob Corker. But without those reforms, which were shot down in the Senate Thursday night, the bailouts would go on and on into infinity.
 Once, Americans considered health care and energy reform to be gigantic undertakings. Now President-elect Obama describes these initiatives as mere subplots in his economic rescue effort. Your humble ambassador has heard analysts casually tick off the elements of the Obama plan: enact the largest infrastructure project in 50 years, initiate the broadest tax cut in history, reorganize 14 percent of the American economy, replace the carbon-based economy with a renewable-energy economy, restructure the auto industry, perhaps even rescue the Detroit Lions.
 Democrats also talk about passing a stimulus plan on Day One. That is, they seek to pass a piece of legislation perhaps equal to half the federal budget without a single hearing or a second of floor debate. Your humble ambassador has not seen the Americans in such a fit of transformational zeal since the run-up to the Iraq war.
 Something has been revealed about the psychology of the nation's capital. When investors in New York become gripped by fear, they pull inward. When Washingtonians are gripped by fear, they rush outward, with bigger and more daring plans. The risk tolerance in the financial world has shrunk to zero, but the risk tolerance in the political world has risen to infinity. 
 Once America was a decentralized country, but now all roads lead to Washington. Mighty C.E.O.'s abase themselves before junior House members. Governors and mayors come groveling. The status of the lowliest bureaucrat has risen delightfully, and there is a feeling of overflowing abundance amid the national scarcity as Washington spends the trillions it doesn't have. Such is the local boom that your humble ambassador can drive from his residence, and in a few minutes he can count 10 McMansions under construction. 
 And this leads, sad to say, to the third layer of emotion: anxiety. Many of those swept up in the excitement of this historical moment also have the nagging sensation that perhaps the laws of gravity, economics and history have not been repealed. Perhaps Mr. Obama's talents, while great, are not as great as his self-confidence. Perhaps the New Deal paradigm everybody is applying doesn't actually fit the circumstances. Certainly something big needs to be done to calm this crisis, but perhaps in the doing, some unholiness is being unwittingly and rashly created.
 Why is it, some ask, that America is so slavishly following the same failed route earlier taken by the Japanese -- from bank capitalization, to industrial bailouts to infrastructure spending? Why is it that the pork-meisters in Congress are already distorting the best-laid stimulus plans? Why are there so few saying ''no'' to any budget request? Why do so many of the plans being offered rely upon a Magic Technocrat -- an all-knowing Car Czar who can reorganize Detroit, an all-seeing team of Olympians who decide which medicines doctors will be allowed to prescribe? 
 The wisest Americans are throwing piles of money around, while looking nervously for signs of fiscal ruin. Your humble ambassador will remain your eyes and ears, and will scoop up any stray billions he finds lying around.

HEADLINE: Health Care Policy Is in Hands of an Ex-Senator

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In selecting Tom Daschle to be his health and human services secretary, President-elect Barack Obama said Thursday that he wanted Mr. Daschle, a former South Dakota senator, to pursue something that had eluded federal officials for decades: securing ''affordable, accessible health care for every single American.''
 Whether Mr. Daschle, a former Senate majority leader, can succeed where others failed is unclear.
 ''Year after year,'' Mr. Obama said, ''our leaders offer up detailed health care plans with great fanfare and promise, only to see them fail, derailed by Washington politics and influence peddling.'' 
 Even Mr. Daschle, who will also be director of a new White House Office of Health Reform, acknowledges that the task will be difficult. In a recent book, he portrays the health care industry as a collection of ''special interests'' and predicts they will wage ''all-out war to defeat reform.'' 
 Mr. Obama said Mr. Daschle, as head of the new office, would be the ''lead architect'' of proposals to expand coverage and rein in health costs.
 Jeanne M. Lambrew, a former aide to President Bill Clinton, will be deputy director of the office.
 Mr. Daschle is well versed in health policy and Senate procedure. But two of his ideas could reignite the kind of ideological warfare that sidetracked health care proposals in the past.
 He wants to establish a Federal Health Board, a powerful independent entity modeled on the Federal Reserve, to decide which drugs, devices and treatments are covered by federal health programs. And he says the federal government should offer its own health insurance plan, to compete directly with private plans, a proposal that alarms many insurers and Republican members of Congress.
 By giving Mr. Daschle double duty, Mr. Obama hopes to avoid a problem that contributed to the collapse of Mr. Clinton's campaign for universal coverage in 1993-94. Donna E. Shalala, who was then health and human services secretary, and the experts in her department often had to take a back seat to Ira C. Magaziner, the health policy coordinator at the White House.
 Mr. Obama said 45 million people had no health insurance and were struggling to pay ''the runaway cost of health care.''
 A major health care initiative ''has to be intimately woven into our overall economic recovery plan,'' Mr. Obama said, adding: ''It's not something that we can put off because we are in an emergency. This is part of the emergency.''
 Mr. Daschle echoed that sense of urgency. ''Our growing costs are unsustainable,'' he said, ''and the plight of the uninsured is unconscionable.''
 With a larger majority in Congress, Democrats are increasingly optimistic that they can realize their dream of affordable health care for all next year.
 Mr. Daschle brings a kind of moral passion to the campaign for more coverage. Health care, he says, is rationed on ''the worst possible criteria: one's ability to pay or one's health condition.''
 Mr. Daschle said his proposal to establish a Federal Health Board could ''reduce or deny payment for new drugs and procedures that aren't as effective as current ones.''
 He predicts that such decisions will ''rankle powerful interest groups, such as drug manufacturers.'' And he is right. Critics say the board would be picking winners and losers among makers of drugs and medical devices.
 David H. Nexon, senior executive vice president of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group for makers of medical devices, said that research comparing treatments could help doctors and patients make better decisions.
 But, he said, ''The medical device industry, life science companies and patient groups would have a real problem with a centralized decision-making operation that denied people access to safe, effective treatments or imposed a cost-effectiveness standard on therapies that would be covered by Medicare or other forms of insurance.''
 Mr. Daschle himself writes that ''doctors and patients might resent any encroachment on their ability to choose certain treatments, even if they are expensive or ineffective compared to the alternatives.''
 Board members would be chosen by the president, subject to Senate confirmation, but would be largely ''insulated from political pressure,'' Mr. Daschle said.
 The board could have a ''spillover effect'' in the private sector, Mr. Daschle said. Private insurers already follow many of Medicare's coverage decisions. He said Congress could go further and link tax breaks for private insurance to compliance with the board's recommendations -- giving the government far more influence than it now has.
 Mr. Obama said the idea of a Federal Health Board ''holds great promise'' for bridging ideological divisions.
 In his book ''Critical,'' Mr. Daschle said that people without job-based insurance should be able to enroll in any of the health plans offered to federal employees, or in a new ''government-run insurance program modeled after Medicare.''
 Democrats said that private insurers would hold down costs and improve care if they had to compete with a public plan. 
 But Republicans said a government plan would have unfair advantages and could drive private insurers from the market.
 Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, a trade group, said, ''The prospects for health care reform are as good as they've been in decades.'' 
 Hospital executives worry that hospitals would be underpaid by the new public plan, just as they say they are underpaid by Medicaid and Medicare. Many doctors decline to take Medicaid patients, saying payments are too low.
 R. Alexander Vachon III, a health policy consultant for several Wall Street firms, said: ''The probability that Congress will pass a major expansion of health insurance coverage next year is less than 40 percent. There's lots of enthusiasm, but Democrats have been trying to do this for 74 years and have not succeeded.''
 But Democrats point out that Mr. Obama will have strong allies on Capitol Hill, including three committee chairmen, Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Max Baucus of Montana and Representative Henry A. Waxman of California.
 Mr. Daschle, who turned 61 this week, was elected to the House from South Dakota at 30; he ousted a Republican senator eight years later. He was in the Senate for 18 years -- 10 as Democratic leader -- before he was defeated in 2004 by a Republican who said Mr. Daschle had become a creature of Washington.
 Since then, he has worked as an adviser at a Washington law and lobbying firm, pursued his interest in health policy, stayed active in Democratic politics and kept an office at a liberal research and policy institute, the Center for American Progress. 
 Even though he was not a registered lobbyist, Mr. Daschle advised many health care companies and other corporations for which his firm lobbied.
 Some consumer groups said the choice of Mr. Daschle appeared to violate the spirit of Mr. Obama's promise to minimize the role of special interests.
 ''It appears that Daschle will have many potential conflicts of interest and will have to recuse himself on a significant number of matters affecting health care and pharmaceutical companies,'' said David Arkush, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch, a consumer group.
 Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Obama transition team, said Mr. Daschle had ''recused himself from participating in any health care matters being handled by his firm,'' Alston & Bird. If confirmed, she said, he will not have any contact with the firm for two years.

WHAT'S PLAN B?
We were distressed by reports late Thursday night that Senate Republicans were close to scuttling a rescue plan for the ailing automakers.

HEADLINE: SENATE ABANDONS AUTO BAILOUT BID AFTER G.O.P. BALKS

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit and Carl Hulse from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate on Thursday night abandoned efforts to fashion a government rescue of the American automobile industry, as Senate Republicans refused to support a bill endorsed by the White House and Congressional Democrats. 
 The failure to reach agreement on Capitol Hill raised a specter of financial collapse for General Motors and Chrysler, which say they may not be able to survive through this month.
 After Senate Republicans balked at supporting a $14 billion auto rescue plan approved by the House on Wednesday, negotiators worked late into Thursday evening to broker a deal, but deadlocked over Republican demands for steep cuts in pay and benefits by the United Automobile Workers union in 2009. 
 The failure in Congress to provide a financial lifeline for G.M. and Chrysler was a bruising defeat for President Bush in the waning weeks of his term, and also for President-elect Barack Obama, who earlier on Thursday urged Congress to act to avoid a further loss of jobs in an already deeply debilitated economy. 
 ''It's over with,'' the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said on the Senate floor, after it was clear that a deal could not be reached. ''I dread looking at Wall Street tomorrow. It's not going to be a pleasant sight.'' 
 Mr. Reid added: ''This is going to be a very, very bad Christmas for a lot of people as a result of what takes place here tonight.'' 
 The Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said: ''We have had before us this whole question of the viability of the American automobile manufacturers. None of us want to see them go down, but very few of us had anything to do with the dilemma that they have created for themselves.'' 
 Mr. McConnell added: ''The administration negotiated in good faith with the Democratic majority a proposal that was simply unacceptable to the vast majority of our side because we thought it frankly wouldn't work.'' 
 Moments later, the Senate failed to win the 60 votes need to bring up the auto rescue plan for consideration. The Senate voted 52 to 35 with 10 Republicans joining 40 Democrats and 2 independents in favor. The White House issued said it would consider alternatives but offered no assurances. 
 ''It's disappointing that Congress failed to act tonight,'' Tony Fratto, the deputy press secretary, said. ''We think the legislation we negotiated provided an opportunity to use funds already appropriated for automakers, and presented the best chance to avoid a disorderly bankruptcy while ensuring taxpayer funds only go to firms whose stakeholders were prepared to make difficult decisions to become viable. We will evaluate our options in light of the breakdown in Congress.'' 
 Immediately after the vote, the administration was already coming under pressure to act on its own to prop up G.M. and Chrysler, an idea that administration officials have resisted for weeks. 
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers called on the administration to use the Treasury's bigger financial system stabilization fund to but there may not be enough money left to do so. About $15 billion remains of the initial $350 billion disbursed by Congress and Treasury officials have said that money is needed as a backstop for existing programs. 
 Democrats also immediately sought to blame Republicans for the failure to aid Detroit, while a number of Republicans quickly blamed the union. But on all sides the usual zest for political jousting seemed absent given the grim economic outlook. 
 ''Senate Republicans' refusal to support the bipartisan legislation passed by the House and negotiated in good faith with the White House, the Senate and the automakers is irresponsible, especially at a time of economic hardship,'' Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. 
 She added: ''The consequences of the Senate Republican' failure to act could be devastating to our economy, detrimental to workers, and destructive to the American automobile industry unless the President immediately directs Secretary Paulson to explore other short-term financial assistance options. Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, and a supporter of the auto rescue efforts, said: ''I think it might be time for the president to step in.'' 
 So far, the Federal Reserve also has shown no willingness to step in to aid the auto industry, but Democrats have argued that it has the authority to do so and some said the central bank may have no choice but to prevent the automakers from bankruptcy proceedings that could have ruinous ripple effects. 
 G.M. and Chrysler issued statements expressing disappointment. G.M. said: We will assess all of our options to continue our restructuring and to obtain the means to weather the current economic crisis.'' Chrysler said it would: ''continue to pursue a workable solution to help ensure the future viability of the company.'' 
 Earlier in the day, G.M. confirmed that it had legal advisors -- including Harvey R. Miller of the firm Weil Gotshal & Manges --to consider a possible bankruptcy, which the company until now has said would be cataclysmic not just for G.M. but for Chrysler and Ford as well. The rescue plan approved by the House on Wednesday by a vote of 237 to 170 would have extended $14 billion in loans to the troubled automakers and required them to submit to broad government oversight directed by a car czar to be named by Mr. Bush.
 But even before the House vote, Senate Republicans voiced strong opposition to the plan, which was negotiated by Democrats and the White House. At a luncheon with White House chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, they rebuffed his entreaties for support. 
 On Thursday morning, Mr. McConnell dealt a death blow to the House-passed bill, giving a speech on the Senate floor in which he said that Republican senators would not support it largely because it was not tough enough. 
 ''In the end it's greatest single flaw is that it promises taxpayer money today for reforms that may or may not come tomorrow,'' Mr. McConnell said. 
 Mr. McConnell, however, held out slim hope for a compromise suggesting that Republicans could rally around a set of proposals by Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who said that the bill did not set stiff enough requirements for the automakers. 
 Mr. Obama, whose transition team had consulted with Congressional Democrats and the Bush White House on the efforts to help the automakers, used his opening remarks at a news conference in Chicago on Thursday to urge Congress to act. 
 ''I believe our government should provide short-term assistance to the auto industry to avoid a collapse while holding the companies accountable and protecting taxpayer interests,'' he said. But in Washington, there was little appetite among Senate Republicans for yet another multibillion-dollar bailout of private companies. Still, with the Democrats and the White House eager to reach a deal, Mr. Corker's proposal became the subject of intense negotiations well into the evening.
 Under his plan, the automakers would have been required by March 31 to slash their debt obligations by two-thirds -- an enormous sum given that G.M. alone has more than $60 billion in outstanding debt. 
 The automakers would also have been required to cut wages and benefits to match the average hourly wage and benefits of Nissan, Toyota and Honda employees in the United States. 
 It was over this proposal that the talks ultimately deadlocked with Republicans demanding that the automakers meet that goal by a certain date in 2009 and Democrats and the union urging a deadline in 2011 when the U.A.W. contract expires.
 G.M. and Chrysler had already agreed to carry out sweeping reorganization plans in exchange for the help. 
 The negotiations over Mr. Corker's proposals broke up about 8 p.m. and Mr. Corker left to meet with Republican senators to brief them on the developments. The Republicans emerged from their meeting an hour later having decided they would not agree to a deal. Several of them blamed the autoworkers union. 
 ''It sounds like the U.A.W. blew it up,'' said Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana. 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee and a leading critic of the auto bailout proposal, said: ''We're hoping that the Democrats will continue to negotiate but I think we have reached a point that labor has got to give. If they want a bill they can get one.'' 
 The last-ditch negotiations made for a dramatic scene on the first floor of the Capitol, where high-level lobbyists for G.M. and Ford, as well as Stephen A. Feinberg, the reclusive founder of Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm that owns 80 percent of Chrysler, gathered with senators and legislative staff in a conference room. 
 A Democratic aide said that there were no lobbyists present who represented Chrysler. 
 At times, various participants huddled in corners of the cavernous hallway outside the conference room, shielding their documents and whispering into their cellphones, as a throng of reporters and photographers waited nearby. Some of the lobbyists and banking committee staff members huddled by two towering windows, looking out on a frigid rain that had been falling all day. 
 Markets reacted quickly in Asia. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index extended mild morning losses after the proposal failed.

HEADLINE: Hype-Dappled Landscape

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
The past week the Bagger has been in Los Angeles, but much of the Oscar talk has been drowned out by fretting about a possible strike by the Screen Actors Guild, which will seek its members' authorization for a walkout beginning Jan. 2. The pall brings to mind last year, when the writers' strike clobbered the Golden Globes and dampened the Oscars. The Bagger would get in a tizzy about the prospect that it will happen again, except for the small fact that people are fighting for their economic futures. A few canceled parties seem like pretty small beer by comparison. 
 Still, it's nice to be someplace where the world does not seem to be ending from the moment you wake up. Oscar-motivated signs and hype dapple much of the landscape, and there is something reassuring about that. Yes, our toes have not touched bottom, but jeez, aren't all those stars beautiful? 
 Armed with a GPS unit and a rented Chevy Impala, the Bagger found there was plenty of tempo in the Oscar story even though we are more than two months away from the big event. On Thursday the Golden Globes gave a hit of oxygen to ''The Reader'' and ''Revolutionary Road,'' two Oscar hopefuls that seemed to be faltering, by nominating them in the best drama category. And as the Bagger wandered through studio lots and industry watering holes, he came across other signs to help guide his Oscar prognostications. 
 In the past week ''Wall-E,'' which is, um, a cartoon in old-timey speak, has gotten serious consideration as best picture, never mind the animated part. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association named it movie of the year, and critics from Time and Entertainment Weekly have put it at the top of their lists. ''The Dark Knight'' seemed to surge as well, making many of the lists and getting a lot of love from the Bagger's contacts.
 The state of play for best picture nominations? ''Slumdog Millionaire'' seems very likely, as does ''Milk,'' which got kudos from the New York Film Critics Circle but not much from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the keeper of the Golden Globes. ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,'' while not universally adored, seems ambitious enough to satisfy many. ''Frost/Nixon'' will have significant demographic appeal (much of the academy came of age during this signal moment in American history), ''Doubt'' is fighting for a place to stand, and ''Australia'' seems dead on arrival, crushed under the weight of high expectation and underdelivery.
 In other words, nothing is settled and more will be revealed.
 Deconstructing 'Doubt'
 One of the scenes in this season's movies that stuck with the Bagger came in the middle of ''Doubt,'' when Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep), the principal of a Roman Catholic school in the Bronx, meets with a mother, played by Viola Davis, who believes her child is being preyed upon by a charismatic priest played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. They go for a walk, and what ensues is a delicate minuet of race and class.
 The Bagger caught up with the writer and director John Patrick Shanley, Ms. Streep and Ms. Davis before a recent screening and asked them about the scene, which, like the discussion it depicts, stops and starts, pivots and then changes direction. 
 Ms. Streep: ''John wanted us to walk, and our instincts as actors made us move and evade each other and try to circle the truth literally.'' 
 Ms. Davis: ''The moment that the scene unlocked for me is when I thought of the fact that this is about me loving my son and protecting my son, and so this ultimately was about me being a good mother. That's it. That's why that line when she says, 'What kind of mother are you?' just literally opens up the whole scene. Because I think that that is a basic human need when you have a child -- to be a good mother.'' 
 Mr. Shanley: ''One of the things that Viola did so well was she played the period. She didn't play a black woman from 2008, she played a black woman from 1964. I think Sister Aloysius has certain assumptions about who Mrs. Miller is and about what mothers are, and they're exploded one by one during the course of this scene and she's left in a place that she's never been in before, and I don't think that she really knows how to proceed. She's in new land.'' 
 In a phone call the film's cinematographer, Roger Deakins, said that for the actors to be able to respond spontaneously to each other, he put a Steadicam in a kind of rickshaw on two wheels so that the actors could choose the points to pause, to turn toward each other and to resume walking.
 They shot the scene for a day, and then Mr. Shanley told the producers that there was a problem with the light. He shot the scene over from the beginning because he wanted both the actors to walk more slowly, to work their way to an accommodation.
 Ms. Davis was happy to do it over and over. 
 Ms. Davis: ''It's the Juilliard in me. I think at one point I looked at Meryl and said, 'Meryl, was I terrible?' '' 
 Mr. Shanley: ''Meanwhile we did the first take and Meryl ran over to me and said: 'What else could you want from this woman? She's turned in the performance of her career.' And I was like, 'We're going to shoot it again.' I knew I didn't have what I needed yet.''

HEADLINE: Deeper in Debt

 BODY:
It was only last year that Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey was calling for a major, and hugely unpopular, increase in turnpike tolls. The goal was to cut in half the state's $30 billion budget shortfall, caused in large part by the underfunding of public-employee pension funds. 
 Now Mr. Corzine is pushing a proposal that in the short term would make the pension problem worse. Unfortunately, given plunging revenues, he has no choice. 
 Under his proposal, cash-strapped municipalities would reduce their payments to the pension funds by half for 2009, and by lesser amounts in 2010 and 2011. (Payments would return to 100 percent in 2012, including an additional sum to make up for the underpayments.)
 In a video on YouTube, the governor said he was recommending the reductions so that municipalities could avoid big property-tax increases. He argued that raising taxes during a recession is a ''poor idea.'' 
 New Jersey's pension debacle dates back to the late-1990s when the state stopped contributing to the funds entirely and used the money for operating costs. Politicians told themselves that the funds' investments in an ever-rising stock market would make up the difference, and they did -- until the market dropped a few years later. This fall the funds took another major blow, losing more than a quarter of their value. 
 Since taking office, Mr. Corzine has required that both the state and municipalities make huge payments to the pension funds. Until now.
 We agree with Mr. Corzine that large property-tax increases would strain many homeowners already struggling to pay their mortgages, which could lead to additional foreclosures. He is right to require towns to resume their full pension payments in 2012 when the economy, presumably, will be stronger than it is now. 
 Even then, the chronic pension fund debt would remain, and more must be done to pay it down. Mr. Corzine and other state leaders could start by pressing unions to agree to raise the retirement age for younger state employees -- those more than 10 or 15 years away from retirement -- to 64 or 65. When the economy recovers, state workers and teachers would have to increase their own contributions to the pension funds. 
 The state will also have to further increase the turnpike tolls, with the added revenue going to the pension funds. Without tough, and politically difficult policies, New Jersey will never dig out of its debt.

HEADLINE: 'Frost/Nixon,' 'Button' and 'Doubt' Lead in Nominations for Golden Globes

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES; Paula Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
A gloomy Hollywood on Thursday put aside a dismal economy and the threat of an actors' strike, focusing instead on Golden Globe nominations that thrust ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'' and ''Frost/Nixon'' to the award season's center stage with five each, with both nominated for best dramatic picture. ''Doubt'' also received five nominations.
 The nominations, considered important Oscar tea leaves despite their occasional out-of-left-field nature, were fairly predictable in the acting categories and spread the love around, with no one film dominating as has happened in the past. The surprises involved which films and performances got brushed to the side or ignored altogether. 
 ''Australia'' -- and notably that epic drama's star, Nicole Kidman, long a Globes darling -- got nothing, a terrible harbinger for its Oscar hopes. Critics have been gushing over ''Milk,'' the biopic starring Sean Penn as the gay rights activist Harvey Milk, but it had a single nomination, for Mr. Penn as best actor in a drama.
 Clint Eastwood had to make do with nominations for best original score for ''Changeling'' and best original song for ''Gran Torino,'' even though he was expected to be a contender in the directing and best actor categories. And ''The Dark Knight'' got one nomination, for Heath Ledger as best supporting actor.
 There was, of course, some happier news. Tom Cruise's efforts to repair his public image got a boost with a nomination for best supporting actor in a comedy or musical for his role as a repugnant movie mogul in ''Tropic Thunder.''Kate Winslet and Meryl Streep were each nominated in two major categories.
 The Golden Globes -- given by the 90-member Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of mostly freelance writers -- are not taken seriously as artistic milestones and have a history of voting idiosyncrasies. Still, the best picture Oscar has mirrored the association's choice for best drama or best comedy-musical in 14 of the last 21 years. And a Globe nomination is viewed as vital to maintaining momentum in the Oscar marathon. 
 ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,'' about a man who ages backward, got five nominations, including best dramatic picture. Nods also went to Brad Pitt for best actor in a drama, David Fincher for best director, Eric Roth for best screenplay and Alexandre Desplat for best original score.
 Tying that expensive film in nominations was the smaller ''Frost/Nixon,'' which revisits the 1977 television interviews between the British personality David Frost and the disgraced former president Richard M. Nixon. The film was nominated for best dramatic picture, best actor in a drama (Frank Langella as Nixon), best director (Ron Howard), best screenplay (Peter Morgan) and best original score (Hans Zimmer).
 ''It's exciting and gratifying, and it means a lot to our particular movie,'' Mr. Howard said in a telephone interview. ''It takes movies like ours -- the opposite of high-concept, easily marketed movies -- and creates excitement around them for audiences.''
 ''Doubt,'' about a nun who confronts a priest she suspects of child abuse, also received five nominations but did not receive one for best picture. Ms. Streep was singled out for best actress in a drama, while her co-stars Amy Adams and Viola Davis are both in the running for best supporting actress. Philip Seymour Hoffman was nominated for best supporting actor and John Patrick Shanley for best screenplay.
 The other films nominated for best dramatic picture were ''The Reader,'' about a law student re-encountering his former lover during a Nazi war-crime trial; ''Revolutionary Road,'' the story of a struggling young couple in the 1950s; and ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' an uplifting tale set in Mumbai.
 In the best comedy or musical category Woody Allen's ''Vicky Christina Barcelona'' picked up a nomination, one of four for the film. Other nominees included ''In Bruges,''''Burn After Reading,'' ''Mamma Mia'' and ''Happy-Go-Lucky.''
 Among its television nominations the association recognized only one network show, ''House'' on Fox, for best dramatic series. ''Dexter'' on Showtime, ''Mad Men'' on AMC and two HBO series, ''True Blood'' and ''In Treatment,'' rounded out the category. Nominees for best musical or comic series were ''30 Rock'' and ''The Office'' on NBC, along with the cable programs ''Californication'' and ''Weeds,'' on Showtime, and HBO's ''Entourage.'' 
 The Golden Globes, which turned into a glorified press conference last year due to the screenwriters' strike, will be presented on Jan. 11 at a ceremony to be broadcast on NBC. The Globes are not expected to be affected by the current standoff between the Screen Actors Guild and studios over a new contract, although the Academy Awards, scheduled for February, may not be as safe.
 The Globes have a lot of quirks. They focus on both movies and television, for instance, and animated films like ''Wall-E'' cannot be nominated in best picture categories. Studios complain the organization nominates people based on their star wattage instead of their performances. The group is still trying to live down nominating (and ultimately awarding) a Globe to Pia Zadora in 1982; recent surprising picks include the 2006 acting nomination for Chiwetel Ejiofor in the obscure film ''Kinky Boots.''
 Although the Golden Globes will no doubt inject frivolity into the movie capital at a very serious time, at least one nominee noted that reality intrudes whether you want it to or not. Marisa Tomei, nominated for her supporting role in ''The Wrestler,'' said in a telephone interview that she was thrilled for the attention but that she was too busy to do much celebrating.
 The chore? Taking her cat to the vet. ''That's life for you, isn't it?'' she said.

HEADLINE: Recession or Not, Paterson's Coffers Swell by $3 Million

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
The Dow is sinking. Unemployment is rising. The real estate industry is frozen.
But that did not stop Gov. David A. Paterson from raking in the dollars on Wednesday night at his first major fund-raiser since he was sworn in. According to Paterson campaign aides, the governor raised $3 million at the event. 
The headliner was Tiki Barber, the former Giants running back, and pretty much any Democrat in New York politics who is a somebody (or thinks he or she is, or would like to be) was there.
Among those spotted on Wednesday night: Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive and potential candidate for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's seat; Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who is set to become commerce secretary; Malcolm A. Smith, whose on-again, off-again bid to become the leader of the State Senate appears to be off again; and a cross-section of the state's political elite, including Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a powerful trade group that is likely to go head-to-head with the governor over budget cuts.
But the surprise appearance of the night was that of State Senator Dean G. Skelos, the Republican majority leader.
Evidently, Mr. Paterson ran into Mr. Skelos earlier in the evening at a holiday party held by Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former United States senator. The governor invited them on the spot, though he and the majority leader have recently been at odds. ''When the governor makes that kind of request, you would never deny it,'' Mr. Skelos said. (No word on whether he actually bought a ticket.)

Hawk, and Prey, in Harlem: Across the park from a fancy Fifth Avenue co-op known for its hawks, a magnificent bird of prey perches in a 100-year-old tulip tree. In its claws, what appears to be a pigeon swoons across the branch, its claws sticking straight out like a corpse in the morgue.
The sight is not an uncommon one: Red-tailed hawks are on the upswing in the city.

HEADLINE: Inside Europe's High-Living Wax Cartel

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL and STEPHEN CASTLE; Stephen Castle reported from Brussels.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Surrounded by a moat and four watchtowers, the ancient Chateau d'Ermenonville is not the kind of place one would associate with a product as mundane as paraffin.
 But the discreet European luxury hotel, about 40 minutes outside Paris, was one in a circuit of hotels that served as bases for more than a dozen years for executives from some of the biggest names in oil to fix prices of paraffin, the wax byproduct of crude oil that is used in candles, paper cups, lip balm and chewing gum.
 Nine companies -- including Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Sasol of South Africa, and Repsol YPF of Spain -- controlled 75 percent of the European paraffin market, and the other 25 percent often fell in with the pricing structure they had engineered. 
 The scheme drove up prices to consumers in a plot that probably touched most households in Europe, according to the European Union's commissioner for competition, Neelie Kroes, whose office levied penalties of more than 675 million euros, or $900 million. 
 In levying the fines in October, Ms. Kroes released a two-page statement and no supporting documentation, but The International Herald Tribune has reviewed dozens of pages of confidential legal documents that offer an unusual look inside the workings of a price-fixing cartel.
 Most cartels operate in secrecy, destroying documents, encrypting e-mail messages or using prepaid phone cards to erase communication traces. But the paraffin cartel was rare in that some members kept minutes, and attendance lists. Cartel members e-mailed invitations and sought R.S.V.P.'s. They booked each other's rooms and played host to open bars. 
 Documents found when investigators first raided the companies in April 2005 included handwritten notes on stationery from hotels on the cartel's itinerary: the five-star Kempinski in Budapest or Chateau de Montvillargenne in the bucolic horse country of Chantilly, France. 
 ''Next price increase May/June 2000,'' a Shell executive scribbled in a note after a meeting in Paris. 
 Tibor Toth, a manager with the Hungarian oil company MOL, and the executive who often kept minutes and attendance, also recorded the prices agreed on in German marks, ''Raise in January unless first-quarter quantities are reduced, otherwise raise in season, DM 120.'' 
 The relaxed clubiness of the paraffin conspirators stokes worries about the hold that price-fixing cartels have on European commerce. With Ms. Kroes taking action against cartels involving elevators, cement, automotive glass and drugs, total annual fines in the past five years have more than tripled, reaching 2.27 billion euros ($2.95 billion) this year. 
 In the paraffin case, as in others, some of the biggest offenders walked off with no, or relatively small, fines because they were first in the door with information implicating less-involved conspirators. And, unlike in the United States, in the Europe Union price fixers do not face the prospect of criminal prosecution.
 Over all, the number of international cartels has been rising nearly every year since the 1980s, according to John Connor, a Purdue University economist whose studies show that global cartels are bigger and more plentiful in Europe. 
 The paraffin cartel involved at least 35 sales or product managers. In internal memorandums they used nicknames for themselves and their meetings: the Blue Saloon, after a favorite bar in Hamburg; the Appetizer Meetings; even, for one participant, the Paraffin Mafia. At meetings, they fixed prices and carved up markets for their distinct product lines: extruder, coating wax, liquid slabs, tea-light candles and grave lights used for tombstones. 
 Most cartels last five years, according to studies, then sputter out amid recriminations over cheating. European regulators suspect this one may date as far back as the 1970s, based on files plucked from some companies involved. Investigators said that they believed they had firm evidence to form a case starting with a Sept. 3, 1992, meeting of five participants at an unknown location, according to the European Commission's confidential 200-page report laying out the evidence. 
 In the months that followed, a ritual developed, according to the documents. Sasol, the market leader, based in South Africa and with an office in Hamburg, played ringleader and club booster. A product manager, Michael Matthai, issued invitations by telephone, fax and e-mail. Usually it was for a half-day meeting, with dinner the night before along with a cocktail hour, often with Holger Schroder, sales manager for Shell Deutschland, playing host. 
 At Sasol, where the club was known as ''Blauer Salon,'' or Blue Saloon, after the Hamburg bar, participants would report back on the gatherings to other executives who kept notes. The companies ''tried to protect their home markets by creating an atmosphere of mutual trust and good will among themselves,'' according to a file obtained from Sasol by commission investigators.
 The documents show that they shared information about customers, production capacities, sales volumes and even plant maintenance. They talked prices, agreeing on absolute numbers. 
 Mr. Toth, the Mol executive, held a more junior position than other sales managers in the cartel, but according to legal documents he was sent to meetings because he spoke English and German. His notes, written in Hungarian, included careful tables and documents with titles like ''Candle Industry Price situation,'' listing prices for a variety of waxes and the notice of a new price structure. 
 Memorandums outlining the agreements contained insider references to some of the biggest paraffin customers -- the candle makers Iberceras of Spain, and Bolsius of the Netherlands -- marked with prices by their names. 
 Customers may not even have noticed because there was never a uniform price increase, just agreement on what specific companies would charge. 
 Some candle makers had their suspicions. During the 1990s, when the cartel was in full swing, the biggest candle manufacturer in Europe, Bolsius, started looking for better prices in Asia, and decided to build a multimillion-euro, 30,000-ton storage depot in Rotterdam for imports, said Vincent Kristen, the company's managing director. 
 But that failed because the company started to detect a curious pattern. ''Soon we found we were getting more or less European prices from suppliers in the rest of the world,'' Mr. Kristen said. 
 By late February 2005, the cartel started to fracture. It gathered for what would be its last meeting in the brightly colored four-star Hotel Madison Residenz in Hamburg but was unable to come to an agreement on prices. 
 Three weeks after the Hamburg meeting, the cartel was shattered. 
 Shell, facing $360 million in fines for its participation in other cartels -- involving synthetic rubber and bitumen, a thick form of petroleum -- revealed the paraffin scheme to European Union authorities on March 17, 2005. Under European Union regulations, Shell won complete forgiveness for what would have been a nearly $130 million fine, as calculated by the commission. Other companies -- some far less implicated -- faced fines eventually totaling nearly $900 million. 
 A series of raids followed in the weeks after Shell talked. Perhaps the richest trove of evidence came from MOL headquarters in Hungary, where investigators discovered Mr. Toth's files with a series of notes on hotel stationary arranged in chronological order.
 Sasol pressed for leniency the day after the raids concluded on April 29 and received a 50 percent reduction, lowering its fine to the equivalent of $423 million. More limited discounts were meted out to Exxon Mobil and others. 
 Since the trustbusters issued the fines, chastened top executives have apologized, with several saying they unwittingly inherited cartel membership from smaller companies they acquired or that their managers acted without company knowledge.
 Nikolaas Baeckelmans, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, said his company ''deeply regrets our involvement, although limited, in the infringement.'' He said participation was confined to four Mobil employees who became involved before the Exxon merger with Mobil in 1999 and a single Mobil employee held over in Germany after the merger.
 Rainer Winzenried, a spokesman for Shell, said that it took time to integrate DEA, a German business it purchased in 2002, which was already a cartel member. 
 Sasol's top executives blamed rogue employees. The commission argued that senior managers should have investigated the real purpose of the meetings since attendees submitted expenses. 
 A spokesman for MOL initially said that the memo writer, Mr. Toth, left the company two years ago, later conceding that that information was incorrect. A colleague of Mr. Toth's in Hungary said he was working there till October, the month the sanctions were announced.

HEADLINE: Big Job Cuts At Bank Of America

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Bank of America said on Thursday that it planned to cut 30,000 to 35,000 positions -- among the largest layoffs ever -- over the next three years as it digests its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. That could amount to more than 11 percent of the combined firms' global work force of 308,000.
 Combining two firms as large as Bank of America and Merrill often involves eliminating duplicate jobs. Both have significant overlap in areas like research and investment banking. 
 But Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., acknowledged that this round also reflected the dismal economy. The firm said the layoffs would cut across all of its businesses, and that a final number would be determined early next year.
 Many of the jobs will be lost through attrition, Bank of America said, though a spokesman declined to comment on specifics of the plan, like which offices will be affected and which businesses will see job reductions.
 Wall Street's pain is unlikely to stop there. After years of rapid growth, built largely on the trading of risky securities like subprime mortgages, the financial services industry is in the throes of its sharpest contraction in modern times. As of last week, banks have cut 186,439 jobs since the onset of the financial crisis in July 2007, according to data from Bloomberg News. Bank of America has already laid off 11,150 employees, while Merrill has cut 5,720.
 Bank of America, whose stock has fallen 64 percent this year, sealed its shotgun marriage to Merrill last week, creating a colossus of both corporate and consumer finance. But the firm, like its peers, has taken billions of dollars from the government to confront a recession that poses serious threats to many of its businesses. 
 Banks are already reeling from losses tied to credit card debt, auto loans and commercial real estate mortgages, and analysts worry that more consumers will struggle to stay current on the debts they incurred in more profitable times.
 Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in an interview with CNBC that the global economy would be lucky if the current recession, which began last December, lasted just two more quarters. 
 He added that housing prices could fall another 20 percent, a situation that would force banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America to take even further write-downs on the mortgage assets they still hold on their books.
 Shares in Bank of America fell 10.67 percent on Thursday, to $14.91, before the job cuts were announced. Shares in JPMorgan, which Mr. Dimon said experienced a ''terrible'' November and December, also fell more than 10 percent, leading financial stocks lower across the board. 
 Citigroup, the embattled financial giant, said last month that it was laying off 52,000 employees, the largest single wave of job cuts in nearly two decades. Even Goldman Sachs, which had dodged the worst of the pitfalls of the credit crisis, has begun laying off employees ahead of what many expect will be its first quarterly loss as a public company.
 All the job cuts will be felt perhaps the most in the New York area, whose economy draws much of its city and state tax revenue from Wall Street. 
 New York City officials are bracing for thousands of additional layoffs. Earlier in the day, the New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., raised his estimates of Wall Street job losses over the next two years to 170,000. Together with an expected 50 percent drop in bonuses, to their lowest levels since 2002, the city's tax revenue could fall by 4.3 percent in the 2009 fiscal year. 
 Last year, Wall Street paid out $33.2 billion in bonuses, a drop of 4.7 percent from the previous year.
 ''The toll taken by the financial industry makes this one of the grimmest economic periods for the city in many years,'' Mr. Thompson said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Rule Eases A Mandate Under a Law On Wildlife

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The Interior Department on Thursday announced a rule that has largely freed federal agencies from their obligation to consult independent wildlife biologists before they build dams or highways or permit construction of transmission towers, housing developments or other projects that might harm federally protected wildlife.
 The rule, quickly challenged by environmental groups, lets the Army Corps of Engineers or the Federal Highway Administration in many cases rely on their own personnel in deciding what impact a project would have on a fish, bird, plant, animal or insect protected under the Endangered Species Act. 
 In announcing the rule, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said his main intention was to ensure that the 1972 law was not used as a ''back door'' means of regulating the emission of the gases that accelerate climate change. Without this rule, Mr. Kempthorne said, his decision last summer to list the polar bear as threatened because of the loss of sea ice caused by the warming of the climate could be used to block projects far from the bear's Arctic habitat.
 ''The Endangered Species Act was never intended to be a back door opportunity for climate change policy,'' he said.
 Legal experts said the change seemed intended to ensure that the protection of species like the polar bear would not impede development of coal-fired power plants or other federal actions that increased emissions of heat-trapping gases. The Endangered Species Act, a complicated law with numerous procedural requirements, has long infuriated business interests and property rights advocates. But the law's broad sweep, and its impact on a range of issues like hydroelectric power and logging, has largely been supported by federal courts.
 Conservatives and business interests believed that the listing of the polar bear as a threatened species raised the specter that the law's impact would be felt far afield. A federal decision to license a coal-fired power plant in Missouri, the reasoning went, could be blocked because the plant's emissions would indirectly contribute to a reduction of the bear's icy habitat.
 But the change to the rule, one of a series of regulatory shifts by the Bush administration in its final months, goes well beyond the concerns about climate change, several legal scholars said.
 ''This goes to the heart of the most important provision of the Endangered Species Act,'' said Brian E. Gray, a professor at the Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.
 Professor Gray added that a core principle of the act was that independent wildlife and fisheries agencies had the major say in determining whether an action could be taken ''without jeopardizing the continued existence of the species.''
 ''And protecting the continued existence of the species,'' he added, ''is the overriding purpose'' of the law.
 Environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife, filed suit in federal court to block the rule. And legal scholars said that, given the imminent arrival of a Democratic administration, the change was vulnerable to quick reversal. 
 But the change was welcomed by property rights advocates. Citing the current recession, Rob Rivett, the president of the Pacific Legal Foundation, applauded the revision and said that ''the Endangered Species Act has been the opposite of an economic stimulus.'' Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, released a statement praising the rule change as a ''common sense'' revision. Mr. Inhofe added, ''This process is a good first step'' toward reform of the Endangered Species Act. 
 Pat Parenteau, a professor at the Vermont Law School, disagreed, saying, ''For all federal agencies, if this isn't a carte blanche, it's certainly a broad license to decide for yourself that you don't need to consult.''
 The new rule would take effect in 30 days, or just before President-elect Barack Obama was inaugurated. Legal experts said that among the Obama administration's options were two quick ones: suspending the rule or settling lawsuits.
 In his news conference, Mr. Kempthorne said federal agencies proposing or approving construction projects had already had some leeway to decide whether to consult biologists at the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service. And, he added, ''Nothing in this regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibility to ensure that a listed species is not harmed.''
 Questioned about the last-minute nature of the rule change, which put Fish and Wildlife officials on a forced march to sort through more than 200,000 comments about the proposal, he asked, rhetorically, if Eli Manning, the New York Giants quarterback, should be taken off the field in the last five minutes of a game. 
 ''We have 39 days of work left,'' the secretary said, ''and we owe it to the public to keep working.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Presence at Conference On Climate Raises Hopes

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: POZNAN, Poland 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry arrived at the United Nations climate conference here on Thursday and immediately reassured delegates that the United States would take strong measures to combat climate change. 
 ''President Obama will be like night and day compared to President Bush,'' Mr. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said at a news conference, adding, ''Congress and the president-elect are committed to movement on mandatory goals as rapidly as possible.'' 
 Although the incoming president has no official representatives here, the conference center is crawling with Congressional representatives and their staff members, a sign of the political transition in the United States. 
 Over the past two weeks, there have been staff members from more than 50 Congressional offices, representing figures like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a Republican foreign policy statesman; and Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, who will be the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
 The staff members were so numerous that the United States delegation here, representing the Bush administration, put a sign on its office door: ''Executive Branch Personnel Only.''
 On Wednesday, transition team officials for Mr. Obama said he would announce his top environment team next week, which so far includes Carol M. Browner, Steven Chu and Lisa P. Jackson.
 Despite elation at the new United States presence, there was widespread concern among delegates that developed nations would be less willing to make the financial investments in climate change at a time of global recession. In opening the two-day meeting of environment ministers on Thursday morning, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said there should be ''no backsliding on our commitments.''
 In a roundtable on Thursday, dozens of environment ministers pledged to hold to previous plans for emissions reductions. Stavros Dimas, environment director general of the European Union, said, ''We are determined despite economic surprises to deal with climate change.'' The European Union has committed to reducing emissions 20 percent by 2020. 
 Still, other ministers made it clear that the global recession had made good works harder. ''If we can bring our finance ministers back on board, we will be successful in Copenhagen,'' where countries hope to arrive at a climate treaty by December 2009, said Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's environment minister, who reiterated his country's goal of cutting emissions by 25 to 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020. 
 There were some bright spots at the conference, which is part of a negotiation to create the global climate treaty. Mexico took the lead among developing countries and committed itself to emission reduction targets and caps, even though developing countries are not required to do so under the Kyoto Protocol. Brazil said it would aim to cut deforestation 70 percent in the next decade. 
 But Xie Zhenhua, the head of the Chinese delegation, reiterated that as a developing country China should not have to make such numerical commitments, but that it would ''take positive and effective mitigation and adaptation measures.'' China is the world's largest emitter.
 Also, some developing countries said promises by industrial nations to help them cope with climate change seemed to have been put off. The fate of a fund to help poor countries adapt to climate change was unclear on Thursday. 
 ''We are really disappointed with the progress we are seeing in Poznan,'' said Amjad Abdulla, director general of the Ministry of Environment in the Maldives, a chain of low-lying islands that is threatened by rising sea levels. ''We are drowning, and there is this huge gap in commitment.''

HEADLINE: City and Suburb: A Time for Reshaping

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''This Old House'' (column, Dec. 9): 
 David Brooks offers an insightful and timely analysis of how a once-in-a-lifetime chance to restructure the way our cities work might be accomplished through President-elect Barack Obama's infrastructure stimulus spending plan.
 I have listened carefully to Mr. Obama's prescriptions for ''change'' and am more encouraged than Mr. Brooks. 
 Mr. Obama has called for a refocus on urban issues like public transit, rebuilding inner-city schools, and revitalizing public parks and common ground in his public works package. He recognizes that cities are the nerve centers of our modern economy and must be restored to create a durable economic base.
 The recent appeal by metropolitan area mayors led by Michael R. Bloomberg to follow the lead of urban planners in carrying out a multibillion-dollar job creation plan is a great place to start. 
 Mr. Obama would get the long-term ''bang for the buck'' he seeks by heeding Mr. Brooks's advice and supporting the shovel-ready plans that metropolitan area mayors are offering.
 Jack Luft Sanibel, Fla., Dec. 9, 2008
 The writer is the former director of planning, development and asset management for the City of Miami (1970-98).
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks laments how President-elect Barack Obama's stimulus plan for infrastructure would result in a large-scale federal version of ''This Old House'' for our sprawling suburbs. He believes that the money could be more intelligently directed toward the kinds of projects that restore a sense of community to the suburbs through the building of ''suburban town squares'' and ''new civic hubs.'' 
 The retrofitting of suburbia will indeed be one of the most important and innovative national projects in the next generation. The federal government encouraged much of this sprawl development through highway construction, building codes and mortgage tax credits. 
 So the precedent for federal involvement is established; why not retool the focus and goals? We should retrofit our suburbs to make them livable communities with true civic centers, walkable neighborhoods, alternative transportation options and preserved open space, while using innovative sustainable development practices that could be a model for the world.

 To the Editor:
 David Brooks is rightly critical of what Barack Obama proposes to do with his enormous investment in public works.
 Aging baby boomers especially would benefit from a crash effort to remake suburbia with a new and innovative source of federal financing.
 Once considered youthful and family-oriented, suburban communities invented after World War II are now caught in the ''age wave.'' 
 Today, more aging Americans live in suburbia than in the central cities. Suburban communities are wonderful places to raise children, but not to grow old. They suffer from a lack of affordable housing, inadequate public transportation, and less than optimum access to health and other community services. 
 Aging-in-place suburban-style requires a more creative mix of opportunities for living, mobility, socialization, recreation and neighborhood connections.
 The future of aging and overall community sustainability is at stake in suburban America. While a national public works program can stimulate the economy, with the right priorities it can also help our nation smooth the transition from baby boomers to ''senior boomers.''

 To the Editor:
 David Brooks explains that ''The New Localism'' would be a better focus for fast-track economic stimulus money than highway repairs that just enable continued suburban sprawl.
 I have observed that the private sector is busy creating pseudo-urban cores in suburbs without federal help. Stimulus money needs to be focused and offered where it is critical to success. 
 Mr. Brooks suggests that the Obama team should focus its stimulus money on projects that support ''civic hubs,'' that is, a sustainable infrastructure. A great place to start would be preschool, primary and secondary schools in cities, for without that, middle-class families will not be returning to revitalize old neighborhoods any time soon.
 Cash-strapped New York City has a blueprint in place to improve urban education, and so do the upstate cities. They lack the resources to create small classes and innovate. That money spent wisely will trigger urban rehabilitation, with a much greater payoff to the economy than new construction, which relies heavily on imported materials.

 To the Editor:
 For some of us, moving away from population centers was not a choice but a necessity. People like police officers, teachers and service workers in Aspen and Vail, New York and Boston are often unable to live anywhere near their place of employment.
 There are forces at work affecting the character of a community that go beyond choice and infrastructure remodeling. We can build all the smart communities we want to, but if the underlying economic and social conditions can't support those communities, they're doomed. 
 David Brooks is right in saying we need to look long and hard at infrastructure planning, but we also need not to put the cart before the horse. We have to address income inequity and other basic economic issues before we embark on utopian projects.

HEADLINE: What's Plan B?

 BODY:
Senate Republicans determined to block the $14 billion rescue package for Chrysler and General Motors have trotted out predictable rhetoric about the dangers of Big Government. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, warned on Thursday that ''a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take everything we have.''
 As the American economy sinks into the deepest recession in a generation -- caused in large part by this sort of anti-government and anti-regulatory dogma -- it would be folly to allow the ideologues to undermine efforts to pull the country out. 
 Let's be clear. The rescue plan passed by the House this week won't fix the ailing automakers that are hemorrhaging cash as sales plummet. But allowing one or more of these companies to collapse into bankruptcy proceedings could potentially cause the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs and even greater economic havoc.
 Furthermore, if the Detroit carmakers are going to survive, they will have to completely overhaul the way they do business -- and start building cars that people will buy. For that, they are going to need new leadership, a rational assessment of their long record of failure and, yes, a much larger infusion of government cash. 
 The short-term bailout not only buys time, it uses the time to build a long-term restructuring plan. The incoming Obama administration can then decide whether to invest billions more to truly rebuild the industry. 
 Nobody -- including the carmakers -- fully understands the depth of Detroit's problems or how much money it will take to dig them out. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, told Congress last week that rescuing the companies would cost taxpayers $75 billion to $125 billion over the next two years. And that's probably optimistic. 
 As sales fall, the more taxpayer money the automakers will need to survive, and the more doubts will arise about whether it makes sense to support failing car companies that can't sell cars.
 Before it makes any decisions, the next administration will need a lot more information. The current plan calls for a government car czar who would have full access to the automakers' finances. By the end of the year, the czar would establish benchmarks to evaluate the carmakers' progress in restructuring. 
 The official would bring the companies together with creditors, workers, dealers and suppliers to hammer out a plan to restore their long-term viability. The various stakeholders would be given until March 31 to reach such a deal. And the czar could use the threat of forcing them into bankruptcy proceedings to encourage all parties to reach an acceptable agreement. 
 The bill has big weaknesses. Most importantly, it fails to demand that top executives of any car company receiving taxpayer money step down. These companies need new managers who are not wedded to Detroit's failed strategies. And the bill doesn't set any conditions to ensure automakers invest in fuel-efficient vehicles. Any long-term plan must make sure the automakers don't simply keep making gas-guzzling trucks and sport-utility vehicles, whose popularity -- unfortunately -- has recovered as gas prices have declined. 
 We were distressed by reports late Thursday night that Senate Republicans were close to scuttling the deal. Despite all the flaws of the temporary fix, we don't see a long-term solution without it.

HEADLINE: Japanese Leader Announces A Sweeping Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan's prime minister announced an emergency stimulus package on Friday, hoping to bolster the world's second-largest economy by spending billions to create jobs, increase business loans and help laid-off workers.
 In a nationally televised speech, the prime minister, Taro Aso, announced the sweeping package that he valued at 23 trillion yen (about $250 billion). It was unclear how much of that figure was new spending and how much was included in earlier stimulus packages, like the $50 billion proposal announced in October.
 ''This is said to be a global recession, a great global recession, that comes once in 100 years,'' Mr. Aso said in the broadcast. ''Japan is not outside the path of this big tsunami, nor can it escape.'' 
 With Friday's package, Japan joins the United States and European Union in proposing sizable spending packages to combat the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. The American president-elect, Barack Obama, has pledged to save or create 2.5 million jobs with new spending estimated at $400 billion to $500 billion, and European nations have announced stimulus measures worth some $260 billion.
 Japan's stimulus package is also aimed at critics who have said that Tokyo has not done enough to stimulate its recession-bound $5 trillion economy, the world's second-largest after the United States. Increasingly grim economic data has helped drive Tokyo's stock markets to nearly 26-year lows, while Japan's currency, the yen, hit a 13-year high of 88.16 yen to the dollar on Friday as Japanese investors continued to recall their overseas loans.
 In recent days, some of Japan's biggest companies have added to the gloom by announcing layoffs and production cuts. Sony said it would cut 8,000 full-time jobs and another 8,000 temporary workers as it closes at least five plants worldwide. 
 In his televised speech, Mr. Aso said Friday's package included 10 trillion yen in government spending and an additional 13 trillion yen to stabilize the financial system, most of it to prop up troubled banks and ease a worsening credit crunch. He said that still more stimulus might be necessary, as financial markets continued to reel.
 Mr. Aso also sounded an upbeat note, suggesting Japan's economy remained relatively healthy compared with other developed countries. In the past, Mr. Aso has praised Japan's banks for avoiding the subprime mortgages that crippled American and European lenders, though Japanese banks have suffered huge losses more recently on their stock holdings.
 ''I want to do everything possible,'' Mr. Aso said, ''to make Japan the first of the developed countries to escape from the current recession.''
 He also said he would open a new session of Parliament in early January, weeks ahead of schedule, to approve the new spending as soon as possible.
 He said the package included tax cuts for homeowners and companies that build or purchase new factories and equipment, and 1 trillion yen in grants to local governments to support job creation. 
 Another 1 trillion yen will be earmarked to help laid-off temporary workers find jobs and to pay their housing costs while unemployed. This measure follows recent protests in Tokyo by groups representing temporary and short-term contract workers, who have taken the brunt of corporate Japan's layoffs so far. 
 One group that has been complaining about unfair treatment is Japan's legions of small and midsize businesses, whose owners complain that they are being denied loans by skittish banks. The biggest portion of Friday's package was 12 trillion yen to recapitalize struggling banks and encourage them to lend more to smaller businesses.
 Mr. Aso said an additional 3 trillion yen would be used to buy commercial paper, a type of short-term business loan, in another step aimed at increasing lending to companies.

HEADLINE: When The Cars Go Away

BYLINE: By BILL McGRAW. 
Bill McGraw is a columnist for The Detroit Free Press.

DATELINE: Detroit 

 BODY:
 THIS week, as Washington has tried to decide whether to rescue the automobile industry, Americans have wondered what it looks like when a giant automobile company goes under. The answer can be found in Detroit. 
 In the summer of 1956, the once-mighty Packard Motor Car Company closed its doors. Its headquarters and chief production complex still stand here, though, and their slowly decaying remains serve as a symbol for the fall of American manufacturing in general and the degradation of the auto industry in particular. The Packard plant sits on East Grand Boulevard on Detroit's east side. It is immense: 3.5 million square feet of space in 47 connected buildings. The campus stretches for almost a mile north to south.
 Since Packard's departure, there have been attempts to use the plant as an industrial mall, and at times dozens of small and medium-sized businesses operated within its walls. Today there is only one small firm remaining, a chemical processing concern. The City of Detroit and a private company have been fighting a long legal battle for ownership of the complex.
 So the property is virtually abandoned, and much of it has been empty for years. Almost all the windows in the four- and five-story buildings -- thousands of them -- are broken. The bricks and masonry are crumbling, and two large enclosed bridges that soar over streets are falling apart. Part of one of the large passageways recently collapsed onto Bellevue Avenue, and still sits there, blocking the street.
 Some floors have caved in because metal scrappers have cut out the I-beams. Vast rooms are filled with trash, from old shoes to unwanted pleasure boats. 
 Nature has reasserted itself: Trees grow on the roof and moss has spread inside. Chalky stalactites hang from ceilings, apparently the result of rain coursing through the walls. 
 Water from broken pipes collects into small lakes, freezes during the Michigan winters, then breaks up in spring and runs out of the plant onto neighboring streets. The plant is home to wild dogs, feral cats, homeless people. Arson is a regular event.
 In its day, when Detroit was the Silicon Valley of the early 20th century, the Packard complex was a center for innovation. In 1905, the architect Albert Kahn designed Building No. 10 with reinforced steel concrete, creating an airy, spacious workspace. Such construction revolutionized the building of factories around the world.
 The demise of Packard took place as the city's industrial base was beginning to unravel. Other notable firms that folded or merged in that era included the Hudson Motor Car Company, Murray Body, Motor Products and Detroit Stove Works. By the end of the 1950s, unemployment had soared, white flight was under way and Detroit's downward spiral had begun.
 Misery has rarely been mentioned as a reason to pass an auto industry bailout. But walk through the Packard plant on a December day and you will know that once a car company disappears, in southeast Michigan at least, nothing comes along to take its place.

HEADLINE: Japan Renews Authorization For Naval Aid in Afghan War

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan's governing party pushed through a law on Friday to extend a refueling mission by its navy in the Indian Ocean, allowing Tokyo to keep its small but symbolic presence in the American-led military action in Afghanistan. 
 Prime Minister Taro Aso's Liberal Democratic Party used its majority in Parliament's more powerful lower house to override an earlier rejection of the bill by the upper house, which the opposition controls. It was the second time this year that the governing party rammed through an extension of the refueling operation, a tactic that risks alienating Japan's public, which generally has a pacifist bent. 
 Mr. Aso had sought quick passage so he could turn his attention to the global financial crisis, amid rising calls at home and abroad for Tokyo to take more action to stimulate its economy. Hours after the refueling extension passed, he appeared on television to announce billions of dollars worth of new spending and loans to create jobs and help companies short of cash. 
 Mr. Aso is struggling to overcome growing doubts about his leadership, which have driven his public approval ratings below 30 percent with his party facing national elections by September. 
 The law that was passed Friday allows a Japanese Navy tanker and escorting destroyer to continue operating for another year in waters off Pakistan, where they provide fuel and water for American and other warships supporting operations in Afghanistan. While the mission has limited military value, it has significance as a test of Japan's alliance with the United States. 
 ''Antiterror patrols have suppressed and deterred terrorist activities in the Indian Ocean,'' Mr. Aso said in a statement. ''It is extremely significant for Japan to continue its refueling mission as a member of international society.''
 J. Thomas Schieffer, the United States ambassador to Japan, immediately welcomed the mission's extension.
 Any use of its military overseas is a delicate issue in Japan, whose post-World War II Constitution renounces its right to wage war. Because of such sensibilities, the law authorizing the operation must be extended every year, setting the stage for an annual political fight. 
 The largest opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, has seized on the refueling issue to attack the Liberal Democrats, whom they accuse of slavishly following the United States. 
 Mr. Aso and his predecessors said the refueling mission was important for keeping open the sea lanes through which the bulk of Japan's oil must pass. Extending the mission had assumed additional urgency in light of President-elect Barack Obama's emphasis on America's role in Afghanistan.
 The refueling mission began in late 2001, when the American-led coalition began its war in Afghanistan. The refueling was briefly halted late last year when the opposition won control of the upper house, resuming in January with new restrictions limiting refueling to ships directly involved in the Afghanistan operation. 
 Last month, Japan announced that it would pull its military out of Iraq, ending its airlift operation there by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Retail Spending Fell for a 5th Month in November

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Weighed down by plummeting auto sales, retail sales declined for a fifth consecutive month in November as Americans continued to trim their spending amid layoff announcements, jittery stock markets and other signs of persistent economic gloom.
 Meanwhile, producer prices fell more than expected, another sign that the threat of inflation had yielded to the specter of deflation.
 Retail sales posted a monthly decline of 1.8 percent from October to November and a 7.4 percent decline between last month and November 2007, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. 
 Excluding automobile sales, which can be volatile from month to month, retail sales fell 1.6 percent in November, roughly in line with analysts' estimates.
 The overall monthly decline was smaller than Wall Street had expected, largely because of an unexpected bump in early holiday sales, economists said. Deep discounts lured shoppers back to shopping malls after Thanksgiving, bolstering sales of electronics and sporting goods.
 Sales at department stores, whose stock prices have tumbled as profit and sales forecasts have fallen, rose 2 percent in November. Home furnishings stores also posted an increase of 0.2 percent. Sales of sporting goods, books, appliances and electronics rose 2.8 percent from October.
 The increased business at department stores was unexpected given that many retail chains outside the discount retailers reported poor sales in November. 
 ''We all kind of breathed a sigh of relief,'' said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wachovia. ''Was there weakness in retail spending? Clearly. But it wasn't as broad based as people had feared. It wasn't a complete disaster.''
 November's monthly drop paled in comparison to a record fall in October, when falling car sales dragged broader retail numbers down by a revised 2.9 percent.
 Auto sales dropped 2.8 percent in November from the previous month, and were down 25.2 percent from November 2007.
 In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department reported that producer prices -- the costs paid by businesses for raw materials and capital goods like machinery -- fell for the fourth consecutive month, dropping 2.2 percent as cheaper oil continued to cut the cost of making a range of goods. The cost of gasoline and natural gas fell sharply while overall energy costs fell 11 percent. ''It's being driven largely by energy prices,'' Mr. Bryson said. 
 Although the report confirmed that inflation had nearly vanished from the economy, the decline raised new concerns that prices might continue to fall at a rapid rate as demand for raw materials and bulk goods decreased, potentially leading to a bout of deflation. 
 Falling prices can cause businesses and consumers to hoard money and reduce spending on expectations that money will be worth more in the future. And economists said they expected prices to slide further as lower oil prices and falling demand worked their way through production cycles.
 ''The effects of lower energy and commodity prices will continue to work through the pipeline, dragging prices further down over the next few months,'' Patrick Newport, United States economist at Global Insight, wrote in a note.
 Producer prices excluding food and energy costs rose 0.1 percent in November, the smallest monthly increase since March. Core producer prices have not fallen this year.
 Consumer confidence for December ticked up from earlier readings, according to the latest sentiment index released by the University of Michigan and Reuters. But Americans remained skeptical about their prospects: an index for consumer expectations dropped again, a sign that spending might continue to decline. 
 ''Part of the reason confidence is coming back is that prices are falling and it's boosting spending power,'' said James O'Sullivan, senior economist at UBS.

HEADLINE: Nowhere to Hide

 BODY:
Here are the fruits of Robert Mugabe's rule of horrors: political chaos, economic collapse, desperate food shortages, violence and now a fierce cholera epidemic. Eight-hundred people have died. More than 16,000 are infected, and there is no end in sight. 
 The increasingly delusional Mr. Mugabe -- Zimbabwe's illegitimate president -- announced on Thursday that the cholera crisis is over. Tell that to the Chigudu family which, as The Times's Celia Dugger reported, lost five children, aged 20 months to 12 years, in a matter of hours. Or to the World Health Organization, which warns that the crisis now poses a regional threat. 
 Mr. Mugabe blames the West for the epidemic that is spread by water contaminated with human excrement. The blame is all his. Water taps in the capital's dense suburbs went dry last week, so people could not wash their hands or food. Hospitals are closed. Garbage is everywhere. Sludge spews from burst sewer lines.
 The international community must provide emergency shipments of food, water purification tablets and anti-cholera drugs. The United States has allocated another $6.2 million for supplies like soap, rehydration tablets and water containers. Unfortunately, the dying will continue until Mr. Mugabe allows international health care workers to enter the country and do their jobs.
 There will be no end to these horrors until Mr. Mugabe is gone. He stole this year's election and has blocked a unity government. South Africa and other states that insist on an African-led solution to this crisis must stop enabling Mr. Mugabe and lead. They must renounce their recognition of Mr. Mugabe as president and press him and his cronies to cede power. The cholera epidemic, spilling into South Africa and other border states, shows there is nowhere to hide from Mr. Mugabe's legacy.

HEADLINE: Coaches For a Game Of Money

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
AS people contemplate their own economic straits, the not-so-funny line you often hear these days is: ''O.K., where is my bailout?''
 Few of us will ever get the financial breaks now being given to big companies, but there is a groundswell among financial professionals and policy makers to provide another sort of remedy.
 As the economy sputters -- and the news of crazy mortgages, escalating foreclosures and personal debt mounts -- there is a growing impetus to give millions of Americans something they badly need: financial advice. 
 The financial world abounds with all types of advisers, of course. Financial planners are a common source of guidance. But most planners are geared toward helping their clients create a long-term strategy for managing their money. 
 Many charge a flat fee for a financial plan, or take a commission based on the products they sell, like mutual funds or insurance, or they charge a fee based on a percentage of assets under management. Fees frequently run into the thousands of dollars.
 Where do you turn if you don't have deep pockets or significant assets, or if you simply need help unraveling more mundane, yet crucial, financial problems, like deciphering the terms of a mortgage, the ins and outs of balance transfers or your 401(k) plan's corporate matching system?
 ''You can take financial education classes. You can read books,'' said Karen Murrell, a senior research fellow at the New America Foundation, a nonprofit policy research organization in Washington. ''But if someone has questions or needs a second opinion before they make a financial decision, they need access to objective, expert advice. Given the current economic situation, there's a greater need than ever before for this kind of service.''
 The institute has been working on a policy idea that she describes as a ''financial service corps,'' inspired by the Peace Corps. If this federal program were adopted, Ms. Murrell said, financial professionals would volunteer their time, pro bono, to help low- and middle-income people sort out their financial lives and problems.
 Given the ridiculous complexity of financial life, basic, inexpensive advice is needed for every income level, and certainly mine. Don't get me started on the time, paperwork and hair-pulling it has taken me, as a freelancer, to set up and maintain my I.R.A.'s. Or what I'm going through trying to buy an iPhone without starting an international event by switching providers.
 ''There are just too many moving parts in our financial lives nowadays,'' said Sheryl Garrett, president of the Garrett Planning Network, a nationwide association of fee-only financial planners who offer clients services by the hour, which can be very useful if you don't want to invest in a long-term plan and really need short-term troubleshooting.
 Ms. Garrett compares her business model to ''a walk-in clinic that treats sprained ankles and dispenses flu shots -- you're there for everyday kinds of issues,'' she said.
 HELPING people cope with everyday money problems has been a growing concern in much of the financial world, and the economic crisis has made matters only more urgent. There is a pilot program in San Francisco that aims to give people financial advice and the coaching necessary to carry out their plans. The project, known as Wealthcare, is a partnership between EARN, a nonprofit that provides financial education, and Saundra Davis, a financial planner. 
 Ben Mangan, the executive director of EARN, said that most people seemed to need more than just information and advice to get a grip on their finances. Knowing you need to save for retirement is just the start, he said. 
 A financial coach could walk you through steps like opening a retirement account, understanding your investment options and setting up the contributions. The plan is to expand the program to other cities in 2009. The goal is to help ''people of modest means, who are on the cusp of upward -- or downward mobility, depending on their ability to manage their money,'' he said.
 Lately, it seems as if that could be anybody.

HEADLINE: It's the New Economic Reality. Work With It.

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
So much for the very rich being different from you and me. It turns out they were just as bad at assessing risk as everyone else, failing to foresee that the days of outsize returns on their investments could not last.
 Very few believed a financial disaster like the one we are living through could actually happen, according to a forthcoming paper by Robert Seaberg, head of the wealth planning group at Citi Global Wealth Management. Or put another way, the risk models that high net worth and ultra-high net worth investors trusted to insure their portfolios failed.
''There aren't a lot of us who want to dwell on the negative,'' Mr. Seaberg said.
 Instead, he said, the rich were fixated in recent years on the great wealth-generating possibilities of concentrated stock positions; derivatives created from the very mortgages that, it turns out, others couldn't pay; and hedge funds that locked up their money to take huge bets on the economy. The collapse of the housing, employment and financial markets, coming at once, was more than a shock to the system. Like so many others, many of the rich have gone back to the drawing board. 
 ''In high net worth and ultra-high net worth, we get involved in these esoteric things, and we forget the basics,'' Mr. Seaberg said. ''Several years ago it was more about the opportunity -- how do I not miss out? Everything is a lot more subdued now.'' 
 In a new column, which will appear every other week on this Web site, I will look at strategies that the wealthy use to manage not only their money but their overall well-being. I will discuss how well these strategies work (or don't) while showing how people with far less money can learn from these same strategies. 
 The recent across-the-board failure to assess risk is a good place to start. Mr. Seaberg's paper, ''A Flock of Black Swans,'' says various advisers failed to impress on their clients the need to consider the possibility that highly unlikely events -- so-called ''black swans'' -- might indeed occur. The rich may not have done anything different, but at least they would have been aware of the risks they faced.
 He has singled out four areas where portfolios were hit hardest and where they should be adjusted to weather future shocks. While his findings are geared toward the highest end of the investing community, people at every wealth level should take note. 
 REDEFINE A SAFE INVESTMENT Until this year, safe investments included United States Treasuries, corporate bonds and auction-rate securities. Treasuries are still safe, though the yield on the three-month Treasury is virtually nothing. But the other two are no longer safe havens. The worst one is auction-rate securities, an instrument long sold as being as good as cash. The market for them seized up over the summer, and people who hold them have spent months fighting to get their money back. 
 Investment-grade corporate bonds are still trading but their yields are down, hit by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the continuing struggles of the giant insurer, the American International Group. This means the definition of a safe investment has become very narrow, mainly Treasuries.
 DIVERSIFY MORE BROADLY For decades, the 60-40 stock-bond split has been too simplistic for high net worth investors. They have increasingly shifted their attention to real estate, hedge funds and private equity, so-called alternative assets with higher returns for those willing to lock up their money for long periods of time. The problem is that many of these investments depend on borrowing, which means their values have plummeted as credit conditions tightened. 
 Mr. Seaberg said investors now need to look outside the United States and Europe to emerging and frontier markets in all aspects of their portfolios to create the greatest diversification. They also need to use more structured notes to reduce risk. With such products, an investor typically gives up some of the gains on a particular security to ensure that any losses will not fall below a certain level. It's a simple structure to put in place, though it carries the risk of the creditworthiness of the bank that created it. 
 CONSIDER TAX CONSEQUENCES When the value of every asset was increasing, the portion lost to taxes was not a big consideration. Gains far outstripped the extra tax burden. This isn't the case anymore. In an environment of lower returns, the after-tax piece is going to matter more. Municipal bonds from cities and states that can meet their obligations are one lower-tax alternative. 
 BE MORE REALISTIC ON HOUSING The era of the house as a constantly appreciating asset is over. In the last two years, the average house in America has dropped 20 percent in value, according to the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. This means people are not going to be getting into and out of homes quickly. More significantly, it should be a signal for homeowners to make sure they have properly insured what they have. Beyond the basics of theft and fire. a homeowner needs to consider natural disasters like hurricanes and floods. 
 But in the current economic environment, the most important piece may be an umbrella policy to cover the people who work for you. If the guy fixing your roof slips off or your nanny falls into your pool, the potential loss of wealth could be far greater than anything the stock market takes away.
 All four points seem incredibly straightforward. The problem was that no one wanted to talk about something as boring as an umbrella insurance policy when they could fantasize about a hedge fund with 80 percent returns. ''It's the little things we don't think of,'' Mr. Seaberg said. 
 In a recent internal memo, Wells Fargo gave its private bankers a checklist of questions that they should have been asking all along. The first question was, ''Are you clear with regards to what is your true appetite for risk?'' It is followed further down with, ''No matter what, always live below or at your means'' and ''Are you saving enough?'' 
 Dan Rauchle, president of Wells Fargo Alternative Asset Management, said the firm's clients had recently been more receptive to reconsidering the basic ways their portfolios were constructed. He said clients had been interested in talking through their ''risk budgets,'' which is the firm's term for assessing a client's appetite for swings in the value of their portfolios.
 Like all corrections, though, there is a risk that people will go too far the other way, and that concerns Robert Weissenstein, chief investment officer for the Americas at Credit Suisse private bank. An early proponent of volatility budgeting, which is meant to prepare an investor for shocks like these, he said: ''These times right now are the 5 percent tail events. If you are typically going to live your life or model for that, you'll probably do absolutely nothing.''
 The one upside of markets like this, he said, is they help people understand the need to assess their true risk tolerance. ''It's one thing to discuss and model,'' Mr. Weissenstein said. ''It's another thing to live through it. How can you not step back and ask questions?''
 While losing 40 percent of $100 million gives those investors more wiggle room than that same decline on $100,000, it still requires them to re-evaluate their view of risk, if not a change to their lifestyles. That soul-searching, done amid the possibility of lower returns in the near future, could alter spending and saving patterns over the long term. ''Without a sense of abundance, people are going to be more careful,'' Mr. Seaberg said. 
 The question, then, is this: Will we all adapt to the new economic realities?

HEADLINE: A Makeover in the Diamond Market

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
FOR years, the image of the De Beers Group, the producer of diamonds based in South Africa, suffered because it effectively controlled the world's diamond supply through its Central Selling Organization in London. More recently, diamonds became associated with conflicts in Africa, where rival armies shed blood to control diamond production and finance their military operations.
 But De Beers has stopped trying to control the supply of diamonds to world markets, partly because of regulatory challenges but also because of the rise of new competition. And the managing director of De Beers, Gareth Penny, 45, says the Kimberley Process, which tracks diamonds from discovery to retailers' shelves, means that consumers can be assured that the gems they are considering have not propelled conflict. The group recorded $6.8 billion in sales in 2007 and employs 22,000, mostly in Africa. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation: 
 Q.What will happen to diamond sales in the United States and the world in this economic crisis?
 A. The first point to make is that 80 percent of diamonds are given as gifts, mostly in the fourth quarter of the year. These are difficult times, but in the research we're doing with consumers now, the desire for our product has never been greater. One of the reasons is that people are looking for fewer, better things. Women are telling us they would rather have one meaningful product that will last.
 Q.Have diamonds been one of these commodities whose prices have been inflated and then crashed?
 A. The volatility of diamonds is only a fraction of that of other commodities. A lot of commodities screamed up in price, quadrupling in value. Diamonds haven't done that. And the downward pressure that diamonds have experienced is minimal as a consequence.
 Q.What has your company and your industry done to assure consumers that they are not buying ''blood diamonds,'' as the movie of the same name suggested?
 A. Every single one of the diamonds that De Beers produces and sells comes with a Kimberley certificate. This chain of warranties means that from the place where it is mined to the time at which it's sold, it's watched over by international organizations that have signed up for the Kimberley Process. That process governs 99.8 percent of all diamonds. Diamonds are probably the most regulated mineral anywhere on earth. 
 Q.Aren't diamonds still at the center of conflict in some countries?
 A. The countries where there was conflict are now almost entirely at peace, countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia. Recently, there have been issues in Congo, but that has not been in diamond-producing areas. So diamonds are not caught up in conflict in Africa. 
 Q.Your whole model of trying to control the supply of diamonds from your stockpiles to the world has been stood on its head, right?
 A. Our business model has changed dramatically in the past few years. We are a demand-driven organization. De Beers doesn't control the supply of diamonds. We have around 40 percent market share today. We have very small stocks, measured in a few months of production, from the time we mine the stone to the time we sell it. Our business model is an absolutely normal one, and as a result of these profound changes, we now find ourselves on the right side of regulators all around the world. 
 Q.So through what channels do you sell your diamonds?
 A. The Central Selling Organization closed down. We have a wholly owned trading company called the Diamond Trading Company, which has a considerable number of customers around the world. And we have a secondary channel that sells to many hundreds of small companies through a tender process.
 Q.Who has the other 60 percent of the market?
 A. The Russians have a major share of it, and then there are major mining companies, such as Rio Tinto and BHP, and many, many smaller ones. 
 Q.In view of Barack Obama's assuming the presidency, which will probably heighten interest in Africa, should American business be doing anything differently? 
 A. We've developed a program that has a number of steps to guide us in how we conduct our business in Africa. One is that you need to form strong partnerships. Business relationships in Africa require those partnerships. So De Beers is in partnership with the Botswana government and the Namibian government, and we have a consortium of black business people we're involved with in South Africa.
 A second element is sustainability and everything that goes with that. Making sure that our work force is well educated and addressing issues like the H.I.V.-AIDS pandemic are all part of the way you operate in an African environment. That gives you legitimacy and the social contract to do business.
 Q.H.I.V.-AIDS is prevalent among your miners in South Africa, right?
 A. It is. But there is a lot of work that's being done. Our company is providing antiretroviral drugs to our employees and their partners, which we do at our cost. We have extensive testing mechanisms. We want everybody to know their status. That's really the first step in this battle. It's just something that's going to require constant vigilance.
 Q.Can American business do more in Africa?
 A. Yes, American business can. If you look at natural resources and minerals and trading opportunities and tourism, I think Africa represents a very interesting and long-term strategic trading partner for the United States.
 It goes without saying that Mr. Obama's election has been unbelievably well received right across the entire African continent.

HEADLINE: Faith-Based Views Veer Off a Straight Political Line

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
E-mail: sgfreedman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Cheri Andes awoke one morning in March 2004 to disconcerting news. An article in The Boston Globe described the growing debate on same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, where the legislature was about to take up the issue for the second time. And in the article, Ms. Andes found two familiar names on irreconcilable sides of the issue.
 The Rev. Jennifer Mills-Knutsen, assistant minister of Old South Church in Boston, endorsed such marriages with the words, ''This is a civil rights issue.'' The Rev. Hurmon Hamilton, pastor of Roxbury Presbyterian Church, told The Globe that same-sex marriage was not ''a solution.'' 
 What the article did not explain, but what Ms. Andes knew all too well, was that the two ministers also happened to be co-chairwoman and co-chairman of the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, a coalition of congregations for which Ms. Andes was the lead organizer. 
 At the same moment that Ms. Mills-Knutsen and Mr. Harmon were becoming public antagonists on same-sex marriage, they were supposed to be allies in the interfaith group's campaign to improve working conditions for nursing-home employees in the Boston area.
 The moral of this particular story, one worth repeating in the aftermath of California voters' rejection of same-sex marriage last month, is that faith cuts a jagged line as a factor in public policy. 
 Or, to put it differently, faith's straight line defies the secular grid that so many politicians and journalists try to impose upon religious communities: that they be unswervingly Democratic or Republican, liberal or conservative, left or right.
 Since the vote on Proposition 8 in California, it has been the turn for liberals to bewail and conservatives to gloat that a large number of black Christians and Latino Catholics and Pentecostals who supported Barack Obama for president simultaneously cast their ballots to strike down same-sex marriage.
 The only surprise, in truth, is that anybody should be surprised that theology refuses to adhere to a partisan platform.
 ''Religion is a lot messier than a lot of us want to consider,'' Diane Winston, a professor of religion and media at the University of Southern California, said in a phone interview. ''It's easier to have neat guidelines. It's easier to think that if you're conservative in one area, you must be conservative in all areas. But religion doesn't often cut that way.''
 Consider, for example, Pope Benedict's homily at Yankee Stadium in April with its ringing support for immigrants, a position that is practiced on a daily basis in Catholic parishes across the country. Under the routine type of analysis, the pope's speech was a stunning deviation from the Roman Catholic Church's (and his own) supposed conservatism.
 Yet the church's stand on behalf of immigrants, like the stands American bishops have taken over the past quarter-century against nuclear arms, the death penalty and President Bill Clinton's welfare-reform bill, would strike a believing Catholic as entirely consistent. 
 In fact, the latest version of the bishops' document, ''Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship,'' makes the case for a theology that advocates on behalf of the weak, both the unborn and the born. 
 The Democratic convention in August offered another example of the ways religious belief confounds political loyalty oaths. At a ''faith caucus'' organized by the Obama campaign, the speakers included the Rev. Charles Blake, presiding bishop of the Church of God in Christ, a black Pentecostal denomination.
 Within the same sermon, Mr. Blake denounced the Democrats for supporting abortion rights, calling for outright resistance, and then turned his wrath against Republicans for being ''silent if not indifferent'' to social injustice. And both parts of the preaching were avidly received by the audience. 
 Had commentators been paying attention, Mr. Blake's exhortation could have practically served as a prelude to the way many of his followers in California, where the Church of God in Christ is especially strong, split their tickets on Election Day between Mr. Obama and ''Yes'' on Proposition 8. But if the standard view of the black church is that it is always liberal, based on its civil rights activism and Democratic voting habits, then this wellspring of social conservatism seemed to be some kind of shock.
 The mistake of conflating religious doctrine with partisan allegiance traces back in some ways to the early 1980s and the emergence of the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority, and more broadly to what came to be known as the Religious Right, as a key constituency in President Ronald Reagan's electoral triumphs.
 ''That skewed our understanding,'' said John J. De Iulio, a professor of politics, religion and civil society at the University of Pennsylvania. ''People overgeneralized from the shift of evangelical Christians into the Republican fold. The idea took hold that if people derive a particular set of views from their religious identities, then it translates into a partisan or ideological identity, and then you must share all the views that come up. And obviously that's not so.''
 The range of positions may be most apparent these days within evangelical circles. Particularly in the younger generation, these supposedly hidebound conservatives have taken up causes like environmentalism (known in evangelical parlance as ''creation care'') and economic injustice (borrowing the Catholic term ''sinful inequalities'') as well as Darfur and the reform of mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. 
 Just this week, Richard Cizik resigned as the Washington lobbyist for the National Association of Evangelicals in the face of criticism for having endorsed civil unions for gay couples in a radio interview. The fact that Mr. Cizik took the stand at all, though, serves notice that the old categories fail at explaining the present reality.
 In Boston, Ms. Andes grasped that point back in 2004. 
 With some delicate internal diplomacy, she kept the interfaith group from fracturing over legislation on same-sex marriage, and it won protections for the nursing home workers, the issue on which there was unanimity. 
 ''I don't think we minimized the differences we felt,'' Ms. Andes recalled. ''But we got to the point where we could see them through a glass wall instead of putting up a brick wall.''

HEADLINE: Migrant Worker Decapitated in Russia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The police in Moscow are investigating the ghastly murder of a Central Asian migrant worker, who was stabbed several times and decapitated in an apparent attack by ultranationalists. 
 The severed head of the victim, a citizen of Tajikistan, was discovered in a dumpster on Wednesday wrapped in a plastic bag, the press service for the investigative wing of the Prosecutor General's Office said. 
 Investigators say the victim and another Tajik migrant worker were attacked last Saturday after they left work at a food warehouse just south of Moscow. The newspaper Kommersant cited unnamed police sources, who said the murder victim was Salekh Azizov, 20, from the city of Vidnoe, also south of Moscow. The second Tajik worker was able to escape, but was hospitalized with injuries, according to the investigators. 
 An obscure group calling itself the Militant Organization of Russian Nationalists announced it was responsible for the killing in an email sent to two human rights organizations that monitor hate crimes in Russia. The email also included a photo of the victim's decapitated head. 
 The authors of the email said the killing was ''a demonstration of their resolve to fight against the non-Russian occupation, and a warning to officials that the same will happen to them if they do not stop the flow of immigration,'' said Galina V. Kozhevnikova a deputy director at the Sova Center, one of the rights organizations that received the email. 
 Millions of migrant workers, mostly from the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, reside in Russia, which is dependent on their labor because of the country's rapidly declining population and dwindling domestic workforce. 
 But violent attacks against ethnic minorities in Russia are common and have been growing in severity as increasing numbers of non-Slavic migrant workers leave economically blighted regions for large Russian cities in search of work, analysts said. 
 In 2008, 85 people have been reported killed and 367 injured in attacks by violent nationalists, said Ms. Kozhevnikova, though she said that the numbers were likely far higher since many attacks go unrecorded or are reported months after they occur. Most of the victims tend to be dark-skinned men from Central Asia or the Caucasus region, though tourists and foreign students have also been attacked.
 Stanley Robinson, a young African-American student from Rhode Island, on a study abroad program to Volgograd in southern Russia, remains in critical condition after he was stabbed three times last week on his way from the gym, a relative of Mr. Robinson said. 
 Human rights groups have frequently criticized Russian officials for appearing to sympathize with violent nationalists and for failing to adequately address the problems of racist attacks in the country.
 State-run Russian television channels have largely ignored the murder of the Tajik worker, though newspapers, which are typically more independent from government meddling, have covered it heavily. 
 A police crackdown on nationalist and neo-fascist groups in Moscow earlier this year resulted in the attacks in the capital abating somewhat over the summer, Ms. Kozhevnikova said.
 Yet violence in Moscow has begun to climb again in recent months, particularly following the rape and murder two months ago of a 15-year-old ethnic Russian girl. A city maintenance worker from Uzbekistan was charged with the crime, sparking protests and revenge attacks by ultranationalist groups, who often refer to non-Slavs on Russian soil as ''occupiers.'' 
 Police found the head of the slain Tajik worker next to the Mozhaisky District administration building in western Moscow, not far from where the girl was murdered. 
 The incident is reminiscent of another grisly beheading videotaped and disseminated on the internet over a year ago. In the video, a masked individual decapitates a bound, dark-skinned man with what appears to be a large knife. Moments later, another man, also bound, is shot point-blank in the head. The video ends with two people in masks giving Nazi solutes in front of a red banner emblazoned with a swastika. 
 Police have still not identified the killers.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Idle Most Plants for About a Month

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said Friday that it would idle all of its assembly plants in the United States and Canada for at least part of the first quarter and build 250,000 fewer cars and trucks than it had planned. 
 Meanwhile, Honda announced that it would reduce North American production from January through March by 119,000 vehicles. 
 Honda now plans to build 1.29 million vehicles in its fiscal year ending March 31, down from earlier projections of 1.47 million, as the recession and tight credit markets send sales plummeting to their lowest level in 25 years.
 At G.M., many plants will close for about a month in one of the broadest shutdowns in the automaker's history. The closures will occur at various times during the quarter, though some will extend the annual Christmas holiday through January.
 G.M. now expects to build about 60 percent fewer vehicles in the first quarter, compared with the 885,000 it made in the same period of 2008.
 ''Every plant in North America has some type of action related to it,'' a G.M. spokesman, Tony Sapienza, said. ''This is an utter collapse of the market, and it's not specific to G.M. or to U.S. automakers. People just aren't buying cars right now.''
 But G.M., which has warned that it may run out of money unless it can borrow about $10 billion from the federal government this month, has suffered more than most of its rivals. G.M.'s sales were down 43 percent in October and November, compared with a 34 percent decline for the industry over all.
 The only major automaker that has performed worse is Chrysler.
 A message posted Friday on the Web site of United Automobile Workers union Local 276 in Arlington, Tex., told members that they would be off work from Dec. 23 until Jan. 20, and again during one week in March. The message from the local's president, Enrique Flores Jr., expressed disappointment that the Senate rejected legislation Thursday to lend the Detroit automakers money, but urged the workers in Arlington, who build full-size sport utility vehicles, to remain hopeful.
 ''Each of you knows that you have no control over the purchasing decisions of the public,'' Mr. Flores wrote. ''Each of you knows that you have no control over the banks and whether or not they will loan customers money to buy the products we produce.''
 The only G.M. plant in the United States or Canada not affected by Friday's announcement is in Lordstown, Ohio. Mr. Sapienza said Lordstown already had two weeks of down time scheduled in January. Three plants in Mexico will also be idled.

HEADLINE: Moving Up the Food Chain

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

DATELINE: LOVELAND, Ohio 

 BODY:
Linda Severin, a Kroger vice president, has spent the last two years dreaming up new products to sell under the chain's store-brand labels. Her creations, while inexpensive compared to national brands, are often fancier than the store brands of old. They include Mediterranean-style pizzas and cake mix with edible images of princesses.
 Her timing could not have been better.
 As the economy plunges into a deep recession, grocery stores are one of the few sectors doing well. That is because cash-short consumers are eating out less and stocking up at the supermarket. And store brand products, which tend to be cheaper than national brands and more profitable for grocers, are doing especially well. 
 Led by chains like Trader Joe's, Kroger, Wegmans and Safeway, grocers have expanded their store brands beyond cheap generics and simple knockoffs of Cheerios, Oreos and Coca-Cola. Now, retailers are increasingly adding premium store-brand items like organics, or creating products without direct competition.
 For instance, the team led by Ms. Severin, Kroger's vice president for corporate brands, developed three-minute microwaveable pizzas as an easy snack for children when they return home from school.
 ''This is designed for moms,'' Ms. Severin said. ''This is a good example where we didn't knock off the national brand, but we thought, 'How can we deliver what our customers are looking for?' ''
 Dollar sales of store brands increased 10 percent during the 52 weeks before Nov. 1, compared with a 3 percent gain for branded products, according to the Nielsen market research company.
 Store brands now account for nearly 22 percent of products sold at the grocery, up from 20 percent a year ago, Nielsen found. At Kroger, store brands account for 26 percent of grocery sales.
 In this economic climate, the numbers suggest, many shoppers are willing to try the newly developed store brands. They also say it is hard to resist the low prices of store brands for staple goods like milk, sugar and cheese.
 ''They are less expensive and they taste just as good,'' said Kim Dittelberger, 49, whose shopping cart at a Kroger store here on a recent day included store-brand ''toaster treats,'' aluminum foil, coffee filters and coffee. ''Now even more so because the economy stinks.''
 Jan-Benedict E. M. Steenkamp, marketing professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said past recessions had given consumers a reason to trade down from national brands. This time, he said, the gains may stick because the quality and consistency of store brands have improved.
 ''Sometimes, it will be disappointing,'' said Mr. Steenkamp, co-author of a book on private-label strategy. ''More often, it will be better than expected.''
 Besides the weak economy, the growth of store brands reflects a historic shift in the balance of power between packaged food manufacturers and grocery retailers. As grocery chains have consolidated and grown bigger, they are increasingly able to stock their shelves with their own products, which bring higher profits and drive customer loyalty -- all to the detriment of major food brands.
 ''The brands aren't as dominating,'' said Alex Miller, president of Daymon Worldwide, a broker for store-brand products. ''The retailer is much more in the driver seat about what goes on in their stores.''
 The increase in store-brand sales has been a boon for some manufacturers, too. Some store brands are made by major food companies like ConAgra Foods and Sara Lee, but many of the goods are made by companies that few customers have heard of, like Ralcorp Holdings (cereal, cookies and crackers), Johanna Foods (yogurt and fruit juice) and Treehouse Foods (soups, salad dressings and salsa).
 ''Those who are winning at retail are those who have decided that rather than be a warehouse for national brands, they have to establish their own brand,'' said Sam K. Reed, the chairman and chief executive of Treehouse Foods. A former chief executive at Keebler, Mr. Reed said he started Treehouse in 2005 because ''private label was consistently growing at a faster rate than branded foods across many categories.''
 Of course, major branded food companies dispute the idea that store brands are just as good as their products. They argue that branded products offer better taste, consistency and innovation, justifying a premium price. 
 ''We're committed to providing our consumers with great-tasting products that are a good value against any competitor,'' said Michael Mitchell, a spokesman for Kraft Foods.
 Others argue that store-brand manufacturers have not been able to replicate some of America's best-known brands, like Cheerios, Budweiser and Brawny paper towels. Grocers certainly sell store brands that look like Cheerios or like Heinz ketchup, but to many palates, the knockoffs do not taste the same.
 ''A lot of it depends on what product it is,'' said Sharon Frey, 42, a Kroger shopper who was trying Kroger premium ice cream for the first time because it was on sale. ''If it's eggs, it doesn't matter. I would buy Heinz. I prefer Heinz ketchup.''
 Store brands have evolved over the years from homemade items like the sauerkraut that Kroger's founder, Barney Kroger, stocked on his shelves to the plainly labeled generics that were sold in the 1970s.
 In the 1980s, a Canadian grocery executive, Dave Nichol, borrowed from a British grocer the idea of introducing premium store-brand products, like a chocolate-chip cookie with more chips than national brands. Mr. Nichol, then an executive and pitchman for the Loblaws chain, sold the cookies under the President's Choice label. Within two years, the brand was the best-selling cookie in Canada.
 ''That's when the alarm bells went on and that's when I realized this was the whole answer,'' Mr. Nichol said.
 In the United States, a growing number of grocery retailers are embracing Mr. Nichol's philosophy, including Kroger.
 The Cincinnati-based chain, the nation's second-largest grocer after Wal-Mart, hired Ms. Severin two years ago to expand Kroger's store brands, which include a value brand, a medium tier that competes directly against national brands, and a premium category.
 A veteran of major food brands, Ms. Severin said her model was not competitors in the United States, but grocers in Canada and Europe, where store brands account for as much as 40 percent of the items sold. She said her focus had been on developing products that offered something other than simply low prices, like premium ingredients or innovative packaging.
 During a tour of the Loveland store, she pointed to store-brand packages of cut vegetables that were microwave-ready, compact fluorescent light bulbs that were environmentally friendly and dog food made with natural ingredients.
 She said she was particularly proud of a curved, 12-ounce bottle of hand soap with scents like cherry blossom and coconut lime. The Kroger logo was barely visible.
 A typical shopper wants hand soap that ''looks good and smells pretty,'' Ms. Severin explained, but does not want a ''big Kroger logo staring out at her.'' The Kroger product was also cheaper, per ounce, than nearby Softsoap, a popular national brand.
 Even as it develops fancier products, Kroger is being careful to keep unadorned store brands on its shelves, too, recognizing that they appeal to many shoppers for the sole reason that they are cheap. One top seller in Kroger's value line is four rolls of toilet paper in plain packaging for 77 cents.
 ''It's really a price that isn't going to be beat,'' Ms. Severin said.

HEADLINE: Revering a Symbol of Mexican Faith and Identity

BYLINE: By MARTIN ESPINOZA

 BODY:
She came into New York across the George Washington Bridge, a gold-framed portrait of a brown-skinned Virgin Mary escorted by a procession of pilgrims in gray jogging sweats.
 A few carried torches that, along with the image of Mexico's beloved Virgin of Guadalupe, left the Roman Catholic basilica in Mexico City that bears her name two months ago and reached St. Patrick's Cathedral on Friday morning.
 Jose Reyes, a stout 45-year-old construction worker who lives in the Bronx, got up at 4:30 a.m. with other members of his parish there, Immaculate Conception Church, to accompany the portrait into the city. Many local Catholic parishes with large Mexican congregations took part in the procession, a celebration of the Dec. 12 Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe. As he walked through Manhattan, Mr. Reyes said, a sense of pride filled his spirit. 
 ''It's indescribable what you feel when you're walking with her, knowing that she came all the way from where your roots began,'' he said after a 10 a.m. Mass at the historic Fifth Avenue cathedral.
 For many in the procession, the grandeur of the city's concrete monoliths, its wealth and its well-dressed denizens briefly faded amid memories of humble towns in Mexico, of families crossing borders to be together for the holidays and of children playing in timeless colonial church plazas.
 It is a common saying that you are not really Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe. Octavio Paz, the Mexican poet awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990, wrote that ''after two centuries of experiment and failure, the Mexican people only believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe and the National Lottery.'' 
 According to Mexican lore, the Virgin appeared in December 1531 before an indigenous farmer and laborer named Juan Diego Cuautlatoatzin. The brown-skinned apparition told Juan Diego that she was the mother of Jesus and that she wanted a church on the Tepeyac Hill, the site of a former Aztec temple dedicated to the goddess Tonantzin. 
 Both Juan Diego and the Virgin of Guadalupe are passionately revered as holy incarnations of Mexican identity. Recognizing their evangelical significance, Pope John Paul II, who canonized Juan Diego in 2002, declared the Virgin of Guadalupe ''Queen of the Americas.''
 The portrait that arrived at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Friday morning is a replica of the revered image kept at the Mexico City basilica. The portrait, about 5 feet tall and 4 feet wide, left Mexico City two months ago, and was brought by vehicle across the border, across the country and into New York, followed by pilgrims on foot and in cars.
 During the Mass on Friday morning, the image was placed to the right of the altar. On the left was an image of Juan Diego.
 Hundreds of Mexican families brought their young children in simple, traditional clothing for a special blessing toward the end of the Mass. The boys were dressed to look like Juan Diego, with a tilma, or cloak, bearing the image of the Virgin. In the story, that image was proof of her appearance on Tepeyac Hill.
 ''If there are any Juan Dieguitos, you can come up,'' Msgr. Robert T. Ritchie said in Spanish. ''We welcome all the children for this special blessing.''
 Boys, from infants to toddlers, their upper lips sporting mustaches drawn with makeup or face paint, were brought up to the altar, some of them crying. Within seconds, the monsignor disappeared amid dozens of Mexican families. Only the hand he used to bless the children could be seen rising from the crowd.
 Hipolito Garcia, a 35-year-old warehouse worker from Union City, N.J., brought his 5-month-old son, Rigo, and 3-year-old daughter, Roselyn, to the Mass for the blessing. Mr. Garcia is an illegal immigrant who is trying to gain legal residency through his wife, Teresa Calyeca, a United States citizen.
 Mr. Garcia, who came to the New York City area from the Mexican state of Tlaxcala in 1991, said his prayers on Friday were for the legalization of the millions of Mexican immigrants ''sin papeles,'' or without papers.
 ''We also pray for a better economy,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''I have a job now, thank God. But we pray for things to improve all over. This economic crisis is worldwide.''
 The portrait that made the trip from Mexico is owned by the Asociacion Tepeyac de New York, an education and advocacy group that organized the procession, said a Mexico City government official who was at the Mass.

HEADLINE: Younger Job-Seekers Have It Worse

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
IN the first year of the recession, older Americans gained jobs at an impressive rate.
 But younger ones lost them.
 The recession provides a double whammy for the job prospects of those trying to establish themselves. There are fewer jobs to go around, and older Americans who can do so are either delaying retirement or seeking to return to the work force. 
 The accompanying charts compare the average number of jobs in September, October and November of this year for each age group to the number of jobs the same age group held a year earlier.
 There are now more jobs than there were a year ago for every group over 55 years of age -- and fewer jobs for every group under 55. 
 Those who focus on unemployment rates could easily miss that trend, because unemployment rates are up for nearly every age group. 
 For men age 65 to 69, for example, the unemployment rate in November was 5.9 percent, far above the 3.4 percent rate in November 2007, the month before the country went into recession. And yet there were nearly 100,000 more men in that age group with jobs than there had been a year earlier. 
 The difference reflects the fact many more older people want jobs. The labor force -- defined as those who have jobs or are looking for them -- has grown rapidly among those who have reached the ages at which many traditionally retire. Now, with their 401(k) plan assets down sharply in value and their homes also worth less than they had been, many people are putting off retirement or seeking to return to work.
 Over all, the recession has had a smaller impact on women, whose employment is down by just 0.4 percent year-over-year, than on men, who have 1.7 percent fewer jobs.
 But it has also taken its hardest toll on racial minorities. Among men age 25 to 34 -- the youngest group in which virtually all have completed their education -- there were 1.6 percent fewer jobs for whites, 2.1 percent fewer for Hispanics, and 6.2 percent fewer for blacks.
 All those figures are taken from the government's household survey, which can be volatile. That is why three-month averages were used. Had the figures simply compared November to November, the changes would have been even sharper.
 The other survey on jobs, in which employers are asked about employment, shows less month-to-month variation, and provides data on which industries are hiring. That data shows ways in which this recession is unlike recent downturns, in that it is hitting industries that heretofore had escaped unscathed.
 In the past, the financial services industry has undergone upheavals, but the changes usually reflected one part of the industry gaining competitive position over another, allowing industry employment to continue to rise. But over all, industry jobs are down 1.8 percent over the last year, the sharpest annual contraction since World War II.
 Similarly, employment in retail sales is off 3 percent, the sharpest decline since World War II.
 On the other hand, health care jobs are up 2.8 percent over the last year, the same gain they showed in the previous year. And federal government hiring, outside the postal service, has risen at a 4.7 percent rate over the 12 months, the fastest growth of the Bush presidency.

BYLINE: Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
The declining economy doesn't seem to have dampened buyers' interests in purchasing artifacts from popular movies and science-fiction gadgets that don't really work. On Thursday a lightsaber wielded by Mark Hamill in the ''Star Wars'' sequel ''The Empire Strikes Back'' sold for $240,000, and the helmet of the android C-3PO, worn by Anthony Daniels in ''Return of the Jedi,'' sold for $120,000. They were among the prizes in an auction of Hollywood memorabilia held by Profiles in History, an auction house based in Calabasas, Calif. The company reported that the one-day sale grossed $3.5 million (including buyers' premiums) for more than 500 items, among them the black leather uniform worn by Hugh Jackman in ''X-Men'' (sold for $90,000), Marlon Brando's costume from ''Superman'' ($72,000) and a miniature flying saucer from ''Forbidden Planet'' ($78,000).

HEADLINE: City of Detroit, Buckling Under Repeated Blows, Sustains Another Hit

BYLINE: By MARY M. CHAPMAN; Nick Bunkley and Micheline Maynard contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Motown left years ago. The city's former mayor is behind bars. Unemployment hovers around 14 percent. An emergency loan measure for its automakers died in Washington late Thursday after failing to generate enough support from Republican senators. Oh, and its professional football team is 0-13 for the season.
 How much more, one wonders, can Detroit take? 
 ''To me, it's like piling on,'' Gail Taylor, one of the city's legions of unemployed men, said Friday of the Senate's decision on the loan measure. ''We've been through enough around here.''
 Mr. Taylor, 59, was killing time at Campus Martius, a town-square-like meeting place in the heart of downtown. Clad in a hooded gray sweatshirt and a leather jacket, he sipped hot chocolate near the area's festively decorated 65-foot Norway spruce tree.
 ''The last person to leave Detroit should turn out the lights, because if it turns out the automakers don't get the money, there's going to be devastation all around,'' he said, shaking his head as snowflakes swirled about. ''From our restaurants to the hair salons to the shoeshine parlors, the fall of the automakers will affect us all one way or another.''
 James Greenwood, 54, a former auto plant worker taking a break from his job as a maintenance worker at nearby Cobo Center, where the North American International Auto Show will be held this winter, huddled with friends around the Campus Martius ice skating rink. The Senate's decision, he said, surprised him.
 ''I thought they would help the industry because they should know how many people would be affected if they didn't,'' Mr. Greenwood said with a mixture of fatalism and hope. 
 ''We've been suffering here for a long time now,'' he said, but in the next breath he held out hope that automakers would get some financial relief from the Treasury and the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program.
 ''You never know,'' Mr. Greenwood said, turning his collar up against the subfreezing temperature, ''somebody in Washington could come to their senses. They could get enough to get through this year. In the long run, though, I think they'll punt it to Obama.''
 Latrice Jackson, however, had little sympathy for Detroit's automakers, or its workers.
 ''I just feel like we all need to buckle down, and stop being so greedy,'' said Ms. Jackson, who lives in suburban Ferndale and takes care of her disabled brother. ''The companies should have seen all of this coming, but they brought it on themselves. And a lot of the workers, well, we all have to learn to get by with less. We need to stop hoarding things, and take better care of our money.''
 Across the street, the popular 91-year-old American Coney Island restaurant was doing brisk business, with folks streaming in to take refuge from the cold, and to talk about the car industry.
 ''Honey, the Big Three is Detroit,'' a waitress, Cindy Williams, 46, said. ''We get all kinds of business from auto workers. ''If the companies don't get money, Detroit is done for.''
 Donald J. Andrews, having lunch near steamy windows with a table of friends, said the Senate's action ''was a big mistake'' that would have severe consequences.
 ''As far as I'm concerned, the automotive industry is the arsenal of democracy,'' said Mr. Andrews, 43, a lawyer from Waterford, about a half-hour drive from here.
 Another lawyer, Jeffrey Schwartz, 53, of the suburb of West Bloomfield, was incredulous that, as he put it, ''the government is for bankers and Wall Street, and then makes the decision not to support this industry.''
 The restaurant's general manager, Dan Keros, agreed that it was the government's job to lend the auto industry a hand.
 ''Saving workers' jobs is every American's duty; it's what the government should have done,'' said Mr. Keros, 62, of Grosse Pointe, who wore a baseball cap colored like an American flag. 
 Overhearing the conversation, a well-known community activist, Malik Shabazz, 46, yelled from a nearby table, ''Bail out the people, not the banks!'' Between bites of a trademark Detroit chili dog -- a steamed hot dog slathered with onions, chili and mustard -- Mr. Shabazz went on: 
 ''Give the banks money? No problem. But the car companies, man, they had to do flips, and they didn't get a dime.''
 A local sports radio station dedicated the entire day to ''standing up'' for the auto industry with messages of hope from people like Detroit's new mayor, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr., and other politicians.
 Stores, too, joined the campaign. John Hiller, the chief executive of Hiller's Markets, a favorite of the area's Asian residents, felt the need to blog about the importance of buying American. ''These cars have a long, illustrious history, its own history,'' he wrote, ''for we come from a place of innovation.'' 
 Thoughts of persistence more than innovation seemed to be the focus of many people like Ronald Williams, 32, a student at Wayne County Community College who was waiting for a bus to take him home. 
 ''We're all just going to have to keep on keeping on,'' Mr. Williams said. ''Around here, that's all we know how to do.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 18, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the economic woes being suffered in Detroit misstated the given name of the chief executive of Hiller's Markets, who has joined in efforts to support the beleaguered auto industry. He is Jim Hiller, not John.

HEADLINE: Even Workers Surprised by Success of Factory Sit-In

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO and KAREN ANN CULLOTTA

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
The word came just after lunch on Dec. 2 in the cafeteria of Republic Windows and Doors. A company official told assembled workers that their plant on this city's North Side, which had operated for more than four decades, would be closed in just three days. 
 There was a murmur of shock, then anger, in the drab room lined with snack machines. Some women cried. But a few of the factory's union leaders had been anticipating this moment. Several weeks before, they had noticed that equipment had disappeared from the plant, and they began tracing it to a nearby rail yard.
 And so, in secret, they had been discussing a bold but potentially dangerous plan: occupying the factory if it closed. 
 By the time their six-day sit-in ended on Wednesday night, the 240 laid-off workers at this previously anonymous 125,000-square-foot plant had become national symbols of worker discontent amid the layoffs sweeping the country. Civil rights workers compared them to Rosa Parks. But all the workers wanted, they said, was what they deserved under the law: 60 days of severance pay and earned vacation time. 
 And to their surprise, their drastic action worked. Late Wednesday, two major banks agreed to lend the company enough money to give the workers what they asked for.
 ''In the environment of this economic crisis, we felt we were obligated to fight for our money,'' Armando Robles, a maintenance worker and president of Local 1110 of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, which represented the workers, said in Spanish. 
 The reverberations of the workers' victory are likely to be felt for months as plants continue to close. Bob Bruno, director of the labor studies program at the University of Illinois at Chicago, predicted organized labor would be emboldened by the workers' success. ''If you combine some palpable street anger with organizational resources in a changing political mood,'' he said, ''you can begin to see more of these sort of riskier, militant adventures, and they're more likely to succeed.''
 The tale of how this small band of workers came to embody the welter of emotions in the country's economic downturn is flecked with plot turns from the deepening recession, growing anger over the Wall Street bailout and difficult business calculations. The workers were not aware, for example, that Republic's owners had quietly set up a new company, Echo Windows LLC, incorporated on Nov. 18, according to records with the Illinois secretary of state's office. And Echo had bought a window and door manufacturing plant in Red Oak, Iowa. 
 Company officials in Iowa declined to comment, but Mary Lou Friedman, the human resources manager at Echo, said in a telephone interview that the factory had 102 employees, all nonunion.
 And at the last minute of negotiations, according to Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, who helped moderate talks to resolve the standoff, and union officials, Republic's chief executive, Richard Gillman, demanded that any new bank loan to help the employees also cover the lease of several of his cars -- a 2007 BMW 350xi and a 2002 Mercedes S500 are among those registered to company addresses -- as well as eight weeks of his salary, at $225,000 a year.
 The demand held up the settlement, which was reached only after Mr. Gillman agreed to back down. (Mr. Gillman said Friday that he had sought the money to offset a large bonus in 2007 that he had chosen not to accept.)
 In many ways, however, Republic was an unlikely setting for a worker uprising. Many workers interviewed, including some who had been at the plant for more than three decades, said they considered it a decent place to work. It was a mostly Hispanic work force, with some blacks. Some earned over $40,000 a year, including overtime, pulling them into the middle class and enabling them to set up 401(k) retirement accounts and buy modest homes. 
 But after Mr. Gillman took over as owner in 2006, there were several rounds of layoffs, and the number of employees fell to about 240, from more than 500. 
 The company had been affected by the declining housing market, and Mr. Gillman said it had also been affected by Chicago's higher production costs. He said he had hoped to salvage the business by buying another manufacturer in Ohio, but was turned down by Bank of America.
 ''This has been the worst week of my life,'' he said. ''I know many of those workers at Republic personally, and I put 34 years of my life into that business, and all my money, too. No stone was left unturned in our effort to save Republic.''
 By mid-October, the company had exhausted its $5 million line of credit with Bank of America, and the bank was refusing to lend the company any more money.
 ''We declined to provide an additional loan because of the company's dire financial conditions,'' said Julie Westermann, a bank spokeswoman. 
 Bank officials said Republic filed for bankruptcy on Friday. 
 In mid-November, during a late-night vigil to see where the missing equipment was going, Mark Meinster, 35, one of the factory's union organizers, broached the possibility of a sit-in with Mr. Robles, the president of the local, if the plant should be closed.
 Mr. Robles, 38, who had worked at the factory for eight years, said he was excited by the idea but also mulled the potential repercussions. ''We'd basically be trespassing on private property,'' he said. ''We might get arrested.''
 Nevertheless, Mr. Robles told Mr. Meinster that he believed most workers would participate. In the coming days, the idea would take root among other union leaders.
 On Tuesday, Dec. 2, Barry Dubin, the company's chief operating officer, delivered the final verdict to workers, telling them they would probably not be getting severance pay or be paid for accrued vacation days. Union leaders quickly moved to hash out details of an occupation.
 ''We knew keeping the windows in the warehouse was a bargaining chip,'' said Melvin Maclin, a groove cutter and vice president of the local. 
 While some workers picketed Bank of America, others began attending to their own financial worries, with many liquidating their 401(k)'s. Others cast worried eyes on their meager savings accounts.
 On Friday, union officials met with company officers and learned the workers' health insurance was being cut off.
 Later, with employees gathered in the cafeteria, Mr. Robles asked for a show of hands of how many would be willing to stay at the factory. All hands went up, with shouts of, ''Si, se puede!'' -- or ''Yes, we can!''
 ''I ain't got no other choice,'' Alexis McCoy, 32, a driver's assistant, said later. ''I have a newborn. I have to take care of my family.'' 
 Local politicians discouraged the police from arresting the workers. Exasperated company officials decided not to press the matter as the news media began arriving in droves.
 The workers organized themselves into three shifts and set up committees in charge of cleanup, security and safety. A sign was taped to a cafeteria wall banning alcohol, drugs and smoking.
 Negotiations involving the company, Bank of America and union officials began late Monday afternoon at the bank's offices downtown. 
 At the root of much of the discussions was the federal law requiring employees to be given 60 days' notice, or that amount of severance, when plants close.
 Bank officials said it was not their responsibility as lenders to ensure that the company made these payments. They said later that they had been discussing closing the plant with the company as far back as July, giving it plenty of time to fulfill its obligations to its workers.
 Nevertheless, union officials argued that Bank of America had received billions of taxpayer dollars in the recent federal bailout, meant to free up credit to companies like Republic.
 ''We never made the argument you have a legal responsibility,'' said Mr. Gutierrez, who described bank officials as willing to be helpful almost immediately. ''We said, 'Will you make a corporate responsibility decision?' ''
 Bank of America's offer to lend the company roughly $1.35 million came on Tuesday, and additional help came from William M. Daley, the brother of Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and the Midwest chairman of JPMorgan Chase, which owned 40 percent of the window company and agreed to lend an additional $400,000.
 Mr. Gillman's demands, however, became a major sticking point. ''I'm not going to describe to you the words that were used when those issues were brought up,'' Mr. Gutierrez said.
 Eventually, the parties agreed that the workers would be the only ones to benefit. They would be paid severance and for vacation, and receive two months' health coverage. The company owners also agreed to come up with $114,000 to cover the payroll for their last week of work. 
 When union negotiators returned to the factory on Wednesday evening with the agreement, the workers approved it unanimously. They emerged from the factory chanting, ''Yes, we did!''

HEADLINE: U.S. Markets Turn Up After Early Losses

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Matthew Saltmarsh and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Is Wall Street developing a thicker skin?
The market surprise on Friday morning was an 11th-hour rejection of the automaker bailout that investors had been expecting would pass.
While stocks fell sharply at first, sending the Dow Jones industrials down 200 points, they gradually turned higher. By the end of the day, the blue-chip index had managed a 65-point gain.
Investors were emboldened by remarks from federal officials who assured that they would not let the Detroit auto industry collapse, including comments from the White House that it would consider drawing on the $700 billion that Congress already approved for assistance to banks and financial institutions. 
But some analysts have been saying that investors have priced in a recession, and Wall Street's relatively quiet close on Friday suggested as much. That would be a change from October and November, when even minor omens of gloom led to declines of hundreds of points.
The possibility of bankruptcy filings by two automakers -- General Motors and Chrysler -- could have major consequences for the domestic job market and the global economy, as well as stoking fears of deflation.
But the comments from the White House, along with gains in technology and financial stocks, helped ease some of the anxiety. The Dow finished up 64.59 points, or 0.75 percent, at 8,629.68.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 6.14 points or 0.7 percent, to 879.73, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 32.84 points, or 2.18 percent, at 1,540.72, bolstered by big gains in stocks like Google and Yahoo.
For the week, the Dow ended down 0.07 percent; the S.& P. 500 rose 0.42 percent, and the Nasdaq gained 2.08 percent.
General Motors shares swung wildly on Friday. They dropped more than 20 percent in premarket trading, then briefly turned higher before closing down 4.4 percent at $3.94 a share. Ford Motor's shares gained 4.8 percent to finish the week at $3.04 a share. Chrysler is not publicly traded.
The declines were more pronounced in Europe and Asia, where benchmark bourses fell sharply. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 share average ended 5.6 percent lower, with the bulk of the selling occurring after it became clear that the bailout negotiations in the Senate had failed. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slumped 5.5 percent.
European stocks ended lower as well, with the major indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt all down more than 2 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London fell 2.5 percent; the German DAX-20 was off 2.2 percent; and the CAC 40 in Paris slid 2.8 percent.
Oil prices slipped $1.70 to $46.28 a barrel in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Energy prices moved higher this week as investors bet that new public works spending in the United States would raise demand.
Investors also had to grapple with a pair of downcast economic reports on Friday. Producer prices fell more than expected in November. The 2.2 percent drop was led by a sharp decline in gasoline prices, which should offer some relief to businesses. But economists are concerned about the prospect of deflation, a period of sustained price drops that can hurt the economy.
A separate report said that retail sales in November fell 1.8 percent, less than expected.
Stocks are up 9 percent since Nov. 20. Some analysts call the winning streak a bear market rally -- a temporary reprieve amid a broader downturn -- although a brave few have proffered predictions that the bottom of the market crash had already been reached.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bill rose 9/32, to 110 8/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.57 percent, down from 2.60 percent late Thursday.
A major test could come on Tuesday, when policy makers at the Federal Reserve meet. Investors expect the central bankers to lower their benchmark interest rate. On Dec. 23, the Commerce Department will release its first estimate of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter. Many economists are bracing for a contraction of as much as 5 percent, which could be the worst quarter since 1982.
Shares in European automakers plunged, after similar declines in Asia. In Europe, shares in the French auto giant Renault were down 7.2 percent while Volkswagen, the German carmaker, was down 0.7 percent.
Shares in Toyota Motor and Nissan fell more than 10 percent and Honda plunged 13.4 percent, while Hyundai in South Korea was 7.7 percent lower.

HEADLINE: Getting Into the Tank With a Pool Shark

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
I CIRCLED table No. 26 at Amsterdam Billiards and Bar, clutching a cue stick and hoping against experience. It was a dank, dark early December afternoon in Lower Manhattan. The 4.5 foot-by-9 foot expanse of green felt in front of my eyes was illuminated by a rectangular halo of stark white light. ''Human,'' a hit song by a band called the Killers, was pounding over the sound system.
 ''Are we human or are we dancer?'' wailed the Killers' lead singer. ''My sign is vital, my hands are cold, and I'm on my knees looking for the answer.'' 
 Though still on my feet, I faced a similar predicament: I was embroiled in a nine-ball match against Tony Robles, a k a ''The Silent Assassin,'' the best professional billiards player in New York. A 42-year-old teetotaler with a trim goatee and piercing brown eyes, Tony has won 30 major tournaments. I, on the other hand, am a 57-year-old amateur billiards buff who once danced ballet and plays almost exclusively with close friends under the influence of adult beverages. 
 But my far more accomplished opponent was proving that he was also human. After winning Game 1 rather handily, Tony had begun Game 2 by sinking eight balls in a row. Then he had missed a tricky three-cushion bank shot on the nine ball. That had given me an unexpected opening. All I had to do was sink the nine ball and the score would be tied. 
 Of course, the shot at hand was no sure thing. Tony had left the cue ball close to the near right corner pocket; the nine ball was parked against the rail a few inches away from the far left corner pocket. I had to knock the cue ball almost the entire length of the table and make it ''cut'' the nine ball at exactly the right spot.
 I stopped my circling, and chalked the tip of my cue, suddenly realizing that I was happier and more clearheaded than I had been in a long time. A game of billiards is a total immersion experience for mind and body. It demands the concentration of chess, the risk management of poker and the touch of golf. The sound of clicking balls seems to make the incessant clamoring of the outside world at least temporarily go away.
 Billiards is also a uniquely noble executive pursuit with a long and glorious tradition. According to Victor Stein, co-author of ''The Billiard Encyclopedia: An Illustrated History of the Sport,'' it traces its origins to Egyptian ground and table games contested in the royal court circa 3300 B.C.
 ''It looked like a sport, but it was actually a magical cult,'' Mr. Stein had informed me in an interview at nearby Blatt Billiards, a leading equipment maker. ''The staff carried by a priest, which was the forerunner of the cue, represented his connection to God. The balls represented the spheres in the heavens. The game was all about manipulating spheres.''
 The roster of my fellow billiards players was a who's who of political potentates, great thinkers, artistic geniuses and celebrities. It included the likes of Louis XIV, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Immanuel Kant, Mozart, Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Bob Hope, Jackie Gleason, 50 Cent, Jerry Seinfeld, Eric Clapton, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mary, Queen of Scots. 
 Although billiards first proliferated in Europe, it enjoyed its heyday in New York at the turn of the 20th century when there were 4,000 pool rooms in the city, according to Mr. Stein. The popularity of billiards declined drastically with the advent of television, electronic games and other forms of indoor entertainment. Today, there are fewer than 30 pool rooms in New York, Mr. Stein said.
 But during the current economic crisis, billiards appears to be making a comeback. Mr. Stein estimated that there were 40 million players in the United States and 500 million players worldwide. Greg Hunt, who owns Amsterdam Billiards and Bar in partnership with the comedian David Brenner, told me that his business had been booming lately with more than 3,000 weekly customers. ''Investment bankers who used to rent houses in the Hamptons are spending their weekends in here,'' he said.
 In fact, billiards is cheap entertainment compared with attending sporting events or movies. At Amsterdam Billiards, table rental rates start at $6.25 an hour per person on weekdays and peak at $9.75 an hour on weekends. Amsterdam has the ambience of an upscale sports bar furnished with Oriental rugs and a dozen television screens. And it has a competitive legacy: a former waitress there, Jeanette Lee, a k a ''The Black Widow,'' is among the world's top-ranked female players. 
 I had sought out Tony Robles because I was looking for an edge against my pool-playing buddies back on eastern Long Island, all of whom have decades more experience than I do. Tony's lesson rates are just $75 an hour, and he doles out tips with an unfeigned modesty and sense of wonder.
 ''I can explain 98 percent of the game, but that other 2 percent,'' he confided, pausing to tap a finger to his forehead, ''it's right here, but I can't explain it.''
 During two hours of lessons preceding our nine-ball challenge match, Tony insisted that we focus on the fundamentals. He showed me how to form a proper ''open bridge'' with my left hand by making a fist and then spreading my fingers on the felt. He advised me to keep my right hand grip extremely soft. ''If you can lift the cue from the butt end, you're holding it too tight,'' he said. 
 In keeping with the sport's mystical origins, Tony showed me the secret of aiming angle shots by visualizing a so-called ghost ball adjacent to my intended object ball. As he explained, most amateurs aim at the same spot on the object ball that they would target if they were hitting it directly with the tip of the cue stick. But this faulty technique fails to account for the fact that both the cue ball and the object ball are 2 1/4 inches in diameter, and that the selected aim spot on the object ball must be struck half a diameter, or 1 1/8 inches, from the center of the cue ball.
 I put the ghost ball technique to the test in the second game of our afternoon match, and lo and behold, it worked like a magic charm. Despite the length and sharp angle of my shot on the nine ball, I made the cue ball cut it into the center of the corner pocket to win the game.
 In retrospect, I should have ginned up an excuse to quit right there. Tony sank two balls off the break to start Game 3. He left me a lengthy angle shot at the end of his first turn, but I proved unable to conjure the appropriate ''ghost ball.'' After my miss, Tony ran the table, sinking the remaining seven balls in rapid succession. 
 Miraculously enough, I managed to sink a ball off the break to start Game 4. I seemed to get on a roll, sinking two more balls in a row. Then I missed a relatively easy shot. Tony sank five balls in less than 60 seconds. The nine ball was now parked directly in front of a corner pocket. But instead of shooting straight at it, he made the cue ball bank off four cushions en route to cutting the nine into the pocket to secure victory.
 ''You showed some real talent,'' Tony allowed as we shook hands after the match. ''But you need to keep practicing.''
 Tony added that I also needed a nickname like his if I hoped to become a pool shark. And although it did not have quite the same ring as ''The Silent Assassin,'' I figured it would have to do for a guy like me. From now on, according to Tony, I would be known as ''The Hurt Man.''

HEADLINE: New-Look Yankees Add Burnett

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
Early Friday night, the Yankees announced two roster moves. There was no mention of A. J. Burnett or C. C. Sabathia, but the team effectively sent eviction notices to players occupying the roster spots of those star pitchers. Chris Britton and Justin Christian were not tendered contracts, and the underlying message was unmistakable: it is time to make way for the big boys.
 Two days after reaching an agreement with Sabathia on a seven-year, $161 million contract, the Yankees came to terms with another projected anchor for their starting rotation. Burnett, the talented but injury-prone right-hander, agreed to a five-year, $82.5 million deal. 
 Like Sabathia, Burnett will not officially become a Yankee until he passes a physical exam and until final contract details are complete. But the Yankees have shown again how serious they are about correcting the major deficiency that kept them from the playoffs for the first time since 1993.
 Only two Yankees made more than 20 starts last season -- Mike Mussina, who retired, and Andy Pettitte, who met with General Manager Brian Cashman in Houston on Thursday but has yet to accept a one-year, $10 million offer to return. The rotation needed major renovations, and the Yankees are nearly finished.
 Burnett turns 32 next month, which if Pettitte does not return would make him the oldest member of a suddenly imposing rotation in which none of the pitchers can be considered past his prime. Sabathia and Chien-Ming Wang are 28, and Joba Chamberlain is 23. 
 Still, Wang tore a tendon in his foot last season, and Chamberlain hurt his shoulder. Burnett is no stranger to injuries himself. He has been on the disabled list 10 times in 10 years, with a career-high of 12 victories until last season, when he went 18-10 with a 4.07 earned run average for the Toronto Blue Jays.
 In late September, some Yankees players dined with Burnett, knowing that he could be a free agent. Burnett had dominated the Yankees on the field, and he made a strong impression in person, too. He opted out of his contract in November and attracted interest from several teams.
 The Yankees first seemed more interested in Derek Lowe, but Lowe, at age 35, wanted $18 million a season. In Burnett, who also drew strong interest from the Atlanta Braves, the Yankees chose a different kind of pitcher.
 Lowe is an older ground-ball specialist who never gets hurt. Burnett is a younger power pitcher who often gets hurt, the classic risk-reward gamble. Four years ago, the Yankees signed Carl Pavano after an 18-victory season, despite a history of injuries. Pavano broke down almost immediately.
 ''After the Pavano thing -- I know he's got better stuff than Pavano, but I guess they were really anxious to rebuild that rotation,'' said one American League scout, who was granted anonymity so he could speak candidly about another team.
 ''One thing about Burnett, though, is that a lot of free agents or potential-trade guys seem to be leery of pitching in the American League. It seems like the money was relatively even with Atlanta, and this is a guy who's staying, and who performed in the American League East. That's pretty important.''
 At the winter meetings in Las Vegas this week, Burnett's agent, Darek Braunecker, said Burnett had not had a structural injury since having reconstructive elbow surgery in 2003, adding that his last injury -- a sore shoulder in 2007 -- was due to overuse.
 Most important, Braunecker said, was Burnett's maturation as a pitcher, knowing when to throw his fastball at 98 miles an hour and when to pitch at a slower speed. His work between starts has also gotten more sophisticated.
 ''He's at that point now where he's finally figured out it's a 162-game grind,'' Braunecker said, ''and there are certain ways you have to go about maintaining yourself during the course of a season.''
 Burnett has been at his best against the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. He is 5-0 with a 2.56 E.R.A. in eight career starts against Boston, and he is 6-3 with a 2.43 E.R.A. in 11 starts against the Yankees, including 3-1 last season. Whenever the Yankees faced him, their hitters seemed to be in awe.
 ''He was throwing pellets,'' Alex Rodriguez said in August after Burnett struck out 13 in eight innings to beat the Yankees, 2-1. ''He was 0-2 on everybody, throwing in the high- to mid-90s, and then he had a snake for a breaking ball. Give him credit.''
 Burnett finished as the A.L. leader in strikeouts, with 231, and ranked third in innings, with 221 1/3. It was the third season of a five-year, $55 million deal with Toronto that included the opt-out clause he exercised. Burnett went 10-8 in each of the first two seasons of the contract, making 21 starts the first season and 25 the next.
 In his career, Burnett is 87-76 with a 3.81 E.R.A. Drafted by the Mets in 1995, he was traded to Florida for Al Leiter in 1998.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Are Victims, Raising Further Questions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Frauds on Wall Street aren't unheard of. But a $50 billion Ponzi scheme, one that prosecutors say struck at boldface names on several continents, is a bombshell by any standard.
 The case against Bernard L. Madoff, the respected longtime trader accused of running one of the biggest frauds in Wall Street history, has been Topic A in the investor community. But close behind is a heated discussion of how the sordid drama will affect the already-battered community of hedge funds and other investment firms -- many of which invested with Mr. Madoff.
 Mr. Madoff's case could hardly have come at a worse time for hedge funds. The whipsawing markets and suddenly unfriendly lenders have already taken their toll on high financiers, and many have already suffered what amounts to runs on the bank by investors clamoring to withdraw their investments. 
 ''It can't help but have the effect of further chipping away at the confidence that the investor community has in the hedge fund industry,'' said Ralph L. Schlosstein, the chief executive of Highview Investment Group, a money management firm and a former president of BlackRock. ''But like many things that come at moments of fragility, its impact is magnified.''
 The collapse of Mr. Madoff's firm took the vast majority of investors by surprise. Mr. Madoff, once the largest market maker on the Nasdaq stock market, was known for his modest demeanor and, perhaps more important, his steady and overwhelmingly positive returns. That in turn appears to have attracted scores of investors, from Palm Beach country clubs to Manhattan social circles.
 It is difficult to map out the swath of damage that the Madoff firm's collapse is likely to cut through the hedge fund industry, not to mention a wide range of other investors. But among its biggest investors were funds of funds, firms that invest in several hedge funds and are nominally among the most sophisticated judges of character in the industry. Because Mr. Madoff reported consistently positive returns for more than a decade -- some say impossibly so -- he drew vast amounts of business from them. 
 Now, the collateral damage is likely to add to the chaos that has already been ravaging hedge funds. Spooked by losses and forced to raise cash quickly as the financial crisis ballooned, investors have sought to pull out their money from hedge funds, causing serious pain, and even some forced closures. A growing list of large, well-known firms have sought to block redemption requests in an effort to stem a mass exodus of investors who now desperately want to get into cash. 
 In a letter sent Friday, the Citadel Investment Group said it was halting redemptions at its two largest hedge funds through March 31.
 Confidence will only weaken further with the Madoff firm scandal, intensifying pain for the industry.
 ''If you couple this with the deleveraging already, this means one thing: more redemptions,'' said Campbell R. Harvey, a professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University.
 The losses from the Madoff firm will also raise more questions about how well funds of funds perform due diligence, a concern already magnified by losses in the hedge fund industry. 
 ''Funds of funds that invested in Madoff will get a double whammy,'' said Whitney Tilson, who runs the T2 Partners hedge fund. ''Not only will they have to take a loss, but they are going to have to do an awful lot of explaining for how they ever got fooled here.''
 Indeed, while many investors are asking how regulators could have missed a towering Ponzi scheme, some are beginning to question the whole process of due diligence. Several potential investors had raised questions about Mr. Madoff's claims of steady returns over the years, but regulators apparently took few steps to investigate.
 ''Where were the auditors?'' asked Bill Grayson, the president of Falcon Point Capital, a hedge fund based in San Francisco. ''Where was his chief compliance officer? Where was the S.E.C.?''
 Already under heightened scrutiny, the collapse of the Madoff firm is likely to propel calls for greater regulation of the hedge fund industry, beyond the current optional registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 What's more, many investors in hedge funds are likely to ask tougher questions of the managers of these firms. Executives who are loath to disclose their investment strategies -- instead running a ''black box'' model, as Mr. Madoff infamously did -- will probably come under increased pressure to open the lid on their operations, at least a little bit.
 ''I suspect that many investors are going to start asking many more questions of their managers,'' Mr. Tilson said. ''They will be much less tolerant of black box managers.''
 Still, some disagree that Mr. Madoff's arrest will lead to widespread contagion throughout the industry. Mr. Tilson argued that most investors would see the case as an unusual circumstance whose breadth and brazenness is unlikely to be duplicated. ''This is not a Lehman Brothers,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Training in West Africa Aims to Stave Off Extremists

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: KATI, Mali 

 BODY:
Thousands of miles from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, another side of America's fight against terrorism is unfolding in this remote corner of West Africa. American Green Berets are training African armies to guard their borders and patrol vast desolate expanses against infiltration by Al Qaeda's militants, so the United States does not have to. 
 A recent exercise by the United States military here was part of a wide-ranging plan, developed after the Sept. 11 attacks, to take counterterrorism training and assistance to places outside the Middle East, like the Philippines and Indonesia. In Africa, a five-year, $500 million partnership between the State and Defense Departments includes Algeria, Chad, Mauritania, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Tunisia, and Libya is on the verge of joining. 
 American efforts to fight terrorism in the region also include nonmilitary programs, like instruction for teachers and job training for young Muslim men who could be singled out by militants' recruiting campaigns. 
 One goal of the program is to act quickly in these countries before terrorism becomes as entrenched as it is in Somalia, an East African nation where there is a heightened militant threat. And unlike Somalia, Mali is willing and able to have dozens of American and European military trainers conduct exercises here, and its leaders are plainly worried about militants who have taken refuge in its vast Saharan north. 
 ''Mali does not have the means to control its borders without the cooperation of the United States,'' Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, a former prime minister, said in an interview. 
 Mali, a landlocked former French colony that is nearly twice the size of Texas with roughly half the population, has a relatively stable, though still fragile, democracy. But it borders Algeria, whose well-equipped military has chased Qaeda militants into northern Mali, where they have adopted a nomadic lifestyle, making them even more difficult to track.
 With only 10,000 people in its military and other security forces, and just two working helicopters and a few airplanes, Mali acknowledges how daunting a task it is to try to drive out the militants. 
 The biggest potential threat comes from as many as 200 fighters from an offshoot of Al Qaeda called Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which uses the northern Malian desert as a staging area and support base, American and Malian officials say. 
 About three months ago, the Qaeda affiliate threatened to attack American forces that operated north of Timbuktu (or Tombouctou) in Mali's desert, three Defense Department officials said. One military official said the threat contributed to a decision to shift part of the recent training exercise out of that area. 
 The government of neighboring Mauritania said 12 of its soldiers were killed in an attack there by militants in September. By some accounts, the soldiers were beheaded and their bodies were booby-trapped with explosives. 
 Two Defense Department officials expressed fear that a main leader of the Qaeda affiliate in Mali, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, was under growing pressure to carry out a large-scale attack, possibly in Algeria or Mauritania, to establish his leadership credentials within the organization. 
 Members of the Qaeda affiliate have not attacked Malian forces, and American and Malian officials privately acknowledge that military officials here have adopted a live-and-let-live approach to the Qaeda threat, focusing instead on rebellious Tuareg tribesmen, who also live in the sparsely populated north. 
 To finance their operations, the militants exact tolls from smugglers whose routes traverse the Qaeda sanctuary, and collect ransoms in kidnappings. In late October, two Austrians were released after a ransom of more than $2 million was reportedly paid. They had been held in northern Mali after being seized in southern Tunisia in February. 
 Because of the militants' activities, American officials eye the largely ungoverned spaces of Mali's northern desert with concern. 
 This year, the United States Agency for International Development is spending about $9 million on counterterrorism measures here. Some of the money will expand an existing job training program for women to provide young Malian men in the north with the basic skills to set up businesses like tiny flour mills or cattle enterprises. Some aid will train teachers in Muslim parochial schools in an effort to prevent them from becoming incubators of anti-American vitriol.
 The agency is also building 12 FM radio stations in the north to link far-flung villages to an early-warning network that sends bulletins on bandits and other threats. Financing from the Pentagon will produce, in four national languages, radio soap operas promoting peace and tolerance. 
 ''Young men in the north are looking for jobs or something to do with their lives,'' said Alexander D. Newton, the director of A.I.D.'s mission in Mali. ''These are the same people who could be susceptible to other messages of economic security.'' 
 Concern about Mali's vulnerability also brought a dozen Army Green Berets from the 10th Special Forces Group in Germany, as well as several Dutch and German military instructors, to Mali for the two-week training exercise that ended last month. 
 Just before noon on a recent sunny, breezy day, Malian troops swept onto a training range here on the savannah north of Bamako, the capital, aboard two CV-22 Ospreys, rotor-blade transport aircraft flown by Air Force Special Operations crews from Hurlburt Field, Fla. 
 As the dull-gray aircraft landed in a swirling cloud of dust, rotors whomp-whomping, the Malians disembarked single file from the rear ramp in dark-green camouflage uniforms and helmets, M-4 assault rifles at the ready. (The Malians normally use AK-47s, but used American-issue M-4's for this exercise.) 
 After a mile-long march through savannah grass, the troops walked down a hill into a small valley. Their target -- the mock hide-out of the insurgents -- was in sight. But what the Malians did not know was that their American instructors were lying in wait, and suddenly attacked the troops with a sharp staccato of small-arms fire (plastic paint bullets), with red flares soaring high overhead. 
 The make-believe skirmish lasted just a few minutes. The Malians, shouting to one another and firing at their attackers, retreated from the ambush rather than try to fight through it. 
 ''We're still learning,'' said Capt. Yossouf Traore, a 28-year-old commander, speaking in English that he learned in Texas and at Fort Benning, Ga., as a visiting officer. ''We're getting a lot of experience in leadership skills and making decisions on the spot.'' 
 Even more significant, Captain Traore said, was that the exercise gave his troops an unusual opportunity to train with soldiers from neighboring Senegal. Soon after the Ospreys returned to whisk the Malian soldiers from the training range, two planeloads of Senegalese troops arrived to carry out the same maneuvers. 
 Still, worrisome indicators are giving some Malian government and religious leaders, as well as American officials, pause about the country's ability to deal with security risks. 
 Mali is the world's fifth-poorest country and, according to some statistics from the United Nations and the State Department, is getting poorer. One in five Malian children dies before age 5. The average Malian does not live to celebrate a 50th birthday. The country's population, now at 12 million, is doubling nearly every 20 years. Literacy rates hover around 30 percent and are much lower in rural areas. 
 There are also small signs that radical clerics are beginning to make inroads into the tolerant form of Islam practiced here for centuries by Sunni Muslims. The number of Malian women wearing all-enveloping burqas is still small, but the increase in the past few years is noticeable, religious leaders say. 
 New mosques are springing up, financed by conservative religious organizations in Saudi Arabia, Libya and Iran, and scholarships offered to young Malian men to study in those countries are on the rise, Malian officials say. 
 In Imam Mahamadou Diallo's neighborhood in Bamako, a congested, fume-choked city on the Niger River, a simmering debate is under way. Imam Diallo, 48, said that two new mosques had been built in his area with financing from Wahhabi extremist groups in Saudi Arabia, and that they were drawing away some members of his mosque. 
 ''Many people here are poor and don't have work,'' Imam Diallo said through an interpreter in Bambara, one of the local languages. ''They're potentially vulnerable to these Wahhabi people coming in with money.'' 
 Just down a bumpy, reddish dirt road, however, the leader of one of these newer mosques, Al Nour, quarreled with Imam Diallo's characterization. Ali Abdourohmome Cisse, the imam since Al Nour opened in 2002, said he did not know who had financed its construction. He added that no one on his staff, including an Egyptian assistant who helps conduct Friday Prayer in Arabic, advocated any form of extremism. 
 At El Mouhamadiya, an Islamic school in the neighborhood, more than 700 students, ages 4 to 25, take classes including math, physics and Arabic. ''But we don't train them in terrorism,'' said Broulaye Sylla, 25, an administrator. ''We don't talk about jihad.'' 
 Mahmoud Dicko, president of the High Council of Islam in Bamako, acknowledged over soft drinks in his second-story office that the influence of conservative Sunni and even Shiite groups had become more visible, but he said they did not pose a serious threat to Malian society. 
 ''Their influence has limits because of the importance of cultural ties here in Mali,'' he said. ''We have a tolerant Islam here, a pacifist Islam.'' 
 American and African diplomats here said Mali was one of the few countries in the region that had good relations with most neighbors, making it a likely catalyst for the broader regional security cooperation the United States is trying to foster. American commanders expressed confidence that by training together, the African forces might work together against transnational threats like Al Qaeda. While Mali has no effective helicopter fleet, for instance, it could team up its soldiers with better-equipped neighboring armies, like Algeria's, to combat a common threat. 
 ''If we don't help these countries work together, it becomes a much more difficult problem,'' said Lt. Col. Jay Connors, the senior American Special Forces officer on the ground here during the exercise. 
 American and Malian officials acknowledged that there were other hurdles to overcome. The Pentagon needs to better explain the role of its new Africa Command, created in October to oversee military activities on the continent, and to dispel fears that the United States is militarizing its foreign policy, Malian officials said. 
 American officials say their strategy is to contain the Qaeda threat and train the African armies, a process that will take years. The nonmilitary counterterrorism programs are just starting, and it is too early to gauge results. 
 ''This is a long-term effort,'' said Colonel Connors, 45, an Africa specialist from Burlington, Vt., who speaks French and Portuguese. ''This is crawl, walk, run, and right now, we're still in the crawl phase.''

HEADLINE: Key Player in Murder Case Is Arrested in a Robbery

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
Once again, Queens prosecutors may be scratching their heads and wondering what to make of Michael Green.
 Mr. Green, 47, who lives in Far Rockaway, helped overturn one of their murder convictions this summer when he produced a tape of someone confessing to the 1994 killing for which Kareem Bellamy was in prison. 
 Then last week, Mr. Green became a star witness in the prosecution's effort to restore Mr. Bellamy's conviction when he testified at a hearing that the tape that freed Mr. Bellamy was a fraud.
 But on Thursday -- less than a week after saying that he had admitted the tape was fraudulent because he wanted to do the right thing -- Mr. Green may have undercut his credibility. He was arrested and charged with breaking into a 56-year-old Queens woman's apartment on Sunday, holding a knife to her throat and demanding money, a spokesman for the Queens district attorney's office said.
 The spokesman said Mr. Green told the woman, ''Sorry, it's the economy.''
 Mr. Green, who is charged with burglary and robbery, took money from the woman's wallet and from her home, the spokesman said. 
 Mr. Green learned that the police were looking for him after a witness identified him as an attacker, said Eugene M. Guarino, his lawyer. Mr. Green turned himself in Thursday night, Mr. Guarino said, and the victim picked him out of a lineup.
 Mr. Guarino declined to comment further on the case.
 The accusations against Mr. Green came amid a hearing before Justice Joel L. Blumenfeld of State Supreme Court in Queens to determine what to do with Mr. Bellamy, who is out on bail after his conviction was set aside in June.
 Mr. Green was questioned last Friday by an assistant district attorney, Brad A. Leventhal. Among the things he testified to was that he had created two fraudulent audiotapes; lied under oath; and, by remaining calm, had beaten several polygraph tests, including one about the fake tapes.
 Toward the end of his testimony, Mr. Green raised his right hand in the air and said, ''Everything I said to you today is the God heaven truth.''
 Prosecutors offered Mr. Green immunity from perjury for lying in a hearing over the summer in which he testified that the tapes were authentic.
 Mr. Green is to return to the witness stand on Jan. 5 to be questioned by Mr. Bellamy's lawyer, Steven W. Silberblatt.
 Mr. Silberblatt said that Mr. Green's arrest ''makes it awkward for the district attorney's office to rely on Mr. Green's testimony.''
 The district attorney's declined to comment on what Mr. Green's arrest meant for the Bellamy case.

HEADLINE: The Well-to-Do Get Less So, And Teenagers Feel the Crunch

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Jodi Hamilton began her senior year of high school in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., this fall on the usual prosperous footing. Her parents were providing a weekly allowance of $100 and paying for private Pilates classes, as well as a physics tutor who reported once a week to their 4,000-square-foot home.
 But in October, Jodi's mother lost her job managing a huge dental practice in the Bronx, then landed one closer to home that requires more hours for less money. Pilates was dropped, along with takeout sushi dinners, and Jodi's allowance, which covers lunch during the week, slipped to $60. Instead of having a tutor, Jodi has become a tutor, earning $150 a week through that and baby-sitting.
 ''I just thought it would be responsible to get a job and have my own money so my parents didn't have to pay for everything,'' said Jodi, who is 17. ''I always like to be saving up for something that I have my eye on -- a ring, a necklace, a handbag.'' 
 It is impossible to quantify how many affluent parents have trimmed allowances in recent months -- or how many of their offspring, in turn, have sought either formal employment or odd jobs. But interviews with dozens of teenagers, parents, educators and employers suggest that many youngsters from well-to-do families seem to have found a new work ethic as the economic crisis that has jeopardized their parents' jobs and investments has also led to less spending money for Saturday night movies or binges at Abercrombie & Fitch.
 After focusing on studies and resume-polishing extracurricular activities in recent years, these teenagers are job-seeking at the worst possible time, however, with employment of 16- to 19-year-olds at its lowest level in 61 years as out-of-work adults compete for low-paying positions. 
 ''We have the Mall at Short Hills a stone's throw away, and there are a load of kids who applied,'' said Nancy Siegel, head counselor at Millburn High School in New Jersey. ''But they are not finding the market welcoming.''
 At the marble-sheathed Westchester mall in White Plains, job applications have increased at stores including Origins, Tommy Hilfiger and the Gap, where job queries from teenagers are up 30 percent over last fall. 
 Julia Stark, a senior at Packer Collegiate Institute, a top private school in Brooklyn, said that this fall she and her friends are ''all trying to work as much as we can'' to pay for weekend restaurant dinners, a welcome break from a heavy course load and college applications.
 In Greenwich, Conn., a Web-based program that connects high school students with nearby job opportunities has attracted 100 seekers each month since September, up from 40 to 60 a month last fall. 
 ''I didn't want to bug my parents for extra cash over the long weekend,'' said Christian Rosier, a junior, who found a job on the Greenwich Student Employment Service the week before Thanksgiving that paid $50 for a few hours of moving furniture. ''I like the one-shot jobs because I can do it on a Friday afternoon and still have time to hang out with my friends on the weekend.'' 
 Teenagers from working- and middle-class families are, of course, feeling similar -- if not more acute -- pressure. Sumit Pal, 17, a senior at Information Technology High School in Queens, said his parents cut his $5 weekly allowance two months ago after the deli where his father works started to lose business. Sumit was interviewed two weeks ago for a job at a company that sponsors rock bands.
 ''I don't mind losing my allowance,'' he said. ''It goes toward other things, like groceries.''
 Teenage participation in the national labor force has fallen steadily since 1979, when 49 percent of all 16- and 17-year-olds had some kind of work; last year, the figure was 30 percent. 
 A recent study by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University showed that teenage employment from 2005 to 2007 rose with household incomes that go up to $150,000 a year: 14 percent of teenagers from families earning less than $20,000 a year work, as do 26 percent of those whose families make $60,000, 32 percent of those earning $80,000 and 33 percent of those between $120,000 and $150,000.
 Over $150,000, it drops to 28 percent. ''Research shows that the bigger allowance you get from Mom and Dad,'' explained Andrew M. Sum, director of Northeastern's center, ''the less likely you are to work.'' 
 Since the 1990s, many affluent children seeking admission to selective colleges have been discouraged from paid work, and steered instead toward volunteer service projects. Rebuilding homes in New Orleans or teaching English in developing countries, seemingly better resume fodder, supplanted after-school or summer jobs scooping ice cream or answering phones.
 ''There's been such a push to demonstrate to colleges that they're involved with activities and charities that it's almost too pedestrian to say that work is part of what I do,'' said William S. Miron, the principal at Millburn High School. 
 Brent A. Neiser of the National Endowment for Financial Education, a group based in Colorado that offers financial literacy programs, said parents tend to ''shortchange the benefits of scut work'' but that even ho-hum employment can be valuable -- and impress admissions officers. 
 ''Dress codes, rules, punctuality and being teachable is enrichment in itself,'' Mr. Neiser said. ''You're contributing to the economy, you're contributing to your personal economy and you're picking up skill sets and habits that will prepare you for your full-time employment.''
 Michael Pollack, a vice president of CBS, said that he was happy to see his 14-year-old son, Zachary, get a job at a veterinary hospital in Scarsdale, N.Y., in September, because Zachary was learning some basic lessons about money.
 ''I really want him to feel it and save it and spend it so he knows that money goes away,'' Mr. Pollack said. ''If he wants to treat all his friends to a movie, that's great. But he needs to see that it bottoms out. Where else are they going to get that experience?'' 
 Zachary, who earns $80 a weekend for 11 hours feeding and caring for animals, said that he was glad to ''help my parents with our financial situation.''
 ''Things I need, they'll buy,'' he said, ''and things I want, I'll buy.''
 Jill Tipograph, who lives in Bergen County and owns Everything Summer, a company that advises parents on camp, travel and work opportunities, said she sent her son to college in Boston this fall with a lump sum in his bank account that was supposed to last the semester. ''But he went through the money like water,'' she said. 
 So Ms. Tipograph and her husband decided to deposit a set amount once a week, and told their son to use the prepaid meal plan more often. ''We also said that if you feel you can't live on the allowance we're giving you, then please look for a part-time job,'' she added.
 He seems to be getting the message, choosing a 10-hour bus ride over a train or plane for a recent visit to a friend in Washington. 
 Kat Rosier, a single mother of boys ages 12 and 17 in Greenwich, has resisted the idea of a job for her older son, Christian, who plays hockey and rows on the crew team, even as her interior design business has suffered.
 ''Here's my dilemma,'' she explained. ''His time is so limited, and I would hate for his grades to fall this year so he could make $100 a week and then for him to not get into as good a college as he wants.''
 Still, having recently lost a job sprucing up the second home of a client who works in finance, Ms. Rosier said her family might need to adjust some habits. ''The other night Christian had eight friends over and I spent $110 on pizza,'' she said. ''I don't mind doing that, but he's got to know that the pizza budget is not $500 a month.'' 
 Christian said he was otherwise cutting back: ''If I'm hungry, I won't drive to McDonald's. I'll just eat something at home instead of spending $10 on lunch.''
 Jodi Hamilton's mother, Jill, said she had been impressed by her daughter's determination to earn, noting that ''she sent out a massive e-mail for baby-sitting and tutoring, and she got so many offers there aren't enough hours in the week.'' 
 Suddenly, the tables are turned: Two weeks ago, Ms. Hamilton borrowed $640 from Jodi.

HEADLINE: The Dreaded Fairness Doctrine

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS. 
Bob Herbert is off today.

 BODY:
Researchers recently announced the results of a study about dogs and fairness that sheds new light on the auto industry bailout debate.
 Trust me. There's going to be a connection. But first, the scientific news: Folks at the University of Vienna conducted a test in which dogs were asked to shake hands over and over and over again. If you have any experience with dogs, you will not be surprised to hear that they were absolutely delighted. And they didn't care about being paid! The opportunity to perform the same trick endlessly with a stranger in a white coat was reward enough. 
 Then the researchers brought in new dogs that were given a piece of bread as a reward for every handshake. The uncompensated dogs watched, lost their innate love of mindless repetition and grew sullen. 
 ''They get so mad that they look at you and just don't give you the paw anymore,'' said Friederike Range, one of the scientists.
 So O.K. Dogs are secretly obsessed with fairness. (And bread. Who knew?)
 Now, let's turn our attention to the U.S. Senate where a plan to bail out the auto industry went down the drain Thursday night. It was a stopgap measure, not necessarily the best bill in the world -- although it did pass my own personal quality-control test, which is to find out what Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama thinks and go the other way.
 But its defeat doesn't bode well for our prospects in coming up with a sensible response to the current economic unpleasantness. And the debate had an unnerving number of complaints about who was getting more than whom.
 ''We're going to have riots. There are already people rioting because they're losing their jobs when everybody else is being bailed out,'' said Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina.
 Some Democrats denounced the bill because they said that it was unfair that the union workers were getting dumped on while a lot of the Wall Street fat cats got to keep their golden parachutes. Republicans complained that it was unfair that General Motors paid its workers more than Toyota or Honda does. Many senators took the DeMint line and wanted to know what made the autoworkers' jobs more important than the home builders or waitresses who were getting laid off, too.
 There were so many fairness arguments that you really did expect Harry Reid to start walking down the aisle dropping pieces of toast in peoples' mouths.
 Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri threatened to vote against the bill because somebody had stuck in a provision giving federal judges a cost-of-living raise while other Americans were going without Christmas presents. ''And my phone is ringing off the hook, Mr. President,'' she said, ''from people who want to be federal judges.'' (Funny. My phone is ringing off the hook from people who want to be the U.S. senator from Illinois.)
 If you took the long view of the pay raise for judges, you'd have to say that: 1) they deserve it; 2) now isn't the best time; and 3) making a statement on the timing is not quite as important as saving several hundred thousand auto-related jobs. But in the end, the judge provision was dropped, the bill died anyway and the Bush administration will have to do something to keep the automakers afloat until Barack Obama becomes president. Which, although I know it's hard to believe, is eventually going to happen.
 The really hard lifting still lies ahead, and we cannot possibly do it if we're going to dwell too much on the fairness thing. It's just too easy for lawmakers to dodge the tough vote by reminding their constituents that somebody else is getting more breaks than they are.
 Which somebody always is. If Senator DeMint's constituents are going to riot over a bailout for the auto industry, they'll wind up being met by tool-and-die makers waving torches and yelling about soybean subsidies. If the lawmakers from Alabama say their constituents do not want their tax money going to bail out Michigan, the people in Michigan are going to say that they never really enjoyed paying more taxes to the federal government than their state received in aid, while Alabama got a return of $1.61 on the dollar. And anytime a representative from the Great Plains opens his mouth, the people from New York are going to point out that while every state gets the same number of senators, there are more people waiting for a subway in Brooklyn in rush hour than inhabit all of Wyoming.
 We can really get tiresome on the subject. You don't want to go there.
 Any mammal can obsess about fairness. (Did I mention how ticked off monkeys get if they find out they're getting cucumbers while somebody in the next cage has a grape?) The real human trick is to get past the quid pro quo and try to focus on the common good.
 Set a better example, guys. It's two years until the next election.

 JURY REFUSES TO CLEAR POLICE
 In '05 Shooting in London
 A jury in London effectively rejected claims by Scotland Yard that Jean Charles de Menezes, a 27-year-old Brazilian electrician, was shot dead lawfully after he was mistakenly identified as a suspect in a failed subway bombing plot in July 2005. The finding, which comes at the end of a three-month inquest, means that the bitter controversy over the killing is likely to continue. PAGE A5
 ONLY TALK, BUT GOOD FOR CLIMATE
 The United Nations' climate talks concluded without a final agreement, but negotiators were hopeful that the meetings had put the world on track to a new climate treaty. The talks were also buoyed by signs from top United States officials that the incoming administration would play an active policy role. PAGE A7

 A Wealthy Saudi Mired in Limbo
 After the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States froze the ample worldwide assets of Yassin Kadi, a worldly Saudi businessman who was designated as a terrorist supporter, and the Saudi government told him not to leave the country. Now he is limited to the area surrounding his home in Jidda, and since Washington has never presented direct evidence against Mr. Kadi, he remains stuck in a legal limbo with no end in sight. ''When it is classified, you cannot defend yourself,'' he said. PAGE A6
 RIOTS EXPOSE ANXIETIES IN GREECE
 This week's violence in Greece and the government's sluggish response to it thrust the country's economic and political troubles to the fore. Despite widespread criticism of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis's handling of the riots, he dismissed the idea of early elections, and did not return from a European Union summit meeting, part of his strategy to diminish the riots by not straying from his normal routine.

HEADLINE: Playing Politics With the Auto Bailout

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Senate Abandons Auto Bailout Bid After G.O.P. Balks'' (front page, Dec. 12):
 The Senate Republicans' rejection of a bailout for America's Big Three automakers confirms a suspicion that many working- and middle-class Americans already had -- Republicans care little for the majority of citizens who suffer from economic crises.
 For decades, Republicans have supported corporate efforts to earn profits without accountability to working Americans. Profits and bonuses rose before the decline, often by eliminating domestic production -- and jobs -- while switching operations overseas. 
 Yet when some of our biggest domestic employers need help -- employers that actually produce something tangible, unlike Wall Street -- Republicans choose to preach rather than do something constructive. Their actions betray American workers and sabotage an already fragile economy.
 Yes, the automakers have a lot to learn, but surely not at the expense of our economic viability. It is almost inconceivable that Republicans would risk destroying some of the nation's few remaining manufacturing giants just to teach the unions a lesson. 
 Barry Moskowitz New City, N.Y., Dec. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Let it be known to the millions of people about to be out of work, to the millions of people who will find themselves on the wrong end of obtaining financing of any sort despite their good credit and to the millions of Americans who will have to pay billions more later when we finally do bail out the auto industry, that Senator Mitch McConnell refused to budge because his political goals were more important than an exercise of statesmanship in a time of crisis. 
 When, as in most crises, only bad decisions were on the table, he chose the worse of the two. Let it be known.
 Robert D. Sichta Barneveld, Wis., Dec.
 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The Senate Republicans' opposition to the bailout of the Big Three automakers confuses me. While I do understand their policy arguments, on purely political grounds it looks like suicide. 
 Most Americans ultimately will not care much either way, but those in states with high concentrations of auto workers -- Michigan, Indiana, Ohio -- surely care a lot. Can the Republicans afford more disadvantages in those three states, in addition to their long-term minority status in the Northeast, Pacific West and much of the mid-Atlantic? 
 It is telling that Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, and Richard C. Shelby, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, are both from the South. Are they unaware that their political decisions are furthering their party's sequestration to that area of the country?
 Pierre Basmaji San Diego, Dec.
 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''What's Plan B?'' (editorial, Dec. 12):
 I wonder if those who think the American automakers should fend for themselves recall that these companies provided employment for thousands of Americans during the Great Depression. Instead of demanding huge incentives to locate somewhere, they built many American communities and were stalwart philanthropists in those communities. They, and the state of Michigan, were considered the arsenal of democracy in our nation's great need. 
 I wonder if we can rely on Toyota or Honda or Hyundai or Tata Motors or Mercedes-Benz or Volkswagen in desperate times? Then again, why should I be surprised when Americans have no historical memory and a ''what have you done for me lately'' attitude? 
 Both Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman would be aghast at our willingness to jettison these American companies and cast our lot with companies and nations that are fair-weather friends.
 Thomas M. Doran Plymouth, Mich., Dec.
 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 You prefer that as a condition for aid, American automakers be forced to produce fuel-efficient vehicles. Yes, production must shift toward fuel-efficient vehicles. But accomplishing this through a diktat to manufacturers in exchange for loans and loan guarantees is not the complete answer. 
 Conditions imposed on manufacturers must be married to an energy policy that establishes a floor (via a tax) on fossil fuel prices. This would send a market signal (higher prices for fossil fuels) that would catalyze not only consumer demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles, but also development of green-tech and alternative-energy industries. Increased tax revenue might be a good thing, too.
 Stephen Shapar Washington, Dec.
 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your Dec. 9 Business Day article about car dealers opens the door on one of the most challenging impediments to growth in the American auto industry: inefficient and uninspired retail distribution.
 Though there's plenty of blame to go around in this national marketing tragedy, Mark Aleve of General Motors is correct in pointing out that if there were fewer dealerships with higher sales, they could invest more in facilities, people, training and advertising. 
 In the end, the auto industry has been caught up by a powerful change sweeping consumer markets. A long period of retail cost-cutting and price discounting has led to consistent underinvestment in broader consumer experiences. 
 Instead we've had poor service, me-too assortments, little assistance and declining trust in product quality. Luckily for Toyota, it figured all this out well before building its American retail system. 
 It's not too late for G.M., Ford and Chrysler to get back in consumers' good graces.

HEADLINE: Sound and Unsound Economies

 BODY:
Like other leaders across the country, Gov. David Paterson of New York is facing a frighteningly large hole in his state budget: a $12.5 billion deficit for the $125 billion spending plan he is set to announce next week. Deep reductions are necessary. But the sort of across-the-board, everyone-shares-the-pain cuts that Mr. Paterson has been talking about could impose too much pain on vital state functions, including higher education, and take too little out of programs that can and should be cut. 
 Here are suggestions for a more targeted process:
 CLOSE AND CONSOLIDATEThe governor can start by canceling Empire Zones, a program created to help bring jobs to poorer areas that has turned into one of the biggest boondoggles in the state. Mr. Paterson and the Legislature must finally close upstate prisons that have few or no prisoners. And a hospital consolidation plan proposed during former Gov. George Pataki's watch needs to be completed to save money and close wards with empty beds.
 It is also time for the Legislature to adopt a workable plan to consolidate New York's 10,500 overlapping governments. They can sell this to local areas as a way to cut property taxes. 
 CLEAN HOUSE It might be hard for Mr. Paterson to really cut the state work force quickly, but he can certainly start cutting -- or not filling -- top state jobs in commissions and authorities. He can also get rid of overlapping authorities and other patronage centers. Why, for example, is there an Alcohol Beverage Control Board and a State Liquor Authority? 
 HELP MASS TRANSIT AND THE ENVIRONMENTThe Legislature should pass Richard Ravitch's proposal for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, including tolls on the bridges without tolls around Manhattan and a small transportation tax for businesses. Increased licensing fees for automobiles, especially heavier ones with lower gas mileage, will provide more revenue. A surcharge on gas also makes sense while the price is down. The Legislature should quickly adopt a new expanded bottle bill to help pay for environmental needs.
 NO TAX ON STUDENTS Unions will fight for health care and education, so those areas probably will not be cut as much as they could be. Higher education will have fewer advocates. Right now Mr. Paterson wants a tuition increase to help pay for the state deficit. The state university system needs to consolidate and find more innovative ways to serve students -- whose numbers will grow during the recession. But any tuition increases should go to the schools where students are enrolled.
 GET MORE HELPThe governor, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and anybody else with clout in Washington needs to press for more federal money for the state and New York City. The Legislature also should consider asking for more from New Yorkers with a short-term millionaire's tax or a half-millionaire's tax.
 With those cuts and revenues, Governor Paterson and the Legislature could avoid the worst across-the-board reductions. Albany's leaders need to spread the pain around, yes, but that doesn't mean the poor and weak should suffer more than the rich and powerful.

HEADLINE: Starting Over, With a Second Career Goal of Changing Society

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Harvard kicked off a small but ambitious experiment this week that it hopes will become a new ''third stage'' of university education. For the student-fellows in the program, most in their 50s and early 60s, the goal is a second-act career in a new stage of life.
 The 14 fellows have resumes brimming with achievement -- including a former astronaut, a former senior official at the United States Agency for International Development, a physician-entrepreneur from Texas, a former public utility official from California, a former health minister from Venezuela and a former computer executive from Switzerland.
 They gathered at Harvard on Thursday to begin the yearlong program intended to help them learn how to be successful social entrepreneurs or leaders of nonprofit organizations focused on social problems like poverty, health, education and the environment. Their interests include sickle cell anemia, women's education in Africa, health care quality and water conservation. 
 The opportunity, the fellows say, is to pick up new knowledge, skills and professional relationships in a new realm. To Charles F. Bolden Jr., one of the fellows, it has the potential to be as life-changing as his selection to join America's space program nearly three decades ago. ''The Harvard program feels sort of like that,'' said Mr. Bolden, 62, a retired major general in the United States Marine Corps and a veteran of four space shuttle missions.
 The program, called the Harvard Advanced Leadership Initiative, is a collaboration among five of the university's professional schools -- business, law, government, education and public health. It is seen as a next stage for universities, beyond undergraduate and then graduate and professional schools. 
 If successful, Harvard professors say, it can serve as a model for schools at other universities, creating case studies and course material.
 ''This is about deploying a leadership force to have an impact on major social problems,'' said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at the Harvard Business School who heads the program. ''We want to make the case to the world that experience matters.''
 The recession, to be sure, is going to make things tougher for social entrepreneurs, as it has for profit-seeking start-ups. Vivian Lowery Derryck, 63, a former A.I.D. administrator for Africa, had incorporated a new nongovernmental organization earlier this year, before joining the fellowship program. Her organization's purpose, she said, would be to forge government and corporate partnerships to address social issues in Africa, like education. This summer, Ms. Derryck said, she spoke to multinational corporations that expressed an interest in contributing. But after the financial collapse, she worried that money might be scarce.
 Still, the nonprofit sector tends to hold up reasonably well in recessions, experts say. The demand for social services grows in bad times, and while contributions will surely drop over the next year or so, they expect the long-term trend of growth to return eventually. In addition, experts say, a shortage of experienced leaders and management is a chronic problem in nonprofit organizations as they become larger and increasingly complex.
 Nonprofit organizations face a collective ''leadership deficit'' over the next decade of more than 600,000 senior managers, the Bridgespan Group, a nonprofit organization that advises foundations and nonprofit groups, has estimated. 
 The Harvard program is aimed at the upper tier of that leadership gap. ''This initiative is path-breaking and has enormous potential if it is done properly,'' said Thomas J. Tierney, the chairman of Bridgespan. 
 The Harvard experiment is part of a larger effort to help find productive ''next'' careers for a coming flood of retiring baby boomers -- more than 75 million people born from 1946 to 1964. Many of them resist the traditional retirement ideal of leisure and travel.
 Indeed, more than five million Americans who are 44 to 70 are already engaged in a stage of work after their first careers that has a social impact, mainly in education, health care, government and other nonprofit organizations, according to a survey this year by Peter D. Hart Research Associates.
 Such later-in-life, second acts have been called ''encore careers,'' ''postcareers'' and ''engaged retirement.'' No matter the name, the concept seems to have considerable appeal, encouraged by celebrity role models like Bill Gates and Bill Clinton. 
 Half of Americans age 50 to 70 want to find work that has a social impact after their primary career ends, according to a poll by Princeton Survey Research Associates.
 ''There is a pretty significant pool of interest and the question is whether they will be able to act on that interest in large numbers,'' said Marc Freedman, chief executive of Civic Ventures, a nonprofit organization whose programs and research focus on social careers for baby boomers.
 Civic Ventures and other groups have sponsored programs at community colleges to develop initiatives that match people's experience and skills to later-in-life careers in education, health care and social services.
 The Harvard program, along with the community college efforts, represents ''the fitful creation of institutions and pathways for this new stage of engagement and purpose in the second half of life,'' Mr. Freedman said.
 The fellows in the leadership program come to Harvard with varying degrees of certainty about their next step. But all say they hope to use the course work, tutorials and field trips to become more effective social entrepreneurs. Next November, each fellow is expected to deliver not a dissertation, but a business plan of action.
 Hans Ulrich Maerki, 62, a Swiss citizen, retired in April as the chairman of I.B.M. operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He has traveled widely across those regions, met with heads of state and worked on applying technology to fields like education, health care and energy. As yet, he said, he has no particular project in mind, but is eager to explore the possibilities at Harvard, though he confesses to some anxiety. ''I haven't sat on a school bench in 40 years.'' 
 Susan Leal, 59, the former general manager of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, is a water expert. She is coming to Harvard to explore fresh thinking to the challenges of water management -- rising demand, aging infrastructure and inadequate investment. Ms. Leal said she might write a book or found or join an advisory group. ''I just haven't figured out the vehicle yet,'' she said.
 Dr. Charles R. Denham, 52, is already a successful social entrepreneur. He has a thriving consulting firm that works with companies on health care information technology and finances his nonprofit Texas Medical Institute of Technology, a research and education organization dedicated to improving health care quality in hospitals. Dr. Denham wants to pass on what he has learned, but also consult Harvard's experts to become more productive. ''I want orders of magnitude improvement in the efficiency of what I do,'' he said.
 For the Harvard program itself, the long-term measure of success will be what it produces. Fourteen fellows is a start, but Mr. Tierney of Bridgespan said the program must eventually generate a few hundred role models. ''The imperative is to go from the few to the many,'' Mr. Tierney said. ''The issue is how you scale up, how you get a multiplier effect.''
 Within Harvard, there is a strong sense that developing this third stage of education must be part of theevolving mission of leading universities. ''It may be a steep hill to climb to success, but this has to be part of the 21st-century educational plan,'' said Charles J. Ogletree, a professor at the Harvard Law School.
 There is also a personal incentive for many of the faculty as well. ''All of us are motivated to some degree by that fact that we're at or near this stage in our own lives,'' said David Gergen, 66, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government. ''We want to know how to go through this and how to help others to go through this to have more of an impact.''

The League of Conservation Voters, starved for good news after eight years of the Bush administration's environmental policies, has hailed President-elect Barack Obama's choices for his top energy and environmental jobs as ''a Green Dream Team.'' Let's hope it is. 
 There is no question what this team must do -- mount a strong offensive on climate change, fashion a more efficient energy system, seek out and invest in next-generation, transformative technologies. These are extraordinarily difficult tasks that will face resistance from industry and many in Congress. 
 Mr. Obama's advisers fortunately seem united in their concern for the threats facing the planet and unafraid to use the pricing power of the market or the financial power of government to address them. 
 This effort will also need the full and very public support of the president. So we are heartened by Mr. Obama's decision to name a senior White House adviser to coordinate energy and environmental policy. His choice, Carol Browner, ran President Bill Clinton's Environmental Protection Agency and did not shy from bureaucratic combat. She toughened air quality standards despite opposition from Mr. Clinton's economic advisers.
 Mr. Obama's most intriguing selection may be his choice to run the Energy Department. Steven Chu is a physicist who shared a Nobel Prize in 1997 and the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He has a sophisticated grasp of the complexities of global warming and a strong belief in fighting it aggressively. 
 Mr. Chu also has refreshingly unconventional ideas of what it would take to solve the problem. Like others, he would put a price on carbon, preferably through a cap-and-trade program, and supports the various efficiency measures -- cleaner cars, greener buildings and a modernized electrical grid -- that Mr. Obama is likely to include as part of his economic stimulus package.
 What sets him apart is his fierce conviction that innovation is just as important as regulation, and that big energy problems, like climate change and the world's dependency on fossil fuels, will not be solved without major private and public investment in the development and deployment of nonpolluting technologies.
 Mr. Obama appears to have chosen well for other essential posts, naming Lisa Jackson, until recently New Jersey's top environmental officer, to run the Environmental Protection Agency, and Nancy Sutley, who holds the top environmental post in Los Angeles, to head the White House Council on Environmental Policy. 
 These are not the passive factotums who have occupied these jobs for most of the Bush years. Both believe in using and strengthening the government's statutory authority to control greenhouse gases and the ground-level pollutants that cause smog and acid rain.
 Admirable appointments would mean little unless Mr. Obama forces these issues to the top of his agenda. Ms. Browner can work from dawn to dusk gathering good ideas, selling them to the cabinet and sending them to Capitol Hill in persuasive legislative packages. But as we've learned in the last eight years, nothing happens unless the president wants it to.

PERSON: Robin Toner 

HEADLINE: Robin Toner, 54, Times Political Reporter

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Robin Toner, who was the first woman to be the national political correspondent of The New York Times and who had a significant hand in the coverage of five presidential elections, innumerable Congressional and gubernatorial campaigns and the great legislative debates of the day, died early Friday at her home in Washington. She was 54.
 The cause was complications of colon cancer, her family said. 
 In a career of nearly 25 years at The Times, and in an age of increasing specialization, Ms. Toner reported authoritatively on almost every domestic issue, whether it was taxes, welfare, Social Security, immigration or health care policy. 
 And in a craft in which small errors are commonplace and bigger mistakes a regular occupational hazard, Ms. Toner devised a meticulous method for checking and rechecking names, dates, facts and figures in her raw copy, a step few reporters take. As a result: barely half a dozen published corrections on more than 1,900 bylined articles.
 In 1992, Ms. Toner was The Times's lead reporter on the election of Bill Clinton, a rollicking campaign in which her tough-minded coverage helped set the pace. A few years later, she became chief of correspondents on the paper's national desk in New York, coaching reporters in bureaus around the country in their coverage of state legislatures, budget deficits (or surpluses) and assorted scandals, crises and crimes.
 She later returned to the Washington bureau, where she held the rank of senior writer, and covered issues like abortion rights, racial justice and judicial nominations, with a feel for Southern politics.
 ''When you watched her work -- relentless on the phone, gnawing her fingernails to the nub, a perfectionist on the keyboard -- you'd think: a workhorse, not a showhorse,'' said Bill Keller, executive editor of The Times. ''Then you'd read the result and it would be elegant.''
 Dan Balz, her frequent competitor at The Washington Post, said her articles were ''grounded in her knowledge of what makes a good campaign, but not tethered to the language or minutiae of politics.''
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts said in a statement: ''There was rarely a day during our health care debates that I didn't open the paper to read Robin's story and learn how what we were doing impacted people.''
 Roberta Denise Toner grew up in Chadds Ford, Pa., outside Philadelphia, one of six children. Her father, Charles R. Toner, was an oil refinery supervisor and World War II B-17 pilot; her mother, the former Mary Louise Zern, was a homemaker who had worked as a Rosie the Riveter in a wartime aircraft plant. A summa cum laude graduate of Syracuse University, Ms. Toner began her reporting career in West Virginia at The Charleston Daily Mail and later worked for The Atlanta Journal and Constitution before joining The Times in 1985.
 She had empathy for underdogs, a soft spot for politicians who did the hard work and a keen appreciation of the role of caste and class in American politics. In a 2004 article, noting that all four nominees on both major party presidential tickets were rich, white men, she described John Edwards, the senator from North Carolina, as ''Atticus Finch with an attitude.'' 
 In 1994, she summed up former Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta, whom she had covered for years, as ''an extremely worldly man, whose career may have begun in the Congregational Church but who proceeded to inspire, enrage, annoy, uplift, disappoint, bewilder (but never bore) fans and critics on a much broader stage.''
 While Ms. Toner loved the game of politics, she never lost sight of the practical problems that politicians often fail to resolve. ''Reality often seemed to be just another subject for debate in the health care struggle,'' she wrote after the collapse of the Clinton administration's proposed restructuring in 1994. ''But it has a way of reasserting itself when the shouting is over. As Congress and the White House move on to lobbying reform and trade issues, a variety of experts are quietly noting that the problems that prompted the health care struggle are still, ahem, very much here.''
 It was in covering the health care debate that year that Ms. Toner met her husband, Peter Gosselin, then a reporter for The Boston Globe and now chief economics correspondent for The Los Angeles Times and the author of ''High Wire: The Precarious Financial Lives of American Families.'' 
 Mr. Gosselin survives her, as do their 11-year-old twins, Jacob and Nora. Ms. Toner is also survived by her brothers, Chuck, of Moorestown, N.J., and Mark, of Kensington, Md.; and her sisters, Gretchen Toner and Jane McConnell, both of Wilmington, Del., and Pat Lefever of West Chester, Pa.
 When her longtime Times colleague David Rosenbaum was murdered as he walked near his home in 2006, Ms. Toner described his approach to reporting in words that applied equally to hers: ''He believed that behind every arcane tax provision or line in an appropriations bill, there were real people, getting something, or getting something taken away. He believed that there was, on most stories, something approximating truth out there if you were smart enough and hungry enough to find it.''

HEADLINE: Economic Crisis Offers Hints of Executive Style

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
He will not formally take power for almost six weeks, but President-elect Barack Obama is already showing some glimpses of how he will wield it.
 Despite his professed resolve to stay at arms length from governance during the transition, the economic crisis has forced him to play a more active role -- nowhere more so than in Washington's scramble to avert the collapse of the Big Three automakers with a federal lifeline.
 From here at what an aide called his ''mini-White House,'' Mr. Obama has been pulling on the levers of power far more than any president-elect in memory, using his new stature to influence events in Congress and the real White House of President Bush and yet limited in his ability -- as the collapse of the auto bailout legislation in the Senate showed -- to control them. 
 On Friday, after Senate Republicans' opposition had doomed a $15 billion industry loan the night before, Mr. Obama called on Mr. Bush and Congress to find an alternative. Twenty-four hours earlier, Mr. Obama had used the bully pulpit of a news conference to urge Congress to approve the loan or risk ''a devastating ripple effect throughout our economy.''
 It was Mr. Obama who set the debate in motion just a week after his election, despite his reluctance to be involved directly. Amid signs that G.M. and Chrysler might not survive the year, he pressed Mr. Bush at a private meeting to support government help. In the next weeks, he directed his advisers to open lines of communication to Republicans. A White House aide said Mr. Obama speaks with Mr. Bush ''more than any of us know.''
 In both the auto debate and parallel work on his promised two-year economic recovery plan, Mr. Obama has shown an inclination to set the broad terms for debate, and then to delegate details to advisers and Congress. For weeks, in public appearances that included ''60 Minutes,'' he has consistently defined the goal for the auto bailout as twofold: A loan from taxpayers, but on the conditions that the companies, including Ford, remake themselves to be viable enterprises and their products to be energy efficient.
 Yet Mr. Obama digs deeply into issues himself; he surprised one adviser in a conference call about the automakers by knowledgeably discussing ''DIP financing,'' a complex special form of financing for distressed companies.
 Along the way, with a skeleton team of senior advisers, Mr. Obama has shown no hesitance in stepping into disputes between the more experienced Democrats who run the House and Senate to forge the united front he will need in coming years to pass his ambitious agenda.
 When it looked last month as if Congress might fail to act because Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, disagreed over where the loan money should come from, Mr. Obama had Rahm Emanuel, the Illinois congressman who will be his White House chief of staff, call Mr. Reid, Democrats familiar with the incident said. ''Harry, don't make this a fight between you and Nancy,'' Mr. Emanuel said, according to one. ''Make it about what the industry is going to do in return for this money.''
 Afterward Mr. Reid and Ms. Pelosi told the company chiefs to return to Detroit and come back with detailed survival plans. They did, but as this week's session approached, chances for a deal with the White House were grim. Ms. Pelosi, unlike Mr. Reid, would not agree to Mr. Bush's demand to get the emergency money from a new environmental program intended to subsidize the industry's long-term retooling to produce energy-saving vehicles.
 Mr. Obama himself called her in California last Friday after news of the worst monthly job losses in 34 years, say people familiar with events. That weekend the speaker acquiesced to Mr. Bush, and Mr. Obama vowed on television that as president he would replenish the retooling program she wanted to protect.
 By all accounts, Mr. Obama has good relations with Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid. But as president he must necessarily be less deferential, making occasional run-ins inevitable, Democrats say. 
 The hints of Mr. Obama's leadership style are, of course, limited by the self-imposed constraints reflected in his mantra that the nation has one president at a time. After he takes office, it will be clearer where Mr. Obama fits on the presidential spectrum between the wonkish and pragmatic but less disciplined style of Bill Clinton, and the crisper but less curious and more ideological decision-making of Mr. Bush.
 Most of Mr. Obama's contacts with Congress and the White House as well as auto executives, labor leaders and bankruptcy experts have been through his senior staff. Besides Mr. Emanuel and John D. Podesta, his transition chief, Mr. Obama's auto team includes Phil Schiliro, a longtime House aide who has gotten a jump on his job as White House legislative liaison to Congress.
 Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who will head Mr. Obama's National Economic Council, has been Mr. Obama's touchstone on the economic aspects of the bailout. Also involved are Joshua L. Steiner, a former Treasury official who is a partner in a private-equity firm, and Brian Deese, a policy adviser on the Obama campaign. 
 ''Do everything you can to help the process along but don't get in the way,'' Mr. Obama told them, according to one member of his team. ''But if there is some way I can be constructive, I want you to do it. And don't talk about it.''
 After his daily workout, Mr. Obama arrives at his office in a no-frills suite in the Federal Building. He eats peanuts while reviewing memorandums and joining the conference calls that are his main conduits for information until he and his Washington staff are in the White House.
 Mr. Obama asks lots of questions, advisers say, and typically makes quick decisions. He leaves the office each day with a notebook stuffed with policy papers and information on potential hires. Each night at home there is a final conference call, about issues coming up the following day.

HEADLINE: White House Ready to Offer Aid to Auto Industry

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Louise Story, Leslie Wayne and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting from New York, Carl Hulse from Washington and Bill Vlasic from Detroit.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration said on Friday that it was prepared to intervene to prevent the collapse of General Motors and Chrysler after Republican senators blocked a compromise proposal to rescue the automakers.
The decision came after a tense standoff this week in which senior White House officials pleaded with Senate Republicans not to block the measure, including a warning by Vice President Dick Cheney that they would be remembered for decades as the party of Herbert Hoover if the industry collapsed.
But while Senate Republicans stood their ground -- in open revolt against President Bush -- it was the White House that gave in.
Shortly before the American markets opened on Friday morning, White House and Treasury Department officials, concerned that steep declines in overseas stock markets could provoke a new round of market panic in the United States, said the administration would consider providing temporary relief. 
After refusing for weeks to tap the $700 billion financial rescue fund, the administration suggested it would dip into the fund to at least permit the companies to continue their operations until the new Congress and new administration arrive next month.
''Because Congress failed to act, we will stand ready to prevent an imminent failure until Congress reconvenes and acts to address the long-term viability of the industry,'' said Brookly McLaughlin, a Treasury spokeswoman.
Administration officials said they had not decided how much to loan the auto companies or on what terms, and were spending Friday examining their books and cash-flow projections.
The government officials said they expected the companies and the unions would be asked to make significant concessions. They also did not rule out the prospect of a bankruptcy for one or more of the companies, but vowed that it would not be ''uncontrolled,'' meaning that enough financing would be provided to enable a reorganization.
Senior administration officials spent part of the day talking to auto executives and their lobbyists. People briefed about the discussions said that Chrysler had asked for financing to make it to February or March and the company was hoping that the administration would decide to lend it and General Motors about $11 billion. G.M. has said it needs $4.4 billion this month and another $4.4 billion next month
Administration officials said they feared a collapse of one or more of the car companies could have broader implications for the economy.
Some 3,000 suppliers, for example, are owed about $13 billion by the auto companies, according to Neil De Koker, chief executive of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association in Troy, Mich., a trade group that represents auto suppliers. Most suppliers sell parts to all three companies, as well as to Japanese auto makers. The fear is that if one of the Big Three fail, it would take down important suppliers who would then be unable to send parts to the others.
The flat financial markets on Friday appeared to give some breathing room to the administration as it worked to hammer out a plan. Officials cautioned that this rescue plan might not resemble either the House bill or the alternative put forward by Senate Republicans.
The White House had initially expressed reluctance to intervene in the auto crisis, and instead supported redirecting $14 billion that Congress had allocated to help the automakers retool to make more fuel-efficient cars. All but $15 billion of the first $350 billion of the financial rescue fund has been committed by the administration to banks and other financial institutions, and Treasury officials had been saying before Friday that they did not know whether they would seek permission from Congress to use any of the other $350 billion. But Congressional leaders have said that the lawmakers have no intention of returning to Washington until the new session begins next month.
Labor leaders in Detroit hailed the announcement by the administration.
''I think it's great news, the responses we've been getting out of the White House and the Treasury,'' said Ron Gettelfinger, the president of the United Automobile Workers union. ''It's important for the White House to exert their influence to release this money as quickly as possible. We cannot afford a run on the banks.''
Both G.M. and Chrysler have said they are in desperate need of cash by the end of December to pay suppliers that have already delivered parts, as well as to make employee payrolls.
The two automakers have both hired bankruptcy counsel, but have repeatedly said that a Chapter 11 filing is a bad option because of the difficulty in getting financing while reorganizing.
The companies are also cutting costs deeply to preserve their dwindling cash hoards. Chrysler just cut another 5,000 salaried jobs through buyouts and early retirements at the end of November. G.M. said Friday that it would drastically reduce vehicle production in the first quarter of 2009 by 250,000 units.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers from both parties called on the Bush administration on Friday to take swift action to prop up the automakers, while Senate Republicans defended their refusal to support a taxpayer-financed rescue plan.
The Senate vote just before 11 p.m. Thursday ended more than a month of debate on Capitol Hill about if and how the government should aid the failing automobile manufacturers, and it capped a frenzied 48-hour legislative roller-coaster ride.
And it came just 36 hours after Mr. Cheney attended a weekly lunch with the Senate Republican conference to plead with lawmakers not to block a rescue of the auto industry.
With the Republican Party still reeling from its defeats in November, and with the unpopularity of the Bush administration, some Republican aides suggested that Mr. Cheney had not helped win support and might have actually lost votes.
It was clear even before the lunch that they would face a tough sell. Several Republicans have given speeches saying they oppose the idea.
There was little appetite among Senate Republicans for another multibillion-dollar corporate bailout and less so for the American automakers who were widely perceived as victims of their own bad business decisions over decades. But Senator Bob Corker, the junior Republican from Tennessee, offered to pursue a potential compromise.
Mr. Corker quickly provided Democrats with the text of a five page amendment to the auto rescue bill, which would require much steeper concessions by the companies and the U.A.W.
As the senators met in the ceremonial conference room of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the first floor of the Capitol, lobbyists and other representatives of G.M. and the Ford Motor Company gathered nearby. Eventually, they were also joined by Stephen A. Feinberg, the reclusive founder of Cerberus Capital Management, which owns Chrysler.
Negotiators on both sides said they were able to agree on Mr. Corker's proposal to require a huge slashing of debt obligations by the automakers, including an agreement for the union to accept an equity stake in place of payments that it was owed to employee benefits accounts.
But Mr. Corker said Republican senators were also insisting on steep cuts in wages and benefits that would bring the American automakers in line with United States-based employees of Toyota, Nissan and Honda. And he said that the Republicans wanted a firm deadline, sometime in 2009, for the automakers to carry out those cuts.
It was over that point that the talks deadlocked, with the union pushing for those cuts to take place after its current contract expires in 2011.
Alan Reuther, the chief lobbyist for the union, said labor leaders back in Detroit were astonished at what Mr. Corker was attempting to accomplish -- a virtual rewriting of the U.A.W. contract, which typically takes the better part of a year to negotiate. ''That's one thing that our folks in Detroit were just amazed at,'' Mr. Reuther said. ''Does Senator Corker really think he can do a restructuring of the industry in six hours?''
When the U.A.W. would not agree to a 2009 deadline, it was clear that no deal could be struck. ''It seems that the U.A.W. blew it up,'' said Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana.

HEADLINE: Amid a Hopeful Mood, U.N. Talks Set Countries on Path Toward a Global Climate Treaty

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: POZNAN, Poland 

 BODY:
The United Nations climate talks concluded here early Saturday, having seemingly achieved their modest goals and then some: setting the world on the track to a new global climate treaty with a renewed sense of purpose and momentum. 
 The final documents produced at the conference contained a few groundbreaking elements, most notably giving nations credit for saving forests and opening up a long-planned fund to help poor countries adapt to climate change. However, many countries complained bitterly that the fund did not provide adequate financing.
 Perhaps contributing most to the hopeful mood were signs from high-level United States officials that the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama would be ready to hit the ground running with a new United States climate policy. 
 ''This is a challenge of leadership, and we have an enormous obligation to meet it,'' said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who will be chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and who has been here for past two days meeting with officials from various countries, including China and Australia.
 The new administration and the Congress ''are all on the same page,'' he said. ''The U.S. has to act, we must lead and we need to have mandatory emissions targets.'' 
 The United States would need to have its climate negotiation team in place by late January or early February, Mr. Kerry said, so that it could be ''confident'' of shaping the next treaty negotiating session, scheduled for March in Bonn, Germany. Nations are aiming to have a treaty finished at a final negotiating session in Copenhagen in December 2009.
 Mr. Obama has said he wants to return to 1990 greenhouse-gas emissions levels by 2020, but Mr. Kerry said he personally felt the cuts should be deeper. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said nations would need to reduce emissions 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 in order to avert the serious and potentially disastrous consequences of climate change.
 The struggles the European Union has had in passing its own climate and energy package, which was announced on Friday after rancorous negotiations in Brussels, showed how difficult it can be to get businesses to cut emissions or invest in clean technology against the backdrop of a global recession. 
 Environmental groups like Greenpeace said the European Union package ''watered down'' an ambitious program by giving too many carbon credits for free, allowing some industries broad exceptions to the emissions limits and giving countries too much leeway to offset pollution at home by investing in green projects overseas. 
 ''Just at the time that the U.S. is finally re-engaging with the international community on climate, it looks like the E.U.'s leadership is dropping away,'' said Joris den Blanken, the European climate and energy director for Greenpeace.
 Still, many here took heart that the European Union package did not backslide on previously announced commitments to reduce emissions by 2020 to 20 percent below 1990 levels. Indeed, they said the fights in Brussels demonstrated the flexibility of a so-called cap and trade system and were a preview of struggles to come in the United States. Under such a system, which is planned by the new administration, limits are placed on emissions by companies or industries; and if those limits are exceeded, carbon credits must be purchased from others who have not reached their limit.
 ''The most important thing is that they were not revisiting their targets,'' said Elliot Diringer, vice president of international strategies at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.
 Indeed, the combination of a progress here, a new European Union package and the change of administrations in Washington left many delegates and environmental advocates here echoing the words of the Bellona Foundation, the largest environment group in Norway: ''Now the ball is rolling.''
 ''The expectations for this meeting weren't high, but there have been good developments and the E.U. package makes me happy,'' said Frederic Hauge, chief of Bellona, noting that the package contains billions of dollars for developing new clean technology. Still, some environmental groups left Poznan unsatisfied. ''Over all we are disappointed,'' said Savio Carvalho, of Oxfam Uganda, noting that developed nations seemed too consumed with their own financial troubles to provide genuine assistance to poorer countries.
 The conference mostly set out to define the final outlines of a treaty that will be negotiated over the next year, and in that regard ''the meeting got done what was needed,'' Mr. Diringer said.
 At the same time, battle lines were drawn for the coming year. Under the previous treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized nations had to commit to emissions reduction targets, while developing nations did not. The United States never ratified the Kyoto Protocol.
 That formula may no longer be acceptable, Mr. Kerry suggested, since some developing nations now contribute heavily to global greenhouse-gas emissions. China and India are the world's No. 1 and No. 3 emitters, respectively. The United States is No. 2.
 While Mr. Kerry said that no one expected China to accept the same kind of emissions commitment as industrialized countries, ''they will have to have some kind of target or we will not be able to ratify the agreement.''
 Another point of contention was control of a fund that had been created to help poor countries respond to climate change. The European Union initially proposed that an outside group like the World Bank do the job. But that angered many poor countries, and the proposal was dropped. 
 ''We need something simple and responsive that developing countries control,'' said Masao Nakayama, the ambassador of the Federated States of Micronesia to the United Nations. ''There's a fire, and it's like they're arguing about whether to use a plastic bucket or a metal bucket or a hose.''

HEADLINE: U.A.W. Chief and Senator Gain From Face-Off

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and CARL HULSE; Micheline Maynard reported from Detroit and Carl Hulse from Washington. Nick Bunkley and Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
For more than 70 years, the United Automobile Workers union has known who its adversaries were: company executives, foreign automakers and right-to-work advocates who fought its organizing drives.
 Now it has another: Senator Robert Phillips Corker Jr. 
 On Thursday night, Senator Corker, a freshman Republican from Tennessee, pushed the U.A.W.'s president, Ron Gettelfinger, to agree in principle to tough contract concessions before the Senate Republicans would agree to provide a lifeline to General Motors and Chrysler. 
 But Mr. Gettelfinger, after giving ground in recent years on health care, job security and pay issues, would not agree to let the concessions take effect next year. The impasse effectively killed the chances for a $14 billion bailout package from Congress.
 While the deal was lost, both Mr. Gettelfinger and Senator Corker can claim a victory of sorts, perhaps setting the stage for future showdowns.
 Mr. Gettelfinger's tough stand risked pushing the companies into bankruptcy, which would abrogate the union contracts he was trying to protect. 
 But on Friday, President Bush and the Treasury said they would consider using money from the $700 billion financial bailout to help automakers.
 Mr. Gettelfinger needed to show he was defending his union's members. Since he took office in 2002, the U.A.W. has given up health benefits and agreed to sweeping wage cuts, and for the bailout, it was prepared to abandon pay guarantees for workers who had lost their jobs.
 Mr. Gettelfinger also appeared during Congressional hearings as more of an ally -- rather than usual sparring partner -- of the chief executives of Detroit's auto companies, sitting next to them while the group endured hours of grilling.
 Although his actions threatened any bailout, U.A.W. members applauded his refusal to budge further, even if it put the American auto industry at risk. 
 ''He stood up and did what he had to do,'' said Dean Braid, a 30-year veteran at a G.M. plant in Flint, Mich. 
 Senator Corker first raised his profile in the Congressional hearings last week, with his relentless questioning of Chrysler's chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, suggesting that Chrysler wanted federal aid only so it could find a merger partner.
 ''There is not a human being alive in the automobile world who thinks that Chrysler is doing anything other than hanging around long enough until it finds somebody to marry,'' he said. 
 He continued with the metaphor, making for one of the more colorful exchanges during four days of hearings in recent weeks on the bailout. ''While this is happening you're going to be going to spas and getting facials and trying to get someone to marry you,'' Senator Corker said. 
 ''I've been married for 38 years,'' Mr. Nardelli responded. 
 With his sharp and colorful criticism, Senator Corker became a face of the opposition to the bailout effort along with another senator, Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who garnered more attention early on in the debate by describing Detroit's Big Three as ''dinosaurs.'' Mr. Shelby has many plants operated by foreign automakers in his state, such as Toyota, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai.
 Now, after negotiating on behalf of Senate Republicans, it is Senator Corker who is being invited to appear on Sunday morning talk shows.
 The Big Three might have expected him to be a bit more supportive of their plight.
 After all, Senator Corker's state has a G.M. factory in Spring Hill that used to be home to Saturn, but which now builds vehicles for Chevrolet. Several hundred active and retired U.A.W. members picketed Senator Corker's Nashville office last week after his exchange with Mr. Nardelli.
 But Senator Corker has been a strong advocate for investment by foreign auto companies in Tennessee. Only five months ago, he stood behind a blond-wood lectern, emblazoned with a large Volkswagen logo, to welcome a German automaker to his state. Nissan already has two plants and its North American headquarters in Tennessee.
 On Friday, Senator Corker took pains to dispel notions that the outcome was the result of sharp split between his party and organized labor, or that it was engineered by lawmakers from states that are home to foreign auto manufacturers.
 ''I was a member of a union as a young man, a card-carrying union member,'' Senator Corker, who was a construction worker, said at a news conference. ''My company that I started when I was 25 employed large numbers of union workers -- carpenters, laborers and others.''
 And Mr. Gettelfinger acknowledged during his own press conference that he had been willing to reach an agreement with Senator Corker on the concept of lowering U.A.W. members' wages and benefits to the levels paid at plants run by Toyota, Honda, B.M.W. and Nissan.
 The two sides wound up apart only by the date when concessions might take effect -- 2009, as the senator wanted, or 2011, as Mr. Gettelfinger proposed, when the next union contract takes effect. But Mr. Gettelfinger refused to yield completely to Congress; yielding would allow lawmakers to tell U.A.W. members what they could earn or what the terms of their contract would be. 
 Mr. Gettelfinger said he suspected that was the prime motivation of Southern Senate Republicans -- not helping the auto companies. 
 ''They thought that they had a two-fer: pierce the heart of organized labor, while representing the foreign manufacturers,'' Mr. Gettelfinger said.
 Democrats, long the U.A.W.'s ally in Congress, assailed the standoff on Friday. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader, accused Republicans of ''recklessly playing games with the nation's economy just so they can take shots against unionized workers.''
 Senator Corker has shown he can play with Democrats, too. A former mayor of Chattanooga and a developer and builder, he was the only new Republican elected to the Senate in 2006, defeating former Representative Harold E. Ford Jr. to take the seat vacated by Bill Frist.
 That distinction made him the party's entire freshman class and gave him the opportunity to try to make a quick impact.
 Despite the collapse of the talks, Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, gave Mr. Corker credit for his efforts in 2007 backing higher fuel economy standards. ''I have been extremely impressed,'' said Mr. Reid, saying Mr. Corker's work laid the basis for the next round of auto legislation when the 111th Congress convenes next month.

HEADLINE: In Poland, Style Comes Used and by the Pound

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Michal Piotrowski contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WARSAW -- At 9 a.m. on a recent December day, several dozen shoppers all hurled themselves at the door of a second-hand clothes store here, like a rugby scrum hitting a wall. Those stuck outside could only watch as a surprising mix of young hipsters and graying retirees sprinted upstairs, first to where the fur and leather coats awaited.
In a scene repeated daily, whenever the latest delivery has landed, the battle was on for the best finds at the store, called Tomitex, where everything, including the fur, sells for roughly $7 a pound the first week after delivery and as low as 75 cents thereafter.
But this is not a tale of people buying used clothes in the midst of recessionary gloom. The global economic crisis has yet to hit a majority of Poles. 
Thrift stores here have become impromptu laboratories of the changing mores and attitudes in a country adjusting to newfound wealth. Young Poles here in the capital are now confident enough in their ability to buy new clothes that they at last have taken to wearing old ones. Those eking out a living on fixed incomes, especially retirees, still lack the means to do otherwise.
And so the hip and the strapped meet at secondhand stores like Tomitex, on Nowowiejska Street in downtown Warsaw.
The pronounced stigma of buying used clothes in a poor country was once a powerful deterrent for shopping -- or at least admitting to shopping -- at secondhand stores, known here by the derogative colloquialism lumpex, which translates as something like bum export. That stigma has been replaced among the young by a playful attitude toward vintage clothing and bargain-hunting that would not be out of place among their contemporaries in London or New York.
It is all part of the ferment of a capital rife with traffic jams as the new and used imported cars have outstripped the capacity of the roads to carry them all. One boutique for the latest new styles, aptly named Luxury & Liberty, has opened in the former headquarters of the governing Polish United Workers' Party, which also previously housed the Warsaw Stock Exchange since the end of Communism.
Poles, who under Communism had few choices for clothes, now have the entire spectrum, but the full breadth is only available to a few.
The gulf between the haves and have-nots is wide, and the two sides are increasingly bumping against each other quite literally.
''I think the elderly people connect this with the past in Poland, in the '80s, the queues,'' said Melanie Kucharska, 21, wearing black boots, jeans and dangly earrings, and braving the throngs to sift through the latest delivery with a pair of friends. ''But it's trendy now to go to secondhand stores,'' she said. ''I can dress in a different way than half of Warsaw does.''
Asked about her better finds, Ms. Kucharska, a student and nanny, recalled her greatest triumph: a ballerina-style dress with a big bow in the front, which she thought was from the '50s or '60s.
Older women, by contrast, registered their extreme displeasure at finding a reporter and a photographer at Tomitex, expressing emotions ranging from embarrassment to anger. ''It will make me seem poor,'' one complained. Others hurled the kind of colorful expressions usually reserved for use on ships at sea.
''Older ladies here are proud and so fashionable,'' said Ania Kuczynska, 33, a fashion designer in Warsaw. ''You can see that they aren't very rich, but they're elegant and they have their own style.''
Ms. Kuczynska said that after socialism consumers placed a great emphasis on labels and logos, to prove that their clothes were new and expensive. A willingness to embrace used clothes signals a new maturity in a city finding its way in fashion, Ms. Kuczynska said. ''It's just the next step in our reality, in our growing economy,'' she said. ''The times are changing.''
It is a trend that has just begun to touch the mainstream here. Marcin Rozyc, a local fashion journalist and stylist, described his surprise when he traveled to Amsterdam several years ago and found well-to-do young people in thrift store fashions.
''Young people had everything from secondhand, but also carried the newest bags from Chanel,'' Mr. Rozyc said.
The broadening of the fashion spectrum through the arrival of designer boutiques and stores made a more experimental approach to clothes possible in the first place, he said.
Luxury & Liberty opened in September, describing itself as a ''concept multibrand store'' with a bar and restaurant, where the winners of the transition from socialism and their children can buy a Vivienne Westwood bag for around $460 or a Diane von Furstenberg coat for just over $1,000, or 3,159 zloty. ''The biggest luxury is liberty,'' reads one part of the store's philosophy statement. ''Luxury and liberty are inside us. All we need to do is focus on them and find them.''
At the Tomitex, there was plenty of focus on display, but not much luxury.
''I can't afford to spend 400 zloty on a new coat,'' said Edyta Sudzinska, 47, neatly dressed in brown pants and a black coat, as she left the store on a recent morning. Ms. Sudzinska, who works as an extra, said she lived off just 1,200 zloty a month, putting 500 zloty toward rent in her one-room apartment.
''For many years we'll be wearing used clothes, till we get to an E.U. standard of wages,'' Ms. Sudzinska said. She said she had noticed the trend among buyers who lived at or above Western standards. ''Now even people who earn well buy here.''
Four years ago, the Tomitex chain had just six stores, according to its co-founder, Piotr Malecki. With business booming, the number of stores has mushroomed to 25 in Poland and an additional 5 in Ukraine, aided, he said, by an emphasis in the media and the broader culture on the environment that made recycling and reusing hip.
Mr. Malecki, 34, no relation to the photographer of the same name who was cursed in his store while taking pictures for this article, said that typical lumpex shops in smaller towns were going out of business. Used, he said, was O.K.; low quality no longer sufficed. ''Even in those small towns, people want to feel good in their clothes,'' he said. ''They don't want a shop where everything stinks.''
But his cash cow is still the higher price for the new deliveries. In Warsaw, he worried about one location frequented by a mostly older, poorer clientele, but should have had more faith in the discerning, younger crowd.
''Our clients know exactly where and when the new deliveries will take place,'' Mr. Malecki said. ''They ride around Warsaw tracking them.''
In Ukraine, by contrast, he said that all that mattered was the lowest possible price, regardless of quality. ''The middle class is small, meanwhile the rich are willing to pay three times as much for an Armani as in Paris or New York,'' he said. ''In terms of quality, it's really quite a Dumpster. It can be compared to Poland 12 years ago.''
At the Nowowiejska Street Tomitex store, women burrowed elbow-deep into crates of scarves. One woman made off with a pair of French Connection jeans; a man picked up a Derby County soccer jersey with an Adidas logo. The goods are weighed on scales, once at the register and again at the door to discourage theft.
Disputes between the customers, on the other hand, are harder to prevent.
''They curse each other and they do fight, but rarely,'' said Ania Jaroszewska, 23, who was watching the second scale at the door. ''It's usually a random thing, when they grab at the same time and say: 'It's mine! It's mine!' ''

HEADLINE: THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Smart Grids

BYLINE: By CLAY RISEN

 BODY:
In March, Xcel Energy, a Minneapolis-based power utility, announced plans to build the country's first city-scale ''smart grid'' in Boulder, Colo. It's a response to what economists would call a tragedy of the commons: people use as much energy as they are willing to pay for, without giving any thought to how their use affects the overall amount of energy available. And because traditional power grids are ''dumb'' -- that is, there's no way to monitor power use once it leaves the station -- utilities err on the side of oversupply, which wastes energy and harms the environment. 
 Enter Xcel's $100 million initiative, called SmartGridCity, a set of technologies that give both energy providers and their customers more control over power consumption. It relies on a network of fiber-optic cables, high-tech meters and sensor-laden transformers to provide power stations with real-time data on demand all along the grid, allowing them to fine-tune the electrical supply, detect failing equipment and predict overloads. Consumers, through a Web-enabled control panel in their homes, are able to regulate their energy consumption more closely -- for example, setting their A.C. system to automatically reduce power use during peak hours.
 Ontario, meanwhile, has committed itself to a 20-year energy plan that includes smart grids, while a consortium of technology and energy companies has pilot programs under way in Dallas and Houston. Even the federal government is getting in the game: the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 provides an annual $100 million to encourage utilities to implement smart-grid technologies.
 The next step, which Xcel plans to introduce in a year or two, is ''dynamic energy pricing,'' in which the cost per watt would vary during the day depending on systemwide usage. Homeowners would be able to preset or manually control the electrical consumption of their home appliances, lighting and A.C. systems to achieve a desired price point. Eventually, smart grids could allow utilities to buy energy from independent sources -- say, homes with roof-mounted solar panels -- in effect turning homeowners into miniature power companies themselves.

THE NEW THRIFT
 As the financial crisis snowballed this year, retail sales fell sharply, and government figures showed the first across-the-board decline in consumer spending since 1991. Curiously, many assessments of this development treated it as an exciting new trend -- and maybe even an overnight realignment of where and how Americans find meaning and satisfaction in life. The lower-spending shopper of 2008 was promptly cited as evidence of a ''new frugality'' or a ''saving is cool'' mentality. ''It's a whole new reassessment of values,'' one commentator suggested, while another posited that ''America's love affair with shopping'' may be over. 
 Yeah? That seems like a lot to infer from data points in a government report, particularly when it suggests that yesterday we were vacuous shopping-bots and today we are virtuously sober citizens. Yes, household-debt loads have contracted a bit, but it's probably not a coincidence that access to debt has contracted, too. And although there is news that some of us are going without luxury goods, there is also news that others are going without fulfilling our doctors' prescriptions. At this stage, the evident hesitation to spend seems more like a function of fear than of frugality. Consumers, spooked by reports of declining spending, are deciding not to spend.
 The truth is that we have long had mixed, even contradictory, feelings about consumption. A few years ago -- pretty much at the height of our most recent nationwide spending binge -- a nonprofit group called the Center for a New American Dream released a poll in which 81 percent of those surveyed agreed that Americans are ''too focused on shopping and spending,'' and 88 percent said our society is ''too materialistic.'' Not long after, the Pew Research Center surveyed Americans about various consumer goods we say we ''can't live without.'' Between 1996 and 2006 the number of material necessities in our lives grew substantially. Aside from new entries -- 49 percent can't live without a cellphone, and 29 percent said the same of high-speed Internet access -- our need for more familiar items spiked, too. The number of people who considered the microwave oven a necessity, for instance, nearly doubled. Some respondents added iPods and flat-screen TVs to the list. Uneasy as we may be about ''materialistic'' purchases, they remain a tangible proxy for progress. 
 Second thoughts about that paradigm are nothing new. ''Too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption,'' Jimmy Carter declared in 1979 in his ''crisis of confidence'' speech. ''We've discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning.'' It's hard to imagine anyone, then or now, arguing otherwise. But who, at the end of the 1970s, would have predicted the emergence of a new normal that included gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s and McMansions? 
 Somehow the normal of hyperconsumption persisted despite the collapse of the Internet bubble, the vulnerability exposed on 9/11, two wars and stagnant wages. Through it all, consumer spending hardly wavered, the personal savings rate plummeted and personal debt mounted. We were told our willingness to spend more -- on fair-trade coffee, eco-friendly totes, organic dog food -- demonstrated a fresh consumer sophistication that would change the marketplace. Now, suddenly, our values are reflected in cheap shirts from Costco. 
 A new normal that revolves around buying lots of stuff while bragging about our bargain-hunting skills doesn't seem to reflect changed values. There are other possibilities that seem more considered and less reactionary: an organization called the Institute for American Values recently issued a report offering serious suggestions for cultivating a new thrift, like endorsing a public-education campaign; making the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets federal workers regularly sock a portion of their income into diversified investment funds, available to all working Americans; and even a revival of National Thrift Week. 
 But so far, nobody has quite reconciled the vision of a sober and repentant new shopper with the substantial government efforts to reignite consumer spending. This year's Black Friday big-box mobs hint that perhaps bargain binges and postmaterialist values aren't the same thing. If there's a deeper shift in our thinking, it's still to come. And maybe it will. After all, the mere fact that we have managed to characterize consumer shock as frugality chic offers a perverse form of hope: That whatever happens, we'll never lose our tendency toward optimism -- even, it turns out, about our pessimism.

HEADLINE: An Evangelical Article of Faith: Bad Times Draw Bigger Crowds

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
The sudden crush of worshipers packing the small evangelical Shelter Rock Church in Manhasset, N.Y. -- a Long Island hamlet of yacht clubs and hedge fund managers -- forced the pastor to set up an overflow room with closed-circuit TV and 100 folding chairs, which have been filled for six Sundays straight.
 In Seattle, the Mars Hill Church, one of the fastest-growing evangelical churches in the country, grew to 7,000 members this fall, up 1,000 in a year. At the Life Christian Church in West Orange, N.J., prayer requests have doubled -- almost all of them aimed at getting or keeping jobs. 
 Like evangelical churches around the country, the three churches have enjoyed steady growth over the last decade. But since September, pastors nationwide say they have seen such a burst of new interest that they find themselves contending with powerful conflicting emotions -- deep empathy and quiet excitement -- as they re-encounter an old piece of religious lore: 
 Bad times are good for evangelical churches.
 ''It's a wonderful time, a great evangelistic opportunity for us,'' said the Rev. A. R. Bernard, founder and senior pastor of the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, New York's largest evangelical congregation, where regulars are arriving earlier to get a seat. ''When people are shaken to the core, it can open doors.''
 Nationwide, congregations large and small are presenting programs of practical advice for people in fiscal straits -- from a homegrown series on ''Financial Peace'' at a Midtown Manhattan church called the Journey, to the ''Good Sense'' program developed at the 20,000-member Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Ill., and now offered at churches all over the country. 
 Many ministers have for the moment jettisoned standard sermons on marriage and the Beatitudes to preach instead about the theological meaning of the downturn.
 The Jehovah's Witnesses, who moved much of their door-to-door evangelizing to the night shift 10 years ago because so few people were home during the day, returned to daylight witnessing this year. ''People are out of work, and they are answering the door,'' said a spokesman, J. R. Brown.
 Mr. Bernard plans to start 100 prayer groups next year, using a model conceived by the megachurch pastor Rick Warren, to ''foster spiritual dialogue in these times'' in small gatherings around the city.
 A recent spot check of some large Roman Catholic parishes and mainline Protestant churches around the nation indicated attendance increases there, too. But they were nowhere near as striking as those reported by congregations describing themselves as evangelical, a term generally applied to churches that stress the literal authority of Scripture and the importance of personal conversion, or being ''born again.'' 
 Part of the evangelicals' new excitement is rooted in a communal belief that the big Christian revivals of the 19th century, known as the second and third Great Awakenings, were touched off by economic panics. Historians of religion do not buy it, but the notion ''has always lived in the lore of evangelism,'' said Tony Carnes, a sociologist who studies religion. 
 A study last year may lend some credence to the legend. In ''Praying for Recession: The Business Cycle and Protestant Religiosity in the United States,'' David Beckworth, an assistant professor of economics at Texas State University, looked at long-established trend lines showing the growth of evangelical congregations and the decline of mainline churches and found a more telling detail: During each recession cycle between 1968 and 2004, the rate of growth in evangelical churches jumped by 50 percent. By comparison, mainline Protestant churches continued their decline during recessions, though a bit more slowly.
 The little-noticed study began receiving attention from some preachers in September, when the stock market began its free fall. With the swelling attendance they were seeing, and a sense that worldwide calamities come along only once in an evangelist's lifetime, the study has encouraged some to think big.
 ''I found it very exciting, and I called up that fellow to tell him so,'' said the Rev. Don MacKintosh, a Seventh Day Adventist televangelist in California who contacted Dr. Beckworth a few weeks ago after hearing word of his paper from another preacher. ''We need to leverage this moment, because every Christian revival in this country's history has come off a period of rampant greed and fear. That's what we're in today -- the time of fear and greed.''
 Frank O'Neill, 54, a manager who lost his job at Morgan Stanley this year, said the ''humbling experience'' of unemployment made him cast about for a more personal relationship with God than he was able to find in the Catholicism of his youth. In joining the Shelter Rock Church on Long Island, he said, he found a deeper sense of ''God's authority over everything -- I feel him walking with me.''
 The sense of historic moment is underscored especially for evangelicals in New York who celebrated the 150th anniversary last year of the Fulton Street Prayer Revival, one of the major religious resurgences in America. Also known as the Businessmen's Revival, it started during the Panic of 1857 with a noon prayer meeting among traders and financiers in Manhattan's financial district.
 Over the next few years, it led to tens of thousands of conversions in the United States, and inspired the volunteerism movement behind the founding of the Salvation Army, said the Rev. McKenzie Pier, president of the New York City Leadership Center, an evangelical pastors' group that marked the anniversary with a three-day conference at the Hilton New York. ''The conditions of the Businessmen's Revival bear great similarities to what's going on today,'' he said. ''People are losing a lot of money.''
 But why the evangelical churches seem to thrive especially in hard times is a Rorschach test of perspective. 
 For some evangelicals, the answer is obvious. ''We have the greatest product on earth,'' said the Rev. Steve Tomlinson, senior pastor of the Shelter Rock Church.
 Dr. Beckworth, a macroeconomist, posited another theory: though expanding demographically since becoming the nation's largest religious group in the 1990s, evangelicals as a whole still tend to be less affluent than members of mainline churches, and therefore depend on their church communities more during tough times, for material as well as spiritual support. In good times, he said, they are more likely to work on Sundays, which may explain a slower rate of growth among evangelical churches in nonrecession years.
 Msgr. Thomas McSweeney, who writes columns for Catholic publications and appears on MSNBC as a religion consultant, said the growth is fed by evangelicals' flexibility: ''Their tradition allows them to do things from the pulpit we don't do -- like 'Hey! I need somebody to take Mrs. McSweeney to the doctor on Tuesday,' or 'We need volunteers at the soup kitchen tomorrow.' '' 
 In a cascading financial crisis, he said, a pastor can discard a sermon prescribed by the liturgical calendar and directly address the anxiety in the air. ''I know a lot of you are feeling pain today,'' he said, as if speaking from the pulpit. ''And we're going to do something about that.''
 But a recession also means fewer dollars in the collection basket. 
 Few evangelical churches have endowments to compare with the older mainline Protestant congregations. 
 ''We are at the front end of a $10 million building program,'' said the Rev. Terry Smith, pastor of the Life Christian Church in West Orange, N.J. ''Am I worried about that? Yes. But right now, I'm more worried about my congregation.'' A husband and wife, he said, were both fired the same day from Goldman Sachs; another man inherited the workload of four co-workers who were let go, and expects to be the next to leave. ''Having the conversations I'm having,'' Mr. Smith said, ''it's hard to think about anything else.'' 
 At the Shelter Rock Church, many newcomers have been invited by members who knew they had recently lost jobs. On a recent Sunday, new faces included a hedge fund manager and an investment banker, both laid off, who were friends of Steve Leondis, a cheerful business executive who has been a church member for four years. The two newcomers, both Catholics, declined to be interviewed, but Mr. Leondis said they agreed to attend Shelter Rock to hear Mr. Tomlinson's sermon series, ''Faith in Unstable Times.''
 ''They wanted something that pertained to them,'' he said, ''some comfort that pertained to their situations.''
 Mr. Tomlinson and his staff in Manhasset and at a satellite church in nearby Syosset have recently discussed hiring an executive pastor to take over administrative work, so they can spend more time pastoring. 
 ''There are a lot of walking wounded in this town,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Lesson of Mumbai: Have a Safety Plan

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
THE deadly attacks in Mumbai, which targeted areas favored by tourists, including two of the city's most luxurious hotels -- the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and the Oberoi -- have raised concerns about the safety of guests at even the best accommodations. 
 ''While terrorist attacks are not new to India, the Nov. 26 Mumbai terrorist attacks in part targeted American citizens and other Westerners for the first time and tragically demonstrate that even in five-star luxury hotels, security is not equipped to deter such attacks,'' the State Department said in a Dec. 4 Travel Alert that urges Americans to exercise caution in India. 
 The violence, which ended with at least 170 deaths, came two months after a truck bomb devastated the Marriott in Islamabad, Pakistan, and 10 months after a suicide bombing attack on the luxury Serena Hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan. 
 As embassies in conflict zones become better fortified against terrorists, ''hotels have become second embassies,'' said Rohan Gunaratna, author of ''Inside Al Qaeda'' and the head of the International Center for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore. ''If hotels understand the threat and put robust security measures in place, this current wave of terrorist propensity to attack hotels can be deflected.'' 
 Security experts and federal agencies offer unsurprising advice about safety measures you can take when traveling to areas where you may be at risk: be vigilant, avoid crowds, keep a low profile. But much of it comes down to using common sense. 
 ''People always say to me, 'I'm about to leave on a trip, what's the best way to protect myself?' '' said Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert and senior adviser to the RAND Corporation, the California research center. ''I say drive very carefully on the way to the airport.'' 
 The likelihood of a hotel guest's being killed in a terrorist attack is about one in a million, said Mr. Jenkins, who conducted a study of hotel attacks that covered 1968 through mid-2005. By comparison, he said, the average American has about a one in 8,000 chance of dying in an auto accident. 
 The compelling survival stories of travelers who were caught up in the three-day siege on Mumbai show there was no pattern to what ultimately saved them. Some barricaded themselves in their rooms while others took cover in hotel conference areas or simply fled. 
 Lynne and Ken Shaw of Wales told the BBC that they hid under a table while the attackers stormed the Taj Mahal Palace. In the interview, Mrs. Shaw said that ''little decisions that night -- just timing -- saved our lives.'' 
 At one point, when they were being led out of hiding, gunfire broke out in the corridor. ''My life was saved because as I was running I stumbled, and I think that really saved me, as I fell back into the room,'' said Mrs. Shaw. 
 Technology came into play in some rescues. Michael Beagelman, chief executive of Concierge International Agents, which provides 24-hour travel services for Altour, a luxury travel company, was able to exchange text messages with a British client at the Taj on her honeymoon. Mr. Beagelman was able to provide her name and that of her husband to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and tell them where the clients were. Indian soldiers eventually helped them get out. 
 In light of the attacks, the Association of Corporate Travel Executives is recommending that travelers going to areas where their safety might be compromised put together a kit with four essential items -- a flashlight with an LED bulb for illumination or to signal for help; a hand-held water purifier in case the water isn't potable; a portable radio; and a cellphone or a Blackberry with international service. 
 ''Events in Mumbai indicated a sophisticated attack on two levels, both cultural and commercial,'' said Susan Gurley, the association's executive director. ''Attacking and seizing a hotel reflects a new level of desperation and savagery.''
 She added, ''This presents new challenges and new solutions for travelers who want to be prepared.'' 
 Ms. Gurley said business travel managers plan to re-evaluate their hotel contracts with an emphasis on guest security. New contracts are expected to require hotels, among other things, to train their staffs to evacuate the building efficiently; to provide detailed floor charts to security officials, the police and firefighters; and to have a surveillance system and secondary methods of communication like a public address system to inform guests of issues. 
 Some hotels already have such safety measures. Marriott, for example, implemented a crisis management plan 15 years ago and has analysts who assess security conditions daily. If a threat exists at a hotel, it is prescribed a color-coded alert, which signals specific security countermeasures. 
 Alan Orlob, vice president of corporate security for Marriott, also periodically meets with other hotel security executives to share information. ''We understand that if there's a threat, it's a threat to the industry, not a particular hotel,'' Mr. Orlob said. 
 But a cautious guest could ''ask for a room above the second and below the seventh floors,'' said Ralph Witherspoon, a security consultant from Cleveland. ''Criminals and terrorists can easily access most ground-floor rooms, and most fire department ladders won't reach above the seventh floor.'' 
 Travelers can also look for the nearest exits. ''Count the doors between your room and the nearest exit,'' recommends the State Department. ''This could be a lifesaver if you have to crawl through a smoke-filled corridor.''
 For information on conditions abroad that may affect safety, travelers can consult the State Department reports at www.travel.state.gov. Registering your travel plans at the department's Web site may make it easier to contact you in case of an emergency. 
 Security experts suggest loading into your cellphone emergency numbers like those for the local United States embassy, your tour operator or your hotel, and letting at least two people at work or at home know where you are going. 
 While every situation is different, said Damon Brenner, a senior manager of global services at Control Risks, a consulting company, ''if you do the little things,'' like knowing where the nearest fire exits to your room are, ''it will help mitigate the potential risk of being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.''

HEADLINE: THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Kindergarten Redshirting Is Bad In Many Ways

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SHEA

 BODY:
The practice of holding young children back from kindergarten in order to increase their odds of success in school has long worried educational observers. A paper published this summer by the economists David Deming, of Harvard's Kennedy School, and Susan Dynarski, of the University of Michigan, found that so-called redshirting affects more children than previously thought -- and the trend is accelerating. The ''lengthening of childhood'' also has negative consequences that other analysts have neglected, including economic ripple effects that could affect the long-term solvency of Social Security. 
 From 1968 to 1995, the authors found, the proportion of American 6-year-olds enrolled in first grade (or higher) dropped from 96.5 percent to 91 percent. From 1995 to 2005, the proportion of 6-year-olds in first grade (or higher) proceeded to plummet to 84.5 percent. One in six American children now has a delayed entry into school. Many schools are even mandating something called ''late entry'' to keep pace with redshirting.
 While other academics have debated how the broader age ranges at each grade level affect academic performance gaps, Deming and Dynarski spotlight two negative outcomes. The first stems from the American tradition of setting a minimum school dropout age. (Some European countries mandate a minimum number of years in the classroom instead.) Disadvantaged students are more likely to drop out as soon as they can, therefore disproportionately decreasing the amount of education they complete. If they also started school late, these students lose time at the start of their education and at the end. 
 Meanwhile, other redshirted children delay their entry into the work force. They're in high school when their parents were in college -- since 1968, the proportion of 17-year-olds in college has dropped by half -- and in college when their parents had jobs. The long-term ramifications of this demographic shift may be significant. Consider that Congress increased the Social Security retirement age from 65 to 67, on the logic that retirees would be supported by more workers. But with late school entry shrinking the size of the work force, that reform ''will partially be undone,'' Deming and Dynarski conclude -- by the lengthening of the American childhood.

BYLINE: By ELSA DIXLER

 BODY:
THE BIG CON: The True Story of How Washington Got Hoodwinked and Hijacked by Crackpot Economics, by Jonathan Chait. (Houghton Mifflin, $14.95.) Chait describes how Republicans, beginning in the 1970s, abandoned fiscal conservatism and embraced the idea that tax cuts are always the best response to any economic problem, regardless of the deficits they engender. His account of how the G.O.P. abolished dissent on this issue is fascinating; even John McCain, who voted against Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, was forced to embrace supply-side nostrums during his presidential campaign. 
 ''The potential of our economy to underwrite a society of broad prosperity is being sacrificed to financial speculation,'' Robert Kuttner writes pertinently in THE SQUANDERING OF AMERICA: How the Failure of Our Politics Undermines Our Prosperity (Vintage, $15.95). Kuttner deplores the increasingly skewed distribution of wealth and the deregulation that created a ''casino economy.'' His proposed solution is ''managed capitalism.'' Richard Grasso became a poster boy for Wall Street excess when he was forced to resign as chairman of the New York Stock Exchange -- Henry Paulson, who is now Treasury secretary, led the exchange board's move to oust him -- after it was revealed that he had collected a compensation package of almost $140 million. In KING OF THE CLUB: Richard Grasso and the Survival of the New York Stock Exchange (Collins Business, $16.95), Charles Gasparino follows Grasso from his working-class childhood in Queens through the court decision earlier this year that he could keep the loot. 
 JOOP: A Novel of Anne Frank, by Richard Lourie. (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's Griffin, $13.95.) This tantalizingly ambiguous novel is framed as the confession of an old Dutchman who claims to have betrayed the hiding place of Anne Frank's family to the Nazis, and whose life has been overwhelmed by guilt. His account of his boyhood in starving wartime Amsterdam (he and his father cooked tulip bulbs when there was nothing else to eat) serves as a backdrop to the betrayal -- unless it's all a self-pitying fantasy, a possibility Lourie astutely leaves open. 
 EDEN'S OUTCASTS: The Story of Louisa May Alcott and Her Father, by John Matteson. (Norton, $17.95.) Bronson Alcott was a hero, a visionary and a crank; his fellow Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a ''tedious archangel.'' This sympathetic dual study of Alcott and his adoring second daughter, Louisa May, whose writing supported the family, won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 2008. 
 THE LONG EMBRACE: Raymond Chandler and the Woman He Loved, by Judith Freeman. (Vintage, $14.95.) ''I wanted to know them so intimately that it would amount to a kind of haunting,'' the novelist Judith Freeman writes of her effort to understand Chandler and his wife, Cissy -- and haunt she did, checking out the 30 or so Los Angeles apartments where the Chandlers lived during their marriage, sipping gimlets like Philip Marlowe in deserted bars in the middle of the day. In the process she discovers some facts about Cissy, a former nude model who was 18 years her husband's senior (he thought it was only eight), illuminates Chandler's attitude toward women and creates a portrait of present-day Los Angeles. 
 THE DEVIL'S GENTLEMAN: Privilege, Poison, and the Trial That Ushered in the Twentieth Century, by Harold Schechter. (Ballantine, $16.) When a would-be singer spurned a social-climbing chemist, the chemist poisoned his rival and married the girl, but he was tried and convicted of another poisoning. In telling this story, Schechter presents ''a late-19th-century New York that fairly throbs with exotic, specific life,'' our reviewer, Edward Lewine, said. 
 THE ROWING LESSON, by Anne Landsman. (Soho, $12.) A rower goes forward by moving backward; an apt image for Landsman's second novel, whose protagonist returns from New York to South Africa to sit at the bedside of her dying father. There she imagines her way into the life he led as a country practitioner and a Jew. 
 VON BRAUN: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War, by Michael J. Neufeld. (Vintage, $18.95.) Von Braun was ''the most influential rocket engineer and spaceflight advocate of the 20th century,'' Neufeld says, but he also sees his subject as a modern Faust, in league with the Nazi devil. This clearly written biography, extensively researched in German and American archives, is the most complete to appear to date. 
 CHILDREN AT PLAY: An American History, by Howard P. Chudacoff. (New York University, $18.95.) The tension between how kids spend their free time and how adults want them to spend it runs through Chudacoff's provocative history. Using letters, diaries and literature, he shows what children have done to amuse themselves since colonial times. 
 FOREIGNERS, by Caryl Phillips. (Vintage International, $14.95.) Lightly fictionalized profiles of three black Britons -- Samuel Johnson's servant and heir, a mixed-race prizefighter who was briefly middleweight champion of the world, and a Nigerian immigrant who was killed by the Leeds police -- provide a kind of allegory of 200 years of black history in Britain.

HEADLINE: Economy Testing Creativity Of the Arts

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

DATELINE: RIDGEFIELD 

 BODY:
 It's a Friday night in late November, just before 8, and the hundreds of people in the halls of the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum here are ready to spend some money. They've paid at least $150 to get in, and most are going to spend at least another $350 for one of more than 250 paintings by artists whose names they won't know until after they've made their purchase.
 It's a fund-raiser called ''Aldrich Undercover.'' All the works were created on identical 9-by-12 paper canvases and donated by the artists, all of whom are known (some more than others) in contemporary art circles. 
 The undercover sale, a different approach to raising money when times are tight, was created by the Aldrich to be low cost and less exclusive than a classic auction. 
 ''Museums really need to look at their funding structures,'' said Harry Philbrick, the Aldrich's director and the man who signals the doors to open at precisely 8 p.m. ''And it's not just cash coming in over the transom. It's finding different ways to do things.''
 Mr. Philbrick's view is being echoed throughout Connecticut's arts community as museums, galleries, theater and opera companies, orchestras and dance troupes face the reality that the thin line most of them walk in even the best of economic times is likely to get even thinner as the current financial crisis plays out.
 Like the Aldrich, Connecticut arts groups are generally taking an activist tack in how they are bracing for the worst -- channeling their creativity into new ways to save money, raise money and develop programming and community connections that will keep people coming through their doors.
 But many concerns remain. Foundations and corporations, which in many cases provide arts groups with well over half their funding, are still sorting out their financial situations. State funding has already been cut once this year by 5 percent, and further reductions are believed to be inevitable in the face of an estimated $6 billion deficit over the next two years.
 Clouding all of it is a pervasive fear among arts groups that in difficult economic times they will be considered dispensable.
 ''I worry about that conversation happening, but I have not heard that conversation yet,'' said Nancy P. Roberts, president of the Connecticut Council for Philanthropy, which works with foundations, corporations and philanthropic organizations in the state. ''Are we going to want our arts and cultural organizations to be there at the end of this?
 ''Those organizations are important to our well being.''
 And yet some have already succumbed after years of trying to make ends meet. Stamford Theater Works closed its doors in October after 20 years, its ongoing financial difficulties exacerbated by the current downturn, which made it even harder to raise money. The Stamford Center for the Arts, while keeping its doors open, declared bankruptcy in August.
 Some arts groups are reporting increased audiences, some decreased. Some are already seeing signs of flagging contributions. Some say their funding is solid. Most say they just don't know yet.
 ''At this time of year, usually we've heard from more of our corporate sponsors and have more secure commitments than we do right now,'' said Nancy Heller, executive director of the Westport Arts Center. ''Our greatest uncertainty is areas of corporate sponsorship and individual contributions.''
 The center, which has an annual operating budget of $800,000 to $900,000, about 70 percent of which comes from donors, is considering cutting fees to the public and focusing on educational and family activities. Its WACky Family Days -- a series of monthly Sunday programs that begins in January -- charges $10 for children; parents are free.
 ''Our job right now more than anything,'' Ms. Heller said, ''is to find a way to best bring value to the community.''
 At the 78-year-old Westport Country Playhouse, a new season pass that costs $24 a month allows holders to see anything if a seat is available. It capitalizes on the last-minute ticket-buying trend that many theaters are seeing. 
 ''We're sort of in a new reality,'' said Jodi Schoenbrun Carter, managing director of the playhouse. ''We're creative and nimble and reactive and proactive at the same time.''
 She said ticket sales are strong, a trend other area theaters are also experiencing as people choose an evening of high-quality theater near home instead of in more expensive Manhattan.
 But the outlook is generally less sanguine in the Hartford area.
 ''It's a lot scary, I'll say that much,'' said Linda Jackson managing director of the Connecticut Opera. Ticket sales for the opening performances last month were down by 50 percent compared with last year, she said.
 And with prices running as high as $95, the company is exploring cost-cutting options for next year, including switching from sets to painted backdrops. ''If any of us could figure out the trick to making producing opera less expensive, we'd probably all be in better shape,'' Ms. Jackson said.
 A year ago, the Hartford Symphony Orchestra began putting into effect a strategic plan to help stabilize its precarious financial situation, reducing the budget by 10 percent to $6 million and overhauling programming to reflect audience preferences. The orchestra is performing all nine Beethoven symphonies and taking small ensembles to performing sites in the community, like the Charter Oak Cultural Center. 
 ''It helps make up the difference, and it also acknowledges that everyone is struggling in this economy,'' said Kristen M. Phillips, the orchestra's executive director. ''People still need the arts as a positive force in their lives. If your 401(k) has taken a huge hit and then you go hear something like Beethoven's Ninth, that can be a very uplifting and transformative experience.''
 A big concern among arts organizations in the Hartford area is the uncertainty -- most corporations and foundations have yet to calculate next year's funding levels. The Greater Hartford Arts Council, which typically distributes about $2 million, does not even begin its annual fund-raising until March. The Hartford Foundation for Public Giving, one of the oldest and largest foundations in the country, expects its disbursements to stay level in 2009 at about $26 million, 13 percent of which generally goes to the arts. But, like other foundations, the Hartford Foundation averages its giving based on several years of assets, so the brunt of the current financial dip will not be felt for another couple of years.
 The Connecticut Arts Endowment Fund, which is separate from arts funding in the state budget, was calculated before the stock market drop, so it will actually go up next year.
 Companies like Lincoln Financial, the Hartford, Webster Bank and United Technologies all say next year's funding levels have not been determined, although most note that requests are up and arts organizations have been calling.
 ''In past years they may have sent in a proposal and hoped for the best,'' said Michael Gannon, director of social responsibility at the Hartford, which typically donates about $800,000 to Hartford area arts organizations. ''This year they're reaching out looking for advice on ways to sweeten the pot so they have the best chance at receiving a grant in return.''
 All parties are mindful that cutbacks to the arts can have ripple effects on local economies. The International Festival of Arts and Ideas, which each summer runs for two weeks in New Haven, had anoverall economic impact on the city -- including direct and residual revenue from the festival -- of more than $19 million last summer, organizers said.
 ''The question is how we can think about shoring up the ecosystem and not just the individual organizations,'' said Mary Lou Aleskie, executive director of the festival. ''If you focus on the fact that you're on quicksand, you get sucked in. You have to keep moving.''
 THE festival and other groups use the Shubert Theater in New Haven for box office functions, which saves everyone money, and the Shubert recently began managing national tours for troupes from overseas, which allows it to cost-share with other theaters. 
 Down the block at the Long Wharf Theater, Joan Channick, managing director, has already swapped out one play for another, lower-cost one in deference to the economy.
 ''Our season got off to a very good start,'' she said, noting that the opening play, ''Hughie,'' starring Brian Dennehy, added an extra week to its run. ''I have some trepidations about the future.''
 Ms. Channick said donors have been cautious -- renewing support, but at lower levels. Compounding the situation is the theater's $35 million fund-raising drive for its planned move to downtown New Haven ( the total cost of the project is $65 million, $30 million of which has been promised by the state). 
 ''If you ask people for commitments now, they'll say 'no,' or give smaller commitments. It doesn't mean abandon it,'' Ms. Channick said, noting that the theater raised $5.5 million in the last six months. ''It's important for all of us not to lose our nerve and not stop the process.''
 Which is why, at the Aldrich, Mr. Philbrick has more in his bag of tricks than just Aldrich Undercover. He's exploring collaborations with other museums to bring in Brazilian art. He's talking to area colleges about a curatorial internship that would help him save staff money and a museum education program.
 And if Aldrich Undercover is any indication, creativity pays off, literally. On Nov. 21 -- the end of a devastating week in the stock market -- the art sale still managed to top its $150,000 goal.
 Lori Ordover, 51, of New Canaan, who works in real estate, bought two pieces. ''I think it's very important to support artists all the time, even when there's an economic downturn,'' she said. ''It's always been creativity that gets us through the difficult times.''
 Alison Cilia, 44, of Katonah, N.Y., who is in advertising, also bought two paintings. She said she had thought hard about whether to come and spend the money. In the end, she said, she decided that ''this kind of stuff shouldn't go away.''
 ''This is something that you should value,'' she said, ''and the only way it endures is if people support it.''

HEADLINE: Bail Out the Writers!

BYLINE: By PAUL GREENBERG. 
Paul Greenberg is writing a book about fish.

 BODY:
A little while back my daughter told me the following depressing joke: 
 Woman: What do you do? 
 Man: Me? Oh, I write books. 
 Woman: How interesting! Have you sold anything recently? 
 Man: Why, yes. My couch, my car and my flat-screen television. 
 A snarkier writer-father might have added, ''and I sold those things to pay for your private school tuition!'' But instead it got me thinking that there was a real problem here. Not just a small problem involving issues of respect between one writer and one teenager, but rather a national problem of respect where being a writer has become so widely associated with being a loser that we have become the stuff of common jokes. 
 My friends (as the nation's most famous loser, John McCain, likes to begin his appeals), in these times of plummeting consumer confidence and evaporating labor markets, it is time to address the problem head on. We must now go boldly forward and bail out the writers. 
 What would such a bailout consist of? In the 1930s, Franklin Delano Roosevelt started the Federal Writers' Project, under which some 6,000 out-of-work writers were hired over a period of several years to write guidebooks, oral histories, ethnographies and the like, and in the process ''describe America to Americans.'' The program not only kept American writers alive but seems to have helped them multiply, to the point where there are now, according to a survey released last summer by the National Endowment for the Arts, approximately 185,000 people in the United States who support themselves primarily as writers of books, plays, poetry, speeches and other literary matter. Thanks to this group, America has been described and redescribed so many times that I fear a kind of word-based Strategic Defense Initiative is taking shape above us, shielding us from harsher but more realistic foreign words and creating resentment among our allies. 
 I am not suggesting that a Rooseveltian approach to the writing crisis is inappropriate. Rather, we should look elsewhere in Roosevelt's legacy for a modern solution. A good place to start would be the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. This entity recognized that an overcapacity of farms and farm produce was driving down crop prices, and that elimination of that overcapacity was needed. 
 Overcapacity has been something generally acknowledged across the writing industry for at least 10 years. In a 2002 essay in The New York Times, the onetime best-selling novelist and story writer Ann Beattie mourned the situation of the modern writer, living in a world where people are more interested in ''being a writer'' than in writing itself. ''There are too many of us, and M.F.A. programs graduate more every year, causing publishers to suffer snow-blindness, which has resulted in everyone getting lost,'' she lamented. That Ann Beattie must now compete on Amazon with a self-published author named Ann Rothrock Beattie is proof of how enormous the blizzard has become. 
 So how would my big St. Bernard of a bailout dig the publishers out of their drifts? According to the industry tracker Bowker, about 275,000 new titles and editions are published in the United States each year. Let's say we want to eliminate half of them. Assuming it takes about two years to write your average book, we would offer book writers two years of salary at the writers' average annual income of $38,000 a year. Add it all up and you get a paltry $10.5 billion to dramatically reduce the book overcapacity. 
 Unfortunately, not all writers would settle for a couple of years' salary to get out of the writing game. No sooner had I proposed this essay to the Book Review than I found a New Yorker humor piece by Andy Borowitz called ''Too Big to Fail.''; In it, Borowitz outlines a similar bailout (albeit a personal one for him alone), but our ideas were close enough to make me fear that maybe I was part of the overcapacity. Unless, of course, I could buy out Borowitz. 
 I quickly e-mailed him and asked what it would take for him to get out of my way. ''I would like $400,000,'' Borowitz replied. ''That would give me enough money to throw myself an A.I.G.-style party to celebrate.'' 
 O.K., let's take Borowitz at his word, since $400,000, according to the National Endowment for the Arts, is about what an average writer earns in a decade -- more than enough time to find a better job. If we multiply $400,000 times 92,500 -- half of the 185,000 Americans the N.E.A. identifies as ''authors and writers'' -- we get a total bailout cost of $37 billion. That's about half of what the government paid for the first installment of the A.I.G. rescue. Should you still find that number too big to swallow, let me ask point blank: Whom would you rather bail out, a writer or an insurance executive? 
 Of course, putting this kind of money on the table would require the strictest of oversight, and for this we could make use of a structure already in place -- i.e., the long-suffering spouses and domestic partners of writers. Under the terms of the bailout, these emotional custodians would be transformed into fiscal custodians and would release funds only when a full cessation of writing activities occurred. There might be a transitional period in which a quick ''think piece'' or travel junket would be allowed, but all major ''projects'' would be stopped cold. Custodians would have to bear the burden of a certain amount of re-education during the transition period. A bailed-out writer would no doubt for many months continue to begin conversations with phrases like ''I just had a great idea for a n--.'' A custodian would intervene here and offer to end the sentence more constructively with something like ''-- new kind of delicious muffin?'' 
 The only problem with my bailout package is the same problem we've already seen with the financial sector: just because you bail out a sector doesn't mean the sector will behave itself (cf that $400,000 A.I.G. corporate retreat). Not long ago, inspired by the N.E.A., I distributed my own unscientific survey to the several hundred authors who share the ''workspace for writers'' I inhabit weekday mornings. Of those who replied, around 60 percent had spent more than $10,000 on their writing education, while a similar number were earning less than $20,000 a year from writing. But when asked what they would do ''if given a subsidy with no strings attached that would support you at a comfortable income level for the rest of your life,'' 96 percent said they would write as much as or more than they do now. 
 The economy slips deeper and deeper into its trench, and yet the workspace for writers seems to get more crowded by the day as refugees from other professions take cover behind what they hope will be the respectability of the writing life. The other day, as I looked down on the field of cubicles from the ''resting area'' on the balcony, I felt an urge to read aloud from a Graham Greene story I had disregarded in my 20s: ''Are you prepared for the years of effort, 'the long defeat of doing nothing well'? As the years pass writing will not become any easier, the daily effort will grow harder to endure, those 'powers of observation' will become enfeebled; you will be judged, when you reach your 40s, by performance and not by promise.'' Harsh stuff. But don't take Greene's word for it, or mine. I'm a writer. Maybe I'm just trying to clear a little more room for myself at the workspace.

HEADLINE: 13 Years After Peace Accord, Fear Grows of New Ethnic Conflict in Divided Bosnia

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- Thirteen years after the United States brokered the Dayton peace agreement to end the ferocious ethnic war in the former Yugoslavia, fears are mounting that Bosnia, poor and divided, is again teetering toward crisis.
On the surface, this haunted capital, its ancient mosques and Orthodox churches still pocked by mortar fire, appears to be enjoying a renaissance. Young professionals throng to stylish cafes and gleaming new shopping malls while the muezzin heralds the morning prayer. The ghosts of Srebrenica linger -- recalling the worst massacre in Europe since World War II -- but Sarajevans prefer to talk about President-elect Barack Obama or the global financial crisis.
Yet for the first time in years, talk of the prospect of another war is creeping into conversations across the ethnic divide in Bosnia, a former Yugoslav republic that the Dayton agreement divided into two entities, a Muslim-Croat Federation and a Serbian Republic.
The power-sharing agreement between former foes has always been tense. Now, however, the uneasy peace has been complicated by Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in February, which many here worry could prompt the Serbian Republic to follow suit, tipping the region into a conflict that could fast turn deadly. 
''It's time to pay attention to Bosnia again, if we don't want things to get nasty very quickly,'' Richard C. Holbrooke, the Clinton administration official who brokered the Dayton accord, and Paddy Ashdown, formerly the West's top diplomat in Bosnia, warned recently in an open letter published in several newspapers. ''By now, the entire world knows the price of that.''
The peace agreement, negotiated at a United States Air Force base near Dayton, Ohio, in November 1995, accomplished its goal of ending a savage three-and-a-half-year war in which about 100,000 people were killed, a majority of them Muslims. A million more Muslims, Serbs and Croats were driven from their homes, while much of this rugged country's infrastructure was destroyed.
But the decentralized political system that Dayton engineered has entrenched rather than healed ethnic divisions. Even in communities where Serbs, Muslims and Croats live side by side, some opt to send their children to the same schools, but in different shifts.
And the country's leaders are so busy fighting one another that they are impeding Bosnia from progressing. Locked in an impasse of mutual recrimination are Haris Silajdzic -- the Muslim in the country's three-member presidency, who has called for the Serbian Republic to be abolished -- and the Bosnian Serb prime minister, Milorad Dodik, who is supported by Russia and Serbia and who has dangled the threat that his republic could secede.
Bosnia, which has received more than $18 billion in foreign aid since 1995, remains a ward of the West, its security guaranteed by 2,000 European Union peacekeepers.
Sketching a worst-case example, Srecko Latal, a Bosnia specialist at the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network in Sarajevo, warned that if the Serbian Republic declared independence, Croatia would respond by sending in troops, while the Bosnian Muslims would take up arms. If Banja Luka, the capital of the Serbian Republic, were to fall, he continued, Serbia would be provoked into entering the fray, leading to the prospect of a regional war.
''For the first time in years, people are talking about war,'' Mr. Latal said. ''They are tired of it, and they don't want it. But it is not beyond the realm of possibility.''
Leaders across Bosnia expressed hope that Mr. Obama would be more engaged in Bosnia than President Bush has been, while emphasizing that the president-elect's multicultural background made him ideally suited to mediate here.
And although Bosnia was featured in a painful campaign gaffe for the probable new secretary of state, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who stepped back from a claim that she had ducked sniper fire during a visit here as first lady -- many here are optimistic that she will have a vested interest in salvaging Dayton as part of President Bill Clinton's legacy.
Bosnia's prospects for stability, analysts say, would also be helped if it joined the European Union, the world's biggest trading bloc. But progress has not been encouraging. In a damning report assessing Bosnia's readiness to join the bloc, the European Commission, the group's executive body, warned in November that ''inflammatory rhetoric has adversely affected the functioning of institutions and slowed down reform'' while corruption and organized crime were significant.
The world is so concerned about Bosnia's stability that the United Nations Security Council has extended the mandate of its senior envoy to Bosnia, who was supposed to leave this year, until June. Still, Miroslav Lajcak, the envoy, said in an interview that while the situation is critical, it was a sign of Bosnia's progress that politics now trumped security as the biggest challenge.
''The political situation is difficult, volatile and unstable, but it is not undermining security,'' he said. ''Violence can't be ruled out, but I don't see the prospect of another war.''
For the country to progress, leaders on all sides say, the structure established by the Dayton accord must be overhauled. The country's two entities have their own Parliaments, and there are 10 regional authorities, each with its own police force and education, health and judicial authorities.
The result is a byzantine system of government directed by 160 ministers, a structure that absorbs 50 percent of Bosnia's gross domestic product of $15 billion, according to the World Bank.
While untangling that bureaucracy would be difficult, persuading the country's leaders to put aside their fundamental differences might be harder.
In October 2007, the country experienced one of its worst political crises when Bosnian Serbs protested a new voting system aimed at preventing politicians from blocking major reform efforts by simply not showing up at meetings.
Fearing that it could be outvoted by other ethnic groups under the new rules, the Serbian Republic condemned the measures and Mr. Dodik threatened to withdraw his party's representatives from all Bosnian institutions. The crisis finally ended after some concessions were made to the Bosnian Serbs, and the European Union rewarded the country by initialing an agreement cementing Bosnia's ties with the bloc.
Mr. Silajdzic, who as Bosnia's wartime foreign minister was at Dayton, argued in an interview that the institutional structure created there had served to legitimize the genocidal policy of the Serbs during the war. He urged the world to help write a new Constitution that would create a unified state based on economic regions, effectively consigning the Serbian Republic to the dustbin.
''The problem with Dayton is that it created an ethnocracy rather than a democracy and has become an umbrella under which Slobodan Milosevic's project of ethnic cleansing is hidden,'' he said, referring to the former Serbian president. ''If the situation is allowed to continue, the message this sends the world is, 'Kill thy neighbor and get away with it.' ''
For Mr. Dodik, the prime minister, such talk just proves that Bosnia's Muslim leadership is intent on domination.
''If Silajdzic doesn't like Dayton, then why did he sign it?'' he asked.
Mr. Dodik, a charismatic former basketball player with a large power base in the Serbian Republic, was once a Western darling for his wartime and postwar opposition to Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb nationalist leader now on trial in The Hague on war crime charges. But many Western diplomats say he has since adopted Mr. Karadzic's nationalist language and they blame him for impeding Bosnia's progress.
Mr. Dodik recently further inflamed tensions by filing criminal charges against a senior United States envoy and foreign prosecutors in Bosnia, accusing them of plotting against his government after they opened a corruption investigation into the Serbian Republic's infrastructure deals, including one for $146 million government building in Banja Luka.
''We are tired of being treated like a banana republic,'' Mr. Dodik said.
Guessing whether he will tear the country apart has become a favorite parlor game in Bosnia in recent months. In the past, he has said that a referendum for independence could be a fair way to settle the Serbian Republic's status.
But in a recent interview, he said that secession was not on his agenda.
''I have said many times that my aim is not secession and we have not taken a single step toward that,'' Mr. Dodik said. ''What has been said is a fabrication.''
Most Serbian analysts agree that secession would be tantamount to political suicide for the prime minister. Beyond the obvious threat of provoking a war, aligning the Serbian Republic with Serbia would diminish Mr. Dodik's power and lead to further isolation internationally.
In the former Yugoslavia, the lives of Serbs, Croats and Muslims were closely entwined for 45 years, with intermarriage not uncommon in larger cities like Sarajevo. But Mr. Dodik said the dissolution of the old state and the war that followed had destroyed whatever optimism he once had about different ethnic groups collectively deciding one another's fates.
''Bosnia is a divided country,'' he said. ''There is not a single event or holiday, except for New Year's or the First of May, that we celebrate together. I have lost all of my illusions.''

HEADLINE: Where Did The Jobs Go? Try The Rooftop

BYLINE: By JULIE BICK. 
Fresh Starts is a monthly column about emerging jobs and job trends.

 BODY:
MOVE over, Joe the Plumber. Spencer the Solar Panel Installer is here. 
 In this case, it's Spencer Bockus, who created solar-powered fans and other contraptions for science fairs as a fifth grader in California. Today, at 22, he is on customers' roofs, measuring where the shade will hit and hooking up photovoltaic arrays, better known as solar panels, to convert the sun's energy into electricity. 
 ''Sometimes I'm 50 feet up on a steep roof and it's so hot the tar is melting onto the bottoms of my sneakers,'' he said, ''but I'm excited because I'm helping the environment.'' 
 Even in the recession, Mr. Bockus has been putting in plenty of overtime for his company, Akeena Solar, which is based in Los Gatos, Calif., and has offices elsewhere in California and in Colorado and the Northeast.
 According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, based in Washington, there was a 45 percent increase in installed solar energy systems in 2007 over 2006. 
 More than 3,400 companies are in the solar energy sector and employ about 25,000 to 35,000 workers, including installers, manufacturers, distributors and project developers and materials suppliers. 
 ''We estimate that will grow to more than 110,000 direct solar jobs by 2016,'' said Monique Hanis, a spokeswoman for the organization.
 Solar workers install thermal collectors, which convert the sun's rays into heat used to supply buildings with hot water, for heating and cooling systems and to warm swimming pools. They also install solar panels to convert the sun's rays into electricity that can power things like appliances and lights. When more electricity is being produced than the customer is using, the excess can be stored in batteries for use at other times. When batteries are full, the surplus electricity can be exported back to the electrical grid if the building is connected to it, offsetting electricity costs from the utility company.
 Consumers are turning to solar energy for various reasons, including, of course, the idea that solar power creates no carbon emissions. And many people feel that solar power is important in reducing the dependence of the United States on foreign oil. Some even see a roof festooned with solar panels as an ecological status symbol. 
 Beyond all of that, government subsidies can reduce the cost of installing solar panels. 
 Bob Cowen of Morris County, N.J., chose solar panels for his roof for both ecological and economic reasons. To outfit his home with 49 solar panels, he paid $64,700, minus rebates of $42,500 -- for an out-of-pocket cost of $22,200. 
 ''The rebates I received from the state of New Jersey made the switch to solar economically feasible,'' he said. 
 In California, Barry A. Cinnamon installed solar panels on his garage in 2001 as a way to save energy costs. Neighbors saw the work and asked him to install panels on their homes, too.
 ''Some people say their company started in a garage,'' Mr. Cinnamon said. ''Mine started on top of one.'' 
 Mr. Cinnamon is now the chief executive of Akeena, which has about $40 million in annual sales and employs 220 workers in seven states. Despite the recession, he estimates that his solar panel installation business will increase 40 percent from last year. 
 Solar panel installers must be able to lift heavy equipment and should feel confident about working in high places, because much of their day is spent on roofs. As for formal training, Mr. Cinnamon said that a high school or trade school education is all that is needed. 
 ''We're designing easier-to-install panels so there's less complicated wiring requirements,'' he said, ''but electrical experience is a plus'' because each project requires someone to perform electrical work. 
 Some applicants with college engineering or business degrees start as solar panel installers, hoping to move into other jobs -- like product designer, sales manager or supervisor -- within the company or industry.
 GERRY HEIMBUCH, vice president for operations at the Solar Center in Rockaway, N.J., estimates that his company hires a new solar panel installer every month. Many good candidates have come from the sluggish homebuilding industry. 
 Beside looking for construction and electrical skills, Mr. Heimbuch wants people who can communicate well.
 ''Our installers need to explain to customers how the new system will work, how to maintain it and how to recognize if there are any issues,'' he said. 
 The Labor Department does not have salary figures for solar panel installers, but in California, Mr. Cinnamon pays workers $15 to $30 an hour, as well as health benefits. His employees can also participate in a stock ownership plan.
 In New Jersey, installers hired by the Solar Center start with a three-month training program and earn from $16 to $28 an hour, in addition to health benefits, as they gain skills and take on higher levels of responsibility. 
 Mr. Heimbuch observes that his solar-installer work force is drawn to construction and to working outside. But he says the environmental impact is important to the workers as well. ''They feel like doing this job is doing the right thing for the planet,'' he says.

HEADLINE: The Divorced Find a Housing Niche

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
DIVORCED last March after a 15-year marriage, with three children and a job that requires extensive travel, David Hess said, ''I suddenly didn't know what to do with myself, in terms of where to live.'' 
 He knew that he wanted a place where his children, 16, 13, and 11, would feel at home on weekends, and that it should be near their mother's house in suburban Morris County. But given his work schedule, he said, maintaining his own single-family house seemed out of the question.
 Mr. Hess, 47, looked at apartments -- both rental and condominium -- but found none were set up to be both ''homey'' and ''comfortable for someone who travels constantly.''
 He did not really consider a hotel, or even an extended-stay hotel, Mr. Hess said, because that would be a ''place to stay, but not a place to live.'' 
 In the end, he found his niche by moving into a new type of housing that is itself beginning to find a niche, particularly among divorced parents like him, according to its developers at Korman Communities.
 The AVE complex in Union where Mr. Hess has resided since it opened in July is one of six, all close to mass transit centers. Three are in New Jersey, two are in Pennsylvania, and one has just been completed near a planned Metro stop in Dulles, Va. 
 The AVE complexes differ from extended-stay residences in that they offer both luxury hotel-style service and rental units, furnished and unfurnished, with condo-style amenities. A tenant can sign a lease for any time period 30 days or longer, and move in within 48 hours.
 Furnished units at the midrise AVE complexes -- the other two New Jersey sites are Clifton and Somerset -- are leased on a monthly basis, for daily rates starting at $145. Most takers are corporate travelers and business people, either working on long-term projects or being relocated, said Lea Anne Welsh, who developed the AVE brand for Korman.
 ''It is the same idea as an extended-stay hotel,'' she offered, ''although we think this provides a much nicer situation, because of the amenities and services.'' 
 But it is the unfurnished units -- leased for a minimum of six months, and ordinarily a year -- that are emerging as a ''hybrid'' housing alternative, Ms. Welsh said. Set off in separate wings, and offering weekly social events for residents, in addition to the AVE concierge services, free cafe breakfast and fitness center access, they are evolving into small ''neighborhoods,'' as Ms. Welsh put it. 
 ''That alternative seems to appeal really strongly to the divorced-dad/executive group,'' she said, ''and some divorced moms, too.'' Dozens of no-longer-married adults, many of them with children, have signed leases for a year's term or longer at each of the complexes, she said; divorced fathers account for about 25 percent of all tenants at the 785 units in New Jersey, and 508 in Pennsylvania.
 Korman did not precisely set out to capture the divorced-person market, Ms. Welsh explained. ''But we did realize that our concept offering flexibility, style and services was likely to appeal to that group.''
 Also, she said, the company had expected that locations in suburban communities close to major urban centers would appeal to ''people in transition, who want to stay close to family'' -- and its expectations have been borne out. 
 Mr. Hess, for example, says he is thrilled that his children have only a 10-minute train ride between his home and their mother's in an adjoining community. 
 George Carrara, who has lived in the 238-unit Clifton AVE on Passaic Avenue since April 2007, describes himself as ''one of the divorced legions.'' 
 ''I don't have kids myself,'' he said, ''but I am Sicilian, so I have a tight-knit family, and they come to visit often.''
 Mr. Carrara, who is a vice president of the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation, described the Clifton site as ideal for him because it provides easy access to the company's showrooms in Manhattan and its distribution center in Cranbury.
 ''Clifton!'' he said. ''Who would have thought? Two minutes off the highway, and during the summer, out by the pool, you'd swear you're in Bermuda.'' 
 Lights that change colors at the push of a button are built into the pool deck; in the summer, vine arbors and tropical plantings are installed, Ms. Welsh said. The Clifton complex also has a large ''tranquillity courtyard,'' set beside its yoga center.
 On the professional side, the AVE complexes offer business centers with banks of computers, and fully wired conference rooms, where Mr. Carrara said he sometimes conducts meetings.
 The resort hotel/neighborhood/executive suite ambience is not for the faint-of-wallet, of course. 
 Danielle Mayville, whose two daughters reside with her during the week (doing their homework in the business center and watching films in the movie theater), said: ''The price is high. It definitely is. But to me, it is so all-inclusive, it is worth it.''
 Ms. Mayville, the manager of the Movado boutique at the Mall at Short Hills, leases a two-bedroom two-bath unfurnished suite in Clifton. The price range for such units is $2,595 to $3,330 a month, when leased on a yearly basis. A two-bedroom unit with a study goes for $3,600 a month. One-bedrooms start at $1,995 per month and go up to $2,550.
 By contrast, a one-bedroom furnished suite costs $145 to $165 a day, if rented for a month. For a two-bedroom two-bath suite with a direct view of the New York City skyline, the rate is $295 to $395 per day.
 Ms. Welsh said the overall economic slump was hurting AVE business ''a bit,'' but not substantially so far. ''In some cases,'' she said, ''companies are moving people who don't want to be moved, and maybe trying to cushion the blow by giving them the experience of living at AVE.''
 Ms. Welsh says AVE's employees have come to recognize the signs of a new tenant in the throes of a divorce, and they strive to accommodate ''distress or disorientation.''
 Some tenants arrive asking about privacy and safety, first and foremost, and not yet ready to gravitate to the social gatherings in the cafe area. ''We watch over them, ask how things are going, ask if there is anything they need in their apartments -- a blender? Extra pillows and blankets for visitors?'' 
 ''Eventually,'' Ms. Welsh said, ''it seems that everyone settles in to the 'neighborhood.' ''

HEADLINE: For I. M. Pei, History Is Still Happening

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar 

 BODY:
 I CAN'T seem to get the Museum of Islamic Art out of my mind. There's nothing revolutionary about the building. But its clean, chiseled forms have a tranquillity that distinguishes it in an age that often seems trapped somewhere between gimmickry and a cloying nostalgia.
 Part of the allure may have to do with I. M. Pei, the museum's architect. Mr. Pei reached the height of his popularity decades ago with projects like the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Louvre pyramid in Paris. Since then he has been an enigmatic figure at the periphery of the profession. His best work has admirers, but it has largely been ignored within architecture's intellectual circles. Now, at 91 and near the end of a long career, Mr. Pei seems to be enjoying the kind of revival accorded to most serious architects if they have the luck to live long enough. 
 But the museum is also notable for its place within a broader effort to reshape the region's cultural identity. The myriad large-scale civic projects, from a Guggenheim museum that is planned for Abu Dhabi to Education City in Doha -- a vast area of new buildings that house outposts of foreign universities -- are often dismissed in Western circles as superficial fantasies. As the first to reach completion, the Museum of Islamic Art is proof that the boom is not a mirage. The building's austere, almost primitive forms and the dazzling collections it houses underscore the seriousness of the country's cultural ambition.
 Perhaps even more compelling, the design is rooted in an optimistic worldview, -- one at odds with the schism between cosmopolitan modernity and backward fundamentalism that has come to define the last few decades in the Middle East. The ideals it embodies -- that the past and the present can co-exist harmoniously -- are a throwback to a time when America's overseas ambitions were still cloaked in a progressive agenda. 
 To Mr. Pei, whose self-deprecating charm suggests a certain noblesse oblige, all serious architecture is found somewhere between the extremes of an overly sentimental view of the past and a form of historical amnesia.
 ''Contemporary architects tend to impose modernity on something,'' he said in an interview. ''There is a certain concern for history but it's not very deep. I understand that time has changed, we have evolved. But I don't want to forget the beginning. A lasting architecture has to have roots.'' This moderation should come as no surprise to those who have followed Mr. Pei's career closely. I recall first hearing his name during construction on his design for the Kennedy Library in Boston in the mid-1970s. The library, enclosed behind a towering glass atrium overlooking the water, was not one of Mr. Pei's most memorable early works, nor was it particularly innovative, but the link to Kennedy lent him instant glamour. 
 The building's pure geometries and muscular trusses seemed at the time to be the architectural equivalent of the space program. They suggested an enlightened, cultivated Modernism, albeit toned down to serve an educated, well-polished elite. Completed 16 years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the library's construction seemed to be an act of hope, as if the values that Kennedy's generation embodied could be preserved in stone, steel and glass.
 In many ways Mr. Pei's career followed the unraveling of that era, from the economic downturn of the 1970s through the hollow victories of the Reagan years. Yet his work never lost its aura of measured idealism. It reached its highest expression in the National Gallery of Art's East Building, a composition of angular stone forms completed in 1978 that remains the most visible emblem of modern Washington.
 Since that popular triumph Mr. Pei has often seemed to take the kind of leisurely, slow-paced approach to design that other architects, no matter how well established, can only dream of. When first approached in 1983 to take part in a competition to design the addition to the Louvre, he refused, saying that he would not submit a preliminary design. President Francois Mitterrand nevertheless hired him outright. Mr. Pei then asked him if he could take several months to study French history.
 ''I told him I wanted to learn about his culture,'' Pei recalled. ''I knew the Louvre well. But I wanted to see more than just architecture. I think he understood immediately.'' Mr. Pei spent months traveling across Europe and North Africa before earnestly beginning work on the final design of the glass pyramids that now anchor the museum's central court.
 In 1990, a year after the project's completion, he left his firm, handing its reins over to his partners Harry Cobb and James Ingo Freed so that he could concentrate more on design. More recently he has lived in semi-retirement, sometimes working on the fourth floor office of his Sutton Place town house or sketching quietly in a rocking chair in his living room. He rarely takes on more than a single project at a time.
 Such an attitude runs counter to the ever-accelerating pace of the global age -- not to mention our obsession with novelty. But if Mr. Pei's methods seem anachronistic, they also offer a gentle resistance to the short-sightedness of so many contemporary cultural undertakings. 
 Many successful architects today are global nomads, sketching ideas on paper napkins as they jet from one city to another. In their designs they tend to be more interested in exposing cultural frictions -- the clashing of social, political and economic forces that undergird contemporary society -- than in offering visions of harmony. 
 Mr. Pei, by contrast, imagines history as a smooth continuous process -- a view that is deftly embodied by the Islamic Museum, whose clean abstract surfaces are an echo of both high Modernism and ancient Islamic architecture. Conceived by the Qatari emir and his 26-year-old daughter, Sheikha al Mayassa, it is the centerpiece of a larger cultural project whose aim is to forge a cosmopolitan, urban society in a place that not so long ago was a collection of Bedouin encampments and fishing villages. The aim is to recall a time that extended from the birth of Islam through the height of the Ottoman Empire, when the Islamic world was a center of scientific experimentation and cultural tolerance.
 ''My father's vision was to build a cross-cultural institution,'' said Sheikha al Mayassa, who has been charged with overseeing the city's cultural development, during a recent interview here. ''It is to reconnect the historical threads that have been broken, and finding peaceful ways to resolve conflict.''
 Mr. Pei's aim was to integrate the values of that earlier era into today's culture -- to capture, as he put it, the ''essence of Islamic architecture.''
 The museum's hard, chiseled forms take their inspiration from the ablution fountain of Ibn Tulun Mosque in Cairo, as well as from fortresses built in Tunisia in the eighth and ninth centuries -- simple stone structures strong enough to hold their own in the barrenness of the desert landscape.
 In order to create a similar sense of withdrawal from the world, Mr. Pei located his museum on a small man-made island, approachable from a short bridge. Seen from a distance, its blocklike forms are a powerful contrast to the half-finished towers and swiveling construction cranes that line the waterfront. Stepped on both sides, the apex of the main building is punctuated by a short tower with an eye-shaped opening that masks an interior dome. 
 From certain angles the structure has a flat, chimeric quality, like a stage set. From others it seems to be floating on the surface of the water -- an effect that recalls Santa Maria della Salute, the imposing Baroque church that guards the entry to the Grand Canal in Venice.
 As one approaches the building, the full weight of the structure begins to bear down, and the forms become more imposing. The bridge, flanked by rows of tall palm trees, is set diagonally to the entry, which makes the stacked geometric forms appear more angular and the contrast between light and shadow more extreme.
 Soon a few traditional details begin to appear: the two small arched windows over the entry; a covered arcade that links the museum to an education center. These touches seem minor, but they provide a sense of scale, so that the size of the building can be understood according to the size of the human body. 
 The blend of modern and Islamic themes continues inside, where Mr. Pei draws most directly from religious precedents. The hemispherical dome, an intricate pattern of stainless steel plates pierced by a single small oculus, brings to mind the geometric patterns used in Baroque churches as well as in ancient mosques. 
 The weight of the interior's chiseled stone forms, with the dome resting on a faceted drum and square base, evokes both classical precedents and the late works of Louis Kahn, whose fusion of modern structure with a timeless monumentality was a turning point in Modernist history.
 Mr. Pei's design lacks the depth and cohesion of Kahn's greatest work. The structural system that supports the dome, for instance, is not particularly elegant; on one side the drum that supports it rests on slender three-story-tall columns, on the other it extends down to meet a wall that encloses a floor of offices before resting on a series of shorter columns, upsetting the room's natural symmetry.
 Nonetheless the meaning of the space is clear. Mr. Pei has created a temple of high art, placing culture on the same pedestal as religion. His aim is both to create a symbol of Islamic culture and to forge a common heritage for the citizens of Qatar and the region.
 The grandeur of the atrium is only a prelude to the real climax: the galleries, which are as intimate as the atrium is soaring. Objects are encased in towering glass cabinets set on tables, giving them an accessibility rare in a major museum. There is also just the right amount of space between the objects -- enough to let them breathe without being isolated.
 And like the building itself, the collections are a reflection of the notion that Modernity and Islamic culture are not in opposition, but woven out of the same historical thread. There are dazzling scientific objects here, including a display of astrolabes, as well as priceless works of calligraphy. (Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which owns one of the world's premier collections of Islamic Art, put it best when I spoke to him at the museum's inaugural gala: ''Many of the pieces I've bid on over the past 10 years, they got.'')
 Yet the most moving works are those that underscore the cosmopolitan values that are at the core of this museum: the notion that the free, open exchange of ideas is what builds great -- and tolerant -- civilizations: a matrix of Spanish Corinthian columns with Islamic flourishes; early translations of classical texts that formed the hinge between antiquity and the European Renaissance; a silk tapestry of a couple in front of a tent, illustrating the Islamic fable ''Laila and Majnun'' that is likened to Romeo and Juliet. 
 These are the moments that Mr. Pei's architecture is meant to embody. His museum reminds us that building a culture, as much as a political or social agenda, can be an act of healing. Like all great art, it requires forging seemingly conflicting values into a common whole.

HEADLINE: THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Guaranteed Retirement Account, The

BYLINE: By STEPHEN MIHM

 BODY:
 This fall, millions of Americans got a nasty shock when they opened up the reports for their individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans. With double-digit returns a thing of the past, there's an understandable nostalgia for the modest but predictable defined-benefit pensions an earlier generation of workers relied on in retirement. Now there's a proposal that revives the idea but makes it a universal, government-sponsored program. 
 Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist at the New School for Social Research, has emerged as the primary exponent of ''Guaranteed Retirement Accounts,'' or G.R.A.'s. The way they work is simple: workers who don't have access to a conventional defined-benefit plan would contribute 2.5 percent of their income (with the government seeding the first $600 of that amount). Their employers would then kick in another 2.5 percent. It's similar to a 401(k), except that the money would be deposited into an individual account with the Social Security Administration, which would pool the money and put it into relatively conservative investments.
 In administering the pool, the government would guarantee a 3 percent rate of return above and beyond inflation. On retirement, participants would receive an inflation-indexed annuity that Ghilarducci calculates would replace a quarter of the wages or salary an average worker was earning. For example, someone who contributed to a G.R.A. for 40 years and retired with a final salary of $60,000 would get an annual payment of $15,500, or 26 percent of the preretirement income. (Social Security currently provides another 45 percent of workers' preretirement income.)
 Like Social Security, the plan would be mandatory. Requiring workers to hand over an additional share of their income might not be popular. But Ghilarducci argues that only a program that forces people to save will prevent huge numbers of Americans from sinking into poverty during retirement. As for how to finance the new program, Ghilarducci has pointed out that reforming tax breaks for 401(k)s, which go disproportionately to high-income earners, would more than pay for the G.R.A.'s. Is such a plan plausible? ''The last time the financial system was shattered,'' she says, ''Social Security was born.''

HEADLINE: Tolls Increase Is Met With Sense of Inevitable

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: CLIFTON 

 BODY:
 DESPITE the news reports she had been hearing for months, Beth D'Errico, of Montclair, forgot about rising tolls until she rolled up to a Garden State Parkway tollbooth with 70 cents in her hand.
 ''It was a dollar,'' Ms. D'Errico, 45, said at the Brookdale rest stop. ''I was like, 'OK, when did this happen?' ''
 After months of negotiations between Gov. Jon S. Corzine and state legislators, and much public griping at countless hearings, tolls on the parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway went up at the beginning of the month to the surprise of hardly anyone -- but to the chagrin of many. By now, it was almost anticlimactic. 
 Robert Dudek, owner of a small North Jersey trucking company, called the increase the ''last nail,'' and said he had directed his drivers to use local routes -- 9, 35, 295 and 1 -- to save money in these trying economic times. 
 ''I've lived through oil embargoes, six-day wars, recessions, buildings falling down in Manhattan -- but this is just bad, bad timing with the tolls,'' he said. 
 Turnpike and parkway tolls went up approximately 40 percent, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority said, raising the average trip to about $1.70 on the turnpike and about $1 on the parkway. Tolls on the Atlantic City Expressway went up between 50 and 60 percent; the Egg Harbor toll plaza for cars, for example, rose to $3 from $2, the South Jersey Transportation Authority said. 
 Steve Schoenwiesner, 50, a licensing specialist who commutes daily from Montclair to White Plains, said he felt the toll increases were ''inevitable.''
 ''They say everything is so underfunded in this state,'' he said. ''You knew it was coming.''
 The majority of the money from the toll increase will be used to improve and repair the roads, and some will go toward building a new rail tunnel into Manhattan, officials said.
 The $7 billion budgeted for road work includes adding six new turnpike lanes from Exit 6 to Exit 8A, at a cost of $2.5 billion; construction at Turnpike Exit 14 in Bayonne for $500 million; and adding a third lane to the parkway between Exits 63 and 80, which will cost $200 million, officials said.
 The tolls will also raise $1.25 billion toward the new rail tunnel. 
 Joe Orlando, a spokesman for the Turnpike Authority, said that feedback about the increase has been largely negative, yet in the first week of the new tolls, he did not see a dip in turnpike or parkway traffic.
 ''On the parkway, there's been one toll increase in 57 years, and the last one was 20 years ago,'' he said. ''Tell me the last thing in your life that hasn't gone up in 20 years.''
 Parkway tolls last went up in 1989; the turnpike's in 2000. The tolls are scheduled to go up again in 2012. 
 Sharon Gordon, a spokeswoman for the South Jersey Transportation Authority, said this was the first increase in tolls on the Atlantic City Expressway since 1998. 
 Despite the assurances from officials that the money will be used for improving transportation, many remain skeptical, having grown frustrated in general at paying more taxes only to hear that state programs are in worse financial shape.
 Tom Metro, a vocational school teacher who commutes from Warren to Kenilworth, said he was pessimistic that the money will truly go for infrastructure. 
 ''Like everything else in this state, it doesn't go where they say it is,'' he said. 
 Manoj Nayar, 39, said he barely noticed the toll increase because he had an E-ZPass, which automatically takes money from his bank account when needed, and that he would be happy to pay for better roads. 
 ''If they take this money and add an extra lane, hey, I don't mind paying extra,'' said Mr. Nayar, who works in information technology and commutes from Exit 130 to Exit 172 on the parkway each day during peak hours. 
 But Ever Bedoya, 32, an independent truck driver from Paterson, said the tolls, combined with a declining business and a leaden economy, worried him greatly.
 ''If things keep on going like this, we're going to have to stop paying the mortgage,'' he said, cradling his 2-year-old son, Kelvin Bedoya.

HEADLINE: The Undertaker Comes to Wall Street

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
THESE days, it's awfully hard to get on Harvey R. Miller's calendar. 
 A 75-year-old lion of the bankruptcy bar, Mr. Miller has been consumed by the largest corporate liquidation in American history: Lehman Brothers, the storied investment bank that set off one of the most harrowing episodes in the financial crisis when it collapsed in mid-September.
 Mr. Miller's workdays begin around 8 in the morning and, if he is lucky, end near 11 at night. This combative, outspoken lawyer says that some days don't seem to end at all, but merely expand into the next, dissolving into tense meetings and complicated hearings in overheated courtrooms.
 Although Mr. Miller has been involved in landmark bankruptcy cases before -- including those of Eastern Airlines, R. H. Macy and Global Crossing -- Lehman's is in a class by itself because of volatile markets, continuing government investigations, the involvement of federal regulators and a possible wave of other corporate implosions. 
 From his perspective as Lehman's undertaker, Mr. Miller believes that the fallout from the firm's messy bankruptcy could have been avoided. Regulators could have stepped in, he says, not necessarily to save Lehman, perhaps, but to head off the meltdown that followed. ''They totally missed it,'' he says. ''Look what happened.''
 When companies rushed to terminate contracts with Lehman, he says, investor confidence plummeted in just about everything -- securities and the markets they trade on, corporate debts and the assets backing them, the power of the government and its readiness to use it. In the days after Lehman filed for bankruptcy, he notes, demand for corporate debt utterly evaporated.
 The failure of a Wall Street firm poses its own special risks, because other companies that rely on it -- such as counterparties to complex financial contracts known as derivatives -- are all financially exposed to its collapse.
 That's why Mr. Miller says it was crucial for the government to head off the wholesale termination by counterparties of all their transactions with Lehman before the firm was forced into bankruptcy. ''If the Fed or the Treasury said, 'Let's say to Lehman, there's no bailout, we're not going to save the company,' they could have supported an orderly unwinding of all the transactions over a period of months,'' he says. ''It probably would've cost the economy a lot less money.''
 THE severity of the economic downturn is leading many analysts to predict a wave of bankruptcies over the next year. And for bankruptcy experts and lawyers who specialize in the trade, all the bad news may be good news for their own business. For one firm in particular, it represents a windfall.
 Weil Gotshal & Manges, the firm where Mr. Miller is a partner, is widely believed to be first on a short list to represent General Motors if it seeks bankruptcy protection. Ira M. Millstein, another partner at the firm, has long been a trusted adviser to G.M.'s board.
 Weil is also handling bankruptcy filings by Washington Mutual, Pilgrim's Pride, Sharper Image and others, and Weil lawyers say representatives of other teetering companies are calling all the time.
 In addition to advising the American International Group, the insurance giant that needed a huge federal bailout to stave off collapse, Weil is handling 13 bankruptcy filings this year alone. 
 Still, none of the failures so far compare to Lehman's. The combined debt of the 13 bankrupt companies represented by Weil totals $684 billion, according to the firm, but a stunning $640 billion is owed by Lehman alone.
 Lawyers involved in the case say it has been a brutal sprint, in which any delay can result in billion-dollar losses. 
 ''Events move with the velocity that almost defies comprehension,'' Mr. Miller said in mid-September at a hearing at the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. In one 24-hour period, he pointed out, Lehman lost $1.6 billion when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange closed out all of Lehman's positions. 
 Since Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection early in the morning of Sept. 15, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen more than 18 percent. Investors worldwide have watched helplessly as billions of dollars they sank into stock markets have evaporated. Tens of thousands of people have already lost jobs in sweeping corporate cutbacks, and countless additional jobs are at risk. 
 With the fate of whole industries -- financial services, automaking, airlines, retailers, real estate, media -- looking shaky, demand for bankruptcy gurus is likely to remain high for some time.
 For Mr. Miller, this moment offers an opportunity, but he does not want for glory, says Sandra E. Mayerson, head of the New York restructuring practice at Holland & Knight. ''His reputation was secure without Lehman, but I think he lives for the thrill of his work,'' Ms. Mayerson says. ''He didn't need a moment.''
 MR. MILLER says there is no place he would rather be than where he is now. Asked why, he pauses an instant, then says he loves the excitement, the risk and the potential reward.
 Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, companies receive protection from creditors and an opportunity to reorganize so they can become productive again, preserve jobs and, ideally, eventually pay back their debts.
 ''If you're successful, there's nothing like reorganizing a company,'' Mr. Miller says. Although Lehman filed for Chapter 11 protection, the firm is not expected to emerge from proceedings. Even so, he says, there are still advantages to Lehman if its bankruptcy is well-managed. It can produce ''a result which benefits people,'' he says. In this case, that would mean finding buyers for Lehman's businesses that were willing to continue employing its workers.
 Mr. Miller says the first bankruptcy case he handled by himself involved a small lithograph company that was to be liquidated. Instead, it was able to reorganize. ''We had a dinner party, and the look on the employees' faces whose jobs had been saved, you can't compare that,'' he recalls of that case.
 Mr. Miller, tall, gray-haired and well dressed, is one of those hyperarticulate lawyers able to speak in complete paragraphs, offering off-the-cuff, for example, his detailed critique of the government's response to Lehman's collapse.
 He was born in 1933, and after graduating from Columbia Law School in 1959, joined a small law firm. In 1963, he joined Seligson & Morris, an eight-lawyer firm that also employed Martin Lipton, Leonard Rosen and George Katz, who went on to be co-founders of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. 
 In 1969, Mr. Millstein brought Mr. Miller aboard at Weil. Mr. Miller created the firm's finance and restructuring department. Weil bankruptcy lawyers have taken on some of the biggest, messiest cases of their time, representing Continental Airlines, Bethlehem Steel, the Sunbeam Corporation, the Marvel Entertainment Group and Carmike Cinemas. The firm also represented creditors of Donald Trump when the developer's holdings ran into problems in the early 1990s.
 Along the way, Mr. Miller helped to assemble a team of younger lawyers, many of whom are now heavyweights in the bankruptcy bar. Martin J. Bienenstock, who spent 30 years at Weil, mostly alongside Mr. Miller, recalled how intimidating it was for a young lawyer to work with Mr. Miller. 
 ''He seemed to forget long ago what it is like to only have the knowledge of a beginner,'' says Mr. Bienenstock, who is building a unit at Dewey & LeBoeuf in New York that specializes in restructuring and corporate governance.
 Mr. Miller pushed young lawyers to improve their skills, often having them prepare and make presentations, Mr. Bienenstock says. He says Mr. Miller, who for years has been a lecturer at Columbia Law School, is also a gifted tutor. 
 The first time he attended a court hearing with Mr. Miller in the late 1970s, Mr. Bienenstock says, ''I basically copied down on a legal pad everything Harvey did, from the time he stood up to go to the lectern.'' 
 He says Mr. Miller would tell a bankruptcy judge what he wanted, listen closely to the judge's response and then try to show that the judge's own thinking supported doing what Mr. Miller wanted. ''To this day, I basically follow that template because it's so effective,'' Mr. Bienenstock says.
 In 2002, after 33 years at Weil, Mr. Miller left to join Greenhill & Company, a boutique investment bank started in 1996 by Robert F. Greenhill. In 2004, Greenhill went public, presumably making Mr. Miller an even wealthier man. 
 At Greenhill, he advised Loral Space and Communications in a Chapter 11 proceeding, and got to know Bernard L. Schwartz, then Loral's chief executive. 
 ''I developed a very strong respect for his professionalism and the way he approached the issue of restructuring Loral,'' says Mr. Schwartz, who now runs BLS Investments in New York. ''He spoke with confidence, with knowledge, and he was always constructive.'' 
 Loral emerged from Chapter 11 with its management team intact, as Mr. Schwartz desired. The two men became friends, Mr. Schwartz says, and now meet for lunch at least once a month. 
 Mr. Miller left Greenhill last year and returned to Weil, a move that generated headlines in trade publications. It is not clear what prompted the move; in a statement at the time, Mr. Miller said that ''Weil is where I grew up, and it's always felt like home to me.''
 Lawyers at other firms say the timing of his return now seems a masterstroke, given the amount of bankruptcy work.
 Mr. Miller can be decidedly old-school in his approach, says Luc A. Despins, chairman of the restructuring practice at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker in New York. Mr. Despins recently represented Lehman creditors, and has faced Mr. Miller in other cases. 
 ''There's a whole generation thing there,'' says Mr. Despins, who is 48. ''When he goes to court, he has a text that is typed in front of him about what he's going to say. It is rare to see lawyers of my generation have prepared, typed text. We are more likely to have bullet points scribbled on a legal pad.''
 And Mr. Miller seems indefatigable, Mr. Despins says. In the Lehman case, he observes, Mr. Miller ''doesn't flinch.''
 ''He did all-nighters and all that,'' Mr. Despins adds. ''It's pretty incredible.''
 But even as lawyers express admiration for Mr. Miller, some also describe him as a hard man to get along with, a man whose temper has sometimes gotten the better of him. In one well-known instance, while representing Eastern Airlines in its reorganization effort nearly 20 years ago, he turned in frustration to a lawyer representing a potential buyer of the company and grabbed him by the collar -- while both were in a judge's chambers.
 Mr. Miller said afterward that he regretted the lapse, but the story stuck.
 Joel B. Zweibel, a well-known retired bankruptcy lawyer who says he physically restrained Mr. Miller at that meeting, chuckles at the memory. He describes Mr. Miller as a difficult but very worthy opponent. 
 Mr. Zweibel squared off with Mr. Miller many times over the years, including the Macy's bankruptcy. He says that while he was able to become good friends with courtroom opponents, Mr. Miller was the exception.
 ''That was not my experience with Harvey,'' Mr. Zweibel says. ''The relationship was strictly adversarial.''
 People whom Mr. Miller perceives as adversaries outside the courtroom are treated accordingly on the inside. 
 During court proceedings in the Lehman bankruptcy, Mr. Miller leveled a snide comment at his former partner, Mr. Bienenstock, questioning his comprehension of a proposed deal. 
 Mr. Miller wanted speedy court approval of a sale of Lehman's domestic capital markets business to Barclays, the British bank. Mr. Bienenstock was worried that the sale of the subsidiary could block creditors from recovering money the Lehman unit owed them.
 ''I'm a little bit shocked, having practiced with Mr. Bienenstock for years, that he doesn't understand an agreement,'' Mr. Miller said at a hearing in September.
 The presiding judge, James M. Peck, headed off any possible bickering, observing, ''Oh, he understands.'' (Mr. Bienenstock says he did not respond to Mr. Miller's comment in light of the judge's words.)
 Mr. Miller, who is so busy that he limited an interview to a 15-minute phone call, describes himself as a zealous advocate, because, he says, that is exactly what his clients want and expect when they hire him. Mr. Miller's work costs nearly $1,000 an hour, according to a court filing in another case. 
 ''When I represent a client, I represent the client, and I do the best for the client,'' no matter who represents the other side, Mr. Miller says. ''And I am not into back-scratching.''
 RIVALS of Mr. Miller ask if so many companies turn to Weil's bankruptcy practice because of him or because of ties to other partners at the firm who schmooze and network more readily. For example, Mr. Millstein's ties to G.M., and in the past to other companies, have been of enormous help to Weil's practice.
 Still, Mr. Miller is probably the best-known bankruptcy lawyer in the country. At an annual conference on distressed investing, his name is on an award given to a professional in the restructuring business.
 No corporate meltdown has posed the combination of challenges that the Lehman case does, not just because the company is so large but also because it operates within an intricate financial web in which spooked investors can move money nearly instantaneously. 
 Lawyers say the case most like Lehman's is that of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment bank that filed for Chapter 11 protection in 1990 after a client, Ivan F. Boesky, paid $100 million to settle charges of insider trading and agreed to testify against the firm and its junk-bond impresario, Michael Milken. Mr. Milken later went to prison for violating federal securities laws.
 Regulators accused Drexel of, among other things, insider trading and manipulation of stock prices. Lehman has not been charged with any crimes, but it and some of its employees face investigations of events before the collapse. Drexel, like Lehman, was liquidated, and Drexel also turned to Mr. Miller to help sell its pieces for as much money as could be gotten to satisfy creditors. 
 Lehman's fall was tied to derivatives and complex mortgage securities. Blame for Drexel's collapse was assigned to a newfangled financial tool of the earlier era, the junk bond. Those high-yield, high-risk instruments helped feed mega-takeovers of the '80s.
 But figuring the worth of Drexel's assets didn't present the problem it does at Lehman, which holds billions in securities backed by home loans and other assets of uncertain worth. And Drexel's collapse wasn't seen as a potential harbinger of financial apocalypse.
 In any event, every bankruptcy case is different. The federal bankruptcy code doesn't come close to covering every twist and turn that arises when companies fail. The best lawyers think creatively in these situations and bring specialized areas of expertise to bear on myriad vagaries of a corporate collapse.
 The Weil team working on Lehman's bankruptcy includes lawyers who are experts in tax, real estate, litigation and mergers and acquisitions, said Lori R. Fife, a partner at the firm.
 ''I've worked pretty much past midnight, every night, and every Saturday and Sunday since Sept. 15,'' when Lehman filed for bankruptcy, Ms. Fife said, adding that she had not worked as hard in previous cases, including the huge bankruptcy of WorldCom. 
 ''We have so many transactions going on at the same time, litigations going on,'' Ms. Fife says. ''It's overwhelming. I don't get a lot of sleep.''
 Neither, these days, does Mr. Mil- ler.

HEADLINE: Wait. Why Is the F.T.C. After Whole Foods?

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
IT'S becoming clear that the Federal Trade Commission and Whole Foods Market need to take their continuing legal spat out of the courtroom and into the grocery store.
 That's right. Pack up the legal briefs. Grab a cab. There's a Safeway on L Street about a mile north of the F.T.C. headquarters in Washington.
 A field trip is in order because the reasoning behind the F.T.C.'s efforts to stop a merger between Whole Foods Market and a smaller competitor, Wild Oats Market, has been undercut by marketplace realities. 
 Since the F.T.C. first challenged the merger in June 2007, Whole Foods has increasingly lost its hold on the organic and natural foods marketplace. Larger competitors like Safeway and Kroger have vastly expanded their store-brand offerings of natural and organic products, and they are often cheaper than those at Whole Foods.
 The situation has only accelerated as the economy has soured. Whole Foods has mounted an aggressive campaign to convince consumers that it isn't so expensive. The store now offers more discounts and store-brand products, which are cheaper.
 Wall Street, at least, isn't convinced. Whole Foods' stock is down more than 70 percent this year.
 So why continue with the litigation?
 Several antitrust lawyers said the fight had become more about personalities than legal reasoning.
 Andrew G. Berg, who specializes in antitrust matters for Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, said the F.T.C. took on Whole Foods after a string of defeats, thinking that it would be an easy victory. Now, he says, the agency is ''backed into a corner.''
 ''I've predicted for a long time that this is a case that the F.T.C. should forget about,'' Mr. Berg said.
 Ronald F. Wick, an antitrust lawyer at Baker Hostetler, said lawyers could become so hellbent on winning that they ''don't tend to be terribly flexible in recognizing economic realities.''
 David P. Wales, acting director of the F.T.C.'s bureau of competition, denied that personalities were driving the case.
 ''The goal is not to drive Whole Foods out of business,'' he said. ''It's not a personal vendetta. Our job is to protect competition and that is what we are doing here.'' 
 Mr. Wales said the agency wasn't contending that Whole Foods and Wild Oats did not have any other competition. Instead, he argues, there is a special level of competition between the two that matters to consumers.
 He said the F.T.C. would present evidence showing that Whole Foods still maintains a unique spot in the premium marketplace for organic and natural products; he declined to elaborate.
 It's important to remember that, at least initially, the F.T.C. had some pretty compelling reasons to bring a case against Whole Foods. And John P. Mackey, co-founder and chief executive of Whole Foods, has very publicly thumbed his nose at the F.T.C.
 Whole Foods, based in Austin, Tex., announced in February 2007 that it was acquiring Wild Oats, in part so the two could compete against the likes of Wal-Mart Stores and Safeway.
 But the F.T.C. didn't buy that argument, and it maintained that the merger would hurt competition and increase prices in markets where the two stores were rivals. As part of its evidence, the agency produced some internal documents and e-mail postings by Whole Foods executives.
 For instance, Whole Foods documents referred to Wild Oats stores as a ''cash cow'' and a ''monopoly'' in markets where Whole Foods didn't exist. The documents also said Whole Foods was waging ''war'' on prices in markets where the two competed.
 And then there were blog postings by Mr. Mackey himself. Using a pseudonym discovered by the F.T.C., Mr. Mackey wrote in March 2006: ''The end game is now under way for OATS. Whole Foods is systematically destroying their viability as a business market by market, city by city.''
 That may have been true in 2006. Today, it's Whole Foods' health that is in question. 
 The case has taken several jarring turns. Whole Foods won an initial round in court, when a federal judge ruled in August 2007 that the market for natural and organic foods was much broader than Whole Foods and Wild Oats. 
 But a year later, with the merger almost complete, an appellate court ruled that the initial decision had been rushed and needed to be reconsidered. Shortly thereafter, the F.T.C. decided to proceed with its own internal hearing on the merits of the merger.
 Last week, Whole Foods sued the F.T.C., asserting that the agency's administrative hearing would violate the company's due-process rights. The lawsuit's opening lines quote the Queen of Hearts scene in ''Alice in Wonderland'':
 ''Now for the evidence,'' said the King, ''and then the sentence.''
 ''No!'' said the Queen. ''First the sentence and then the evidence.''
 The additional lawsuit means that there are three separate cases wending their way through the system for a case that no longer makes much sense.
 Whole Foods officials say they have spent at least $16.5 million defending the merger. The F.T.C. declined to say how much it had spent so far. 
 Both sides would be wise to take that trip to the Safeway. Whole Foods might learn a thing or two about how to compete against a larger, more efficient rival. And the F.T.C.'s lawyers might see that even if they lost the battle with Whole Foods, they were winning the larger war to keep prices down.

HEADLINE: Chief Leads Fight to Keep Selling Those Camels and Kools

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

DATELINE: MASTIC, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Down by the lapping waters of Great South Bay, the Indian chief stared up at the trees swaying in the wind. Then he squinted: Was that a surveillance camera on top of that utility pole?
 Probably not, but Harry Wallace, chief of the Unkechaug Nation, says he has good reason to be watching his back -- and his tribe's -- closely. 
 He and several other owners of shops that sell cigarettes on the tiny Poospatuck reservation on the South Shore of Long Island, where the Unkechaugs are based, have been sued by the City of New York. The city claims that this Indian enclave -- the closest reservation to New York City -- has become a ''tax evasion haven'' and a drain on the city's coffers.
 The Bloomberg administration says the city and the state lose more than $1 billion a year in tax revenue because of what it calls bootleg cigarettes distributed on Indian reservations in New York. Of that amount, the administration contends, $195 million represents the city's share, and officials blame the Unkechaug Nation reservation for most of that. 
 New York City officials say millions of cartons of untaxed cigarettes are sold every year by Poospatuck retailers to bootleggers who smuggle them into the city to resell for about $5 a pack, not the $8 or $9 charged by New York retailers who pay the state and city taxes of $4.25 a pack.
 As part of their legal challenge, city lawyers have asked a federal judge to block the smoke shops from selling untaxed cigarettes to non-Indians without collecting state and city taxes from them.
 Answering these claims is the Unkechaug chief, Mr. Wallace, 55, who was born in Queens, went to Dartmouth and was a lawyer in private practice in Manhattan before moving to the reservation and opening the Poospatuck smoke shop.
 But he has been outspoken in defending his tribe, arguing that cigarette sales are the only viable economic engine on the 55 acres of sovereign territory. He calls the city's suit an attack on legitimate Indian livelihood, and the result of elected officials feeling the economic pinch and blaming budget woes on the smallest reservation in the state.
 ''They're picking on us because they think we're this little tribe with no means to defend ourselves,'' he said. ''Bloomberg needs a scapegoat, so he blames us for the city's deficit, instead of criticizing the financial markets.''
 Lawyers for the smoke shop owners have requested a dismissal of the suit, arguing that the court does not have jurisdiction in sovereign territory, Mr. Wallace said. He is not a defendant in the suit, though he was named in a similar suit that was filed in 2006 by the owner of the Gristedes supermarket chain.
 Though Mr. Wallace grew up in the Bayside and Little Neck sections of Queens, his family nurtured his Indian identity, taking him often to visit his uncles on the reservation. He chose Dartmouth, he said, because it had as its founding mission the education of Indians, and he helped establish a group on campus called Native Americans at Dartmouth. 
 Later, at New York Law School in Manhattan, he helped found the Indian Law Committee and wrote a thesis on Indian land claims. In the 1980s, he worked as a lawyer concentrating on cases involving landlord-tenant disputes, real estate, personal injury and American Indian discrimination issues.
 Mr. Wallace said he grew more interested in Indian issues after marrying Margo Thunderbird, a daughter of Chief Thunderbird of the Southampton-based Shinnecock Nation. The couple have two daughters. In 1991, he moved to a plot of land belonging to his mother on the Poospatuck reservation, nestled on the banks of the Mastic River. ''It changed my life because I knew I was going to get into issues affecting the reservation,'' he said.
 Mr. Wallace opened the reservation's first full-service smoke shop, to ''show the community that we could develop an economy separate and distinct from the state and that it could be done the right way.'' 
 Other reservation residents followed his lead and also opened shops, transforming cigarette sales into a booming business as state and local taxes have driven up the cost to smokers. Of the 450 Poospatuck tribe members, 275 live on the reservation, a network of narrow streets with small houses, tidy modular homes and ramshackle trailers. 
 On a recent weekday, the reservation looked like a bustling cigarette shopping outlet. Signs for smoke shops were posted everywhere, and discounted cartons were sold from drive-through windows. An employee held a huge sign and directed a line of traffic to parking spots.
 According to state law, nontribe members who buy cigarettes on reservations are supposed to report and pay the taxes on those purchases. Legislators have been trying for years to force tribal smoke shops to collect taxes on sales to non-Indians, but the tribes have refused, citing their status as sovereign nations. 
 The State Department of Taxation and Finance says the Poospatuck cigarette trade grew to 11.3 million cartons in 2007, from 406,000 cartons in 1996. 
 Mr. Wallace calls the estimates by the city and state drastically inflated.
 Mr. Wallace, who said the number of smoke shops on the reservation has increased to 14 from 6 in the past couple of years, said he could not provide specific sales and revenue figures for the shops because he does not monitor each store's accounting.
 Mr. Wallace said his own sales of untaxed cigarettes had declined in recent years, but would not provide specific numbers.
 Eric Proshansky, the city's lead lawyer on the lawsuit, said the city's estimates were ''absolutely solid.'' 
 Mr. Wallace said he and the tribal council are working to establish ground rules to curb abuses, such as barring phone or Internet cigarette sales and prohibiting residents of the reservation from selling cigarettes unless they have a store. He has also proposed setting sales limits and monitoring sales volume by working with the cigarette wholesalers that sell to the reservation. 
 But in the end, he says, tribal leaders lack strong enforcement powers over the smoke shops, partly because they do not have their own police department.
 While he has called the Suffolk County Police to help with lawbreakers on the reservation in the past, he said he is reluctant to do so now because of heightened tensions between the tribe and the county. ''We can't ask them help us enforce our council decisions, because now all they care about is tobacco and taxation -- they just want to come in and shut everything down,'' he said.
 As he spoke, Mr. Wallace moved aside a candle he lights to mask the smell of cigarettes. Though he himself is a smoker perpetually trying to quit, he explained that cigarettes are helping to breathe economic life back into his tribe. The tribal leaders require cigarette retailers to pay into a fund that goes to improve housing for tribal members and to provide money for college.
 Mr. Wallace calls the challenges to cigarette sales the latest in the historical shortchanging of his tribe and its attempts at economic self-sufficiency. Though hundreds of acres of land has been taken from the Unkechaug Nation, he said, it has managed to retain a foothold because of longstanding political and cultural ties and strong trading and intertribal relationships. 
 As other commercial enterprises have fallen away, about the only things tribe members have left are their sovereignty and the right to conduct tax-free business, he said. ''For Bloomberg, this is about his budget deficit, but for us, this is survival,'' he said. ''This is sovereign territory, and they are not going to collect a nickel without our consent.''

HEADLINE: THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Wage Gap Divides Men Too

BYLINE: By AARON RETICA

 BODY:
Economists have been trying for decades to understand the considerable gap in wages between men and women, but they have not paid enough attention to our psychological attitudes toward breadwinning, according to Timothy Judge and Beth Livingston, organizational psychologists at the Warrington College of Business Administration at the University of Florida. What if the real difference isn't between men and women but between men who think women belong at home -- and everyone else? 
On average, according to ''Is the Gap More Than Gender?'' which was published in September in The Journal of Applied Psychology, men who say they believe in a traditional role for women earned a stunning $8,549 more per year than men who profess egalitarian values. Egalitarian-minded women earned $1,330 less than their male counterparts, and traditional women earned another $1,495 less.
Judge and Livingston's study is based on data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics from thousands of people as they matured between 1979 and 2004. Periodically, investigators asked questions like whether ''employment of wives leads to more juvenile delinquency.'' Judge and Livingston used the answers to assess where people fell on the traditional-to-egalitarian continuum. After the researchers controlled for hours worked, education, occupational segregation and an array of other factors, the effect of what they call ''gender-role orientation'' was stark. And it held up even for those who change their own orientations. ''If you are a man and you become more egalitarian, it has a really detrimental effect on your earnings,'' Judge explains.
Judge and Livingston have several theories about why the effect is as strong as it is. Perhaps egalitarian men don't negotiate salary as strongly as traditional men because they see doing so as ''thuggish, alpha-male'' behavior -- or perhaps employers unconsciously discriminate against ''egalitarian men who don't conform to stereotypes.'' Livingston's biggest concern about the study is that a few people have interpreted it to suggest that you should raise your boys to be chauvinists. ''One radio host asked me whether he should go into the next room and call his boss a bitch,'' Livingston told me, ''which I would not advocate.''

HEADLINE: Downtowns vs. Outlet Malls

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 I was appalled to see the enormous article and consumer guide on Nov. 30 highlighting, applauding and endorsing the discount shopping malls! We are in the worst economic situation of the century, which stretches from the cities to main streets in every community. I have been in business in Darien for 31 years and have never seen a time like this. I am a ''Mom and Pop'' store that has weathered many storms. However, with 10,000 customers on my mailing list, I have virtually no one coming into shop. 
 This article will impact my business and many others in a negative way at a time when it is devastating to lose a few customers. Instead of writing about discount outlet malls, tell your readers about the importance of supporting their local merchants who know them by name and who provide customer service not to be found in large department stores or discount outlets. Perhaps the best value is saving gas and time by staying in your hometown and getting to know your neighbors and friends, who own local businesses. They support your local fund-raisers, appear on town boards and donate endless volunteer hours and money to enhance the local community.
 If our customers abandon us to save a few dollars, what they will lose when this economic blip is over will be much greater. Will the discount outlets open up on Main Street? No. Will they run an ad in your kid's football program or let the Girl Scouts sell cookies on a Saturday morning outside their storefront? No. Will they come to a Chamber of Commerce meeting to talk about making the town beautiful with holiday lights or flower baskets in spring? No. 
 They don't want to know their customers by name. They only want to get their e-mail addresses so they can market to them some more. There are thousands of stores and restaurants that give these small towns their character and give the homes their value. These peaceful suburban enclaves would not be the same without them.

HEADLINE: THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Quinn Solution, The

BYLINE: By STEPHEN MIHM

 BODY:
Who's to blame for the current world financial crisis? Among the more plausible culprits are Wall Street's wizards of ''securitization,'' who packaged mortgages and other loans into ever more esoteric financial instruments. But what securitization has caused, it can also cure -- or so says Stephen Quinn, an economist at Texas Christian University. 
 The collateralized debt obligations and other securities at the heart of the current mess are worth a certain amount on paper, but their real ''fair market'' value is almost certainly much lower in the wake of the subprime crisis. How much lower is anyone's guess, but it's impossible to find out with any precision: these securities aren't traded on the open market. In fact, no one even knows which institutions own these things, because they're buried in the balance sheets of firms around the world.
 Quinn wants these toxic securities to come home -- literally. He proposes that the United States set up a government-sponsored corporation like Fannie Mae that would accept any and all securities backed by mortgages and real estate in the United States. Anyone unloading securities into the pool would in return receive shares of stock in the new corporation -- shares that would have the same face value as the inflated book value of the securities. Stockholders would then be entitled to their share of the revenue from the mortgages in the pool, paid out in quarterly dividends. Once the mortgage-backed securities have been replaced with a single, homogeneous security (shares of stock in the new corporation), those shares could be bought and sold. The precise contents of the pool would be published, so that investors and speculators could judge for themselves the likely worth of the shares.
 It's an idea that Quinn has borrowed from the British government, which successfully pulled off a similar ''debt-for-equity swap'' in the late 1600s, consolidating government debt under the auspices of the Bank of England, which handed out shares of conventional bank stock in return. ''The Brits figured out that if you pour all this stuff that's goofy and heterogeneous into a gigantic pool and give everyone identical shares on the pool, you're creating a lot of readily priced, easily traded securities,'' Quinn says. And that, he asserts, ''is what securities are supposed to be.''

HEADLINE: Legislators Approve Budget Without Raises

BYLINE: By NICOLE NEROULIAS

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
 AFTER weeks of mounting public outcry about a 2009 budget proposal that would have included raises for some county employees, Westchester legislators approved a slightly smaller budget without the raises late Monday night.
 The $1.8 billion budget, about $1.5 million less than the proposal submitted by County Executive Andrew J. Spano on Nov. 14, will increase the county portion of property taxes -- about one-sixth of an average resident's bill -- by 1.8 percent, rather than 3 percent as Mr. Spano had proposed.
 ''I fear the economy will get worse before it gets better,'' Mr. Spano said in a statement released before the Monday vote, withdrawing his proposed pay raises for commissioners and managers. The proposed retroactive 3.25 percent raises for commissioners and department heads amounted to about $780,000 more in pay and $110,000 in retirement benefits, totaling about $890,000. 
 ''They have done an outstanding job and if times were better, they would be getting the increase they deserve,'' Mr. Spano said. ''But we all have to tighten our belts in times like this -- and sometimes that hurts.''
 The conciliatory gesture came as too little, too late for some of Mr. Spano's vocal critics, especially members of Rethinking Westchester Government, a new group that wants to eliminate New York's county governments, as have Connecticut and Massachusetts. Connecticut got rid of all its county governments in 1960 and Massachusetts abolished most of its in the late 1990s.
 One of the group's founders, Paul J. Feiner, a former county legislator and now the Greenburgh town supervisor, said services could be provided more efficiently at the state and local levels.
 ''Westchester County is becoming very unaffordable,'' he said. ''It's driving people out of the county, and people can't even sell their homes these days.''
 Mr. Feiner's remarks during the public hearings process offended some legislators, including Kenneth W. Jenkins of Yonkers, who noted that Greenburgh's proposed 2009 budget, scheduled for a vote this week, would result in a 7.7 percent tax increase for residents of unincorporated areas of the town and nearly 10 percent for residents of its villages.
 ''Get your house in order first before you step out and speak to anybody else,'' Mr. Jenkins said, before casting his vote in favor of the county budget, which passed, 13 to 4.
 IN a response Tuesday morning, Mr. Feiner said municipalities have far fewer options for painless cuts than at the county level.
 ''People don't want to see the town pool closed in the summer,'' he said. ''People feel we shouldn't be cutting police when the economy is bad. If you cut $400,000 from the town, you're cutting major programs. If you cut $400,000 from the county executive's bodyguards, the only ones feeling it are the bodyguards and the county executive.''
 Mr. Spano's proposal was $101,000 below this year's budget, but the county executive had argued that a tax increase was unavoidable because of the anticipated $26.3 million shortfall in mortgage taxes, state aid and interest income and a $20.5 million jump in fuel, utility and Medicaid costs. More than 70 percent of the budget consists of mandated expenses, he added.
 But citing the economic downturn, with area residents hit hard by job losses on Wall Street and by the housing market crisis, the League of Women Voters and the Westchester County Association, a business advocacy group, had also called on the board to flatten or reduce taxes.
 ''Any increase is unacceptable at this point in time, when you see the number of people losing their jobs,'' said William M. Mooney Jr., the association's president.
 The board's four Republicans agreed, voting against the budget, which they say could have made additional cuts to legislator stipends, the county's mounted police force and Mr. Spano's security detail, among other programs. Mr. Spano's security detail was cut by 15 percent, which was in his initial proposal.
 ''Given the economic times, given the uncertainties, we could not support any tax increase this year,'' said Legislator George Oros, the board's minority leader.
 Mary Beth Gose, president of the League of Women Voters of Westchester, said her group was disappointed by the tax increase, but ''somewhat relieved'' by the changes to Mr. Spano's initial proposal. Next year, she said, the county executive should prepare his budget earlier so the public has at least a month to study it and make suggestions.
 ''It's a complex budget, and it's important for people to understand what's under consideration and what the county government does,'' she said.
 Democrats and Republicans on the board agreed that next year, they would solicit more input on ways to consolidate services and explore private-public partnerships, striving to save taxpayers money without seriously hurting their standard of living.
 Eliminating 52 vacant county positions this year was an acceptable sacrifice, but layoffs and other draconian measures should only be a last resort if the recession continues, said Legislator Jose I. Alvarado, chairman of the board's budget committee.
 ''We are not firing anybody, everyone is staying put and hopefully hanging around with us as things get better,'' said Mr. Alvarado, a self-described optimist. ''I think things will turn around. Everything is cyclical.''
 Last week, the legislators added $5.3 million to Mr. Spano's proposed budget, primarily for community services for the county's neediest residents. 
 In addition to reinstating financing for public day care centers and mental health programs, the amount also included about $500,000 each for the Legal Aid Society, which provides lawyers for residents who cannot afford them, and the Westchester Arts Council, whose programs provide educational and tourism benefits for the county.
 The legislators were able to add the money while lowering the tax levy because they also increased anticipated revenue by $5.8 million, after consulting with the board's auditors about projected income from taxes and county agencies.

HEADLINE: Before The Fear, There Was Foolishness

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LET'S be clear. We are not in a depression, and we are not even remotely close to the pain and misery of the Great Depression.
 At the worst of that era, unemployment was near 25 percent -- and there was usually only one breadwinner per family. The jobless rate is now 6.7 percent, still far below even the levels of the recession of the early 1980s. The airports are still mobbed, and the airplanes, though smaller and fewer in frequency, are almost full. High-end restaurants, like my favorite, Mr. Chow in Beverly Hills, are still almost impossible to get into. And for consumers, inflation hasn't disappeared: groceries are unspeakably expensive.
 Still, life is different now. Ever since the nutty experiment of letting Lehman Brothers fail, there is a new feeling in the land -- fear -- on a scale that I have never experienced. Chilling, right-to-the-bone fear. Fear that there is no bottom to our problems, that we got into this mess in some mysterious way we don't understand, and that no one knows how to get out of it. 
 I see this fear in many ways: Rich friends who were investors in private equity are now watching the whole wealth machine go rapidly into reverse, eating up their savings. A friend in real estate in California has written to me that ''the recession has destroyed our wealth,'' adding: ''We are essentially bankrupt.''
 I see even more grim signs. The house across from ours in Beverly Hills was sold two years ago and leveled to build a house twice as big; the lot sits empty and is again for sale. 
 The smartest young person I know, a top student at a major, prestigious law school, cannot get a job. Two years ago, he would have had 20 job offers. I know that I am talking here about a thin slice near the top. I am talking about what I see. I know that conditions are far, far worse for many workers around Detroit.
 When will it end? Business is a lot like sex. Both are better when the participants are confident. But in business, confidence has been shattered by ''mark to market'' accounting principles that make healthy financial institutions look frail or dead, and by using derivatives to magnify foolish bets on risky subprime mortgages. The losses have been devastating for banks and other lenders.
 How did this happen? Simply put, the lenders lent with unimaginable foolishness and made incredibly risky bets. And the bets busted. 
 Now lenders are terrified that their loans will go bad. They are terrified that the government doesn't know what it's doing. They are terrified that, at any moment, an accounting vice president will show up to say, ''Hey, we didn't know it, but we had a piece of this bond and when we mark it to market, we have a billion-dollar loss.''
 So they don't lend. And people cannot buy cars and homes. My Cadillac dealer down here in the desert, near Palm Springs, is constrained by the credit crisis, as so many car dealers are. He cannot provide direct car financing. How can G.M. survive if its dealers cannot finance cars? And some companies cannot buy machines or even meet payroll. 
 There is a wonderful aphorism that if a fish could think, the last thing it would think about is water. It takes water for granted. Likewise, as Americans, we took credit for granted -- and now it's gone for so many people.
 There is only one place it can come from now: the federal government, which has to guarantee loans made by lenders, completely restock the banks' coffers, flood the society with liquidity and create so much of it that it will have to be lent out.
 Of course, this will have the makings of the next credit bubble. But that cannot be helped. Maybe Barack Obama can put some meaningful regulation in place when he becomes president. Maybe he can convince Congress to repeal the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and get the private bar back in oversight gear. Maybe we can have a more vigilant Fed.
 But without drastic government credit action right now, and a rescue of the auto companies, we could have major deflation, leading to a depression. I pray that this doesn't happen.
 This is not the time for timidity by government. We can leave to researchers the discussion of who is ideologically purest. For now, real people need real help. Depressions are miserable, grinding days of fear. The time to stop them from ever coming is now. Jan. 20 may be too late.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Where Are the New Jobs for Women?,'' by Linda Hirshman (Op-Ed, Dec. 9):
 The women who built our tanks, guns, ammunition and planes during World War II would argue that women are able and willing to swing a hammer, operate a crane or design a structurally sound bridge. 
 The need to make ends meet may eventually drive more women into construction and manufacturing, as the absence of male workers did in the 1940s. 
 I agree that a stimulus plan should include jobs in social work and teaching -- not because these fields are dominated by female employees, but because they are in dire need of financing and staffing. 
 We should be building up our intellectual and social infrastructure as well as the physical. Both are crumbling.
 Julie K. Holt Boston, Dec. 9, 2008
 The writer is a project manager for the Institute of Technology Assessment at Massachusetts General Hospital.
 To the Editor:
 Linda Hirshman made a very important point -- we cannot afford to leave women out of any job expansion or economic stimulus plan. 
 In this day and age, most households with children need the income from two jobs to make ends meet. Not only do we need more jobs, but we also need to increase the value, parity and pay for jobs traditionally held by women, increase the number of women in better-paying, nontraditional fields and make sure that careers of the future are open to all genders. 
 Occupational segregation of women is not biologically determined, and we need only to look at the more than 200,000 women serving in the military to see opportunities to change this construct. 
 Many of these military women are holding what would be considered nontraditional jobs, but when they leave the military their skills are often not recognized and used. 
 Much needs to be done to fix our economy, and women can and will play an important role. 
 We must be sure that any plan increases opportunities for everyone, including women, to support their families.
 Deborah L. Frett Washington, Dec. 10, 2008
 The writer is the chief executive of Business and Professional Women/USA and the Business and Professional Women's Foundation.
 To the Editor: 
 Linda Hirshman correctly states that there does not seem to be any job creation for women in President-elect Barack Obama's economic stimulus program. 
 However, Ms. Hirshman adds that ''fortunately, jobs for women can be created by concentrating on professions that build the most important infrastructure -- human capital.'' 
 These ''human capital'' jobs are some of the lowest paid jobs, and women hold the majority of them. 
 If it is true that men will be the recipients of all the new ''green'' jobs, then women will still be left behind on the salary scale. 
 Why are there no jobs created that pay women equally as well as men? Why must women always be the caregivers and caretakers of the ''human capital''? Not only are we given the lion's share of taking care of other people's children and those who are in need of social services, but then we leave these low-paying jobs at the end of the day to work in our own homes taking care of husbands, children and sometimes elderly parents. 
 I would love to be a teacher, but frankly, I can't afford to be. Pay those of us who do the lion's share of the caretaking, and give women the financial recognition they so deserve.
 Beatriz Golden-Hayes Atlanta, Dec. 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Linda Hirshman should be commended for pointing out that Barack Obama's economic stimulus plan so far covers jobs that have traditionally been held by men, including jobs in construction. 
 She rightly stresses that the plan should also provide for positions in critical fields such as education and social work -- positions traditionally held by women.
 I would hope, however, that a stimulus plan would attract more men to enter the vital social service fields, including teaching at the preschool and elementary levels. 
 It has been acknowledged for some time that young children have innumerable contacts with women, but hardly any with men in the important early development years. This is especially true within households headed by single women.
 To attract more men to these fields requires not only improved salaries and benefits but also an attitude change that welcomes what men can bring to the classroom and to the social work field.
 Gerald Bazer Toledo, Ohio, Dec. 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 While job development for women in the health and human services during the current recession is an important priority, we should not forget the thousands of women with the talent and the aptitude to work in the construction trades and make decent salaries for themselves and their families.
 Recruiting and training women for the trades should be a priority of the federal infrastructure initiative. 
 My daughter, a college graduate, is thriving as a fourth-year apprentice carpenter, building New York City's water filtration plant in the Bronx. 
 Programs to assist women of diverse backgrounds enter nontraditional employment should be an integral part of the federal economic recovery effort.
 George S. Getzel Bronx, Dec. 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Many, if not most, of the people I know who have been working diligently for clean energy solutions to global warming are women. 
 Some are volunteers, but many are employed by state government or nonprofit organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility, the Maine Council of Churches and the Sierra Club.
 We are thrilled by Barack Obama's commitment to address both global warming and dependence on foreign oil through home weatherization.
 I recently became a certified residential energy auditor.
 There were other women in my class. As a career, home energy auditing can have flexible ''mother's hours.'' 
 And who better than women to promote the benefits of homes that are green, healthy, comfortable and energy-efficient?
 Rosie the Insulator, anyone?

HEADLINE: The City's Boom Years Were Good for Transit, Too

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
As the city's economy soared and its population grew from 2003 through 2007, something unusual was happening on the streets and in the subway tunnels. 
 All those tens of thousands of new jobs and residents meant that more people were moving around the city, going to work, going shopping, visiting friends. And yet, according to a new city study, the volume of traffic on the streets and highways remained largely unchanged, in fact declining slightly. Instead, virtually the entire increase in New Yorkers' means of transportation during those robust years occurred in mass transit, with a surge in subway, bus and commuter rail riders. 
 ''What you see is that for the first time since at least World War II, all of the growth in travel in the city has been absorbed by non-auto modes, primarily by mass transit,'' said Bruce Schaller, New York's deputy transportation commissioner for planning and sustainability, who wrote the study, which is to be released on Monday.
 ''Now we've really turned a corner in the city in that all of the growth in travel over the last four years has been absorbed by mass transit and so, in terms of the city's sustainability goals, this is very encouraging to see.'' 
 The city's sprawling public transportation system was able to handle such a surge because of vast improvements in service in recent years, Mr. Schaller said, as well as the advent of the MetroCard, which made using the system more efficient. A steep drop in crime made people more willing to use the system, and the construction of housing in areas well served by subways also brought in many more riders.
 But now the system faces its worst financial crisis in more than two decades, with officials proposing raising fares and cutting service, measures which threaten to unravel the system's gains and hamper its ability to carry riders when the economy recovers.
 ''The increase in transit has paced the economy,'' said William M. Wheeler, the director of planning for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who was not involved in the study but reviewed some of the data at the request of The New York Times. ''They're going hand in hand. I think it's pretty compelling.''
 ''I guess now the question is what's in the future,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''The challenge is going to be, can you have an adequately funded transit system to be there for that economic growth.'' 
 The study is the first analysis to take an overall look at traffic and transit patterns in New York during the boom years from 2003 through 2007, when, according to the report, the city added more than 200,000 jobs and its population increased by more than 130,000. 
 Of course, the outlook today is very different, with the city shedding jobs and sliding into a deep recession as the transportation system grapples with its own financial free fall. The authority's next budget, facing a $1.2 billion deficit, is expected to be grim. 
 The authority is hoping for a bailout from Albany early next year along the lines of a rescue plan proposed by a special state commission. The plan would create a new payroll tax in an effort to halt the service cuts and limit the amount of the fare increase.
 ''We're in a recession at the moment, but when we come out of that I think we're well positioned to continue in the direction of sustainable growth, provided that the support is given to transit,'' Mr. Schaller said.
 The trend of stable traffic volumes and rising transit during the recent economic boom was in contrast to previous periods of growth, Mr. Schaller said. In the 1990s, as the economy expanded, both street traffic and transit ridership grew, though the increase in transit was greater. 
 In earlier decades, however, there was a general trend toward increased vehicle traffic while, for many years, transit ridership declined. 
 Mr. Schaller said that vehicle trips citywide peaked in 1999 and then leveled off, with a dip in 2001 as a result of the terror attack on the World Trade Center. The overall trend has been largely stable traffic volumes across the city from 1999 through 2007.
 In contrast, during the years when the economy was most buoyant, from 2003 to 2007, transit ridership soared, increasing about 9 percent during those years, according to the city study. 
 The difference is even greater when the focus is on the core commercial district of Manhattan, south of 60th Street. From 2003 to 2007, the study found, traffic entering that area fell by 3 percent. During the same period, transit ridership into the same zone rose 12 percent.
 However, the most marked change occurred in the level of travel in Manhattan that crossed 60th Street heading south. Traffic from this direction was down 8 percent, even as vehicle traffic from Brooklyn and New Jersey was largely unchanged. At the same time, transit and commuter rail ridership going south and crossing 60th Street increased. 
 ''It's the one place in the city that we see evidence of people getting out of their cars or taxis and getting into transit,'' Mr. Schaller said. ''Elsewhere what we see is the growth in travel being absorbed by the transit system, but 60th Street is the one place that we see traffic declining and transit increasing.''
 He said the area was particularly well suited to such a shift. ''You have very rich transit service and very heavy traffic congestion,'' he said.
 The flattening of overall traffic volumes, with an actual decline in Manhattan's main business district, raises questions about the need for congestion pricing, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's failed plan to charge drivers to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan.
 But Mr. Schaller, whose department was deeply involved in supporting congestion pricing, said that the data did not undermine the basic principles behind the plan, since traffic levels remain well above what they were a decade or two ago. 
 ''People can make a judgment as to whether it's acceptable that the traffic is as heavy as it is,'' he said. ''If it's stable, I think that's good news. It doesn't mean that it's stable at an acceptable level.'' 
 The study was produced in response to a city law passed in the summer requiring the Transportation Department to make an annual report on traffic and transportation trends. It is based on data that has long been collected by a variety of public agencies, including counts of vehicles made every fall at key points throughout the city. Those tallies tend to count individual vehicles multiple times as they move around the city, so they do not produce an accurate picture of the actual number of vehicles on city streets, but they do allow useful year-to-year comparisons of traffic volumes. 
 The Transportation Department now plans to expand its data collection to more areas of the city to give the agency a more detailed understanding of traffic trends. 
 It will also start analyzing data from taxis equipped with G.P.S., which will help the city to have a better understanding of vehicle speeds in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Her Body, My Baby

 BODY:
It was pretty much inevitable that Alex Kuczynski's article on surrogacy (Nov. 30) would inspire contempt and ridicule in the blogosphere. After all, she is beautiful, slim, wealthy and cheerfully unapologetic about it all; she does not try very hard to deflect envy. But grief is grief no matter how much money you have, and I can say with certainty -- having struggled with infertility myself, and having been criticized for being a privileged New Yorker who threw lots of money at the problem (and wrote about it) -- that Kuczynski's sadness and feelings of emptiness could not be washed away by her millions. Yes, ultimately money did help her solve her problem -- most of us, myself included, could not have afforded innumerable rounds of IVF and, when all else failed, gotten a womb for hire. And yes, she could have adopted, she could have been child-free, she could have done many things. 
 But Kuczynski had the audacity to write honestly about wanting to replicate her own DNA at any cost, and for that she was punished. At any rate, what was shocking, and inexcusable to me, was The Times's complicity in creating the Park Avenue Princess narrative: I mean, of all the photos taken, were the ones of the perfectly groomed Kuczynski next to the lovely but bovine surrogate really the most representative of the text? The surrogate couldn't have been dressed elegantly, too? Or, more damning, the photo of Kuczynski on her perfectly manicured Southampton lawn, holding her $150K baby, with the black nanny standing grimly in the background, ready to whisk that baby away at the first sign that he was mussing Mom's perfectly coiffed 'do?
 Kuczynski was naive enough to pose for those photos, it's true. But did they really tell the story of the text? I don't think they did. They did, however, relay the feelings of the people who edited the magazine.
 JUDITH NEWMAN New York
 I'm glad Alex Kuczynski has her baby, but I wonder if it occurred to either the writer or her editors that the story leaves The Times open to the charges of elitism leveled at it during the recent presidential campaign. She and her husband, ''a very successful investor,'' can afford three houses, including a ski home in Idaho and a summer house in Southampton, so paying $25,000 for another woman to carry their baby is not a problem. During her ''pregnancy,'' the writer boasts she raced down a mountain on skis at 60 miles an hour, Olympic-gold-medal speed, and did Bikram yoga twice a day right until the other woman gave birth to her baby. Fascinating details, but the article reads more like parody than serious journalism, especially the photograph of the author with her baby and dark-skinned servant on the lawn of her house in the Hamptons.
 FOX BUTTERFIELD Former Times Correspondent Hingham, Mass.
 If prostitution is unethical, immoral and illegal, why is it O.K. for one woman to pay for the use of another woman's body? If it's unethical, immoral and illegal to buy and sell body parts for transplantation, why is it O.K. to rent a uterus? Our morality seems so malleable in the hands of those who feel entitled.
 LISA WILSON Yarmouth, Me.
 Whatever the other issues involved, there is something profoundly wrong with our educational and economic systems when a middle-class, two-income family has a daughter selling her eggs and a mother selling her uterus to pay for college.
 SHIRA SAPERSTEIN Takoma Park, Md.
 I am filled with revulsion by Alex Kuczynski's cover story. I find it unconscionable that in an era with so many children who cannot find homes there are rich, white, educated couples who can pay $25,000 so that another woman, living in far less well-off circumstances, can go through the physical ordeal and emotional pain of having and giving up her baby. Yes, it is her baby, not Alex Kuczynski's. We are now so far from nature, morality and ethics that the violations of human bonds and trust are not even a consideration. Kuczynski wants a baby? Kuczynski must have a baby -- who will look like her husband, who will satisfy some crazed yearning for a genetic variant of herself. I have never liked the idea that a ''contract'' trumps nature.
 LYNDA SWANSON Daly City, Calif.
 I don't underestimate the pain of Alex Kuczynski's infertility nor the joy her new baby will bring. I'm just disappointed in The Times for missing the point. Kuczynski, a recovering cosmetic-surgery addict, represents what the rich have become: an elite fringe that is so far flung from the majority of society as to seem freakish. And Cathy, the surrogate mother, represents how the once-stalwart middle class has diminished: an educated person who is relegated to selling space in her body to help pay for her own child's education (surrogacy may feel like a gift, but it is a job). What could have been a discourse on class, feminism, bioethics, was instead a dull, self-indulgent, one-sided confessional from the one with the name and the income. There's a good story here, but the wrong person told it.
 HANNAH HENRY Napa, Calif.
 In words that echo Aristotle's view that a woman is a receptacle for the life force implanted by a man through intercourse, the author refers to Cathy Hilling as ''the woman who carried our child'' and explains, ''Strictly speaking, she was a vessel, the carrier, the biological baby sitter, for my baby.'' The title of the article, ''Her Body, My Baby,'' engages in the same obliterating action, with the author as the stand-in life-force impregnator, situated outside the nine-month process of creating a child but claiming responsibility for and complete ownership of the result. And Kuczynski perceives Cathy as participating in this reduction of her role when she likens herself to an Easy-Bake oven.
 That simplistic formulation of so-called gestational surrogacy (''organ rental,'' per Kuczynski) may have helped two strangers leap over chasms they couldn't have traversed otherwise. But it is a shortcut that relies on denigrating concepts, concepts that have historically led to inhumane treatment. As infertility and intervention increasingly muddy the meaning of the word ''mother,'' we must traverse that terrain and not take shortcuts.
 A woman's body and the growing being inside her participate in an astounding symphony for about 40 weeks to build from egg and sperm a human that can survive outside the woman's body. The woman's feelings, thoughts, meals and actions influence that symphony, helping create what the growing being experiences at every moment. Yet Kuczynski literally reduces Cathy's whole self to her uterus. This is a disturbing denigration of a beautiful, astoundingly complex phenomenon that builds life and that bonds most living beings and their offspring for life.
 JANET BENTON Wyncote, Pa.
 By publishing Alex Kuczynski's wildly self-absorbed account of her ''adventure'' with surrogate pregnancy, The New York Times does a disservice to couples who have wrestled with the heartache of infertility. Kuczynski would have better served her subject by writing the story about someone who was not fabulously wealthy and who perhaps had to make some compromise or sacrifice in pursuit of motherhood. Her obtuseness shows in her decision to be photographed for the story, holding her baby with her uniformed ''baby nurse'' nearby. Presumably the nurse will allow her to continue to raft on Level 10 rapids without the burden of the physicality of parenting. By printing this bizarre, atypical account, The Times shows no respect for those less entitled who have confronted infertility and the morally complex options available to fulfill the desire to love and nurture a child.
 RICHARD HOWARD Winchester, Mass.
 To conclude that Kuczynski is a 75 percent mother is both insulting to herself and to all parents who love and raise children in a nontraditional family. Grief for the loss of the ability to experience pregnancy and birth needs to be acknowledged and deserves recognition as part of her family's story. But to use such simple calculations, hmmm, do the math -- am I a 50 percent parent because my children are adopted? What is the grandparent who raises a grandchild -- a 25 percent parent? When my sons cried their eyes out at the recent death of their father (by adoption), I can assure you it was not half-heartfelt.

 From the photographs Gillian Laub took to illustrate the cover article by Kuczynski, you might easily conclude that the author is a rich young woman who can buy a baby the way other people buy a dress. This is partly right. To the author's credit, she does not stint on unflattering details while telling the complex story of how she came to meet and employ Cathy Hilling, who became her friend over the year in which they cooperated in the effort to bring a baby into the world.
 Kuczynski is a good writer. Laub is a good photographer. But who decided to combine their work this way? And what is Kuczynski's sin, exactly? Aside from affluence, talent, a good figure and luck?
 MARY PANZER New York
 As an adoptive parent, I expected to be sympathetic to this cover article. Instead I find I am appalled by it. Leaving aside the very real moral issues of surrogacy, which I view as similar to those involving organ donation, the selfishness exhibited by the author is amazing. Has it never occurred to her that her son may not want every parent, teacher and student in every school he ever attends to know his birth story? Does she think he will never read this? Is privacy something she doesn't feel her child is allowed?
 And what decision maker is responsible for showing the surrogate barefoot? This one picture belies all the careful respect the article seems to afford her choice. She is the hillbilly who needs to ''rent her womb'' -- the barefoot-and-pregnant stereotype. No matter what the words say, the picture speaks louder.
 I hope the money the author earned for this article was worth it. I think she and the woman who helped her have a son will regret this forever.
 JOANNE MCCARTHY Madison, N.J.
 I enjoyed the thoughtful account of Alex Kuczynski's experience of achieving motherhood with a surrogate.
 She was very honest as she charted the progress she made in reconciling some of the less-than-charitable preconceptions that she had about surrogacy. She clearly illustrated that the surrogate mother, Cathy, is intelligent and was frank about the financial incentive. Why then did you choose to contrast the women with photographs that are such an obvious cliche?
 CYNTHIA MARTIN Seattle
 It was 10 years ago this month when I stood in the elevator at Bloomingdale's with my 1-month-old son. The other women in the elevator commented on my ability to fit into my jeans with such a young baby. I smiled and replied, ''I didn't gain a lot of weight before he was born.'' The secret of my newly adopted son was safe. I didn't realize until now, in my mid-40s, the many benefits of being ''pregnantless.'' And we all know what Kuczynski stated, that it's not the nine months of pregnancy that make you a mother but everything after that.
 TRACY GLASER Cortlandt Manor, N.Y.
 My firstborn was conceived in the usual way and delivered after an uneventful pregnancy. Genetically perfect and robustly healthy, he was nevertheless born with a rare brain disorder, most likely the result of an as-yet-unidentified, symptomless virus that passed through my body undetected during the early weeks of his gestation. I wonder how often -- if at all -- privileged parents who acquire their children through the medically, financially and ethically extreme measures described by Alex Kuczynski consider the possibility that things may not go according to even the best-laid (and paid-for) plans. Who bears the blame, and the burden, when the hard-won trophy arrives in less-than-mint condition?
 JEAN BROOKMAN Branford, Conn.
 While I was fascinated by Alex Kuczynski's article about her journey to motherhood, I was bothered by one particular aspect of the article that she seemingly glosses over. Kuczynski mentions that Rebecca, the daughter of Cathy, her surrogate, ''had been an egg donor to help pay her college tuition.'' As a woman and recent Ivy League graduate who has been courted by couples and organizations advertising for egg donors in campus publications, I was both intrigued and horrified by this statement. Intrigued because, admittedly, my friends and I would occasionally half-joke that if our finances ever got so bad, we could always sell our eggs; horrified that many young women in this country have apparently had no choice but to turn to the invasive and emotionally complicated procedure of harvesting their eggs to pay for the exorbitant costs of higher education.
 While our nation can be proud of the technology that we developed to give children to the childless and recognize the profound fulfillment that children bring to families, we should also be ashamed by what students resort to in order to pay for something that should be a right for us all.

HEADLINE: Hollow Reserves

 BODY:
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have put enormous strains on all of the men and women of the United States military. The last seven years have been especially hard on those serving in the National Guard and other reserve forces, who too often have had to shortchange their families, finances and careers to accommodate lengthy, repeated and unexpected tours of active duty overseas. Many are tired and demoralized. 
 American communities that depend on the National Guard to provide the first line of domestic defense are also being shortchanged. The years of prolonged overseas deployments have stretched Guard units dangerously thin and left the Guard with barely 60 percent of the equipment it needs to carry out its basic missions. That raises serious doubts about the Guard's readiness to respond to either a natural disaster or a terrorist attack. 
 These problems arose because the Bush administration badly underestimated the number of ground troops needed to simultaneously wage war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has had to rely far too heavily on the National Guard and the Reserves to make up the differences. 
 More than 450,000 men and women serve in the Army and Air National Guard, and somewhat less than 400,000 in the Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force Reserves. Roughly half a million of these part-time soldiers have fought in Iraq or Afghanistan -- many for more than one tour. At one point in 2005, nearly half the United States front-line fighting forces in Iraq, and more than half in Afghanistan, came from the Guard and the Reserves. 
 Those percentages have come down since Robert Gates took charge of the Pentagon and began addressing the problem, in part by beginning a needed expansion -- long opposed by the Bush White House -- of the active-duty Army and Marine forces. But over 20 percent of American forces in Afghanistan and over 10 percent in Iraq still come from the Guard and the Reserves.
 Reserve units are meant to be sent overseas, although only for limited periods in national emergencies or as part of full-scale wartime mobilizations. Most reservists, like Guard members, have civilian jobs and family economic responsibilities. Their units are generally the last in line for getting new equipment and maintaining combat readiness. 
 Guard units sent overseas experience similar problems. And their overuse abroad creates a dangerous void in their home states. Governors throughout history have depended on locally available, properly equipped National Guard units to respond to natural disasters and other emergencies -- a mission that has become even more urgent since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Regular Army troops and military Reserve units are legally barred from domestic law enforcement duties. National Guard troops are not. 
 These prolonged deployments have dealt another blow to communities. In civilian life, many Guard and Reserve members serve as police officers, firefighters and emergency medics. When they are mobilized to help out the overstretched active-duty Army, they are not available to respond to emergencies at home. 
 Much of the Guard's best gear has followed these soldiers overseas and stayed there. Earlier this year, the Pentagon reported that just for the Army National Guard, equipment shortfalls amounted to nearly $50 billion. Among the equipment that must be restocked are helicopters, cargo trucks, chemical decontamination gear, night vision goggles, radios and satellite communications kits. These items are essential for dealing with domestic emergencies. 
 In response to Congressional pressure, the most recent defense budgets have included substantially increased spending for resupplying Guard units at home and abroad. But at present rates, the Guard will still be more than 20 percent short of its equipment needs when the current resupply program ends in 2013. 
 The men and women who join the Guard and the Reserves understand that they are not just signing up to be weekend warriors. But there can be no excuse for the way the Pentagon has overtaxed these units over the last seven years. And there is no letup in sight. 
 The 21st century has already shown that America's need for active-duty ground forces will be considerably greater than once expected, not just for war-fighting, but also for training foreign forces, peacekeeping and other missions. It has also shown that assuring the security of America's homeland has again become an essential requirement of overall defense planning.
 The National Guard is ideally designed to reinforce homeland security. The Reserves are meant to provide America with rapidly expandable armed forces in times of unexpected, and temporary, crisis. Neither can perform these essential functions properly the way they are being used today.
 Defense Secretary Gates set the right standard almost two years ago when he declared that ideally, reservists should not be mobilized for active duty more frequently than one year out of every six. 
 We urge President-elect Barack Obama to continue the expansion of active-duty forces. Relieving the stress on the Guard and the Reserves -- allowing them to fulfill their primary missions -- is one more reason why Mr. Obama must live up to his commitment for an early, orderly drawdown of troops in Iraq. The administration and Congress must also provide the National Guard with more money to accelerate its resupply efforts. 
 No one can predict the timing or the nature of the next domestic emergency. The country cannot afford to be caught unprepared.

HEADLINE: Week 52: What Sense Does It Make?

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
THE last week. The lost week. 
 Normally, the unfortunate people who are stuck at work during the molasses-slow week between Christmas and New Year get to know its spooky charms. Corridors and conference rooms lie empty, the telephone on the desk sits as quiet as a headstone. 
 But this year, a week that is usually just carefree and unproductive is likely to be positively dead. Companies in industries like high technology and manufacturing, pressed to the wall by the recession, are forcing workers to take the week off for accounting reasons as well as to reduce lighting and heating bills. Other people will also be taking the week off for the first time -- not to dash off to ski at Killington, Vt., but because they lost their jobs.
 In advertising as well as book and magazine publishing, many employees are customarily given the week off as a genteel perk of the trade, a seasonal variation on the ''summer hours'' that have them bolting from the office after lunch on Fridays to get a rush on traffic to the Hamptons. These days, however, free time also means more time to dwell on new economic anxieties. 
 ''A lot of people feel like they're walking on eggshells'' when it comes to job security, said Josh Rabinowitz, a senior vice president at Grey Worldwide, an ad agency. He plans to visit the Berkshires and Montreal with family during his Lost Week break, but will keep his Treo close at hand. ''A lot of my friends are just unsure, because we're dependent on a business model that is being challenged in this economy,'' he said. 
 For the second straight year, Ryan Rutledge, a media planner in the Chicago office of GSD&M Idea City, an ad agency, will be forced to take vacation days around the holidays. While his friends seem jealous that he will have nearly two weeks off, Mr. Rutledge does not sound like a man who is slipping into blissed-out vacation mode. ''We had a really hard year in 2007 and lost some clients, so we did a forced vacation last year, and it kind of stuck,'' he said. 
 Then, like other companies in its field, the agency started laying people off. ''Things are changing every day, and there is nothing you can do,'' Mr. Rutledge said. ''You have to go with the breeze.''
 Other people who have been fortunate enough to keep their jobs said they would once again enjoy, or at least endure, the distinctive rituals of this painfully slow week at the office: two-hour lunches, ambitious de-cluttering projects. This year, they said, with the economy spiraling downward, the traditional tedium may take on an ominous undertone. Does that silent telephone represent a brief reprieve from a harried schedule, or a reminder of deals evaporated, of clients and colleagues lost? 
 ''A lot of times, people would look forward'' to the quiet stretch between the holidays as a period of reflection and planning, said Larry Kubiak, director of psychological services at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare Behavioral Health Center in Tallahassee, Fla., which treats addictions and psychiatric problems. 
 This year, however, ''people are more in a survival mode,'' Dr. Kubiak said. ''With that dead week, you're sitting there by yourself at work and you have even more time to ruminate about bad things that can happen, which are constantly reinforced with everything you read in the newspaper.'' 
 Buck Sommerkamp, a multimedia developer for a company in Kansas City, Mo., that manufactures components for steel buildings, will be trying not to ruminate. He said that his employer will shut most operations from Dec. 19 to Jan. 5 to cut costs, and gave him the option of taking the days off unpaid or of using his 2009 vacation days (he chose the latter). 
 ''We've had a lot of bad news hit us in a short amount of time as a country,'' he said. ''But on the bright side, if want you want to jump in the car, gas is $1.30 a gallon, so if you want to road trip, it's 'See you later!' ''
 He plans to make the best of the time off, perhaps going sledding with his children. ''I can hang out in Starbucks a little more, work on some home improvement projects that have been languishing,'' he said. ''It's a fact of life, and everybody's got to do their part and see their companies succeed.''
 In Silicon Valley, where business is usually slow this time of year, the practice of dismissing workers for the last week on the calendar is becoming increasingly common, just as it was in the wake of the dot-com crash. Cisco Systems, which sells networking technology, recently announced it would shut down much of its operations from Dec. 29 to Jan. 2 as part of a $1 billion cost-cutting program. ''You don't have to be a rocket scientist to work out that the overall economic environment has its challenges,'' said Terry Alberstein, a spokesman for Cisco. ''I think that employees understand that.''
 Hewlett-Packard will effectively close for two weeks this year instead of its traditional one, by shuttering operations for the week of Christmas as well as the one after. 
 With other firms taking similar measures, such moves make trying to get anything done in Silicon Valley during the last week of December ''like trying to do business in August in Europe,'' Mr. Alberstein said. ''Everybody's out already.'' 
 Well, not everyone. For the still-working stiffs who lack the clout to secure a prized week of vacation, the time does not have to feel like a sentence. Some professionals have actually come to cherish the week as a perfect time to plot, plan, strategize and exhale.
 ''People idling at their desk, or playing computer games, or trying to Google lost lovers are all participating in an annual cleansing maneuver,'' Robert J. Perkins, president of Consensus Research Group, a market research and consulting firm in Manhattan, said in an e-mail message. ''My view is that the week is exactly like the flash gun from 'Men in Black,' '' he added. ''It is designed to make you forget about the last year so that you can start the new year, well, new.''
 THOSE who make up the skeleton crew tend to come together over their shared misery, said Andrew Palladino, a public relations consultant in Weston, Conn. ''There is an undercurrent of tension, but then you bond with the people you actually stay in the office with. People feel sorry for you. 'Oh, you have to work? So you're not going to Vail?' '' 
 ''It is sort of a subculture,'' he added.
 Just because the 52nd week tends to lack energy and purpose doesn't mean it hasn't acquired a certain mythology. Some stock investors consider it a charmed week. Hollywood has long regarded it as one of the most profitable stretches of the calendar. Amusement parks like Disney World are hopping. 
 ''I despise that week between Christmas and New Year's,'' said CC Skye, a fashion designer in Los Angeles, in an e-mail message. ''It is such a dead week here in L.A. that most of the city closes. It is as if someone turned the lights on after the party.'' 
 The torpor often triggers the while-the-cat's-away reflex.
 ''When my boss leaves, she doesn't give us any instructions,'' said Leanne Lee, 28, an administrative assistant in New York. Like Robinson Crusoe marking the days by carving notches into a wooden post, Ms. Lee measures time in the number of books read; last year, she made it through two Henry Miller novels.
 ''You just take the shoes off, kick the feet up on the desk,'' she said. ''It's almost like having extra vacation time.''
 Given the timing -- resolution season -- it is little wonder that productivity gurus have seized on the week as a potential highlight: at last, a chance to clean up! Dig through that mountain of paperwork! Open those unread e-mail messages from July!
 ''I always thought of this as the strategic planning week,'' said Julie Morgenstern, a personal organizational consultant in Manhattan. This year, she suggests people map out best-case and worst-case scenarios. ''Use this week to imagine: if I lose my job, what other companies can I study? If my industry goes down, what other industries can I transfer my skills to?'' she said.
 Sometimes, in keeping with Woody Allen's contention that 80 percent of life is showing up, people who report to work at the year's bitter end find opportunity knocking just because they happen to be there. 
 Ann Shoket, the editor in chief of Seventeen, said that sticking around at the Hearst building during the Lost Week two years ago -- while most of her colleagues were away -- may have helped her win her current job. She was working as the executive editor at CosmoGirl magazine, and Cathie Black, the president of Hearst Magazines, called her in about the top job. 
 ''Things might have turned out very differently,'' Ms. Shoket recalled, ''if I'd had to put off that meeting because I was lounging on the beach in St. Maarten.''

HEADLINE: A Case for Pills To Boost Your Brain

BYLINE: Compiled by THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
A Case for Pills To Boost Your Brain
 Brandon Keim writes on the Web site for Wired magazine about the case for legalizing drugs such as Adderall and Ritalin, which enhance cognitive functioning. 
 If drugs can safely give your brain a boost, why not take them? And if you don't want to, why stop others? In an era when attention-disorder drugs are regularly -- and illegally -- being used for off-label purposes by people seeking a better grade or year-end job review, these are timely ethical questions. The latest answer comes from Nature, where seven prominent ethicists and neuroscientists recently published a paper entitled, ''Towards a responsible use of cognitive-enhancing drugs by the healthy.'' In short: Legalize 'em. ''Mentally competent adults,'' they write, ''should be able to engage in cognitive enhancement using drugs.'' 
 Hey, That's My Treat
 Rebecca Carroll writes on the National Geographic Web site about jealousy among dogs.
 The first scientific study to find envy in non-primates affirms what many already know: dogs can get jealous. ''Everybody who has a dog at home probably [suspects] that dogs can be very jealous of other dogs and also of people,'' said lead author Friederike Range of the University of Vienna, Austria. In experiments with 43 dogs, Range's team showed that the canines reacted to inequity. The team had one dog watch another dog receive a reward for doing a trick. When the watching dog performed the same trick and was not rewarded, that dog refused to do the trick again, Range said. ... Scott Creel, a behavior ecologist at Montana State University, said the research suggests many social species may have mental processes scientists once believed were unique to humans, or at least primates. ''It seems logical that many of the same selection pressures that have shaped our cognition and emotions also operate in other social species,'' said Creel. 
 A Cool Idea
 Elizabeth Kolbert writes on the New Yorker Web site about a lesson on energy efficiency offered by Steven Chu, President-elect Barack Obama's choice for the nation's next energy secretary.
 In the mid-1970s, California -- the state Chu now lives in -- set about establishing the country's first refrigerator-efficiency standards. Refrigerator manufacturers, of course, fought them. The standards couldn't be met, they said, at anything like a price consumers could afford. California imposed the standards anyway, and then what happened, as Chu observed, is that ''the manufacturers had to assign the job to the engineers, instead of to the lobbyists.'' The following decade, standards were imposed for refrigerators nationwide. Since then, the size of the average American refrigerator has increased by more than 10 percent, while the price, in inflation-adjusted dollars, has been cut in half. Meanwhile, energy use has dropped by two-thirds.

HEADLINE: Long-Lived, but Not Immortal: Fears Fade on Hybrid Batteries

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
WHILE his day job as a flight instructor typically has him thousands of feet above the ground, George Finlay's everyday transportation is decidedly more down to earth: a 2002 Toyota Prius.
''I wanted to make a statement about reducing our dependence on dinosaur gunk,'' Mr. Finlay, 66, said.
That commitment led him to become an early adopter of hybrid vehicles. It also gave Mr. Finlay, of South Orange, N.J., the opportunity to face what many skeptics predicted would be the Achilles' heel of battery-electric cars: replacement of the high-voltage battery pack that powers the car at low speeds.
Hybrid critics have long said that the cost of a new battery, if it failed after the car's warranty expired, would quickly wipe out an owner's years of savings on gasoline. The argument was not unreasonable, given the high (and at first, uncertain) cost of the battery packs, which had yet to prove their durability in real-world driving. 
That situation has changed since hybrids went on sale in the United States a decade ago. Both Honda and Toyota, the market leaders, now have considerable hybrid experience. And both have recently reduced the prices of replacement nickel-metal-hydride battery packs -- a move made possible by maturing technology and growing sales volumes, they say. Even so, new replacement batteries still cost more than $2,000.
While owners and automakers say that hybrid batteries are proving generally reliable, the packs can reach a point where they will no longer hold a charge. For Mr. Finlay's Prius, trouble arrived at 80,000 miles with a glowing ''check engine'' light on the dashboard.
''My mechanic told me he had good and bad news,'' he said. ''The bad news was that I needed both a radiator and a replacement battery. The good news was that the battery pack was under warranty.'' The car was repaired by a Toyota dealer in two days and the battery cost Mr. Finlay nothing.
Toyota has sold more than 960,000 hybrid vehicles in the United States since introducing the Prius in 2000, including some 670,000 Priuses. A Toyota spokesman, John Hanson, said that the company has replaced approximately 350 battery packs on the second-generation Priuses, which were introduced as 2004 models. Nine out of 10, he said, were covered under warranty (10 years or 150,000 miles in some states, eight years or 100,000 miles in others) or insurance settlements from accidents.
Honda has sold more than 220,000 hybrid cars in the United States. Earlier this year, the company issued service bulletins regarding premature battery module failures and extensions of the battery warranty; Honda was concerned that in seven warm-weather states some 2000-4 Insight batteries were being overcharged and overheated during regenerative braking.
Honda would not disclose how many batteries it has replaced; a spokesman, Chris Naughton, said that ''replacement rates for parts are proprietary.''
Fuel economy and environmental concerns are not the only incentives that motivate hybrid buyers. Chad Melin, 36, a mortgage banker who lives in Chandler, Ariz., bought his 2002 Honda Insight in part so he could drive solo in freeway carpool lanes. Last year, the battery, still working properly, was replaced under warranty at 45,000 miles.
''It cost me nothing and I picked the car up the same day,'' Mr. Melin said. But he has since sold the car. Among his reasons: ''I wouldn't want to own a hybrid with a battery that wasn't under warranty.''
In some cases, drivers have been alerted to battery problems when a condition that Insight owners call a ''recal'' begins occurring more frequently. The recal -- actually a normal function of the car's electronics, according to Honda -- resets the hybrid electronics to more accurately account for the battery's charge level. When a recal occurs, no electric motor assist is available and the car is powered by its gas engine alone.
James Frye, a computer programmer from Pleasant Valley, Nev., said that recals started occurring in his car, which he had purchased with a salvage title, at 110,000 miles. He replaced the battery himself, installing a $250 pack he purchased used from an Internet parts supplier. He also bought a Manual Integrated Motor Assist kit sold by www.99mpg.com of North Grosvenordale, Conn.
The company's owner, Mike Dabrowski, said that the assist kit was designed to solve the recal problem by giving the owner greater control over the battery charging process. With the kit, ''I can charge as much as I want or discharge as much as I want,'' Mr. Dabrowski said.
Honda has reservations about Mr. Dabrowski's device. ''First and foremost, any modifications that change the assist or recharge characteristics of the powertrain could likely stress components, the battery for example, in a way that is well beyond their intended operating parameters,'' said Mr. Naughton of Honda.
Ford has sold more than 81,000 Escape and Mercury Mariner Hybrids since their introduction. According to a Ford spokeswoman, Jennifer Moore, the company has experienced no significant issues with batteries and has replaced only ''a very small number,'' under warranty. (Ford declined to give an exact number of battery replacements.)
General Motors has big plans for adding battery power to its cars, but at this point it is a newcomer to the hybrid market. A spokesman, Brian Corbett, concedes that G.M.'s hybrids have not been trouble-free: some 2007 Saturn Vue Green Line owners experienced a voltage drop, and the company began a voluntary recall to replace 9,000 battery packs in 2007 Saturn Vue and Aura hybrids. The recall ended last June.
If there are looming battery failures awaiting owners of current hybrids, it would be logical they might show up first in fleets that accumulate many miles each year. That has not been the experience of Shawn Bowden, general manager of Yellow Cab in Vancouver, British Columbia, who said his fleet had pioneered the use of commercial hybrid vehicles in North America. The company now has nearly 100 hybrids.
''The maintenance on a hybrid is incredibly nothing,'' Mr. Bowden said. ''They cost more to buy, but you get it back in three years with fuel savings and low maintenance.''
Yellow Cab's hybrids operate around the clock and accumulate very high mileage, more than 300,000 miles in many cases. Mr. Bowden estimated that only four or five hybrid battery packs had been replaced on cars in his fleet. The repair can be delayed several days, he said, because dealers do not keep the bulky packs in stock.
Mr. Bowden said Yellow Cab's first Prius, a very high-mileage 2001 model, was acquired from its driver-owner by Toyota and shipped back to Japan so the company could study wear on the battery pack and the car itself.
The price reductions in hybrid battery packs have been significant. In September the price of a battery for a second-generation Prius was reduced to $2,588, and the first-generation to $2,299, both from $2,985. In June, Honda cut the replacement battery price for the Insight (the original two-seat model was discontinued after the 2006 model year) to $2,000, the Civic Hybrid to $2,200 and the Accord Hybrid to $2,400, all from more than $3,000. All prices are for the battery pack only, not including installation.
The replacement cost for the Ford and Mercury hybrid battery is $6,000. A Ford spokesman, Said Deep, said that the company had ''taken out costs'' each year, and that by the time customers would have to pay for battery replacements they should be cheaper.
Though the warranties are long and battery pack replacement costs are coming down, some consumers are still concerned they're going to get stuck with a very expensive dead battery.
That issue affected the resale price of used hybrid cars at one time, a concern that largely evaporated with the most recent spike in gasoline prices. At one point, a three-year-old Honda Civic Hybrid retained 58 percent of its original price, compared with 60 percent for a nonhybrid Civic of the same year, according to John Blair, chief executive of Automotive Lease Guide, a company that sets resale values for the industry.
''But over the last six months, concern about fuel prices means that hybrids are retaining a greater share of their value,'' Mr. Blair said.
''I think you'll find three-year-old hybrids appreciating, not depreciating,'' he added. ''In the early days of selling hybrids, we as a company had concerns about battery replacement affecting future resale value. What we found was that it just never materialized as an issue.''
The greater unknown lies with the durability of the lithium-ion packs that will be used in many next-generation plug-in hybrids and battery-electric vehicles. Although it has long been used to power cellphones and laptop computers, lithium-ion is still a largely unproved technology at the scale necessary to power automobiles.

HEADLINE: Children May Have Been Good, and Yet ...

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

DATELINE: PHILLIPSBURG, N.J. 

 BODY:
 LOUIS NIKO, who has been playing Santa Claus at the Phillipsburg Mall for the past 12 years, still asks the children who bounce on his lap if they have been naughty or nice, but when it comes to taking their gift requests in these difficult economic times, the man dressed in snow-white whiskers and a bright red suit is no longer making promises. 
 ''With so many people struggling financially, I have had to change my conversation a bit when the children ask me for toys,'' said Mr. Niko, 80, a retired maintenance supervisor who lives in West Easton, Pa., just a short sleigh ride from the mall. 
 Mr. Niko's careful approach was on full display at his Santa station on a recent Friday at the mall. Christopher Hoffman, 5, and his brother, Connor, 2, had just rattled off a laundry list of goodies, including Lego blocks, a model space ship and an Elmo doll, when Mr. Niko replied: ''Well, boys, we'll look at our list of toys that we make at the North Pole, and if I find some of your toys on the list, I'll get them for you. Whatever I don't find, I'll try to get you next Christmas.'' 
 As he spoke to the boys, Mr. Niko, whose Santa-like whiskers are real, shot a quick look at their mother, Suzanne Hoffman, who was standing nearby and nodded in approval.
 ''It's better to make the kids know that they will not be receiving everything they ask for,'' said Mrs. Hoffman, a figure-skating instructor who lives in Whitehouse Station, N.J. ''My husband and I have been watching our Christmas budget more this year than in years before. We have come up with a budget, and we are sticking to it.''
 So have many other shoppers and retailers across the region, and Santas like Mr. Niko -- who noted that while he is seeing two to three hundred children a day, that is roughly two to three hundred fewer children a week than at this time last year -- are feeling the belt-tightening crunch. 
 ''I'd say my bookings are down from last Christmas season by about 40 percent,'' said Joe DeFelice, a 74-year-old Santa from Burlington Township, N.J., whose credentials including ho-ho-hoing at the Quaker Bridge Mall in Princeton and who now does his best St. Nick at private parties, recreation centers and even auto dealerships.
 ''This terrible economy is really hurting me,'' said Mr. DeFelice, who said he had made as much as $10,000 playing Santa in a single Christmas season. ''I only charge $100 an hour, and I know for certain that some of those Santas from New York charge $200 an hour. So if I'm doing poorly, how are they doing?''
 Not well, at least in the case of Mike Pope, a 48-year-old taxi driver and part-time actor from East Meadow on Long Island. Mr. Pope, whose acting credits include playing Santa Claus at malls, department stores and private parties, was let go by Hicks Nursery in Westbury, which could no longer afford to pay him for his services. 
 ''It's cheaper for them to use an employee who already works there,'' said Mr. Pope, who took his jolly-old act to the Kings Plaza Mall in Brooklyn. ''The economy has been bad for everyone -- even Santa Claus.''
 Ken Gresk, a 69-year-old retired schoolteacher who lives in Manchester, Conn., is one Santa who is thriving despite the tough economic climate.
 ''Business has never been better,'' said Mr. Gresk, who estimates that he sees 2,000 children each holiday season, primarily at private parties and special functions.
 Mr. Gresk said that an unusual business strategy has a lot to do with his recession-proof Santa. ''I let my clientele pay me for what they think my services are worth,'' he said. ''This pretty much allows me to play Santa without the issue of money getting in the way.'' 
 The man who plays Santa at the Westchester Mall in White Plains said that he had worked there for six years but had not seen a decline in the number of children visiting on a daily basis this year, nor had he been fielding requests for less-expensive items. On weekends, said Santa (just Santa; it is the policy of the Noerr Programs, which operates the mall's Santa Set, to have its Santas remain anonymous), he chats with 300 to 400 children a day.
 ''In good economic times or bad, children are still children, and they are going to ask Santa for their favorite toys,'' he said. ''I have been playing Santa for over 20 years, and during my career, I have never had a child ask me for anything less than what he or she really wanted.'' 
 Although Santa is doing well at the Westchester Mall, Bob Mindte, the owner of Santaforhire.com, a company based in Newport Beach, Calif., that dispatches Santas across the country, said that mall Santas had been most affected by the economic downturn. He said that fewer mall Santas would be used because the photography companies that use them must pay rent at the mall regardless of the number of customers they draw and must rely on enough Santa traffic to make a profit.
 ''Many of those companies are nervous about not being able to make up their initial investments,'' Mr. Mindte said. ''But outside of the malls, the Santa business, at least as far as I can see, is doing pretty well -- maybe not as well as in years past, but pretty well.''

HEADLINE: Unable to Sort Out Their Future

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Jersey City 

 BODY:
 TOM MULLAHEY'S small union office is in a cavernous building that holds what might be the largest single cluster of decent-paying blue-collar jobs left around these parts. As he sat there one recent day, he ticked off the list of opportunities that awaited him when he graduated from Dickinson High School up on Palisade Avenue 35 years ago.
 ''You could get a job in Colgate, in Clorox, in American Can, you could come here, you could go anywhere,'' Mr. Mullahey said, naming one solid paycheck after another, all at plants long since shuttered, except the one where he works: the giant pale-blue United States Postal Service plant in the industrial swamps on the back side of his home city. ''At that time you could quit here and get a job anywhere with comparable wages.'' 
 He and the 2,500 other workers here at the New Jersey International and Bulk Mail Center -- the largest of 21 such facilities across the country -- made the same bargain American workers have made for generations when signing on with the post office: no great riches, but bedrock stability with an employer that has never laid off a worker. But the mountains of parcels that once rose alongside the miles of conveyor belts each Christmas season here have eroded to foothills, and an uncharacteristic mood has taken hold. 
 ''Frenzied with worry'' was how Mr. Mullahey described the 950 workers he represents as branch president for Local 300 of the National Postal Mail Handlers Union. ''You have different rumors every day. It's like a roller coaster -- you're up, you're down, we're staying, we're going. It's to a fever pitch now.''
 To the ever-growing list of signs of a teetering economy, add this unexpected entry: Postal workers worried about jobs they always believed came with the nearest thing this country offered to a lifetime guarantee.
 ''In the past at this time of year, we would have had so much overtime,'' said Cindy Cilwik, 61, who empties sacks of mail arriving by truck at the start of their journey through the 1.5-million-square-foot plant. She joined the post office after her last employer, Macy's in Newark, closed in 1992. ''Now, some days we run out of mail.''
 The cause of worry is twofold: the national problem of declining mail volume (down 4.5 percent in the fiscal year that ended in October), the result of a shrinking economy, competition from private carriers and the growth of a virtual world that conducts more of its affairs on computer screens; and the local question of what will happen to the vast plant here known more familiarly as the Bulk, which handles an average of 600,000 pieces each day and once employed 4,000 people.
 In recent months, the workers here have grown more anxious, as news has circulated about a plan the postal service is considering to outsource to private contractors much of the parcel handling that is, as Mr. Mullahey said, ''the lifeblood of this facility.'' In the last two years, the plant lost two other big jobs: when the postal service stopped offering foreign surface mail shipments, which traveled by ship; and when the handling of the military mail headed to Iraq and Afghanistan was outsourced to a private contractor in Newark. 
 Earlier this fall, union leaders gathered with local politicians outside the plant for a rally urging the postal service to preserve the jobs here, most of which pay about $50,000 a year.
 ''There are no plans to outsource at this time,'' said Darleen Reid-DeMeo, a spokeswoman for the postal service in New Jersey. ''As a matter of fact, we will be adding four Flat Sequencing Sorting machines at this location in 2009.''
 The new sorting machines, Mr. Mullahey said, will occupy the space vacated by the military mail operation, with fewer jobs, the same fate he fears for the parcel operation if it, too, is replaced by the machines, as the plan the postal service issued this summer proposes. 
 ''Who thought the government was going to pull a Wall Street job and privatize?'' said Joe Costigan, 51, referring to the outsourcing of the military mail and a possibly similar fate for the parcels. He took what he thought was another lifetime job back when he graduated from Ferris High School: at the Colgate-Palmolive soap factory on the Jersey City waterfront that later made way for office towers. He joined the post office 22 years ago, and drives a forklift that loads boxes of sorted mail and parcels into trucks bound for seven cities. ''I figured like this: the government can't move to Mexico. But this is the first year since I've been here that we were off on Thanksgiving.''
 As the mail stream has thinned and more large companies have sent their parcels to the facility already sorted for delivery, the number of workers has declined, mostly through attrition and retirement, but also through some transfers to other postal jobs. Overtime has all but vanished. The post office has always given hiring preference to veterans -- Mr. Mullahey estimated that at least a third of the workers he represents have served in the military -- but there has been almost no hiring here since 2006.
 ''We have a bunch of veterans coming home now that should be having jobs here,'' said Flo Summergrad, 60, a shop steward for the American Postal Workers Union, which represents 680 clerks here. ''We are the people that are a stable work force in a community, and the less and less of us that there are, the less our communities are going to hold up.''
 The current labor contracts protect against layoffs, but if the jobs are outsourced here, some workers may have to transfer, or end up retiring earlier than they had planned, before the maximum pension that comes after 42 years of service. 
 ''There's no blue-collar jobs like this left in America,'' Mr. Mullahey said as he walked along the aisles that in earlier years -- more prosperous for the people sending gifts at Christmas as well as for the postal service handling them -- were choked by parcels.
 ''You can send your kids to college, you can buy a house, you can live the middle-class lifestyle -- what's left of it,'' he said as the conveyors clattered along, carrying less than they once did.

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
HARD TIMES: The grim headlines have given a boost to some economics-related titles, including Niall Ferguson's ''Ascent of Money'' (No. 10 on the hardcover nonfiction list); Michael Lewis's ''Panic!'' (No. 19 on the extended hardcover list); and Amity Shlaes's revisionist history of the Depression, ''The Forgotten Man'' (No. 13 on the paperback nonfiction list). Shlaes's ''blame the New Deal first'' argument has drawn fire in some corners of the blogosphere, with Paul Krugman blasting her ''misleading statistics'' and Crooked Timber dismissing her as an ''unscrupulous hack.'' Shlaes struck back in The Wall Street Journal, writing that if President-elect Barack Obama ''proposes F.D.R.-style recovery programs, then it is useful to establish whether those original programs actually brought recovery. The answer is, they didn't.'' 
 HARD TIMES II: The biggest publishing story of the Depression wasn't ''Gone With the Wind'' (the No. 1 fiction bestseller in 1936 and 1937) or ''The Grapes of Wrath'' (No. 1 in 1939). It was the ''fateful decision to make books returnable,'' Michael Korda writes in his chatty history ''Making the List.'' As the economy collapsed, publishers began allowing booksellers to return unsold merchandise -- a policy that stayed in place even after the economy revived. ''When I became an editor at Simon & Schuster,'' Korda writes, ''it was the custom to take young editors out to the warehouse in New Jersey and show them a vast, gloomy space full of books gathering dust, millions of them it seemed. These were all 'returns' . . . and were meant as a warning to us to always remember that when we made a mistake . . . there was a real consequence.'' If only there were a place budding bankers could gaze at heaps of mortgage securities gone sour. 
 HARD TIMES III: The bad economy of the 1930s may have been good for books like Hans Zinsser's ''Rats, Lice and History'' (No. 8 on the 1935 nonfiction list) and Edmund Jacboson's sleep manual, ''You Must Relax'' (No. 9 in 1934). But everything wasn't gloom, doom and sleepless nights. The Depression, Korda notes, also saw the runaway success of ''Boners,'' a megaselling 1931 collection of ''schoolboy howlers'' illustrated by Dr. Seuss (who got his first known review, from a critic who pronounced them ''simply swell''). We may have ''Boners'' to thank, or blame, for books like ''I Can Has Cheezburger?'' the LOLcats anthology that's been parked on the paperback miscellaneous list for eight weeks now. 
 HUCK AND CHUCK: Artie Lange's ''Too Fat to Fish'' is No. 5 in its third week on the hardcover nonfiction list, a notch below Mike Huckabee's ''Do the Right Thing.'' Quien es mas macho? While the proudly disheveled Howard Stern sidekick was dodging mortars on a beer-gut Bob Hope tour of Afghanistan, the clean-shaven G.O.P. presidential hopeful was going mano a mano with his campaign supporter and karate instructor Chuck Norris. ''Within 45 minutes,'' Huckabee writes of his first lesson, ''I was executing throw-down moves on my practice partner. I definitely felt the power.''

PERSON: Robert Chandler 

HEADLINE: Robert Chandler, 80, a Creator of the '60 Minutes' Format

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Robert Chandler, a former CBS executive who played a crucial role in creating the highly rated and critically acclaimed weekly newsmagazine ''60 Minutes,'' died Thursday at his home in Pittsfield, Mass. He was 80. 
 The cause was heart failure, his son Doug said.
 Mr. Chandler was a producer and director of documentaries and election coverage in 1966 when his colleague Don Hewitt proposed a new format: a newsmagazine with several segments rather than the standard hourlong documentary.
 ''In the formative years, he was our biggest fan at CBS,'' Mr. Hewitt, who was executive producer of ''60 Minutes'' for 36 years, said in an interview on Friday. ''Chandler pushed '60 Minutes' to replace 'CBS Reports' when Fred Friendly and Dick Salant were not enthusiastic about the idea of a weekly newsmagazine.'' 
 Mr. Friendly was president of CBS News from 1964 to 1966 and Mr. Salant led the division from 1966 to 1979. The first ''60 Minutes'' was broadcast on Sept. 24, 1968. 
 ''Bob played a very important part in setting up the format,'' Mr. Hewitt said, ''and now almost everybody in the world, certainly in Europe and Asia, has a weekly newsmagazine.'' 
 By 1973, Mr. Chandler was vice president for public affairs broadcasting and Mr. Hewitt's boss, with budget oversight and a voice in story selection.
 As director of the network's election unit in the late 1960s, Mr. Chandler created and operated the CBS News Poll. In that capacity, he negotiated the 1976 partnership that established The New York Times/CBS News Poll. He also supervised the network's coverage of elections and conventions from 1968 through 1974.
 Among the documentaries that Mr. Chandler produced, co-produced or wrote in his 22 years at CBS were ''Under Surveillance'' (1971), a report on the government's surveillance of dissenters, and ''The People of South Vietnam: How They Feel About the War'' (1967). 
 In 1975, Mr. Chandler was promoted to vice president for administration and assistant to the president of CBS News. He retired from the network in 1985, but later worked at NBC and, in 1990, was executive producer of a two-hour PBS documentary, ''Learning in America: Schools That Work.''
 Robert Zuckerkandle was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 25, 1928, one of two sons of Louis and Minnie Gurin Zuckerkandle. (He chose Chandler as a pen name before legally changing his last name.)
 Mr. Chandler earned a degree in economics in 1949 at City College of New York, where he was also editor of the college newspaper. In his sophomore year he met Eleanor Reiff; they were married in 1951.
 After college, Mr. Chandler was hired by Variety as a music reporter. He served in the United States Army in Germany from 1951 to 1953, then returned to Variety to cover radio and television. In 1961, MGM hired him as publicity director for its television division.
 Two years later, he joined CBS as public relations director for the news division. In addition to his wife and his son Doug, Mr. Chandler is survived by another son, Larry; his brother, Martin; and one grandchild.

HEADLINE: Official History Spotlights Iraq Rebuilding Blunders

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ and T. CHRISTIAN MILLER; James Glanz reported from Baghdad, and T. Christian Miller, of the nonprofit investigative Web site ProPublica, reported from Washington.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
An unpublished 513-page federal history of the American-led reconstruction of Iraq depicts an effort crippled before the invasion by Pentagon planners who were hostile to the idea of rebuilding a foreign country, and then molded into a $100 billion failure by bureaucratic turf wars, spiraling violence and ignorance of the basic elements of Iraqi society and infrastructure.
 The history, the first official account of its kind, is circulating in draft form here and in Washington among a tight circle of technical reviewers, policy experts and senior officials. It also concludes that when the reconstruction began to lag -- particularly in the critical area of rebuilding the Iraqi police and army -- the Pentagon simply put out inflated measures of progress to cover up the failures.
 In one passage, for example, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is quoted as saying that in the months after the 2003 invasion, the Defense Department ''kept inventing numbers of Iraqi security forces -- the number would jump 20,000 a week! 'We now have 80,000, we now have 100,000, we now have 120,000.' '' 
 Mr. Powell's assertion that the Pentagon inflated the number of competent Iraqi security forces is backed up by Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the former commander of ground troops in Iraq, and L. Paul Bremer III, the top civilian administrator until an Iraqi government took over in June 2004.
 Among the overarching conclusions of the history is that five years after embarking on its largest foreign reconstruction project since the Marshall Plan in Europe after World War II, the United States government has in place neither the policies and technical capacity nor the organizational structure that would be needed to undertake such a program on anything approaching this scale.
 The bitterest message of all for the reconstruction program may be the way the history ends. The hard figures on basic services and industrial production compiled for the report reveal that for all the money spent and promises made, the rebuilding effort never did much more than restore what was destroyed during the invasion and the convulsive looting that followed.
 By mid-2008, the history says, $117 billion had been spent on the reconstruction of Iraq, including some $50 billion in United States taxpayer money.
 The history contains a catalog of revelations that show the chaotic and often poisonous atmosphere prevailing in the reconstruction effort.
 When the Office of Management and Budget balked at the American occupation authority's abrupt request for about $20 billion in new reconstruction money in August 2003, a veteran Republican lobbyist working for the authority made a bluntly partisan appeal to Joshua B. Bolten, then the O.M.B. director and now the White House chief of staff. ''To delay getting our funds would be a political disaster for the President,'' wrote the lobbyist, Tom C. Korologos. ''His election will hang for a large part on show of progress in Iraq and without the funding this year, progress will grind to a halt.'' With administration backing, Congress allocated the money later that year.
 In an illustration of the hasty and haphazard planning, a civilian official at the United States Agency for International Development was at one point given four hours to determine how many miles of Iraqi roads would need to be reopened and repaired. The official searched through the agency's reference library, and his estimate went directly into a master plan. Whatever the quality of the agency's plan, it eventually began running what amounted to a parallel reconstruction effort in the provinces that had little relation with the rest of the American effort.
 Money for many of the local construction projects still under way is divided up by a spoils system controlled by neighborhood politicians and tribal chiefs. ''Our district council chairman has become the Tony Soprano of Rasheed, in terms of controlling resources,'' said an American Embassy official working in a dangerous Baghdad neighborhood. '' 'You will use my contractor or the work will not get done.' ''
 A Cautionary Tale
 The United States could soon have reason to consult this cautionary tale of deception, waste and poor planning, as troop levels and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan are likely to be stepped up under the new administration. 
 The incoming Obama administration's rebuilding experts are expected to focus on smaller-scale projects and emphasize political and economic reform. Still, such programs do not address one of the history's main contentions: that the reconstruction effort has failed because no single agency in the United States government has responsibility for the job. 
 Five years after the invasion of Iraq, the history concludes, ''the government as a whole has never developed a legislatively sanctioned doctrine or framework for planning, preparing and executing contingency operations in which diplomacy, development and military action all figure.''
 Titled ''Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience,'' the new history was compiled by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, led by Stuart W. Bowen Jr., a Republican lawyer who regularly travels to Iraq and has a staff of engineers and auditors based here. Copies of several drafts of the history were provided to reporters at The New York Times and ProPublica by two people outside the inspector general's office who have read the draft, but are not authorized to comment publicly. 
 Mr. Bowen's deputy, Ginger Cruz, declined to comment for publication on the substance of the history. But she said it would be presented on Feb. 2 at the first hearing of the Commission on Wartime Contracting, which was created this year as a result of legislation sponsored by Senators Jim Webb of Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, both Democrats.
 The manuscript is based on approximately 500 new interviews, as well as more than 600 audits, inspections and investigations on which Mr. Bowen's office has reported over the years. Laid out for the first time in a connected history, the material forms the basis for broad judgments on the rebuilding program.
 In the preface, Mr. Bowen gives a searing critique of what he calls the ''blinkered and disjointed prewar planning for Iraq's reconstruction'' and the botched expansion of the program from a modest initiative to improve Iraqi services to a multibillion-dollar enterprise.
 Mr. Bowen also swipes at the endless revisions and reversals of the program, which at various times gyrated from a focus on giant construction projects led by large Western contractors to modest community-based initiatives carried out by local Iraqis. While Mr. Bowen concedes that deteriorating security had a hand in spoiling the program's hopes, he suggests, as he has in the past, that the program did not need much outside help to do itself in.
 Despite years of studying the program, Mr. Bowen writes that he still has not found a good answer to the question of why the program was even pursued as soaring violence made it untenable. ''Others will have to provide that answer,'' Mr. Bowen writes.
 ''But beyond the security issue stands another compelling and unavoidable answer: the U.S. government was not adequately prepared to carry out the reconstruction mission it took on in mid-2003,'' he concludes.
 The history cites some projects as successes. The review praises community outreach efforts by the Agency forInternational Development, the Treasury Department's plan to stabilize the Iraqi dinar after the invasion and a joint effort by the Departments of State and Defense to create local rebuilding teams.
 But the portrait that emerges over all is one of a program's officials operating by the seat of their pants in the middle of a critical enterprise abroad, where the reconstruction was supposed to convince the Iraqi citizenry of American good will and support the new democracy with lights that turned on and taps that flowed with clean water. Mostly, it is a portrait of a program that seemed to grow exponentially as even those involved from the inception of the effort watched in surprise.
 Early Miscalculations
 On the eve of the invasion, as it began to dawn on a few officials that the price for rebuilding Iraq would be vastly greater than they had been told, the degree of miscalculation was illustrated in an encounter between Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the defense secretary, and Jay Garner, a retired lieutenant general who had hastily been named the chief of what would be a short-lived civilian authority called the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance.
 The history records how Mr. Garner presented Mr. Rumsfeld with several rebuilding plans, including one that would include projects across Iraq.
 ''What do you think that'll cost?'' Mr. Rumsfeld asked of the more expansive plan.
 ''I think it's going to cost billions of dollars,'' Mr. Garner said.
 ''My friend,'' Mr. Rumsfeld replied, ''if you think we're going to spend a billion dollars of our money over there, you are sadly mistaken.''
 In a way he never anticipated, Mr. Rumsfeld turned out to be correct: before that year was out, the United States had appropriated more than $20 billion for the reconstruction, which would indeed involve projects across the entire country.
 Mr. Rumsfeld declined to comment on the history, but a spokesman, Keith Urbahn, said that quotes attributed to Mr. Rumsfeld in the document ''appear to be accurate.'' Mr. Powell also declined to comment.
 The secondary effects of the invasion and its aftermath were among the most important factors that radically changed the outlook. Tables in the history show that measures of things like the national production of electricity and oil, public access to potable water, mobile and landline telephone service and the presence of Iraqi security forces all plummeted by at least 70 percent, and in some cases all the way to zero, in the weeks after the invasion.
 Subsequent tables in the history give a fast-forward view of what happened as the avalanche of money tumbled into Iraq over the next five years.
 Dashed Expectations
 By the time a sovereign Iraqi government took over from the Americans in June 2004, none of those services -- with a single exception, mobile phones -- had returned to prewar levels.
 And by the time of the security improvements in 2007 and 2008, electricity output had, at best, a precarious 10 percent lead on its levels under Saddam Hussein; oil production was still below prewar levels; and access to potable water had increased by about 30 percent, although with Iraq's ruined piping system it was unclear how much reached people's homes uncontaminated.
 Whether the rebuilding effort could have succeeded in a less violent setting will never be known. In April 2004, thousands of the Iraqi security forces that had been oversold by the Pentagon were overrun, abruptly mutinied or simply abandoned their posts as the insurgency broke out, sending Iraq down a violent path from which it has never completely recovered.
 At the end of his narrative, Mr. Bowen chooses a line from ''Great Expectations'' by Dickens as the epitaph of the American-led attempt to rebuild Iraq: ''We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us.''

HEADLINE: THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Rising-tide Tax System, The

BYLINE: By STEPHEN MIHM

 BODY:
In the last 20-plus years, overall economic growth in the United States has come at a cost: rising income inequality, which in the past few years has hit levels not seen since the late 1920s. A more progressive income tax, introduced during the New Deal, helped mitigate the problem, and it remains a likely prescription today. Yet a team of economists that includes Robert Shiller of Yale University and Leonard Burman of the Tax Policy Center recently released a paper in which they propose another way of ''spreading the wealth'' -- one that, while less controversial in political terms, would still prevent income inequality from worsening in the coming years. 
 Under the proposal, the tax code would automatically be rewritten at the end of each year to reflect any changes in the relative share of national income earned by each income bracket. For example, if one year the nation's top earners saw their share of national income rise while people at the bottom saw their share grow at a slower rate (or decline), the following year's tax rates would be automatically rewritten to compensate for the new inequality. This would keep everyone's share of after-tax income at the earlier level.
 The proposal is progressive in intent but conservative in effect. The only ''redistribution'' it promises would be an automatic response to growing inequality. Indeed, the proposal would work both ways: if the rich saw their share of the nation's income grow more slowly relative to people lower down the economic ladder, the tax system would become less progressive, and the tax burden would increase on the middle- and lower-income tax brackets.
 The name of the proposal -- the Rising-Tide Tax System -- is an allusion to John F. Kennedy's claim in 1962 that ''a rising tide lifts all boats,'' a promise that general economic growth would benefit all members of society. Shiller argues that it's still possible to turn Kennedy's vision into a reality. ''It's something we can engineer,'' he says.

HEADLINE: Bus Service to Light-Rail Station Is Free, but Will It Be Popular?

BYLINE: By DAVID HOLMBERG

DATELINE: NORTH BERGEN 

 BODY:
 THE new buses are free and they are green, but North Bergen township officials say that commuters may still need a little prompting to take advantage of a new shuttle service that will take them to the light rail station from either end of town. 
 Nicholas J. Sacco, the mayor of this Hudson County township since 1991, called the service a ''great initiative to improve traffic flow by reducing the number of cars on our roads, while protecting the environment in the process.'' 
 Mr. Sacco and other officials hailed the buses at a news conference recently. The shuttle service is part of a three-year pilot program that will use two buses to carry commuters from parts of town that are underserved by mass transit during rush hour. Each bus seats 18 passengers and will operate from 6 to 8 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m., traveling to the North Bergen Light Rail station at Tonnelle Avenue and 51st Street.
 The $65,000 buses were acquired by the town through a grant from New Jersey Transit that also included $120,000 for maintenance costs and drivers' salaries. 
 A New Jersey Transit spokesman, Joseph Dee, said the payments would be made in decreasing increments of $30,000, $20,000, and $10,000 over the three-year period to allow the township to gradually assume more and more financial responsibility for the shuttles.
 In an interview, the township administrator, Christopher Pianese, described the pilot program as ''pretty unique. It's a door-to-door kind of thing.'' Mr. Dee said the new service was the only one serving Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, although about 20 municipalities in New Jersey have community shuttles for other purposes.
 The North Bergen station opened in 2006, as part of the Hudson-Bergen system, which connects to ferry and PATH service to Manhattan.
 Mr. Pianese, who handled the grant application, said that ridership would be evaluated month-to-month to determine how well the buses are serving the intended population, which he said was an economic cross-section of the county.
 Mayor Sacco said ''people have to be convinced'' that the shuttle fits their schedules and locations, and some might be skeptical about a free service and return to cars if they are not satisfied.
 ''We have to get the timing down,'' Mr. Sacco said. ''People might wait longer for a shuttle than they want to wait. We have to build trust and confidence so people don't say: 'maybe it's not going to work for me.' '' 
 Initially, there will be 12 stops on each of the routes, which are each about two miles long. Mr. Panesi said that if that number proved to be too many, some might be dropped; adjustments might also be made to the buses' schedules to accommodate commuters.
 ''We should be able to see if the shuttle needs tweaking,'' he said.
 Mr. Pianese said, though, that he was confident the shuttle would attract a sufficient number of riders to justify the service. In fact, he said, ''my concern is that there might be too many riders.''
 Mr. Dee said that New Jersey Transit would evaluate the shuttle when the pilot program ends to determine if expansion is necessary.
 One factor in selecting the North Bergen station as a shuttle service site, officials explained, is that road construction on nearby Routes 1 and 9 has caused a decline in ridership from the station, and might continue to do so for about two more years. The shuttle bus service was intended to dovetail with the construction.

HEADLINE: Good News for Drivers Is Bad for State Budget

BYLINE: By DERRICK HENRY

 BODY:
THE recent decline in gas prices has left a $100 million hole in Connecticut's budget for this fiscal year, taking a chunk of what was expected to be $404 million in gasoline tax revenue. 
 The state now expects to collect $304 million from the tax on the wholesale price of gasoline for the fiscal year, said Thomas J. Fiore, the director of the revenue-section of the state's Office of Policy and Management. 
 ''This tax has been incredibly volatile over the years,'' said Mr. Fiore. For example, he said, the tax brought in $63 million in the 1999 fiscal year, when oil prices were lower. In the 2008 fiscal year, it brought in $367.8 million. 
 The wholesale price of gasoline topped out at $3.42 a gallon in June, dropped to $3 by September and then sank to $1.92 in October and $1.34 last month, according to data from the federal Energy Information Administration. 
 The Office of Policy and Management repeatedly advised Nancy S. Wyman, the state comptroller, that the drop in gasoline prices would affect revenue. In September, the office lowered its tax revenue estimate by $27.4 million. In October, the drop was estimated at $100 million. The tax is 7 per cent of the wholesale price of gasoline that gas station owners pay. There is also a 25-cent per gallon state excise tax that consumers pay at the pump.The average retail price for a gallon of regular gasoline in Connecticut hit an all-time high of $4.39 in July. In the middle of last week, it averaged $1.88, according to data from the AAA.
 Revenue from the wholesale tax has climbed steadily in the last five years. It brought in $179 million in the 2004-5 fiscal year, according to the Department of Revenue Services. In the 2005-6 fiscal year, it brought in $279.6 million, and $309.4 million in 2006-7. In the 2007-8 fiscal year, the revenue was $367.8 million. That trend led lawmakers and officials to expect similar revenues this fiscal year, from July 1 to June 30.
 ''Forecasts come out of thin air. As the oil price gyrates, so does this portion of Connecticut's budget,'' said Arthur W. Wright, professor emeritus of economics at the University of Connecticut. ''There's been a lot of jumping and gyrating in the state capital.'' 
 Dr. Wright said that relying on such a tax exposes the state to market risk. But he said that even if the state wanted to get rid of the tax, because of its instability, it would be difficult to do so, because officials would have to find money elsewhere or raise other taxes.
 Connecticut's $18.4 billion budget had a projected deficit of at least $338 million at the beginning of this month, according to the state comptroller, despite $71.8 million in cuts that the General Assembly made during a special session last month.
 Because that projected deficit exceeds 1 percent of the budget, Gov. M. Jodi Rell is required by law to present a new plan to balance the budget. Chris Cooper, a spokesman for Mrs. Rell, said that she was working on a new plan.
 Christopher G. Donovan, the Democratic House majority leader, said that while revenue from the gas tax can be volatile, it is unclear if the tax would be revisited anytime soon.
 The tax was imposed in the 1970s and remained at 5 percent until 2005, when lawmakers approved annual increases, bringing it to the current 7 percent.

HEADLINE: Harder to Get to, Easier to Pay For

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
LIKE many New Yorkers seeking to migrate to the suburbs to raise a family, Josh and Elizabeth Haynes Leventhal first started looking for houses in Montclair, Maplewood and South Orange, N.J., mainly because those were places they'd heard about while living in TriBeCa. The neighboring town of West Orange was not on their shopping list.
 Though West Orange is less than 20 miles from New York City, it is not on the lists of many home buyers to begin with, agents say, because it does not have a train station that provides direct service to Pennsylvania Station -- as Montclair, Maplewood and South Orange do. Nor does it have a small village of shops -- to push a baby stroller, for instance, while running Saturday morning errands.
 What West Orange does have, the Leventhals found, was a lot more open space and an old-fashioned charm. They and their year-old daughter, Madeline, are now living in a six-bedroom Victorian built in 1865 in Llewellyn Park, a gated community, for which they paid $1.375 million in June. 
 While Mr. Leventhal has continued working as a Wall Street trader, Ms. Haynes Leventhal has completed a contemporary novel about Wall Street titled ''Trading.'' Together, they have discovered some of the old-fashioned establishments that endure in West Orange, like the Eagle Rock Diner, where the waitresses call all three of them ''Honey.''
 ''You feel like there's something down-to-earth and real here,'' Ms. Haynes Leventhal said.
 There is a bowling alley next to the diner and a venerable local steakhouse, Pal's Cabin, just down the street. There are six golf courses, the sweeping Eagle Rock and South Mountain reservations, a zoo, an arena with two skating rinks and a shopping center with a multiscreen movie theater and a supermarket.
 According to census estimates, West Orange's population last year was 42,906. Montclair, its neighbor, tallied up at 37,052. The difference is that West Orange's population is spread out over 12.1 square miles, about twice the area of Montclair. 
 ''Each section of town has its own little vibe to it,'' said Heather De Barros, who with her husband, Manny, traded their first home in West Orange 10 months ago for a four-bedroom colonial in the Eagle Crest neighborhood, paying $740,000. 
 They are apparently not alone. ''We have a lot of people staying within the community,'' said Ronald De Piro, the managing broker for Weichert Realtors' West Orange office.
 Because a commuter must take a bus to New York from a park-and-ride garage, or a jitney to one of three stations on New Jersey Transit's Midtown Direct train line, West Orange is generally perceived as somewhat out of the way. But to many residents, that is not necessarily a bad thing.
 ''You can buy a house, usually, for less than you could in a town on a train line,'' said Justin Wrobel, the president of Exit Garden State Realty, whose offices are in West Orange.
 The leafy Upper Gregory neighborhood in West Orange looks like neighborhoods in nearby South Orange or Maplewood. But the price of a home in West Orange would be about $75,000 less than a similar house in South Orange or Maplewood, Mr. Wrobel said.
 Business has been slow during the economic downturn, he added, though houses will sell quickly if they are not overpriced. 
 Sam Joseph, an agent for Re/Max Village Square who sells in Llewellyn Park, says he has had a ''pretty decent year.'' Specifying West Orange's attraction, he said, ''People want the proximity of New York without the headaches.''
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 Main Street, an urbanized clump of tightly packed stores and wood-frame houses, is the backbone of downtown West Orange. At about the midpoint of Main is Glenmont, the estate that Thomas A. Edison and his young second wife, Mina, bought in 1886. Edison then built a large laboratory nearby.
 This stretch of Main Street, up to the looming Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic church at Eagle Rock Avenue, is the most walkable part of town and includes the town hall and establishments like Gaffer's Pub and the Rock Cellar. This part of Main Street plays host to the enormously popular annual St. Patrick's Day parade.
 West Orange is bisected by Interstate 280, which runs east and west, with Eagle Rock Reservation to the northeast and a portion of the sprawling South Mountain Reservation to the south. Essex Green Shopping Center is off I-280, near the center of the township, and Francis A. Byrne Municipal Golf Course is down Mount Pleasant Avenue.
 The quieter Upper Gregory and St. Cloud neighborhoods are off Northfield Avenue, which leads to Richard J. Codey (formerly South Mountain) Arena, Turtle Back Zoo and the big park-and-ride garage. Pleasantdale, a village on Pleasant Valley Way, is home to an Orthodox Jewish community and has its own Judaica store.
 According to statistics compiled by the New Jersey State Police, crime dropped to 26.2 incidences per 1,000 population in 2006, from 44.5 incidences per 1,000 population in 1998. Violent crimes in the same period dropped to 83 per 1,000, from 123.
 ''You might hear a complaint or two about property taxes,'' said John F. McKeon, who grew up in West Orange and has been its part-time mayor for 10 years, ''but you won't hear anybody say they're not comfortable living here.''
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 There were 335 houses listed for sale earlier this month on www.gsmls.com, the Garden State Multiple Listing Service's Web site. The median price was $400,000. Prices ranged from $150,000, for a renovated one-bedroom condominium, to $4.25 million, for a six-bedroom colonial to be built in Llewellyn Park.
 More than half the houses are priced at $300,000 to $500,000. A three-bedroom 1960 split-level was listed at $405,000, with a $15,000 credit for renovation offered. The 2007 tax bill on the house, which has three full baths and a finished basement, was $11,538.
 Judging by West Essex Board of Realtors numbers, the downturn has had an effect on the West Orange market: 423 houses sold here from Jan. 1 to Nov. 30, whereas in all of 2007, 540 houses sold. The average sale price was $418,334, and the average length of time on the market was 84 days. Last year the average price was $454,238, and the average time on market was 76 days.
 WHAT TO DO
 For $40, Essex County residents can buy an annual identification card that lets them play each round of golf at the Francis Byrne course for $21 -- a $20 discount. Ice skating at Codey Arena, run by the county, is $6 for adults, $4 for children and residents over 65, and $4 to rent a pair of skates. An annual family pass to the community pool is $260.
 The shopping districts of Montclair, South Orange and Maplewood are nearby, as are the malls in Short Hills and Livingston. ''The nice thing about being here,'' Ms. Haynes Leventhal said, ''is that we have a lot of friends in the surrounding towns, and we're sort of equidistant between them.''
 THE SCHOOLS
 There are seven elementary schools for kindergarten through fifth grade; three middle schools (Edison for sixth grade and Roosevelt and Jefferson for seventh and eighth grades), and West Orange High School. 
 Enrollments at the seven elementary schools range from 321 to 503. At Gregory School, the largest, average class size in the academic year ending in 2007 was 16, versus 19.1 statewide. Average class size for fifth-graders was 18.2, versus 21.1 statewide.
 About 2,000 students in Grades 9 through 12 are enrolled at West Orange High School. SAT averages for the year ending in 2007 were 486 in math, 472 in reading and 468 in writing, versus 509, 491 and 489 statewide. The class of 2007 had a 95.1 percent graduation rate, versus 92.3 percent statewide. 
 THE COMMUTE
 Essex County operates a large park-and-ride garage next to Codey Arena. Community Coach Inc. runs 18 express buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal on weekday mornings and 12 express buses during the evening rush hour. The trip takes 40 to 45 minutes. A 10-trip pass is $64.35, and garage parking is $535 a year.
 West Orange also operates three free jitney lines to South Orange, Orange and Mountain stations on New Jersey Transit's Midtown Direct line. There are four morning jitney rides from the St. Cloud neighborhood, and six from South Orange at night. A monthly pass from South Orange to Penn Station is $154.
 THE HISTORY
 Thomas Edison was 84 upon his death in 1931. His widow married her childhood sweetheart, Edward Everett Hughes. When he in turn died, in 1940, she went back to using the surname Edison. She died in 1947 and is buried next to Edison at Glenmont, which is now a national historic site.

 BOOK REVIEW
 THROUGH A VEIL, DIMLY
 The pending publication of ''The Jewel of Medina,'' a novel of life with the Prophet Muhammad as told by a wife, occasioned fears of a violent response from Muslim extremists and complaints that it is ''soft-core pornography.'' It is, rather, ''historical romance,'' Lorraine Adams says in a review, with ''lamentable'' prose even by that standard. PAGE 10

 Among the latest crime offerings is ''The Private Patient'' by P.D. James. So what if the characters are a bit stock?

HEADLINE: In Tough Times, the Tough Open a Store

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com

DATELINE: SCARSDALE 

 BODY:
 WHO in his right mind would open a new store when the economy is in free fall and Americans are squirreling away any spare cash?
 Joe Passero would. And to underscore what he calls his chutzpah, Mr. Passero plans in the spring to open a 19,000-square-foot store on Central Park Avenue here that will sell, of all things, furnishings for kitchens, bathrooms and other rooms in the home. In case you've been locked in an unwired dungeon for the past year, fewer people are buying or renovating homes -- home sales were down 3.1 percent in October -- and the median price of the American dream went down 11.3 percent in just a year.
 But Mr. Passero has confidence that his brand name's reputation will allow him to sprint, or at least trudge, into this fiercely howling wind. He is the chief operating officer of Klaff's, one of the Northeast's largest independently owned home design stores, and he and his family own established stores in Norwalk, Danbury and Westport in Connecticut. 
 He acknowledges that business has been soft in the current doldrums. ''This situation is hopefully going to turn around,'' he said, with an air that suggested he hadn't quite convinced himself.
 Indeed, Mr. Passero, a tall, husky and dapper man of 52, confesses that in deciding to open the Scarsdale store, he received some pushback from relatives who are in business with him and who, he says, told him, ''Why rock the boat, why make changes, everything is great.'' He himself had some anxious days when he watched Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns implode and the stock market kept steamrolling downward.
 ''We're dependent on builders and architects and new construction, which is, I wouldn't say screeching to a halt, but it's not moving,'' Mr. Passero said.
 If he needs any more convincing of how much of a business eccentric he is, a recent survey by the Business Council of Westchester of its 1,200 members showed that two-thirds of them project that their revenue will either decline or fall flat in the next year. Nevertheless, entrepreneurs open businesses all the time -- almost 800 business certificates were filed with the county clerk's office between Sept. 1 and Nov. 20, in the teeth of the current crisis.
 Mr. Passero describes himself as more of a risk taker than others in his family, and he is a great believer that in calamity there is opportunity. The business was started in 1921 as a wholesale plumbing supplier by his grandparents, Joe and Mary Klaff, and withstood the Great Depression. When World War II came along and cast iron was hard to obtain, the Klaffs went into decorative hardware and electrical supplies. After the war, when veterans were eager to start families, the business moved into lumber and kit houses. 
 Thus was born an all-purpose home design business that today has 220 employees and had sales last year of more than $56 million, according to financial reports, in lighting fixtures, lamps, tiles, kitchen cabinets, decorative handles and even towels.
 ''Some of the most successful businesses that have ever been started were started during times like these,'' Mr. Passero said. ''You have to keep moving forward. If not, you're moving backward. You can't stand still in business.''
 Mr. Passero has barely stood still since he was 8 or 9, when he started loading delivery trucks for the family business as a stock boy. That experience cultivated an interest in architecture and design, and when he started managing the business, he moved the company into new frontiers like high-end cabinetry and tile and stone.
 With the older generation getting on in years -- his mother, Mollie Klaff Passero, is president, and an aunt and two sisters are also active -- he is looking for opportunities to expand the company so some of the children, nephews and nieces can have the same adventures he had. 
 Mr. Passero conceived of a Westchester branch two years ago, and in March signed a 15-year lease for a shuttered Treasure Island outdoor furniture store. It was on Westchester's main shopping drag and close enough to the Klaff's distribution warehouse that, he said, it was ''geographically sensible.'' 
 He welcomes the challenge of turning the property into a bustling enterprise and expects that by the time the store opens, the nation's economy should have picked up. He takes comfort in glimmers of hopeful, if peripheral, change, like Barack Obama's election and the fact that the stock market's November tailspin could have been worse. 
 ''They said stocks are as low as they've been since 2003. They didn't say since 1929,'' he said.
 ''People are being conservative in spending, and that can only last so long,'' he added. ''I believe there are tremendous real estate values out there, and if people buy homes, they need to fix them up, and that's the business we're in.'' 
 The interview with Mr. Passero took place on a late afternoon in his Norwalk office, on a day after the stock market tumbled more than 800 points over two days and an icon of American banking, Citigroup, lost half its value. But just as the interview was concluding, he switched on his computer screen and a Web site flashed the news that the stock market had rallied almost 500 points. Mr. Passero heaved a big sigh of relief.

HEADLINE: UConn Seeks Approval for Hospital Merger

BYLINE: By GREGORY B. HLADKY

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
 THE University of Connecticut Health Center, which has survived with the aid of $52 million in state bailouts since 2000, is now hoping for legislative approval to merge with Hartford Hospital. 
 Advocates of the merger believe that it would eventually end the need for repeated infusions of state funds and would give Connecticut a major academic medical center that could provide an economic boost to the region.
 The current medical center includes a stem-cell unit and medical and dental schools in addition to its 224-bed hospital. 
 UConn's president, Michael J. Hogan, said that the merger hinged on a request for $500 million in state bonds to build a new, larger complex at the Health Center's Farmington campus, and more than $10 million a year in additional state support.
 Mr. Hogan said that the merger plan with Hartford Hospital was still being negotiated. ''We have worked our way through a number of thorny issues,'' he said. ''But we still have some very big issues left.''
 Hartford Hospital officials declined to be interviewed about the merger plan.
 The proposal comes amid forecasts of state budget deficits as high as $6 billion over the next two years.
 ''I suppose this does seem like a bad time,'' Mr. Hogan admitted as he began a round of lobbying visits with legislative leaders earlier this month. ''In the long term, though, the hospital has to be rebuilt. I don't see any way around it.''
 Convincing lawmakers of the need to merge the two hospitals will probably not be easy, according to the vice-chairwoman of the Legislature's Appropriations Committee, Representative Deborah W. Heinrich.
 ''At this point, with everything that's on the table, with the spending cuts we're looking at, it will be a plan that's going to be very closely scrutinized,'' said Ms. Heinrich, a Democrat from Madison.
 But the committee's Senate chairwoman, Toni N. Harp of New Haven, said she hoped that the funds needed to build a new regional medical-educational center on the health center campus ''can be offset by the dollars we get from the federal government for infrastructure improvements.''
 Ms. Harp and Mr. Hogan said that creating a new medical teaching and research center appears to fit President-elect Barack Obama's stated desire to finance public projects with federal funds in order to stimulate the economy. ''I'm thinking that would be a good place to look,'' Ms. Harp said.
 According to Ms. Harp, an expanded health center should eventually be able to pay off the state bonds needed to finance its construction. 
 Ms. Heinrich said that lawmakers must also consider the possibility of closing the UConn health center, which has encountered frequent financial problems since it opened in the 1960s. ''Just like with every decision we have to make, we have to look at every option,'' she said.
 She said that the medical center ''serves a very unique function in this state'' as Connecticut's only public hospital. ''It would be a shame to lose that,'' Ms. Heinrich said.
 ''This is not something we're going to finish deciding in this next session,'' she added. ''It's going to take some time.''
 The merger would also need approval from the State Office of Health Care Access.
 ''They have such an exhausting road ahead of them,'' said Cristine A. Vogel, the office's commissioner. She said that any such plan must answer the question, ''Does the population in that area require these services?''
 Last year, UConn offered the General Assembly a proposal to construct a $495 million teaching hospital to replace the antiquated one in Farmington. But Mr. Hogan said the plan ''was not well received by other area hospitals,'' which were apparently fearful of added competition.
 The legislature commissioned a study this year by the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering that recommended that the health center join with one or more for-profit hospitals in the area.
 The unresolved issues to a merger with Hartford Hospital include what kind of financial contribution the state would make and the exact financial arrangements with the hospital's for-profit parent company, Hartford Healthcare Corporation, according to Mr. Hogan.
 He said UConn would also need the state to pay for the difference between the cost of benefits and health care for Hartford Hospital employees and the more-expensive plans that UConn Health Center employees, who are state employees, have.
 Mr. Hogan estimated that cost at $10 million to $15 million a year.
 ''The real question is whether we want to have a publicly funded medical school in this state,'' said Ms. Harp.

HEADLINE: THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; National ''10 Percent Off'' Sale, The

BYLINE: By STEPHEN MIHM

 BODY:
 After rebate checks arrived in the mail in the spring as part of the economic stimulus package, U.S. taxpayers unexpectedly saved much of the money rather than spending it. But if too many households embrace thrift, consumer spending could come to an abrupt halt -- something to keep in mind as Congress prepares yet another stimulus package. To frustrate this newfound frugality, two economists are proposing an intriguing solution: have the federal government underwrite an across-the-board ''10 percent off'' sale in stores throughout the country. 
 Rather than send checks in the mail, according to a plan first advanced by Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University and Edward Leamer of U.C.L.A., the federal government would promise each state government a lump sum equal to 10 percent of the total money spent on consumer goods within the state over the previous six months. In return, each state would agree to institute a ''10 percent off'' sale throughout stores within its jurisdiction. This would be done by eliminating the state sales tax (if one exists) as well as imposing a negative tax (in other words, a further price reduction) to bring the total sale to 10 percent. Participating retailers would then submit their sales receipts to the state government in order to be reimbursed for whatever losses they sustained by making these sales. In turn, the state governments would be reimbursed by the federal government.
 In the end, the federal government's money would go only toward propping up consumer spending. Moreover, Kotlikoff and Leamer argue that by limiting the sale to six months, consumers will jump at the opportunity to buy now before the opportunity disappears, particularly when it comes to big-ticket purchases. ''If you have an incentive to buy a car now rather than in six months,'' Kotlikoff says, ''you may be willing to spend.''

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
HOW slow is the New York real estate market in this season of our economic discontent?
 When marketers and publicists who once saw buyers line up to sign contracts were asked what they now consider a ''hot'' level of sales, they said they were happy if two or three buyers had signed contracts in the last month or so, and had actually handed over checks for the 10 percent down payments.
 The Platinum, a 43-story tower on West 46th Street and Eighth Avenue, and the Visionaire, a curved glass and terra-cotta building in Battery Park City, each had three signed contracts in the last four weeks. Adrienne Albert, the chief executive of the Marketing Directors, which is marketing the building, said she was proud. 
 ''The developers didn't want to release this information because they are afraid it doesn't sound like many sales,'' she said. ''But given today's market and the fact that some jobs are closing their offices because sales are so slow, I am quite proud of our achievement.''
 James Lansill, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, said that getting two signed contracts at Riverhouse, One Rockefeller Park, in Battery Park City, in the last month was ''outstanding'' for the ''volume of deals'' relative to the market meltdown. Four contracts were signed in October.
 Mr. Lansill cited a second development, the Chelsea Enclave, a new glass and red brick building of 54 apartments on Ninth Avenue and West 21st Street, on the grounds of the General Theological Seminary. There, six apartments have gone into contract since the project went on the market in September, including two in the last month.
 ''We are in the eye of the storm,'' he said. ''A lot of buyers are paralyzed.'' 
 Both sides are uncertain about the value of real estate, he said, especially when the city has an inventory of 6,000 unsold apartments in new buildings or buildings under construction.
 Several marketers pointed to a major project that reported five new signed contracts in the last four weeks: the Edge, two towers of blue glass going up on the waterfront in Williamsburg.
 When the first phase of the project, with 575 luxury condominiums (there are also 375 moderate-income rental apartments), went on the market in the spring, sales were brisk, with five contracts signed a week. But by fall, that had slowed to one or two a week. 
 Now, with the market bleak, the developer, Jeffrey E. Levine, the chairman of Douglaston Development, said that the current sales pace at the project was ''a glimmer of light in a world of darkness.''
 He said the project's amenities, including a glass-enclosed year-round pool and a ''fantastic neighborhood,'' were still bringing in buyers despite the changed market. 
 It helped, he said, that most of the Edge's new home owners were first-time buyers who didn't have to sell another apartment, and were more likely to be in the creative arts, entertainment and the news media than in the troubled finance industry.
 ''Now we have a reality-based market and the buyers are people with real income and real assets,'' he said. 
 Prices at the Edge are below most in Manhattan, about $900 per square foot. A small one-bedroom lists at about $540,000, though, Mr. Levine said, ''We are willing to work with buyers.''
 In this difficult market, however, it appears that a number of lower-price projects in Jersey City are selling better than their more prestigious counterparts across the Hudson River. 
 At the Beacon, formerly the Jersey City Medical Center, where buyers once signed 60 contracts a month, six condominiums went into contract in November, said George F. Filopoulos, the president of Metrovest, the developer of the project. One-bedroom apartments there list for about $350,000. 
 Buyers are offered sponsor help with financing and closing costs, and can rent to buy. ''You have to be realistic,'' Mr. Filopoulos said. ''You have to throw everything you can at it.''

HEADLINE: Consequences Of Going To the Tape

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
FOR several months the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater has been announcing that many evenings of its current 50th-anniversary season at New York City Center will have live music, and which ones. There's no question that live music makes a difference. If you watch Ailey's classic ''Revelations'' from upstairs, there are moments when it's almost as good to look at the singers as it is to watch the dancing. Nothing about the season's opening gala was more terrific than the guests who sang, above all Jessye Norman, onstage amid shadow to deliver ''Fix Me, Jesus.'' But the other live-music performances -- for ''Revelations'' and other ballets -- have been sensational too; in Hope Boykin's new work ''Go in Grace,'' the musicians are the main event. 
 A few of us, though, have been living in such privileged conditions that it is still a shock to realize that live music is negotiable. This shock, I know, is illogical. The 1948 movie ''The Red Shoes'' shows the old Ballet Rambert dancing ''Swan Lake'' to 78 r.p.m. records at the Mercury Theater; Ailey has frequently presented ''Revelations'' to taped music, from its 1960 premiere on; and it has been 35 years since Twyla Tharp had a smash hit with ''Deuce Coupe,'' to Beach Boys recordings. 
 But for many of us live music has remained the norm. I never guessed, when I first watched the Martha Graham Dance Company in the 1970s, or when I first watched the Paul Taylor Dance Company in the 1980s, that the time would come when they would perform to recordings. 
 That time came some years ago. And it came in New York, where live musicians cost more. When I watched a 1988 season by the Taylor company at City Center, I saw that the difference between one performance of ''Mercuric Tidings'' and the next was because the conductor Donald York took an even more exciting tempo; when I reviewed the same company's 2008 season in the same theater, just one performance of one dance -- at the season's gala -- had live music. The Graham company performed with live music this month at the Kennedy Center in Washington, but its two-week 2007 season at the Joyce Theater had all taped music.
 In 2005 the Graham company was able to give a two-week season with a live orchestra of 28 players, but the cost -- as Joan Acocella, reviewing in The New Yorker, reported at the time -- was $184,000. The same month a Mark Morris season with six instrumentalists and eight singers cost, for four performances, $35,000. Ms. Acocella (also reviewing the excellent Nrityagram Dance Ensemble, which had three instrumentalists and a vocalist) remarked: ''In these days of near-zero public funding for dance, one assumes that the companies more or less killed themselves to raise that money, and the result made all the difference in the world. Dance audiences, I believe, have now got used to taped music, and you can get used to it, the same way you can learn to eat Spam instead of ham, or breathe smog instead of air. Your life is just diminished, and you don't realize it until you see concerts such as we saw last month.''
 As the economic climate deteriorates steadily, dance audiences are likely to be asked to eat ever more Spam, in and out of New York. Miami City Ballet expects to have a live orchestra when it visits City Center for five performances in January, but the company's latest press release announces that it is canceling a live orchestra for its current South Florida season's Programs 3 and 4. ''Live music for programs this season would cost the company $480,000, and as of Dec. 4, 2008, $188,281.83 had been raised,'' the release says. The company's board, it says, determined that ''the goal would not be met.'' Such stories have occurred elsewhere; more will follow.
 The general practice of companies using taped music is to pay a fee to the recording artists for each performance. But several companies, perhaps many, cut corners by not doing so. Few companies declare in the program what recording of the music is being used, and regrettably few people in the audience ask. (I am sometimes one of those few. And I intend to keep asking.)
 And we are likely to start hearing more taped performances of ''The Nutcracker'' and ''The Sleeping Beauty.'' This prospect depresses me beyond measure. You need to be a regular dancegoer to know quite how much difference a conductor and orchestra can create between the same cast's performances of the same ballet on Wednesday and on Thursday. Where there is taped music, sooner or later you're likely to see taped dancing. 
 Recordings do have their advantages. I have known ballet conductors to ruin performances, and American Ballet Theater's largely excellent October-November season at City Center would have been twice as good if the orchestral playing had been better. The choreographer Matthew Bourne remarked in 2006 that while a good performance of live music was still his ideal accompaniment for his choreography, he had often found himself longing for a recording after hearing some severely flawed performances. Replacement conductors or players had wrecked crucial details, he said, and made sections of the choreography ineffective while giving the dancers problems. 
 But let me give you an example of the ideal. Fifty years after the legendary ''Sleeping Beauty'' of the Sadler's Wells Ballet's first American season in 1949, dancers were still telling me how the conductor, Constant Lambert, suddenly slowed the tempo in one passage of the Rose Adagio so that Margot Fonteyn, a dancer revelatory in her musical responsiveness, spontaneously made an unprecedented, electrifying effect. And this wasn't one of the choreography's spectacular moments; it was just a wonderfully dancey one. In that passage the ballerina, on both points, slowly circles on one spot; her upper body stretches up and down; her arms make sweeping changes of position; and her feet and legs richly vibrate to the score. Fonteyn at that moment was so incandescent that she won waves of applause through the music; her colleagues had never known the like. It all happened, apparently, because Lambert, a man of long theatrical experience, knew on impulse how to pluck the moment and propel her to new heights. 
 That opening night changed the history of ballet in America. Such moments, however, won't happen with recordings. 
 In one sense it's odd that live music should matter to so many of us. I grew up listening to records; they remain a large and intimate part of my life; I'm an obsessive audio collector. Like most people I went to dances where recordings were played; live music was rarely encountered at the parties where I danced. 
 Specific recordings have special resonance, and a few dance works have shown why. Ms. Tharp's ''Deuce Coupe'' is one; her several Frank Sinatra ballets are others; and Mr. Taylor's ''Company B'' (set to songs by the Andrews Sisters and recently seen with American Ballet Theater) is another. These have great choreography, and they very seldom receive stale performances. Part of their spell is that they catch some fresh essence of how those familiar recordings made us want to move ourselves.
 One work in the current Ailey repertory, Robert Battle's ''Unfold,'' uses Leontyne Price's recording of ''Depuis le jour'' from Charpentier's ''Louise.'' I think that this recording represents Ms. Price better than it does that aria (of which I have 10 better recordings), but at least it's always interesting at each performance to listen to the particular qualities she brought to this music. And though this isn't remotely important choreography, it seems to respond more to the lushness of her vocalization than to what the aria is saying or to its musical style. 
 Better that than, say, Emanuel Gat Dance's ballet to Mozart's Requiem, in March at the Joyce Theater. The differences between one version of Mozart's Requiem and another are much more profound than with Charpentier's ''Depuis le jour,'' and yet the Gat company did not name which recording it was using in the Joyce program. (I was much more interested in trying to identify that recording than I was in watching the choreography.) Examples of this indifference to musicians are commonplace. 
 I'd rather see smaller companies in smaller theaters, where dance still feels like music making. In August I went to see one of this year's final Noche Flamenca performances at Theater 80; since the season's first night Soledad Barrio had developed her great solo with her musicians, and it ended with them following her into a corner of the stage like huntsmen.
 A flamenco dancer at a Dance Critics Association conference once stated this rule: If you see flamenco to taped music, it's not real flamenco. The rule should apply outside flamenco, too. When you're hearing taped music, don't be too sure you're seeing real dance. As we enter dark financial days, this battle must be fought and fought again.

HEADLINE: Room to Rent. Bath Nearby.

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
NO one in New York has any privacy. But would you be willing to share a bathroom with that guy down the hall to save a buck? 
 A number of young New Yorkers who want to live alone but cannot afford it have settled on just that sort of compromise: renting a room and sharing facilities like kitchens and bathrooms with neighbors.
 Jessica Duffett, 25, an assistant and archivist at an art gallery, shares the top floor of a brownstone in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, with a woman who she estimates is about 10 years her senior. They have separate apartments, each with a kitchenette, but the bathroom is in the hallway beyond the locks on their front doors.
 ''I tell everyone, when they say, 'Oh, you live in a dorm,' no, I prefer pension,'' Ms. Duffett says with a grin and a self-mocking flick of a wrist. ''You know, those European hotels where you have your bar of soap and your towel and you shuffle down the hallway.'' 
 Call it what you will, but put on your pants before you grab your towel.
 ''There's always been a tradition of this, especially for the lower end of the housing market,'' said Alex Schwartz, the chairman of the department of urban policy analysis and management at the New School. ''What you may see now is it's extended up to portions of the housing market -- people who previously wouldn't live in this sort of unit.''
 Many apartment buildings that require this kind of intimate cooperation have rough reputations that make them unappealing beyond the practical inconvenience of sharing a shower with half a dozen strangers -- not an insignificant compromise in its own right. Single-room-occupancy buildings (rooming houses with six or more units) are often used as supportive housing for people coming out of homelessness or rehabilitation programs. Others are a landing pad for new immigrants. Some are quite grim, poorly run and badly maintained.
 ''It is easy to lump together good S.R.O.'s and bad ones,'' says Dov Treiman, a lawyer and the editor of The Housing Court Reporter. ''The most visible ones are those filling the almost last-ditch needs of the most needy in society.''
 In recent years, as rental prices have gone up and up, students and young professionals have become more willing to live in rooming houses or other dorm-like arrangements, said Howard Feingold, the president of Best Apartments, a real estate company that specializes in affordable rentals. Mr. Feingold, who handles about a dozen dorm-style apartments a year, said young people have been willingly choosing to live in such places for several years.
 ''They want to live in the city,'' Mr. Feingold said. ''They want a less expensive option, and if they can get over the fact that they're sharing a bathroom, and if they're not home a lot, they'll take them.'' 
 He points out, however, that some of these buildings are much nicer than others. 
 Ms. Duffett's apartment, for example, is on South Portland Street, which was named the best block in all of New York City by Time Out New York in 2006, based on criteria like aesthetics, amenities and train access. She has wide-beam hardwood floors, a decorative fireplace and a separate bedroom with a tin ceiling. 
 Ms. Duffett also has a small built-in community: the tenants who live in similar setups on the two floors below her. (The landlords live on the first floor.) 
 ''Everybody looks out for each other,'' Ms. Duffett said. ''It's sweet.'' 
 A recent Craigslist search showed studios and one-bedrooms near Ms. Duffett's apartment for $1,600 to $2,100. Ms. Duffett pays $1,450.
 Friends of hers who used to live in the area have all been priced out. Because of her willingness to be seen in the hall in a bathrobe, she has been able to stay in the neighborhood she loves. 
 ''I went to boarding school, I went to college and lived in dorms -- I've never experienced the truly private apartment, private bathroom,'' Ms. Duffett added. ''This is more of the same.''
 Sharing facilities with five others allows Davin Sweeney, a 28-year-old graduate student at Wagner School of Public Service of New York University, to cover his $750-a-month rent by bartending just a few nights a week. He has a bright, private room in an old mansion in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, as well as access to kitchens, bathrooms (there are three rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom on each of the first two floors) and a lush backyard. His landlords live in an apartment on the top floor. 
 ''Sometimes, like everywhere else, the dishes pile up,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''Everyone just has to pull their own weight, take the garbage out. We don't have any rules about that, so the best thing is to be respectful and just do it. And for the most part, people are.'' 
 The six tenants spend some time together, especially in the summertime when they bump into one another in the garden. But for the most part, they keep to themselves. 
 ''I don't think anyone's opposed to hanging out,'' says Kaya Williams, a 23-year-old research assistant at the Vera Institute of Justice, who pays $850 for a very spacious bedroom in the same building. ''Everyone's just got different schedules.'' 
 Mr. Sweeney agrees. ''We're often just ships passing in the night,'' he said.
 In some larger buildings, sharing does not always lead to caring. Clayton Harley, 25, has about 30 neighbors, but knows only a handful of them. His space is small and his floors are linoleum, but he pays only $900 for a place in Chelsea. To him, the important part is being able to live by himself in Manhattan -- even though he shares one and a half bathrooms with five people.
 ''I have no problem with the shared bathroom except for the shower,'' Mr. Harley said in an e-mail message. ''As clean as it gets, it's still a shared shower and the shower for me is a hallowed place of clean, which just isn't possible in this situation.''
 Chris Wisniewski pays $700 a month for a classic loft in Williamsburg with high ceilings, skylights and sweeping views of the East River. He has a roommate and a shower. But he also has a climb -- a hike up seven flights of stairs -- and he and his roommate share a toilet with the rotating occupants of two other apartments. 
 ''I don't leave my razor here anymore,'' said Mr. Wisniewski, 29, standing in a large bathroom full of natural light and potted plants. ''I found gray stubble on it. So anything that requires high levels of sanitation, I keep in my own space.'' 
 Mr. Wisniewski, a philosophy student and bartender, has a brown beard.
 ''The idea of sharing a toilet is very, very common until some time in the mid-20th century,'' said Prof. Andrew S. Dolkart, the director of the historic preservation program at Columbia. 
 Mr. Dolkart said that in the first half of the 20th century, a lot of single-family homes were converted into rooming houses. Many of those places, he pointed out, were illegal. (Many still are.)
 ''Putting kitchens and bathrooms into studio apartments was a considerable investment,'' Mr. Dolkart said. ''Just using bathrooms and kitchens that were already there, it wasn't.'' Many building owners decided to forgo conversions to apartments, especially in poorer neighborhoods where the return on the investment would be lower. 
 Today, landlords are eager to reconfigure rooming houses and single-room-occupancy dwellings into fully equipped private apartments. 
 ''S.R.O. landlords are always trying to convert their building into something more lucrative,'' says Marti Weithman, the director of the West Side S.R.O. Law Project of Goddard Riverside Community Center. Converting is not, however, an easy process and requires undergoing some inspections by the city.
 ''The S.R.O. housing stock has been a staple for at least the last half century,'' she added. ''It's one of the last remaining permanent affordable housing stocks that exist in New York City.''
 Since many rooming houses are illegal, accurate counts are hard to come by. But according to the most recent numbers available from the Housing and Vacancy Survey in 2005, conducted by the Census Bureau, of New York City's two million total rental units, nearly 10,000 had no private toilet. About 9,300 had a shared kitchen. 
 There are some landlords, however, who see dorm-style apartments as a worthwhile business venture with real virtues for certain tenants.
 ''You don't have to worry about roommates not paying rent or chasing down utility companies,'' said one young landlord who rents dorm-style rooms on three floors of an old factory building in Williamsburg. He charges $750 to $1,300 per month. The other floors are made up of private lofts, art studios or rehearsal space for musicians. He asked that his name not be used because the building is not approved for all of its uses. 
 ''People who come live in this building are very much: 'I just moved to New York, I want to go out and do everything all the time. I didn't come here to cook dinner.' '' he said. ''They come in here,'' he added, standing in the kitchen, ''to reheat Chinese food.''
 But the arrangement is not for everyone, and plenty of people who look at his apartments leave quickly. 
 ''Even when you're really explicit when you're advertising it, people think, 'Oh, yeah, it's like a three-bedroom apartment,' '' he says. When they arrive, however, they find a very different animal. ''It's always kind of awkward because they don't want to insult us. But you can tell right away.'' 
 Many of the people who do decide to move in, he says, find more than just a good economic solution to a pricey town. 
 ''They come here and meet other young, creative people doing their things,'' he says. ''They end up hanging out together, maybe forming lasting friendships. And then they move on.''

HEADLINE: Wilpon's Losses in Fraud Case May Affect Mets

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Eric Dash and Jack Styczynski contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Fred Wilpon and Bernard L. Madoff grew up in the 1940s less than a dozen miles from each other in middle-class neighborhoods of New York City. Wilpon went on to become a wealthy real estate investor and the principal owner of the Mets, and Madoff one of the most successful traders on Wall Street.
 Madoff and Wilpon have had a close personal and financial relationship for more than two decades, and Wilpon entrusted Madoff with hundreds of millions of dollars to invest, according to several people with knowledge of their relationship. But Madoff's investment firm has collapsed in what federal authorities are describing as a $50 billion Ponzi scheme, and questions are being raised about whether the fraud could harm the Mets' status as a big-payroll franchise. 
 Bob DuPuy, the president and chief operating officer of Major League Baseball, said Saturday that he and Commissioner Bud Selig had spoken with Wilpon on Friday. DuPuy said that all three believed that the fraud case would have no effect on the Mets' operation. 
 But interviews Saturday with several people with knowledge of Wilpon's business dealings revealed concern about significant problems that Wilpon and the Mets could encounter because of the reported fraud. Although it is unclear how much money Wilpon may recoup, any significant financial loss by a team owner raises questions about how those losses may affect the franchise. 
 ''Any fraud that has been committed against Fred is something of deep distress to all of us and we feel very badly about the entire matter, but we all believe that this will not affect the team,'' DuPuy said in a telephone interview.
 Wilpon invested his own money and that of his investments firm, Sterling Equities, with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. That company had a long track record of strong and steady returns, but Madoff was arrested Thursday morning by federal agents at his apartment in Manhattan and later charged with securities fraud for operating what the authorities were portraying as the biggest Ponzi scheme in financial history. 
 DuPuy said that the Mets were a separate entity from Sterling Equities and Wilpon's other investments. 
 ''The Mets are completely self-sufficient, and we have confidence that none of the other investments will affect the team,'' DuPuy said. ''They have been one of our most successful franchises on and off the field, and they are going into a magnificent ballpark next spring, and we expect it to be business as usual.''
 Wilpon bought the Mets in 1980 in a partnership with Nelson Doubleday and became the team's principal owner in 2002, when he bought Doubleday's share of the team. The losses that Wilpon has sustained as a result of the Madoff fraud case could hamper his ability to pay back debt related to that buyout.
 The losses could also hurt Wilpon's ability to help the Mets weather the current economic downturn. Many sports leagues, including Major League Baseball, are bracing for lower revenue next season as consumers cut back on discretionary spending. 
 Perhaps most troubling is the possibility that losses incurred by Sterling Equities could put pressure on Wilpon to raise money by selling other assets. Because Sterling invested money directly with Madoff, Wilpon may have to come up with money to reimburse some of his own investors for losses. That may cause him to sell valuable assets, including a portion of his ownership in the Mets.
 This year, Forbes magazine estimated the value of the Mets to be $824 million, making it the second-most valuable baseball franchise, behind only the Yankees. 
 After Wilpon became the Mets' principal owner, the team had several down years. In recent years, Wilpon has made a concerted effort to put a more competitive team on the field. The payroll has surged as the team started its own television network, SportsNet New York, which broadcasts Mets games. 
 In 2008, the Mets had the second-highest payroll in baseball. Despite the current economy, the Mets have planned to keep their payroll at the same level in 2009. This week, the Mets signed Francisco Rodriguez to a three-year, $37 million contract to be the team's new closer.
 One person who has worked directly with Wilpon said that Wilpon and Saul Katz, the president of the Mets, who is a co-founder and president of Sterling Equities, were very close with Madoff. 
 ''They were more than just business associates; they were friends and there was an enormous amount of trust,'' the person said.
 That friendship may or may not end up being something that Mets fans regret.

HEADLINE: A Faltering Economy Is Felt Even on the Beach

BYLINE: By MATT HIGGINS

DATELINE: SUNSET BEACH, Hawaii 

 BODY:
When it comes to the effects of a recession on the surf industry, the metaphors sometimes come in waves.
 ''I feel that the economic crunch is a little bit like a tsunami coming across the sea,'' said Wayne Bartholomew, the president of the Association of Surfing Professionals. ''I don't believe the full impact is being felt yet.''
 Randy Rarick, the executive director of the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing, taking place on the North Shore of Oahu this week, said: ''I have a little saying, 'The stock market is down; surf is up.' No matter what, you don't have a paycheck coming in, you're not doing anything, you can still go out and catch a wave.'' 
 Such sentiments reflect a common mix of fear, loathing and fatalism as the conclusion of the competitive surfing season at the Pipeline Masters on Oahu collides with the holiday shopping season. 
 As with forecasting waves, it is difficult to predict what will happen in 2009 for those who derive a livelihood from an $8 billion surf industry. Still, talking to athletes, sport organizers and market analysts provides a sense that some of the gains from recent years will be wiped out.
 Most famously, stocks have fallen recently for Quiksilver, the surf industry's largest manufacturer, and Pacific Sunwear, its largest retailer. Shares of Quiksilver stock traded at $1.53 at Friday's closing. Pacific Sunwear's shares are down more than 80 percent this year; earlier this week, the president of the company's PacSun division resigned.
 Such bad news has tended to skew the sense that the surf market is going down the tubes, said Dick Baker, the chairman of the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association.
 ''You can find good spots of business in the surf industry,'' he said. ''I would argue it's more of a function of consumer spending than it is surf becoming more dramatically affected by this, or going out of fashion.''
 Marie Case, the managing director of Board-Trac, a board-sports market research company, said her company forecast 3.3 billion purchases by surfers in 2008. That is down from a high of 4.1 billion in 2003. But Case says an economic downturn is only part of the reason for declining purchases by surfers.
 ''This is an aging market,'' Case said, owing to diminished birth rates 12 to 16 years ago.
 There were 2.4 million surfers in the United States in 2007, according to Case, up from two million in 2004. But more than 50 percent are older than 25. In 2007, the average surfer was 29, which has hurt surf retail.
 ''The 25-plus market, they don't buy as many T-shirts or pairs of sandals,'' Case said.
 Whatever the causes, the effects have shaken some industry veterans.
 ''In 35 years of being in business, I've never seen it so bad here,'' said Rarick, who is also a surfboard shaper on the North Shore. ''I'm like, 'Whoa, there's definitely going to be some shakeout here.' ''
 ''You're not even seeing it yet,'' Rarick said. ''It's just starting to be felt.''
 Action Sports Retailer is a trade show held three times a year in Southern California at which surf shop operators meet with industry brands.
 Andy Tompkins, the group show director of the events, said the recession would probably mean slightly smaller attendance in 2009.
 ''There are definitely some specialty shops that are going out of business,'' he said. ''Very often, these are independently operated.''
 And as the retail business affects the bottom lines of the surf apparel brands -- Quiksilver, Billabong and Rip Curl -- there will be an impact on the 11-stop ASP World Tour and the surfers who compete on it.
 None of the events, which cost about $2 million each to produce, have been canceled for 2009.
 ''I'm being cautious,'' Bartholomew said. ''I'm anticipating some support will fall through.''
 For athletes, there have already been signs of diminishing support. 
 ''It's had a huge effect already, from individual sponsorships to the amount of support all the surf companies can offer us,'' said Taj Burrow, who is ranked third on the world tour and is sponsored by Billabong. 
 The surfers who are not ranked in the top 10 will be the most vulnerable.
 But that is not to suggest that the life of a professional surfer is not a charmed existence. For many who do not watch CNN, life is still a beach, according to Strider Wasilewski, the team manager for Quiksilver Americas.
 ''A lot of these guys live in their own reality, which they have created -- which is a good one,'' he said. ''Most of these guys don't even know there's a recession.''

HEADLINE: Blank Check for Banks, Pink Slips for Detroit

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
HERE in Bailout Nation, you'll be surprised to learn, some of us are more equal than others. 
 Witness the Congressional back of the hand delivered last Thursday to Detroit automakers. Chrysler and General Motors were asking for $14 billion to see them through the end of the year; the Senate said no. 
 Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who leads the Senate Republicans, opposed the rescue. ''None of us want to see them go down, but very few of us had anything to do with the dilemma that they have created for themselves,'' he said. ''We simply cannot ask the American taxpayer to subsidize failure.'' 
 That's a new concept -- not asking the taxpayer to subsidize failure. Is that not what we just did with the banks, to the tune of $700 billion, 50 times what the beleaguered carmakers asked for?
 Moreover, in the bank rescue, taxpayers are subsidizing not only failure but also outright recklessness and greed. In spite of the fact that financial institutions drove the nation into the economic ditch, and even though ''very few of us had anything to do with the dilemma that they have created for themselves,'' the financial industry received billions, with few strings attached. 
 Complaints about bailing out high-earning autoworkers are another fascinating disconnect. The supposedly exorbitant autoworker wages that get everybody so riled up pale in comparison with the riches of Wall Street. 
 Neither were the banks required, as Detroit would have been, to get rid of their private jets or supply Treasury with in-depth restructuring plans in exchange for bailout funds. 
 This is not to argue that handing money over to troubled carmakers is a good idea or without peril. (On Friday, Treasury said it would move to prevent carmaker failures until Congress reconvenes and deals with the mess.) 
 Rather it is to remind everyone the degree to which the banks have been blessed with a no-questions-asked bailout that will almost certainly generate tremendous taxpayer losses down the road.
 YES, of course, banks are different from you and me and Chrysler and G.M. Because lending makes the world go 'round, banks need to be healthy and well-capitalized. 
 But the Troubled Asset Relief Program is open to banks that are both well and sickly. And nobody overseeing the program seems eager to ensure that its funds go only to those institutions that will survive and be able to pay back the taxpayer.
 ''Why is it that each of the carmakers needed a specific plan in hand to share in $14 billion while most of the banks only needed a large hat in hand to share $700 billion?'' asked Brian Foley, a compensation consultant in White Plains. ''I don't have a sense of transparency, that there are visible accountability criteria being applied to TARP. If banks want to tidy up their balance sheets, they can go right ahead.'' 
 As of Dec. 5, Treasury had allocated a total of $335 billion to TARP and disbursed $195 billion to institutions under its various parts.
 Testifying before Congress last Wednesday, Neel Kashkari, the youthful former Goldman Sachs executive whom the Treasury Department has charged with overseeing ''financial stability,'' defended the $700 billion federal triage package intended to get our banks lending again. 
 The plan's achievements so far, according to Mr. Kashkari: ''First, we did not allow the financial system to collapse. That is the most direct important information. Second, the system is fundamentally more stable than it was.'' 
 Maybe so. But an audit of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, released last week by the Government Accountability Office, suggests that the program's holes are many. 
 For example, the G.A.O. said, Treasury has no way to determine if the program is achieving its goals of increased lending by banks. There also seems to be no monitoring of the banks' compliance with TARP limits on executive compensation, the G.A.O. added. 
 Treasury should take nine actions to ensure the integrity of the TARP, according to the G.A.O. Many relate to keeping its operations transparent, managing conflicts of interest and hiring enough staff members to ensure that the program's goals are met. 
 While these recommendations all have merit, there is one important item missing from the TARP to-do list: Hire tough-minded bank analysts to help determine which institutions are best positioned to use TARP funds in a way that will benefit their shareholders and the taxpayers at the same time. 
 Such a team could help prevent Treasury from throwing good money after bad. 
 According to the G.A.O., as of Nov. 21, about 48 employees were assigned to TARP. Only five are permanent staffers; the rest come from other Treasury offices, federal agencies, and organizations providing temporary help. 
 What is needed is a small army of TARP analysts -- a lot of former bankers are out of work, by the way -- to conduct a worst-case analysis of the banks' assets and capital cushion. In private equity circles, this is called a ''burndown analysis.''
 Such an assessment typically involves extremely harsh loss estimates for every loan category in Year 1 and higher-than-average loss estimates for loans in Years 2 and 3, the elimination of dividend payments, and a valuation of the bank's prospects based primarily on its deposits -- not its loan portfolio. 
 The essential questions are these: What are the bank's assets really worth, how much can it earn and how much capital would the bank need to operate profitably? 
 Bankers will object, of course. They want to keep their rosy scenarios intact for as long as they can. But such a see-no-evil approach has been central to the slow-motion nature of this train wreck. Now that the government is dispensing dollars, it is time for misplaced optimism over asset values to disappear. 
 Private investors looking to put money into beleaguered banks are running precisely these types of analyses. Why shouldn't the officials who have opened the taxpayer spigot for the banks do the same?

It finally rolls up to the party in its G8 sedan -- with a big snorting engine under the hood, herds of leather in the cabin and a keg in the trunk -- only to find the festivities are over. The last drunk has staggered out. The pool is being skimmed. It's too much, too late.
Back in the halcyon days of 2002, General Motors had a plan for Pontiac. The division, tarnished by three decades spent selling restyled Chevys, would transform itself into the American version of BMW, building rear-drive performance cars without the high German prices. The G8 would be the flagship, and its role was to make such a notion seem not quite so preposterous.
But today, with G.M.'s future in doubt, the G8 power-slides into unknown terrain. Some people at G.M. say this midsize sedan is the future face of a Pontiac unit that will be downsized and refocused. Some say the G8 is doomed to die in 2013, or that its V-8 engine will be swapped for a less thirsty turbocharged 4-cylinder. Others, including tight-fisted members of Congress, insist that G.M. could never make a car this good in the first place. 
So, ''Mad Max'' fans, the G8 may be the last of the V-8 interceptors. How fitting that it is built in Australia. The G8, which supplants the Grand Prix, was engineered Down Under, where the same basic car is the Holden Commodore.
The G8 is sold in two versions -- the base model (with a 3.6-liter V-6) and GT (6-liter V-8) -- with a super-high-performance GXP scheduled to go on sale by February. A fourth version with a pickup bed called the Sport Truck may or may not arrive next fall. (Aussies love these car-truck combos, which they call ''utes.'') Mere talk about the trucklet has restored a lustrous sheen to the feathered '70s hairstyles of those who loved the Chevy El Camino.
At $28,875, the base G8 is a fine automobile, though light on power (256 horses) and heavy on weight (3,885 pounds) compared with a comparably set-up Nissan Maxima or Mazda 6.
Yet the base car suffers no visual slights. It has the same flared fenders and 18-inch wheels as the GT. It rides on the same impressive suspension, with struts in front and four links in the rear.
Mainly, though, the base model exists to remind you that for an extra $3,365 you could have had the GT. It offers two extra cylinders and 105 more horses, plus another gear in the transmission, larger disc brakes and a six-CD changer with MP3 playback.
To opt for the V-6 and not the V-8 is to squander a basic American freedom -- to buy the biggest, most powerful car available. And even if supersizing seems like a liberty the nation can no longer afford, in this instance logic sides with extravagance. The V-8's cylinder-deactivation system pulls the GT's economy rating up to 15 miles a gallon in town and 24 on the highway, almost on par with 17/25 for the base car.
Indeed, the GT is where the action is. This car is a class-jumper, a $32,240 four-door with the power and grace to hang with luxury-sport titans like BMW's 5 Series.
Anyone who's driven a Pontiac in the last 30 years might read that sentence and think that G.M. piped nitrous oxide into my test car. But the comparison is defensible. Despite the yawning cultural chasm between Australia and Germany -- in Oz, the sound of breaking glass is the unofficial national anthem; in Deutschland, littering is rarer than Miller Lite -- the two nations have the sort of curving, open road systems that breed fantastically cohesive rear-drive cars.
And that is exactly what we have in the G8. Setting the tone is a cabin whose studied relationship among steering wheel, seat and pedals make it easy to find the optimal driving position.
The interior is all black and silver, and the controls are of seriously high quality. The back seat is as amply proportioned as the front, with a wide pass-through for large items like snowboards. My one complaint is that too-thick windshield pillars make it hard to see through corners.
I know this because I was constantly seeking curves through which to toss this car. Pitched hard into a turn, the big Pontiac claws through the corner. It won't wallow or pitch or track wide of the intended line.
The G8 is similar to a great stereo system in that it's defined at low volume levels, yet able to be cranked up without distortion. No matter the speed, the steering returns the same measured response as the throttle pedal, as the braking system, as the body motions. Other cars this harmonious are usually found in German showrooms.
Like a BMW or Mercedes, the Pontiac is a heavy machine that feels stout and energetic rather than cumbersome. This is due primarily to its 50-50 front-rear weight distribution and its stiff structure, which frees up the chassis to absorb bumps rather than to mitigate body flex.
The powertrain gets the rest of the credit. The V-8 puts out 361 horsepower and has a torque plateau as big as Ayers Rock. Its output flows through a 6-speed manumatic transmission and a limited-slip differential that helps the rear tires bite the pavement.
I was also able to spend some time in a preproduction 2010-model GXP. Because I'm a conscientious, well-trained consumer, this more powerful, almost visually identical car immediately made me forget the GT that I had, up to then, raved about.
Lest anyone forget that Pontiac pretty much invented the muscle car (with the 1964 GTO), the GXP is a reminder. Forty-six model years later, the formula still works: put an oversize engine in a salaryman's sedan. Performance meets stealth.
But the GXP can do things no '60s-era muscle car could -- like turn and stop. It brings refinement in equal proportion to its aggressiveness.
If the GT is a half-price BMW 550i, then the $37,000 GXP is an M5 for hard times. Its Corvette-derived 6.2-liter V-8 speaks Wookiee, grinds out 415 horsepower and mates to an available, fluidly shifting 6-speed manual. This engine clips more than half a second off the GT's 5.3-second time in the 0-to-60 m.p.h. run. G.M. says it will do the sprint in 4.7 seconds.
Though its pulse is quicker, the GXP has the same integrity as the GT. Pontiac added 14-inch Brembo brakes up front and it upgraded up the suspension. Both cars feel finished, resolved.
The G8s are an accomplished family of sport sedans, the kind of cars that make Pontiac's old ''We build excitement'' ads something more than ironic fodder. They also make a convincing claim to a niche that Detroit has largely left unfilled since the '60s -- the sporting, affordable, rear-drive midsize sedan.
It's a pity that America isn't in the market for a sharp-looking V-8-powered anything right now. Personally, I hope someone will invent a time machine within the next week or two and have the good sense to set the controls for the year 2000.

HEADLINE: Nascar's Sponsors, Hit by Sticker Shock

BYLINE: By SUSANNA HAMNER

 BODY:
AT the Indianapolis Motor Speedway last July, the parking lot was filled with excited Nascar fans chugging beer, roasting pigs and exchanging drivers' statistics. 
 But in an office inside the racetrack, the scene was far from celebratory. Executives of the Big Three Detroit automakers told Brian France, the Nascar chief executive and chairman, that they planned to cut their investments in the sport sharply in the 2009 racing season. 
 Since then, Chevrolet has said it is cutting back on advertising and sponsorship deals with 12 tracks. Ford is trimming Nascar spending by 20 percent, and Chrysler by 30 percent. 
 The economic crisis is hitting industries around the globe, and the pain is beginning to filter down into professional sports. Many sports may face smaller crowds and shrinking player salaries, with, of course, exceptions for stars like the Yankees pitcher C. C. Sabathia. 
 General Motors said in September that it wouldn't buy any advertising time for the Super Bowl in February; earlier this year, it withdrew Cadillac's sponsorship of the Masters golf tournament. It has also terminated its $7 million-a-year endorsement deal with Tiger Woods. 
 The National Basketball Association and the National Football League recently announced staff layoffs, and the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants and Jets of the N.F.L. are still trying to find companies willing to pay to put their names on stadiums under construction. Honda said recently that it was dropping out of Formula One and selling its team. 
 ''The economic crisis is going to hit all sports. Every team should operate under the worst-case-scenario assumption,'' says Michael E. Rapkoch, founder of Sports Value Consulting, based in Dallas. ''Many sponsors' contracts that are up for renewal this year or next probably won't be renewed. For the long-term contracts, I won't be surprised if they try to get out of them through bankruptcy or some other way.'' 
 Nascar, which relies on corporate sponsorships more than other sports, is particularly vulnerable. In the 2008 racing season, 400 companies put up more than $1.5 billion to sponsor races, cars and drivers. About a third of that was provided by auto companies, which are now struggling with the economic downturn, if not possible bankruptcy. 
 Automakers aren't the only ones pulling out. Longtime sponsors -- including Kodak, Texaco and Domino's Pizza -- are abandoning Nascar. Even Craftsman, the Sears brand that has been the title sponsor of the truck series since it started in 1995, is cutting its ties.
 And this summer, Chip Ganassi Racing shut down the team of Dario Franchitti, the 2007 winner of the Indianapolis 500, after being unable to find a sponsor for his car following his switch to Nascar.
 ''Many of the major sponsors pulling back have been involved in our sport for decades,'' Mr. France says. ''They're making cuts, and we're affected.''
 It's a big comedown for Nascar, which has had sizzling growth over the past decade. A multibillion-dollar TV deal in 2001 helped propel it from a regional sport that drew most of its revenue from sales of tickets and merchandise into a popular franchise with a national following. 
 Its top-level Sprint Cup series of 36 races draws an average of 7.8 million television viewers a race, making Nascar the second-most-watched sport, behind professional football. It can attract crowds -- more than 200,000 for the Daytona 500 and Talladega -- that exceed those for a Super Bowl, a World Series game and an N.B.A. finals game combined. Over all, Nascar sanctions more than 1,200 races at 100 tracks in the United States and abroad.
 This year, revenue was approximately $3 billion, a 50 percent increase from 2001. That's better than the N.F.L., the N.B.A. and the National Hockey League in the same period. Only Major League Baseball grew faster. ''If you go back to 1998, there is no question Nascar has shown the biggest growth,'' says David Broughton, research director of SportsBusiness Journal.
 But the sport will not see those kinds of impressive numbers next season. 
 TV viewership has slipped in the past year or so, and so has attendance. The truck series' official sponsor is now Camping World, the largest retailer of recreational vehicle equipment. Nascar gave the retailer a substantial discount: Camping World will pay approximately $2 million a year, half of what Craftsman is estimated to have paid. While it is gaining as well as losing sponsors, Nascar expects its take from title sponsorships to drop 20 percent next year, to about $150 million. 
 ''We told them what we could afford,'' says Marcus Lemonis, chief executive of Camping World. ''They were very sensitive to us and offered an appropriate price for the market conditions.''
 This kind of cost-cutting has forced the three separate entities of the sport -- teams, racetracks and the privately held Nascar company -- to lay off about 600 employees. Storied teams with revered family names like Dale Earnhardt Inc. and Petty Enterprises have no choice but to merge with other teams. Some teams unable to land a season's worth of sponsors, like Doug Yates and the Wood Brothers, can afford to participate in only a handful of races. 
 The boom years made drivers a little spoiled, with many flying in private planes and riding in luxury motor coaches, says the longtime racer Jeff Burton. But, he added, ''this is our wake-up call.''
 BRIAN FRANCE, the Nascar chairman, was not born in a car, but he might as well have been. His grandfather, Bill France Sr., known as Big Bill, founded Nascar in 1948. His father, Bill Jr., who took over in 1972, built the sport into a behemoth.
 Bill Jr. took Brian to races when he was still in diapers. At 14, Brian shocked fans when he marched down the stairs of a race control tower to announce to the press that the driver Donnie Allison was the winner of that day's race, seconds after his father had flagged Richard Petty the champion. After poring over the scorecards for several hours, officials ruled the teenager correct.
 When Brian France began his first season as chairman and chief executive in February 2004, he faced many doubters inside and outside the sport. Fans viewed him as a Hollywood elitist who couldn't relate to them, the polar opposite of his father, a ''good old boy'' who would hang out with drivers on the track.
 But the number of skeptics dwindled after Mr. France, 46, transformed a sport once fueled by moonshine and bravado into a technologically sophisticated entertainment juggernaut.
 DirecTV and Sirius Satellite Radio have channels that allow fans to watch or hear a race from the vantage point of a single driver. Fans can follow a race on their computers through TrackPass RaceView on Nascar.com, using an advanced 3-D feature that lets them track a car or change the perspective. At the track, Sprint FanView is a next-generation scanner offering live audio and video, as well as real-time stats. And Sprint Cup Mobile lets fans listen to the radio broadcast over the phone.
 In 2007, Mr. France persuaded Toyota to compete in the Nationwide Series and the Sprint Cup. The move to bring in a big-spending foreign competitor was controversial at the time, but it could help Nascar weather the economic storm now that the Detroit Big Three are pulling back so many dollars.
 Perhaps Mr. France's greatest achievement occurred, when, as executive vice president, he persuaded track owners to consolidate their broadcast rights in 2001, striking a six-year, $2.4 billion deal with Fox and NBC. Viewers across the country could see the sport every week. In 2005, Mr. France reached a $4.48 billion, eight-year TV deal with ABC-ESPN, Fox, the Speed Channel and TNT.
 Intent on keeping his sport blazing hot, he took a risk that may be contributing to the sport's current woes. Determined to make Nascar mainstream, he promoted it in a way that may have alienated some of his core fans, industry experts say. 
 Rustic racetracks have been replaced with stadiums filled with skyboxes for the wealthy and corporate sponsors. The tough, good-old-boy personalities of the drivers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt have shifted to the clean-cut, movie-star-handsome images of drivers like Jimmie Johnson and Carl Edwards. In 2003 the legendary Winston Cup Series title was bought out by Nextel, now Sprint Nextel, ending 32 years of the tobacco brand's sponsorship. 
 ''Brian comes across as somebody who wants to be known as a great C.E.O., like a Paul Tagliabue or a David Stern,'' says David Poole, a journalist and co-author of ''Nascar Essential: Everything You Need to Know to Be a Real Fan.'' ''He wants to talk about the sport's marketing successes. The sport needs leadership in that area, but among those who live with grease under their fingernails, that goes over poorly.'' Perhaps that's why, this year, Nascar announced an effort to go back to its roots, including allowing drivers to express themselves.
 Yet, to keep the sport growing, Mr. France needed to garner a wider audience in different demographic groups. More than half of Nascar fans earn less than $50,000 a year. As the economy worsens, many fans could have a hard time justifying plopping down $92, on average, each race weekend. 
 Mr. France's most radical change to the sport -- the ''Car of Tomorrow'' -- has backfired. Concerned with safety, Mr. France in 2000 required all teams to start developing vehicles with such strict safety standards that drivers could survive crashes that would once have been fatal. He required that all teams drive such models exclusively by this year. 
 The move to create safer vehicles gained momentum when Dale Earnhardt, father of Dale Earnhardt Jr., was bumped while rounding the final turn at the Daytona 500 in February, 2001; he slammed into a wall and was killed.
 The Car of Tomorrow was also intended to cut costs and level the playing field financially by requiring all teams to drive variations of the same car. But since its introduction last year, the car has pushed up costs just when revenue has been going down. 
 Tracks have different lengths, grades, shapes and layouts; in the past, large teams had about 20 cars that were used for varying conditions. But the gradual introduction of the new car forced teams to maintain old fleets and crews on top of new ones.
 Mr. France acknowledges that costs have risen for some teams, but says that the new car should save teams substantial money in the long run.
 The worst problem, though, is that the Car of Tomorrow has made sponsors feel that their cars are indistinguishable. In the past, a Nascar Dodge did not look much like a Dodge on the street, but fans wouldn't mistake it for a Ford Fusion. Now the cars look identical. Jimmie Johnson's Chevy looks the same as Carl Edwards's Ford, Kasey Kahne's Dodge and Brian Vickers's Toyota. 
 Car manufacturers say they are exploring ways to make their race cars look more like models in dealer showrooms. 
 WHEN the 2009 season starts in February, there are likely to be more empty seats in the stands, fewer cars on the tracks, blank spots on cars where logos used to flash, and smaller crews in the pits. Even Toyota is cutting its Nascar budget by 10 to 20 percent.
 To avert a collapse of the sport, analysts say, Nascar must push through sweeping changes to its business model, like reducing sponsorship rates, cutting back the number of races and trimming the distances of some of them. For example, a handful of premier races would run the traditional 400 or 500 miles, but the rest would become 200- or 300-mile events. 
 Some analysts say Nascar should take cues from the N.F.L. and explore placing sponsor dollars in an official pool, with each team receiving an equal share. They also suggest a salary cap.
 Mr. France has announced that there will be no preseason and in-season testing at its tracks next year, saving teams an estimated $1 million a car. He is also toying with the idea of cutting back the number of team members who can come to the races, which would save each team an additional $500,000.
 In hindsight, Mr. France's broadcast deal, which brings in about $500 million a year, may be the main thing that saves Nascar from ruin. 
 ''We've got to work hard and be willing to sacrifice,'' says Jeff Burton, the driver. ''We're going to definitely struggle next year and the following.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 21, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about corporate sponsorships of Nascar racing misstated the role of Craftsman, the Sears brand. Although Craftsman is leaving Nascar's truck series as a title sponsor in 2009, it remains Nascar's official tools brand.
 The article also referred incorrectly to layoffs in Nascar racing. Although teams and racetracks have laid off some employees, Nascar, the sanctioning body, has not.

HEADLINE: Detroit's Small Packages Arrived, and Left, Early

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
WHEN a steep recession struck the United States 50 years ago, automakers were caught unaware. Car sales plunged in 1958, and the national unemployment rate was 6.8 percent. At a time when Americans were tightening their belts and looking for practical, economical automobiles, all Detroit had to offer were pricey, ostentatious behemoths.
That may sound similar to Detroit's situation today. Yet the seeds of the Big Three's current problems were laid in the late 1950s, when the lack of small American cars opened the door to the first large wave of imports, particularly the Volkswagen Beetle. 
There was a reason, though, that the Big Three had failed to produce small cars before the 1958-59 recession. A decade earlier, smaller American automakers had tried, and largely failed, to make successful compacts.
The generally accepted explanation for the failure of these Detroit compacts is that nobody cared about fuel economy or small cars.
But they also failed because they had the bad luck of being produced by chronically undercapitalized independent automakers. These compacts were not particularly thrifty, had no distinctive engineering features and rather than being stylish but sensible, they were simply cheap and frumpy. Not surprisingly, they failed to entice Americans. Detroit's abandonment of the entry-level car market to foreign makes started in the early 1950s.
Other than the toylike Crosley, the only new small American cars immediately after the war were business coupes. They had short wheelbases, tiny greenhouses and, instead of a back seat, a space where items like salesmen's sample cases could be stored.
The Chrysler Corporation was particularly enamored of the style and produced business coupes across the Plymouth, Dodge and Chrysler lines. Many were spartan strippers. Lack of equipment and a shorter wheelbase helped to keep the weight below 3,000 pounds. With 6-cylinder engines, they got slightly better fuel economy than a standard American sedan of the time, but most were simply warmed-over prewar cars.
Henry J. Kaiser, the industrialist known for building the Liberty ships of World War II, introduced one of the first postwar American compacts. In an ominous precursor of possible things to come, the United States government had a hand in the specifications of the new Kaiser compact, modestly named the Henry J. Because the development of the car had been financed with a government loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the agency specified that the car must sell for no more than $1,300.
To meet that price, the base Henry J, introduced in 1951, was built without such niceties as a trunk lid, armrests, passenger-side sun visor, glovebox or flow-through ventilation. The standard engine was a tractorlike 4-cylinder, though a 6 was available.
Stylistically, the car was odd and hunchbacked. It had a disproportionately large greenhouse with a short wheelbase and short overhangs. To emphasize the appliancelike nature of the Henry J, a version of the car called the Allstate was briefly sold through Sears and featured in its catalog.
Although it reeked of cheap, the Henry J wasn't particularly cheap to build, and it sold for just a little less than the least expensive versions of standard sedans from the Big Three. The sales volume that Kaiser had counted on to make a profit never came, and the Henry J died after the 1954 model year.
Another unsuccessful experiment was the Hudson Jet of 1953. By then, Hudson had become an innovator with unibody automobiles and the first step-down design that lowered a car's center of gravity. Lacking the money to revamp its regular car line, Hudson decided to create a compact.
The designers had wanted to do a small car that was even sleeker than the striking Hudson Hornet sedan. But meddling by a prominent Chicago dealer and by the company president, A. E. Barit, resulted in a design that looked like a squashed, very skinny, very tall 1952 Oldsmobile.
In contrast to the Henry J, the 6-cylinder engine in the Hudson at least had adequate power. Advertisements boasted that ''mighty power and matchless roadability'' had come to the low-price field. The problem was, the price wasn't so low. Although the little Jet was well equipped and a decent performer, it actually cost more than some full-size cars. This, combined with the bland styling and comically high profile ended up spelling the end of not just the Jet, but of Hudson as an independent company.
Yet another also-ran compact was the Willys Aero models of 1952-54. An altogether better effort than either the Jet or Henry J, the Aero was actually pretty, but it still suffered from the same problems as its compact competitors: the customer simply didn't save enough to justify the compromise of a smaller car.
Nash seemed to be the only American manufacturer to get the compact formula right. The styling of its Rambler was fresh, distinctive and attractive. The cars were well equipped and priced sensibly. But the most important factor that contributed to the original Rambler's run in 1950-55 was that there was a full line of Ramblers in many body styles, including a jaunty convertible.
Nash merged with Hudson in 1954 and became American Motors. That company brought back the same basic Rambler in 1958, giving it a facelift and calling it the Rambler American. The car survived largely unchanged until the American was redesigned for 1964.
Nash, along with Hudson, even sold the tiny Metropolitan -- made by the Austin Motor Company in England -- whose upside-down-bathtub styling mimicked the larger Ramblers in a way that can be described as appallingly cute.
Bob Lichty, a Canton, Ohio, dealer of collector cars, said: ''Few of the early compacts like the Henry J and Nash Rambler stay around my showroom very long, and none are particularly expensive. A great Henry J might do midteens.''
But it's the Metropolitan that has the largest following. ''Women especially just go nuts for them,'' he said. ''I've had people who weren't even looking for a collector car take one look at them and decide they have to have one.''

HEADLINE: Watch Out for Risk in the Middle of the Road

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
INVESTORS rarely brag about their individual bond holdings, but they are certainly complaining about them now. 
 Many middle-of-the-road bond mutual funds that seemed to promise stable returns in a difficult market have recently taken gut-wrenching plunges. These funds, as well as managed accounts run under the same principles, have turned out to be much more volatile and risk-laden than investors generally understood. 
 ''I'm terrified,'' said Phyllis Minkoff, 83, of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., who holds three bond funds that have had large losses. ''I have those funds and some annuities, and thank God for Social Security. I worry, but I live in hope.'' 
 Fixed-income strategies that embraced risk have been severely punished of late. Many investors have been unpleasantly surprised by sharp declines in fixed-income portfolios marketed as core holdings -- deemed appropriate for retirees or investors seeking to buffer their stocks with bonds. 
 ''These people feel we let them down, and I'm sorry,'' said Daniel J. Fuss, 74, the vice chairman of Loomis Sayles, the investment firm, and the manager of several funds with outstanding long-term records but dismal recent performance. The Managers Bond fund, an investment-grade, intermediate-term bond fund, for example, was down 20.4 percent this year through Thursday.
 His funds' prospectuses contain warnings about risk. Still, he said, ''We didn't do a good enough job explaining that these funds could be this volatile, especially for investors in our investment-grade funds.'' 
 He tried to enhance performance by reducing holdings of Treasuries -- the only financial asset that has rallied in recent months -- and by increasing bets on specific securities that seemed underpriced. His picks included Lehman Brothers, whose collapse set off financial shock waves that have not yet abated. While emphasizing overlooked securities has paid off through the years, he said his choices have been unfortunate over the last year or so. ''I was wrong,'' said Mr. Fuss, who invests heavily in his own funds. ''I'm a humble man.'' 
 This strategy -- overweighting specific bonds and classes of bonds that seem to be underpriced -- has worked for skilled managers for decades but is risky now. Stephen A. Walsh, chief investment officer of Western Asset Management, the fixed-income subsidiary of Legg Mason, and one of the biggest bond managers in the United States, said he had learned this to his chagrin. 
 Losses in his firm's core portfolios have been so painful that they would require a ''paradigm shift,'' he said, if ''the conditions of the last 15 months'' were to continue much longer. 
 By next summer, he said, if ''Treasuries continue to be the best-performing asset class, then we're going to be living in a world of hurt.'' He remains hopeful that a degree of normality will return reasonably soon, and he is sticking with his basic approach, at least for now.
 Mr. Walsh's fixed-income funds held Lehman securities, as well as those of Bear Stearns, GMAC and Ford Motor Credit, and broad categories like mortgage-backed securities, leading to ''challenging'' losses, he said.
 The funds' literature warns of risk, but Mr. Walsh acknowledged that many investors were shocked that the funds could decline so much. ''In this storm, we haven't provided our investors with a good anchor to windward,'' he said. 
 If the financial and economic turmoil continues for an extended period, he said, it would mandate ''a rethinking of the paradigm that we've operated under all these years, that core bond funds, focused on investment-grade bonds, are a good diversifier for a portfolio.'' This approach should be sound, he said, in a healthier climate. 
 While Western Asset Management has an excellent long-term record, its bond funds have performed dismally in the market downturn, according to a broad analysis of bond mutual fund data conducted by Morningstar for Sunday Business. Five bond funds run by Western performed in the lowest quartile of their categories in the 12 months through October, after being in the top quartile over the previous five years. 
 Four of those five offerings are intermediate-term bond funds stressing investment-grade securities that were often viewed as core holdings for people seeking to buffer their portfolios. The funds only added to investors' agony, with losses this year through Thursday from 12.1 percent for Legg Mason Partners Core to 30.9 percent for Legg Mason Investment Grade Prime. 
 BY contrast, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 40.5 percent through Thursday, the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond index, a broad bond market gauge, which includes a substantial proportion of Treasury bonds, was up 3.3 percent. Funds that mirror the index or emphasize Treasuries have held their own. 
 The Morningstar analysis also showed that seven of Mr. Fuss's funds plummeted over the last year or so and underperformed compared with their peers after five years in the top quartile of their fund categories. 
 Among these seven funds -- most of them multisector funds that have often taken contrarian positions -- two of them, Managers and Loomis Sayles Investment Grade, are marketed as core holdings. Managers is listed as a ''fund pick'' by Fidelity. Alexei Maravel, a Fidelity spokesman, said its inclusion resulted from ''a purely quantitative screening process for ranking and sorting funds'' and ''does not represent any kind of qualitative recommendation.'' This year through Thursday, Investment Grade was down 15.7 percent. 
 What happened to these funds? Mr. Fuss says he has thought deeply about it. ''After an experience like this, you go back and re-examine what you were doing,'' he said. ''You ask yourself, did you do the wrong thing?'' he said, and quickly answered: ''Yes. Was the decision process right? Yes. Did it lead to the wrong conclusion? Yes, it did. That's the tough part.''
 He believes that the financial system has behaved irrationally, and says he misread the political tea leaves, expecting, for example, that Lehman would not be allowed to fail.
 Some of his holdings, like the Lehman securities, are simply losses. But broad areas of the bond market remain ''phenomenally undervalued,'' he said, and are likely to come back in a major rally, while the vogue for Treasuries is likely to reverse. He said he had no idea when this might happen, but that in the meantime, ''we're being very prudent.''
 For his part, Mr. Walsh said, ''If you can get yourself to think a bit longer term, to next year perhaps, when risk aversion abates, then corporate bonds and even stocks may start to look very good.'' 
 For now, many investors hope they can hang on long enough to see this rebound. ''I grew up in a depression,'' said Mrs. Minkoff, who has two children and four grandchildren. ''I hope I don't wind up my life in a depression.''

HEADLINE: THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Higher Globalization, The

BYLINE: By SCOTT L. MALCOMSON

 BODY:
Until earlier this year, globalization was expected to make government steadily less important. Private flows of goods, capital and services made states seem puny things. Elected officials were thought to have less and less discretion when it came to making economic decisions. The International Monetary Fund, which offers a helping hand to states facing financial peril, saw its annual meetings become lonely affairs. Editorials in the financial press wondered if the fund had a mission left. 
 The financial crisis tipped all this over in a hurry. As with security after 9/11, government came roaring back. Market-oriented central bankers in the developed economies suddenly began, in effect, nationalizing banks. The I.M.F. went from broken to heroic, brokering rescue packages for Pakistan, Iceland, Hungary and Ukraine. The Western championing of free markets came in for a good deal of ridicule from states that had resisted the end-of-government enthusiasm of globalizers. Globalization, far from burying the state, now depended on states for rescue.
 But not just any states. Those states that had accumulated large pools of cash -- often, indeed, as a hedge against vulnerability to the capital mobility characteristic of globalization -- now looked both wise and newly powerful. The petro-states, as well as Singapore and other Asian states, above all China, are having their day, despite being threatened themselves by recession. In October, the U.S. Treasury department deputy secretary Robert Kimmitt traveled to the Persian Gulf seeking investment in the United States; his trip overlapped with that of Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown, who was trawling for a cash infusion for the I.M.F.'s international bailout fund. Most of the cash-rich countries have state-dominated economies, a point gleefully emphasized by China earlier this month when the head of its sovereign wealth fund said it would cease investing in Western banks because Western states don't give sufficiently clear economic guidance.
 Globalization was not supposed to depend on handouts from the state. But whatever form globalization takes next, it will not be despite governments but because of them -- and a rather unexpected and unpredictable group of governments at that.

HEADLINE: Arts Groups Tightening Schedules And Belts

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

 BODY:
THE Carolyn Dorfman Dance Company of Union is rethinking its spring gala, looking at ways to simplify its biggest fund-raising event to lower ticket prices and attract more potential supporters.
In Moorestown, the Perkins Center for the Arts held its first major fund-raiser in five years this fall. A multidisciplinary center, it is adding more low-priced classes to its winter roster, and holding off on a $3 million capital campaign to fully renovate its satellite facility in Collingswood.
And in Montclair, Luna Stage has canceled one of its Main Stage productions for this season, ''After Adam,'' by Christina Ham, a budgetary decision deemed necessary as the 16-year-old company faces the cost of moving to a new location next year.
''It's a question of being fiscally responsible,'' said Jane Mandel, the company's artistic director, about the decision to cut the upcoming play. ''We need to survive.'' 
Across New Jersey, arts organizations are girding themselves for what is expected to be one of the worst cycles in recent memory, for support and for patronage. Following a 12 percent reduction in state funding this year, arts groups are expecting even bigger cuts next year as the state faces an estimated $5 billion deficit. Support from foundations and corporations is also down, as these traditional sources of funding also feel the squeeze of a severely contracted economy. Finally, individuals have become increasingly reluctant to fill out donor pledges, or buy subscriptions to their local theaters.
''Organizations are looking at worst-case scenarios to plan for the tough times ahead,'' said Steven R. Runk, executive director of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, which supports nearly 800 arts organizations. ''Arts groups tend to carry out these extravagant missions without a lot of resources to begin with. So when you're looking at losing 10, 20 percent, it begins to hit hard.''
Based on the historic patterns of previous economic downturns, James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, predicted that the first signs of economic recovery would not come until sometime between March 2010 and February 2011.
That doesn't bode well for the arts, which some consider a luxury.
''If the governor is cutting state employees and asking state workers to give up their raises, arts funding is going to be difficult to justify,'' Dr. Hughes said.
The level of state funding for the arts will not be known until early next year, when Gov. Jon S. Corzine issues his preliminary budget. But many in the art world expressed fears that this round could be even worse than in 2003, when Gov. James E. McGreevey tried to eliminate the state arts council altogether.
In some ways, that fight set the stage for what could be the arts' saving grace this time. For one thing, arts groups say they learned to organize effectively, getting their message out through rallies in Trenton, audience appeals and mass mailings. Second, the solution found by the State Legislature in 2003 was a new hotel-motel tax, 40 percent of which is dedicated to funding the state's arts, tourism and historic sites. The legislation established that the annual contribution to the arts could not fall below $16 million, the amount paid to the arts council the first year the law took effect. If it did, the hotel tax would be discontinued -- an unlikely scenario.
Under that formula, the arts council is banking on at least $16 million in funding for the 2010 fiscal year, which begins on July 1, 2009, But that minimum would still represent a 16 percent drop from the $19.2 million the agency was granted this year. And the 12 percent reduction in the state's arts funding this year has already left New Jersey among the 15 percent of states across the country with the most significant cuts to the arts, according to Angela Han, director of research at the National Assembly of Arts Agencies. Some have been hit harder: Florida reduced its arts funding 45 percent this year.
The coming fiscal year represents the start of another three-year cycle for the 140 arts groups receiving general operating grants from the state. Organizations will be required to submit detailed analyses of their budgets and needs; depending on that information, some could be dropped from the state's coffers.
''People are preparing for the crisis ahead, looking at their budgets line by line, asking themselves, what's critical that we need to do, and what can be put on the back burner,'' said John McEwen, executive director of the New Jersey Theater Alliance.
With reduced corporate donations and slower ticket sales this fall, McCarter Theater in Princeton is putting together contingency plans for next year, which include co-producing more plays with other theaters, applying for a line of credit, and looking at ways to cut costs, a process that is somewhat tricky, according to Kathleen Nolan, its interim managing director.
''You have to keep your eye clearly focused on your core, the heart and soul of your institution,'' she said. ''There may be better ways to do a mailing, and you may not need to go to that conference, but you leave the art alone.''
Foundations that have long supported the arts are also finding their resources drying up. David Grant, president of the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation in Morristown, said its assets are down 20 percent to 25 percent from last year. In 2008, the foundation, the largest private supporter of the arts in New Jersey, gave out $4.5 million in grants to 94 arts organizations, and $1 million toward arts education. Mr. Grant said he expected Dodge's grant-making capacity to shrink by at least 15 percent in the coming year.
''We're asking each other: How do we look at next year with diminished resources, the same ambition and greater need?'' Mr. Grant said. ''We could make across-the-board cuts, but I think we're going to have to be much more strategic than that.''
As more and more companies change hands, file for bankruptcy or shutter their doors, corporate donations are another area of concern.
''You might have had two or three donors in the past that are now merged into one, and you don't know what types of programs they now want to support,'' Mr. McEwen said. ''It might have been arts in the past, but now it's energy or education.''
So with these institutional resources becoming less dependable, arts organizations are increasingly turning toward individuals, both as donors and patrons. As is, between personal donations and ticket sales, individuals account for about 80 percent of arts organizations' revenue, Mr. McEwen said.
There are some bright spots. After being threatened with closing last year, the Paper Mill Playhouse got a major boost in June when the Millburn Township Committee voted to buy its land and buildings and lease them back to the theater. The theater's institutional and individual donations have increased in recent weeks, said Mark W. Jones, its executive director. He attributes that to the fact that it began this season out of debt for the first time in many years.
''People who have the means to weather the storm are sympathetic to our needs,'' Mr. Jones said. ''As long as you're spending your money properly, they're willing to step forward.''
At the Newark Museum, attendance in the past three months is up 50 percent over the same period last year, according to Mary Sue Sweeney Price, the director, who says people are more likely to visit local attractions when money is tight. She expects even better turnout next year when the museum celebrates its 100th anniversary.
''This will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to talk about Newark and the museum,'' Mrs. Price said. ''We hope we can appeal to the public and institutions that this anniversary is a worthwhile and justifiable cause.''
Other arts organizations are also making a more concerted effort to reach out to the public. The cocktail party and auction held in late October by the Perkins Center for the Arts netted $18,000, and more of these events are planned for next year, according to Diane Felcyn, the assistant director. The center has also doubled its annual appeal mailing, which will now reach 1,000 people. At the McCarter Theater, board members are making personal phone calls to thank any new contributors, even those donating just $10.
The arts community is also readying its defensive position. The advocacy group ArtPride New Jersey has been surveying audiences at 25 arts sites this fall to update its 2000 study, which found that the arts put back $1.5 billion into the state's economy each year. Ann Marie Miller, the organization's executive director, who said it had become necessary to update the survey, predicted, ''We'll have good news to deliver.''
Still, Ms. Miller is a realist when it comes to the health of the state's arts community.
''There's always fallout in an economic downturn, so it would be foolish to think we're not going to lose some groups,'' she said. ''But the organizations that are well managed and have loyal audiences -- they'll survive.''

HEADLINE: A Year of Tumult For REITs

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
A MAIN benefit for those who own real estate investment trusts has been their low historical correlation to the rest of the financial markets. In other words, REITs have tended not to move in tandem with most stocks and bonds, thus making them good portfolio diversifiers.
All of that seemed to change this year amid the deepening credit crisis and Wall Street's meltdown. Just as stocks fell fast and furiously, so, too, did most REIT shares. (And at those times when stocks were rallying back, REITs also moved higher.)
The REIT market is now poised to end 2008 with big losses. This year through Thursday, the index of equity REITs, which own commercial property and constitute the bulk of the market, was down 49.16 percent according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. (Losses for mortgage REITs, which originate loans and invest in mortgage-backed securities, averaged 42.16 percent.) The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has skidded 40.1 percent so far in 2008.
REIT shares, meanwhile, are trading at deep discounts to the value of the assets they hold -- which may lead some investors to wonder whether now is the time to start buying again. 
According to estimates last week by Green Street Advisors, a research firm that tracks real estate securities, REITs are trading at about a 30 percent discount to net asset value, on average. That number is similar to the level in late 1990, but considerably higher than it was last month, when the discount reached an unprecedented 47 percent.
But Mike Kirby, the director of research for Green Street, issued a caution about the numbers, noting that it was harder than usual to establish a REIT's net asset value, which represents what a company would fetch for the properties it owns if it sold them today.
''Real estate transactions have dried up, so there are no recent comparisons,'' he said. ''They're based on a guess right now.''
This has been a second consecutive year of losses for REITs -- in 2007, they fell nearly 16 percent. The declines show a continued reversal of fortunes for an asset class that not long ago was considered a darling of Wall Street.
Previously, REITs outperformed the overall stock market for several years, providing average annualized returns of 23.6 percent from November 1999 through January 2007, according to the REIT association. ''It just seems like everything has been pulled down,'' said Greg Sukenik, a senior analyst covering the REIT market for Zacks Investment Research, describing the current investment climate.
Gun-shy investors, it seemed, saw little difference in stocks or REITs; some remain reluctant to put their money into anything these days.
Brad Case, vice president for research and industry information at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, agreed that REITs have been moving more in lock step with the rest of the financial markets, but says that this has been only a recent change.
He described the 2008 performance of REITs as akin to having two separate markets.
''The first nine months were largely a normal market,'' he said, noting that equity REITs actually gained 6.6 percent from the end of February through September. But by end of November, he said, the market was down 58 percent from its peak in January 2007.
All REIT property types have been hit hard. This year through Thursday, the industrial sector was down a staggering 81.11 percent; lodging and resorts dropped 66.57 percent; and regional shopping malls were off 66.34 percent. The best performer -- that is, the sector with the smallest losses -- was self-storage, down 14.59 percent.
A DRIVING force behind the market's dismal performance has been rising debt levels in many REITs. ''They took advantage of all the cheap credit that was once available and overextended themselves, often buying overvalued properties using excessive leverage,'' said Joel R. Bloomer, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, the market research company.
But as the debt comes due, some of these companies face potential headaches. Refinancing may be tricky under the tight credit environment, just as raising money through equity offerings would be during a bear market. At the same time, REITs have been contending with falling real estate values, so selling property to raise capital may also be hard.
More than ever, investors are paying closer attention to REIT balance sheets, in addition to management experience. ''You want companies with good cash flow,'' Mr. Sukenik said.
To help conserve cash, or because profits are falling, some REITs have trimmed back dividends -- the one feature that makes their shares especially attractive to income-seeking investors. REITs are required to disburse at least 90 percent of their taxable income to shareholders, in exchange for favorable tax treatment. (Many REITs typically distribute more than 90 percent, according to the trade group.)
Paul E. Adornato, a senior REIT analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said that nearly a quarter of the 99 equity REITs covered by his firm have cut or suspended dividends, with most of those changes occurring in the last two months. They include companies in a wide range of sectors -- among them General Growth Properties, which focuses on shopping centers; Felcor Lodging, hotels; ProLogis Trust, warehouses; and Post Properties, apartments.
Mr. Sukenik of Zacks Investment said, ''Companies that pose the highest risk have high near-term debt maturities, constrained liquidity, and problems covering the dividend.''
Yet he and other analysts still see a few bright spots, not to mention value from the market's precipitous drop.
On many analysts' list of favorites is Public Storage Inc., which operates self-storage centers nationwide and is the reason, some say, for the sector's comparatively better performance.
''What's unique about Public Storage is that it has no debt -- they have a fair amount of preferred stock but no debt,'' Mr. Kirby said. ''The best REITs out there are not going to be deploying capital over the next year but preserving all the capital they can.''
For that reason, Mr. Sukenik favors the so-called blue-chip REITs ''with geographic diversification and plenty of balance-sheet flexibility who can better withstand the expected economic downturn, which will continue well into 2009.''
In particular, he likes Equity Residential Properties Trust, which he called a bellwether apartment REIT, in part because it has a healthy cash reserve and available line of credit.
''We think apartments will perform better than other sectors, particularly retail and office, in 2009 due to the continued housing slowdown which creates a larger pool of renters,'' he added.
Mr. Adornato, meanwhile, preferred AvalonBay Communities, which develops and manages luxury apartments, mainly on the East and West Coasts, and Douglas Emmett Inc., which owns apartments, along with office space, in California and Hawaii.
''They operate in high-barrier-to-entry markets,'' he said, where there are often obstacles to construction, like strict zoning limitations or community resistance to new developments.
Mr. Sukenik was also positive about the health care sector, which holds properties like hospitals and medical office buildings. ''People still spend money on health care, even in this environment,'' he noted.
Among his choices was HCP Inc., which he says ''has done a successful job of delivering after heavy acquisition activity in 2007.'' In addition, he said, ''the company has about $1.5 billion of cash and credit availability.''
While Mr. Bloomer of Morningstar said he had a negative outlook on the entire REIT market, he did prefer some companies over others in certain sectors -- like the AMB Property Corporation over ProLogis.
''Here are two very similar companies where management went down two different paths -- ProLogis took full advantage of loose credit and borrowed and bought at a rapid pace, but AMB didn't,'' he said. ''Yet its stock has sold off nearly as much as ProLogis.''

HEADLINE: Necessary Medicine?

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama placed a heavy bet last week that the recession-wracked country he is about to inherit has finally reached its tipping point on health care.
 It might seem counterintuitive to gamble that political and economic forces would converge at such a low point after more than half a century of failure. The Treasury has never been so overcommitted, and providing ''affordable, accessible health care for every single American,'' as Mr. Obama describes his goal, would require substantial resources up front.
 But Mr. Obama, like others, sees political opportunity in the country's economic distress, and he threw in last week with those who argue that the financial crisis has only made it more imperative to remake the health delivery system -- that, in fact, economic recovery depends on it. 
 In nominating the former Senate leader, Thomas A. Daschle, as both director of a new White House office of health reform and secretary of health and human services, Mr. Obama made explicit that the reeling economy had not softened his commitment. The issue had been crystallized, he said, by the plight of American automakers, who assert that health care expenses add anywhere from $1,100 to $1,500 to the price of a car. 
 ''Year after year, our leaders offer up detailed health plans with great fanfare and promise, only to see them fail, derailed by Washington politics and influence peddling,'' Mr. Obama said at Thursday's news conference in Chicago. ''This simply cannot continue. The runaway cost of health care is punishing families and businesses across our country.''
 With that sense of the battle-scarred history of health care politics, Mr. Obama began a careful campaign to frame the issue more as a pocketbook concern than a moral one. Given that four of five Americans are dissatisfied with health costs, while only 15 percent lack insurance, strategists have argued since the Clinton health care debacle of the 1990s that success would depend on persuading the vast middle of its economic self-interest. 
 It was no accident that Mr. Obama emphasized that reducing costs would be ''the starting point'' of his efforts.
 With health insurance premiums rising this decade at four times the rate of inflation, and draining a growing share of personal income, middle-class support for an overhaul would seem to be reaching critical mass. If a broad swath of Americans feel destabilized enough by health costs, their demands for relief could help marginalize the kind of opposition from entrenched interests that has killed previous efforts.
 ''Most Americans are troubled by the lack of universal insurance, but what really frightens them is the prospect that their own insurance won't protect their health or family finances,'' said Jacob S. Hacker, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley and an authority on health care. ''That's a fear that more and more Americans are facing as health costs skyrocket and job security plummets.''
 Mr. Obama seems to recognize that the recession, with its devastating job losses, affords him the potential to accelerate public opinion. To broaden support for his plan -- whatever it ends up being -- he insisted last week that systematic improvements in health care would be essential to any lasting economic recovery. 
 ''It's not something that we can sort of put off because we're in an emergency,'' he said. ''This is part of the emergency.''
 Mr. Obama said his health plan would be ''intimately woven into'' his administration's economic blueprint. And he directly confronted those who might ask how the country could afford a major expansion of health coverage in times of shrinking revenues and burgeoning deficits. ''I ask a different question,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I ask how can we afford not to?'' 
 Indeed, the economic consequences of the system's inadequacies have come into stark relief with the economy's deterioration. Rarely have they been felt so directly by such a broad spectrum of people. 
 Researchers at Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families estimate that 4.1 million people lost their employer-sponsored insurance over the last year, and that two million of them remain uninsured. Across the country, the chronically ill report they are deferring care and splitting pills because they can no longer afford out-of-pocket costs.
 Employers are being pushed to the brink, from general stores to General Motors, which reportedly spends more per car on health care than on steel. States are facing unsustainable increases in demand for public insurance programs and are cutting benefits, eligibility levels and provider payments in order to balance budgets.
 ''The case for action has been compelling for a long time, but getting our political system to act requires a widespread sense of crisis and broad resolve among political leaders,'' Mr. Hacker said. ''In fostering that sense of crisis and that resolve, the current severe downturn has been hugely important.'' 
 There has been pressure from Congressional Democrats for Mr. Obama to stand strong on health care, with influential committee chairmen like Senators Max Baucus of Montana and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts making it an unwavering priority. They are ready to take up legislation early next year, a task made easier by Mr. Obama's plea for immediate action and by tentative encouragement from business, labor and provider groups. 
 Those interested parties may retreat once details make clear whose ox will be gored. Well-financed health insurers and business groups waged a brutally successful campaign against the Clinton health care plan, and doctors and hospitals have done much the same in state legislatures.
 There is a rough consensus, certainly among the Democrats who control both houses, around many key components of the Obama plan -- to expand government subsidization of insurance for the poor, to stimulate competition through a new government plan, to require insurers to accept those with pre-existing medical problems and to invest in computerization, prevention and payment incentives for better care. 
 Less certain, of course, is how to pay for it. During the campaign, Mr. Obama said he would get about half of the necessary total, estimated at more than $100 billion a year, by raising taxes on those making more than $250,000. The rest was to come from savings generated by various efficiencies (their value is a matter of considerable dispute).
 Mr. Obama reaffirmed on Thursday that his proposal to roll back the Bush tax cuts might be deferred because of the recession. ''We're probably going to have to, then, find additional dollars to pay for some investments in the short term,'' he said, adding that he wants his health plan to pay for itself over a decade. 
 Some of those dollars may be found by packaging health care initiatives as stimulus measures, a recessionary opportunity presented by the public's acceptance of deficit spending to spur the economy. What, after all, is $100 billion for health coverage if the government can print $700 billion to bail out the banks? 
 The Obama transition and leaders in Congress are negotiating a massive stimulus package that could include $40 billion in health care spending over two years. Among the likely beneficiaries would be state Medicaid programs and computerized health records, both of which Mr. Obama had vowed to expand long before the recession. 
 Jonathan B. Oberlander, who teaches health politics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said recessionary pressures had raised the chances for change from nil to possible. The question, he said, is whether Mr. Obama and Mr. Daschle can harness the new urgency and marginalize the opposition that will inevitably emerge.
 ''The history of health reform is replete with instances of reformers believing this time it's inevitable,'' Mr. Oberlander said. ''Those prior tipping points all turned out to be mirages.''

HEADLINE: Cuban Leader in Venezuela To Build Ties With Chavez

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
President Raul Castro of Cuba arrived here on Saturday on his first official foreign visit since assuming power two years ago from his ailing brother, Fidel. The decision to visit Caracas first highlights Cuba's continuing reliance on subsidized oil and other forms of aid from Venezuela. 
 The visit is an opportunity for President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela to burnish his revolutionary credentials. He has vowed to strengthen ties with Cuba's new leadership despite cultivating a much warmer relationship with Fidel, who is 82 and living in seclusion. 
 ''I bring a salute to all the Venezuelan people, an embrace from the Cuban people and the chief of the revolution, Fidel Castro,'' Raul Castro said after arriving here.
 Mr. Castro, 77,and Mr. Chavez discussed a range of cooperation projects in areas like agriculture, education, medicine and athletic training that are supported by thousands of Cuban advisers operating in Venezuela. The two leaders signed an agreement opening the way for Venezuela to continue assisting Cuba inincreasing its oil-refining capacity and to eventually build a plant in Cubato import liquid natural gas.
 Cuba is by far the largest beneficiary of Venezuela's foreign aid, receiving, for instance, more than $150 million to build a petrochemical complex in Cienfuegos on Cuba's southern coast. But with oil prices plunging recently, the financing for some of Venezuela's foreign aid projects has come into question. Cuba's government may also be worried about possible disruptions in subsidized oil exports, which were cut early in the this decade during an oil strike here. 
 Given that uncertainty, Mr. Castro has also been trying to deepen ties with other trading partners like China and Brazil. 
 Indeed, before Mr. Castro's visit to Caracas was announced this month, Cuba's government had said that he was planning to go to Brazil for a meeting of Latin American and Caribbean countries convened by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil. 
 After stopping in Caracas, Mr. Castro is still expected to travel to Brazil in the coming days, raising the prospect of stronger relations with Brazil and, perhaps, even of a potential option for back-channel dialogue with the coming Obama administration. 
 The government of Mr. da Silva, a former leftist labor organizer, has expressed a strong desire to strengthen relations with both Havana, which Mr. da Silva has visited twice in the past year, and Washington. 
 ''The U.S. approach to Cuba will unfreeze with Obama,'' said Christopher Sabatini, senior director of policy at the Americas Society, a policy organization in New York focusing on Latin America. ''Lula has both the international cred and the ideological cred to be an interlocutor in this process.''
 Cuba's potential in developing alternative forms of energy also figures high on Brazil's efforts to cultivate warmer ties with Cuba, with Brazilian sugar and ethanol producers seeking to interest Cuba in Brazilian ethanol technology and investment, possibly as a way to circumvent an American tariff on imports of Brazilian ethanol if Washington's embargo is altered. 
 ''The Brazilians are taking a long-term view on Cuba as an entry point into the Caribbean and even the United States,'' said Jorge R. Pinon, an energy fellow at the University of Miami. ''As for the Cubans, they are still recovering from the shock of losing the Soviet lifeline, so they want an insurance policy in case of changes in relations with Venezuela,'' he said. ''The Cubans are getting their ducks in a row.'' 
 But while Brazil has emerged as Cuba's second-largest trading partner in Latin America, its influence in Cuba is still dwarfed by that of Venezuela, whose subsidized oil exports to Cuba were valued at $3.01 billion this year through November, according to a new study by the Center for Hemispheric Policy at the University of Miami. 
 Moreover, Venezuela is also financing another refinery expansion in Santiago in eastern Cuba, a project that, combined with the upgrade of the oil and petrochemical complex in Cienfuegos, could put Cuba on the road to becoming a potential regional oil-refining center. 
 Cuba's recent announcement that its offshore oil reserves could hold as much as 20 million barrels has also set off fierce speculation in energy markets over whether the estimate was accurate and, if so, how that petroleum would eventually be commercially explored. 
 For now, the American embargo on trade with Cuba has limited the ability of American oil companies and foreign oil companies with large operations in the United States from striking deals to produce oil in Cuban waters or offer the Cuban government energy services in the form of drilling or geological work. 
 But that framework for dealing with Cuba could change, explaining why Mr. Castro has welcomed the Venezuelan investments in Cuba's refineries and has reached out to oil-exporting countries like Russia, Angola and Brazil, which is increasing its own oil production after a series of huge offshore oil discoveries. 
 ''We already have extensive oil dealings with a monarchy in Saudi Arabia, a failed state in Nigeria and Venezuela, which is Cuba's top patron,'' said Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, an expert on Cuba's energy industry at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. ''Why should Cuba, which is relatively stable and close to our major ports and refineries, be an exception?''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 21, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Cuba's economic relations with Venezuela misstated, in some editions, the recently estimated size of Cuba's offshore oil reserves, which have aroused speculation that Cuba, with Venezuelan help in building refineries, may become a regional oil-refining center. The reserves contain as many as 20 billion barrels, not 20 million.

HEADLINE: The Novel That Predicted Portland

BYLINE: By SCOTT TIMBERG

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
 SOMETIMES a book, or an idea, can be obscure and widely influential at the same time. That's the case with ''Ecotopia,'' a 1970s cult novel, originally self-published by its author, Ernest Callenbach, that has seeped into the American groundwater without becoming well known.
 The novel, now being rediscovered, speaks to our ecological present: in the flush of a financial crisis, the Pacific Northwest secedes from the United States, and its citizens establish a sustainable economy, a cross between Scandinavian socialism and Northern California back-to-the-landism, with the custom -- years before the environmental writer Michael Pollan began his campaign -- to eat local.
 White bicycles sit in public places, to be borrowed at will. A creek runs down Market Street in San Francisco. Strange receptacles called ''recycle bins'' sit on trains, along with ''hanging ferns and small plants.'' A female president, more Hillary Clinton than Sarah Palin, rules this nation, from Northern California up through Oregon and Washington. 
 '' 'Ecotopia' became almost immediately absorbed into the popular culture,'' said Scott Slovic, a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and a pioneer of the growing literature-and-the-environment movement. ''You hear people talking about the idea of Ecotopia, or about the Northwest as Ecotopia. But a lot of them don't know where the term came from.''
 In the '70s, the book, with a blurb from Ralph Nader, was a hit, selling 400,000 or so copies in the United States, and more worldwide. But by the raging '80s, the novel, along with the Whole Earth Catalog, seemed like a good candidate for a '70s time capsule -- a dusty curio without much lasting impact. 
 Yet today, ''Ecotopia'' is increasingly assigned in college courses on the environment, sociology and urban planning, and its cult following has begun to reach an unlikely readership: Mr. Callenbach, who lives in Berkeley, Calif., and calls himself a ''fringe, '60s person,'' has been finding himself invited to speak at many small religious colleges. This month, the book's publisher, Bantam, is reissuing it.
 ''For a while it seemed sort of antique to people,'' said Mr. Callenbach, a balding and eerily fit man of 79, sitting in his backyard, which he was converting into a preserve for native plants. ''They said the book is 'very Berkeley' and all that. But now that you go out into America and young society, it apparently doesn't seem that weird to them at all.''
 When he began working on his novel, Mr. Callenbach was a middle-aged editor of science books at the University of California Press. His marriage was crumbling, and he despaired over what he saw as an endangered environment. He spent three years writing the book, sending each chapter to scientists to make sure the science held up. Then the real work began.
 ''It was rejected by every significant publisher in New York,'' Mr. Callenbach said. ''Some said it didn't have enough sex and violence, or that they couldn't tell if it were a novel or a tract. Somebody said the ecology trend was over. This was New York, circa 1974. I was on the point of burning it.''
 But he cobbled together money from friends -- ''I think they wrote me checks out of pity for my poor, about-to-be-divorced state'' -- and printed 2,500 copies. The first printing sold, as did the next, and after an excerpt in Harper's Weekly, Bantam decided to publish ''Ecotopia.'' 
 The author now calls it ''a lucky little book.''
 But not a classic book, the kind taught along with Herman Melville in American literature classes. Set at what seems to be the turn of the 21st century, and told through the columns and diaries of a reporter from the fictional New York Times-Post, the novel is not especially literary. Its characters are flat; its prose -- well, call it utilitarian. And the plot, in which the narrator drops his skepticism and settles into Ecotopian life, thanks in part to a love interest, lacks sophistication. And yet the book has managed to find its place in the here and now. 
 Alan Weisman, author of last year's acclaimed ''The World Without Us,'' a nonfiction chronicle of the planet after the departure of the human race, said the book was ahead of its time. Environmental writing in the early '70s was not especially concerned with shortage and sustainability, he said. ''A lot of it was about preserving beautiful areas and beautiful species.'' 
 In fact, like other important environmental books, the novel's impact may be lasting. Writing has a special place in the environmental movement -- ''a literature with measurable effects,'' wrote Bill McKibben, in the introduction to ''American Earth: Environmental Writing Since Thoreau,'' a new anthology. John Muir's essays and books about the Sierra Nevada gave the country national parks, just as Bob Marshall's writings about forestry led to the Wilderness Act, which has protected millions of acres of federal land.
 So what has ''Ecotopia'' given us?
 A great deal, thinks Professor Slovic of the University of Nevada, including the bioregionalism movement, which considers each part of the country as having a distinct ecological character to be cultivated. The green movement's focus on local foods and products, and its emphasis on energy reduction also have roots in ''Ecotopia,'' he said. In fact, much of Portland, Ore., with its public transport, slow-growth planning and eat-local restaurants, can seem like Ecotopia made reality.
 ''People may look at it and say, 'These are familiar ideas,' '' Professor Slovic said, ''not even quite realizing that Callenbach launched much of our thinking about these things. We've absorbed it through osmosis.''
 Daniel Brayton, who teaches English and environmental literature at Middlebury College in Vermont, plans to teach ''Ecotopia'' in his utopian fiction class. He sees the book's genius as its ''big-picture environmental thinking,'' successfully predicting the big issues of today. ''Callenbach got that right,'' he said. ''He's looking at the total physical health of the social body.''
 ''Ecotopia'' has its critics. Feminists attacked it for its ritual war games, in which men don spears to work off their ''natural'' aggression, dragging women into the woods to celebrate. (Mr. Callenbach said he was influenced by the anthropologist Margaret Mead, and her idea that the sexes express aggression differently.) 
 Some were made uncomfortable by the way black people were excluded from Ecotopian society: most live in Soul City, which is less affluent and green than the rest of Mr. Callenbach's world. The author said he was reflecting black nationalist ideas of the time, as well as an early '70s skepticism about integration. ''I probably would write it quite differently at this point,'' he said.
 Mr. Brayton of Middlebury sees ''a deep conservatism to the book,'' where categories like race and gender are unalterable. ''In academia we call that essentialism.'' 
 Over the years, Mr. Callenbach's readership has changed, as hippies and New Agers have been joined by churchgoers. The author often visits St. Mary's College of California, a Catholic school near Oakland. ''Ecotopia'' is required freshman reading at the Presbyterian-affiliated Muskingum College in rural Ohio. And it's part of the curriculum at the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit institution.
 Mr. Callenbach hopes the book will resonate among the greening edges of an evangelical movement. But the novel's relatively free sex and liberal politics may limit that readership. Susanna Hecht, a professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, sees it as a counterpoint to Thoreau's more austere ''Walden.'' 
 '' 'Walden' is very Protestant,'' she said. ''This is pagan, with a Zen relationship to nature.'' 
 But to Mr. Callenbach and many of his fans, ''Ecotopia'' is a blueprint for the future.
 ''It is so hard to imagine anything fundamentally different from what we have now,'' he said. ''But without these alternate visions, we get stuck on dead center.''
 ''And we'd better get ready,'' he added. ''We need to know where we'd like to go.''

HEADLINE: To Build Confidence, Aim for Full Employment

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and co-founder and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
IN the current crisis, discussions of economic policy have often centered on uninspiring, short-term goals. To restore confidence in our economic future, we need appropriate, firm targets that will clearly put us where we want to be. 
 For example, President-elect Barack Obama has framed his economic stimulus package in terms of the number of jobs he will create. The goal is to add 2.5 million jobs, he says, by hiring people to improve our highways, fix up our schools and do other infrastructure work around the country. All of that is fine, but it does not represent a commitment to full employment -- providing a job for everyone who is willing to work. As a result, confidence remains abysmal.
 If the new president had a target of full employment, and if Americans believed that he could reach it, the confidence problem could be quickly solved. 
 The Great Depression provides an analogy. Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt had at least a vague idea that economic stimulus would help the situation, but even Roosevelt lacked clear targets for such policies during the New Deal. The economic stimulus applied was inconsistent and inadequate. Confidence waned, and the depression was longer and deeper than it needed to be. 
 People still remember aspects of that depression history. The Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps tackled infrastructure projects, much as Mr. Obama proposes -- but these New Deal programs were not enough to restore full employment. That history reduces the current credibility of Mr. Obama's target of 2.5 million jobs.
 On the other hand, there have been some worthwhile targets in monetary policy in recent years. A number of central banks have adopted firm inflation targets, which has helped to contain inflation expectations. Those expectations have tended to coincide roughly with the targets. 
 At the moment, of course, inflation is no longer the fundamental risk. Our current problems are deflation and recession -- possibly even depression -- and so we must rethink our targets.
 An immediate shift to a full employment target may not be possible, simply because there is no confidence right now that we can hit it. While people seem to believe that central banks can control inflation, there is little consensus that central banks can prevent a depression under circumstances like this.
 In a forthcoming book I've written with Professor George A. Akerlof of the University of California, Berkeley, we argue that current circumstances call for a couple of intermediate targets. If we can hit them, we may credibly be expected to hit the ultimate target of full employment -- and keep inflation at bay. The intermediate targets should be announced forcefully, with an immediate effort to achieve them.
 First, there should be an intermediate target for conventional fiscal and monetary policy, one ambitious enough to restore full employment in a typical recession. (Fiscal policy is the taxation and expenditure proposed by the president and voted by Congress; monetary policy is the province of the Federal Reserve Board.) 
 This target may be inadequate, however, because we are not in a typical recession. Conventional fiscal and monetary methods may fizzle, as they did in the 1990s in post-bubble Japan. After its stock market and real estate debacle early in the decade, the government of Japan moved its budget into deficit and brought interest rates down to zero. But the economy never entirely recovered, and in due course the government debt rose to 1.71 times the annual gross domestic product, versus a current multiple of 0.74 in the United States.
 Similarly, we just do not know whether these measures will work in this country. That is why we also need a second intermediate target, for credit. The ability to borrow should be restored to an appropriate level for a normal economy at full employment. 
 This is crucial because the most salient problem in our institutions is the drying up of credit. Without credit, companies that count on outside finance will go bankrupt, requiring an impossibly large fiscal and monetary policy stimulus to achieve full employment. 
 Furthermore, as long as the credit crisis continues, the economy's response to conventional fiscal and monetary policy may be drastically reduced. A person who cannot borrow, for example, is unlikely to buy a car, even if a generous fiscal policy has provided him with the needed down payment. Under the current circumstances, the Keynesian ''multiplier,'' the economy's response to fiscal policy, may be unusually low. Our best econometric models just won't tell us how low. 
 FOR months, the Fed has been working to expand credit, and has invented some good methods for doing so. On Nov. 25, it announced a smart method to jump-start credit, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, which would issue loans, using securities backed by newly issued consumer and small-business loans as collateral. The Fed has started paying interest on reserves to control the inflationary impact of such a policy.
 This plan and others like it are promising. But all the government loan programs announced so far represent only a tiny fraction of the $52 trillion of total credit market instruments outstanding. We will need to go much further and extend credit to households and businesses that would otherwise be ignored. 
 Along with fiscal and monetary policy, credit needs to be targeted on a scale that would get us out of our current economic mess. That's what Washington should do now.

HEADLINE: A Finger In The Dike

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
For the first time in human history, I agree with Dick Cheney. According to The Los Angeles Times, he warned Republican senators that if they refused to bail out the auto companies, ''we will be known as the party of Herbert Hoover forever.''
 The senators from the Herbert Hoover Party promptly fumbled, but President Bush seems poised to rescue the car companies anyway. Thank heaven! 
 Look, there are plenty of sound arguments against a bailout. But there's a practical argument that trumps everything: when conditions are so fragile, we can't risk a staggering blow to the national economy. When you see a hole in the dike, don't discuss the virtues of laissez-faire policies -- plug it!
 There were also sound arguments for not rescuing Lehman Brothers. So the government allowed Lehman to collapse -- and almost everybody now recognizes that it was a mistake that cost taxpayers more than a bailout would have.
 Lehman Brothers was small potatoes -- a tiny French fry -- compared with America's automakers. Lehman Brothers had 25,000 employees worldwide; General Motors alone has 250,000.
 The Big Three have almost 400,000 employees worldwide, including about 230,000 in the United States. In addition, several hundred thousand people make car parts for the Big Three, and a half-million more sell or distribute cars from them. All told, considerably more than one million jobs in the United States depend directly on the American automakers, and many more indirectly. 
 Let's look at the reasons cited for washing our hands of the auto companies:
 A rescue mucks up the dynamic of capitalism; governments shouldn't spend taxpayer dollars to reward failure. Thomas Murphy, the chairman of General Motors at the time of the 1979 Chrysler bailout, perhaps put it best: a bailout of Chrysler, he said then, would constitute ''a basic challenge to the philosophy of America.''
 In fact, the Chrysler bailout went ahead and worked pretty well. Jobs were saved, Chrysler retooled and came up with successful cars that included the first minivan, and the Treasury was repaid and made a profit on the bailout.
 We've already rewarded failure by bailing out the banking sector, because the alternative was worse. If the same is true again, and it's cheaper to rescue the car companies than clean up the mess afterward, wouldn't a rescue reflect a pragmatism that is precisely ''the philosophy of America''?
 The solution isn't a bailout, it's bankruptcy. If the car companies enter Chapter 11, they'll be able to rework burdensome contracts and actually make themselves competitive again. That's how the airlines recovered, and auto companies shouldn't be favored.
 Bankruptcy would be a gamble because we just don't know whether cars from bankrupt companies will still sell. I'll buy a $400 air ticket to fly on a bankrupt airline, because it'll still be honored in a month's time, but that doesn't mean I'll spend $30,000 on a car from a bankrupt company when I'm counting on its resale value in 10 years' time.
 While bankruptcy would help automakers extricate themselves from onerous contracts, the gap with foreign automakers isn't as wide as some believe. As my Times colleague David Leonhardt has noted, the reported $73-an-hour wage in Detroit is a fiction. Union workers at the Big Three get about $55 per hour in wages and benefits, compared with $45 per hour for nonunion workers at the American plants of Honda or Toyota. One reason for the gap is that the Detroit labor force is older, and health and other benefits are always more expensive for a 50-year-old worker than for one half that age. 
 A bailout is hopeless: This is a bridge loan to nowhere.
 Yes, the Obama administration will have to come back in January with a full rescue package. The package should focus on saving jobs, not stockholders or bondholders. Shareholders should lose most of their investments, bondholders should get a haircut, managers and board members should be ousted, autoworkers should have their pay and benefits trimmed to market levels, and taxpayers should get an equity stake that they could profit from.
 But saving the auto sector isn't hopeless. Car companies have made progress in recent years, as underscored by the Chevy Volt, a plug-in hybrid that can go 40 miles without using a drop of gas. (The catch is that if gas prices stay as low as they are now, consumers may instead be demanding gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s.) 
 Think of a bailout as part of the huge planned stimulus package. It's much cheaper to keep people in their existing jobs than to create new jobs elsewhere. 
 I lived in Tokyo in the 1990s, as perfectly reasonable arguments for government restraint led to acquiescence in the face of escalating economic disasters. Anyone who lived through Japan's ''lost decade'' understands that the risks of inaction are greater than the risks of action.

HEADLINE: Asian Leaders Focus on Growth At a 3-Nation Summit Meeting

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The leaders of China, Japan and South Korea on Saturday held their nations' first joint summit meeting, which had been intended to overcome political animosities but instead focused on a joint Asian response to the global economic crisis. 
 The one-day meeting in Dazaifu, Japan, ended with sweeping promises to turn Asia into an engine of growth, but offered few specifics. The three leaders -- Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China and President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea -- also discussed regional political issues like ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 The leaders promised new stimulus spending to increase domestic demand and pick up the slack in global growth left by the United States' slowdown. Japan and China also agreed to open lines of foreign currency credit to South Korea, whose economy has been hit hardest. 
 In a joint news conference after their meeting, the leaders said most of their discussion focused on overcoming financial troubles.
 Despite the lack of concrete results, the three-way summit meeting won wide attention in the region for being held at all. Despite their geographical proximity and shared cultural backgrounds, the three nations remain divided by often emotional disagreements over history and territory, as well as growing economic and technological rivalry.
 The meeting was originally planned months ago, before the turmoil in financial markets began in September, with the vague goals of building good will and establishing political dialogue. The nations' leaders have held three-way meetings in the past, but only on the sidelines of larger international conferences.
 In a joint statement, the leaders hailed the meeting as having built trust among the nations. They also pledged to increase economic links and expand social and cultural exchanges. 
 The leaders agreed to increase dialogue by holding three-way summit meetings regularly. The statement said the nations would hold a second one next year in China, and a third in South Korea.
 ''It is the first time historically for the three countries to hold an independent summit,'' Mr. Aso said. ''It is epoch-making progress for the leaders of the three countries to hold meetings regularly and strengthen ties.''
 Among the meeting's few concrete results were agreements by Japan and China to lend foreign currency to South Korea to shore up its currency, the won, which has dropped by a third against the dollar since the current crisis began. The agreements will expand what are known as currency swap deals in which the Korean central bank is allowed to borrow foreign currency from the other nations' central banks using won as collateral. Tokyo promised to make available the equivalent of $20 billion, while Beijing pledged $26 billion.

HEADLINE: Suburban Democrats Crave State Senate Clout

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
SEVEN Democratic state Senators got little public attention last year when they announced the formation of a Suburban Caucus, with Craig M. Johnson of Long Island as co-chairman. After all, the Democrats were the Senate's minority party, so the new group had little clout.
 But last month's elections, in which Democrats won control of the Senate for the first time in 43 years, have given the caucus a potentially pivotal role on behalf of suburbs across the state. First, however, the Democrats were trying to unify and settle a fight over the Senate leadership. 
 ''Now we're in the majority,'' Senator Johnson said in an interview. ''There's no doubt that our voice will be not only critical but loud within the Democratic conference.'' 
 The aftershocks of the election are still being felt on the Island. Local officials are warily watching Albany, especially on school aid. With the lame-duck Republican majority still in charge until Jan. 1, the Senate will reconvene on Monday, and on Tuesday Gov. David A. Paterson will propose his 2009 budget under the gloom of recession.
 The biggest casualty of the elections is the Island's highest-ranking senator, Dean G. Skelos, a Republican from Rockville Centre. In the new Senate, he faces demotion from majority leader to minority leader. Likewise, his six fellow Republican senators from Long Island are expected to lose their chairmanships of the committees on finance, health, the environment, higher education, consumer protection and corporations.
 In the campaign, Republicans warned that if they lost control of the Senate, the Island would suffer at the hands of a city-oriented Democratic Party. The Democrats dispute that.
 ''The politics are very simple: if you want to hold on to the Senate, you have to take care of Long Island,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a spokesman for the Democratic Senate transition team. ''We've got to prove we're going to fight for Long Island and the other suburbs and not be driven entirely by New York City.
 ''What the Democrats plan to do is cap property taxes, follow the Suozzi report'' and oversee Long Island Rail Road issues, Mr. Sheinkopf said. He was referring to a state panel on local government led by the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, that calls for changes in local government.
 Long Islanders have little cause to worry, said Eric Lane, a counsel to the Senate Democrats in the 1980s who is now a Hofstra University law professor. ''Long Island remains an important location, in the eyes of a Republican majority or a Democratic majority,'' he said. ''They can't afford to neglect such a large suburban bloc. If anything, the Democrats will try to win more seats on Long Island, so it may get even more attention.''
 Underscoring the potential sway of the Suburban Caucus is the bare majority that the Democrats won in the Senate, with 32 seats to 30 for the Republicans. The Republicans still hold seven of the nine Senate seats from Long Island.
 After the election, the Democrats immediately began wrangling over leadership posts. They finally negotiated a compact recently promoting Malcolm A. Smith of Queens from minority leader to Senate president and making a dissident, Pedro Espada Jr. of the Bronx, the majority leader. But a few days later that deal fell apart.
 Amid the leadership battle, the Island will be looking to Senator Johnson and his Democratic colleagues as their party struggles to balance the competing interests of New York City and its suburbs and upstate areas. When Brian X. Foley, the Democratic Brookhaven town supervisor who won a Senate seat in November, takes office next month, he will become the eighth member of the fledgling Suburban Caucus. Three others represent parts of Westchester, and three come from upstate. 
 Mr. Smith welcomed the birth of the caucus, Mr. Johnson said. ''When I got elected, I approached him with the concept, and he said, 'Absolutely,' '' Mr. Johnson said. ''He endorsed it, loved the idea.''
 The Democratic takeover of the Senate stemmed from political inroads on the Island. Mr. Johnson helped pave the way last year with an upset victory for the vacant Seventh District seat in northwestern Nassau. He became the Island's first Democratic senator in a century (excluding senators whose districts included parts of Queens).
 That breakthrough was followed by another last month, as Mr. Foley defeated the 36-year incumbent, Caesar Trunzo, in the Third District on Suffolk's South Shore. Yet another Democratic upset in Queens cemented the new majority.
 The slim Democratic majority makes the Johnson-Foley duo a potential swing vote by themselves. 
 ''They could become the Gang of Two and put Long Island on the map politically,'' said one local Republican senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of still-fluid leadership maneuvers and pending decisions on allocating staff and funds to the senators.
 Displaying his independence in March, Mr. Johnson publicly split with his party and joined the Island's Republicans senators at a rally to protest proposed school aid cuts. ''I broke with my conference to stand up for Long Island schools,'' he said. 
 Mr. Johnson said he was open to future cooperation with Republican colleagues from suburbia. Senator-elect Foley, who as Brookhaven supervisor has been dealing with a Republican Town Board, said he, too, welcomed bipartisan efforts.
 But the die-hard Republicans -- who bargained unsuccessfully with dissident Democrats in an attempt to keep Mr. Skelos in power as a coalition majority leader -- are nevertheless intent on regaining Senate control in 2010. That election is crucial because the federal census that year will be the basis for the next Legislature to redraw the boundaries of all Senate, Assembly and Congressional districts, affecting the political landscape for years to come.
 ''When you only have a two-vote margin, it's a very fragile majority,'' said Arthur J. Kremer, a former assemblyman from Nassau. ''For the Democrats, it's going to be like piloting a ship in a terrible storm.''

HEADLINE: Arts Groups Tightening Schedules And Belts

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

DATELINE: Palisades 

 BODY:
 WHEN Westchester arts advocates and their counterparts from elsewhere in the mid-Hudson region gathered here for a strategy session last month, the talk quickly turned to Gov. David A. Paterson's proposal to slash next year's state arts budget. The proposal, delivered a day before the session, was another body blow after a month in which the advocates watched both individual contributors and corporate sponsors sustain singularly large losses. 
 ''It's a stunning period, it's unprecedented,'' said Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council, which was named by the New York State Council on the Arts to lead the session. 
 Ms. Langsam knows whereof she speaks. She was deputy commissioner of cultural affairs for New York City during the 1970s, when the city almost went bankrupt. While the current economic crunch has parallels to that situation, ''New York City is New York City,'' she said. ''This is the world.'' 
 Heather A. Hitchens, executive director of the state arts council, said that she had never seen anything like this. 
 Before the downturn, she said, ''there was already a sense of 'How do we remain viable for the long haul?' Then you layer this situation on top of it, it just compounds it.''
 Under the governor's proposal, delivered on Nov. 12, the $48 million budget of the state arts council would be cut by $7 million. Of the $1.3 million that goes to Westchester County arts groups, $400,000 would be cut, Ms. Langsam said. In addition, $500,000 in county arts financing has become a point of dispute, and while the County Legislature recently voted to include the money in the budget, no one knows precisely how either the county or state budget will ultimately be resolved. 
 For now, Ms. Langsam said that the Westchester Arts Council was planning for reductions next year of about 20 percent in its programs, including those it administers, like one featuring performing and visual arts on the ground floor of the building the council owns at 31 Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains. The program is scheduled to be restarted on Saturday with a new name -- ''Live at the X'' -- but with five fewer live performances than had been planned before the economic crisis hit, Ms. Langsam said.
 Typical of the fare Westchester audiences might not see because of the cuts was a lunchtime concert by Melissa Stylianou, a Toronto-born vocalist and a rising star in jazz. Mark Morganelli, executive director of Jazz Forum Arts, said that he had hired Ms. Styliano to appear on April 17 based on discussions he held in July with Westchester Arts Council officials, but they had recently written him that the show had been canceled.
 Ms. Langsam held out the possibility that the show might be restored, if money was found. But for Mr. Morganelli, who has been producing about 50 free jazz concerts around Westchester each summer for eight years, the cancellation was one more bit of evidence that financing had become more precarious. 
 The county's top classical music organizations are also feeling squeezed. While the appointment of Itzhak Perlman as artistic director of the Westchester Philharmonic sparked a dramatic turnaround in attendance, and an increase in the number of contributions, ''the size of the contributions we had hoped for is off, and the speed with which they're coming in has slowed considerably since all of the bad news of a couple months ago,'' said Joshua Worby, the orchestra's executive director.
 At the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, in Katonah, Michael Barrett, the chief executive, said that plans to increase the center's $9 million endowment had been put off. 
 ''We're trying to finish the year in fairly reasonable shape so that our deficit doesn't grow that much,'' he said.
 To accomplish that, the chairwoman of the board late last month announced that new or increased membership gifts sent before the end of the year would be matched up to $50,000.
 Looking to next year, Mr. Barrett said, Caramoor is bracing for fund-raising cuts of at least 20 percent. The cuts could lead to reduced spending on maintenance of the center's 90-acre grounds, a 10 percent staff reduction and even a slight scaling back of concerts at its summer festival.
 ''Instead of the Berlioz-size orchestra,'' he said, ''we'll be having the Haydn-size orchestra.'' 
 Similarly, many theater groups are downsizing productions. 
 ''We're certainly feeling the pinch,'' said Quinn Cassavale, general manager and director of development at the Schoolhouse Theater, in Croton Falls. With growth in subscriptions having stalled, the company was producing only three main-stage plays this season, down from four last season. And the season's opening play, ''Him,'' called for a cast of only two.
 Likewise, the Hudson Stage Company, which is in residence at Pace University, in Pleasantville, is working with smaller casts. ''We're trying to be solvent, wise in making choices that can work within our budget,'' said Denise Bessette, a producer. 
 The company's last fully staged productions, both of which closed last month, were a two-character play, ''Mary's Wedding,'' and a one-woman show, ''Pardon Me for Living.'' 
 The Emelin Theater, in Mamaroneck, has no plays on tap despite 35 years of producing.
 ''We're looking at the whole range of alternatives in terms of how to remain active in the arena of producing and presenting live theater in a way that makes fiscal sense,'' said Seth Kaplan, co-president of the theater's board. The company's last play, ''Everyone Expects Me to Write Another Streetcar,'' a one-character affair drawn from Tennessee Williams's writings that ran for two nights in November 2007, might provide a model for future shows, Mr. Kaplan said. 
 Other kinds of performances could also decline. Jerri Lynn Fields, executive director of the Hudson Valley Writers' Center, in Sleepy Hollow, said she was planning for an 8 percent cut in her $346,000 budget, which could result in 6 to 10 of a planned 33 readings being canceled. The cancellations would be doubly unfortunate in that the readings are held in the center's headquarters, a former train station converted at considerable expense into a performance space and schoolhouse.
 Education efforts could be affected as well. At the writers' center, class sizes could dwindle as scholarships for low-income 7- to 11-year-olds disappear or parents feeling the economic strain simply decide not to enroll their children, Ms. Fields said. Meanwhile, enrollment in adult classes has already dropped 30 percent at the Pelham Art Center, said Lisa Robb, the executive director. 
 As the recession continues, freelance artists are also feeling the effects. Barry L. Mason, a Westchester photographer, painter and sculptor whose work has been exhibited at sites from the Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon to the White House, said jobs were less plentiful. And Mr. Morganelli said that clubs and restaurants were hiring fewer musicians, as consumers cut spending on entertainment outside the home. 
 But not all the news is bad. Despite some decline in corporate contributions, the Jacob Burns Film Center, in Pleasantville, has had little change in its major source of support, individual contributions, said Stephen Apkon, the executive director. He attributed the stability in part to a large, diverse base of contributors partial to the center's high-profile education efforts, notably a $20 million media arts lab that celebrated its grand opening this month.
 Some organizations feeling the economic pressure are still forging ahead with new plans. At Caramoor, separate grants will pay for a program to develop young vocalists and a weekend-long outdoor series in October, Mr. Barrett said. And Jazz Forum Arts is staging seven spring shows at the Tarrytown Music Hall -- a ''huge risk,'' Mr. Morganelli said, though he further described it as ''a calculated risk, because people will still go out and spend money on an artist they want to see.''
 ''And they will stay close to home and not go into the city and spend money on tolls, parking, gas, dinner, and a high-priced ticket,'' he said.
 OFFERING Manhattan-quality fare at suburban prices, always a selling point for Westchester performing arts groups, has become even more important. Jack W. Batman, an experienced Broadway producer, took over the struggling White Plains Performing Arts Center 19 months ago with the idea that he could produce for $250,000 a musical that would cost $8 million on Broadway, and pass along the savings to ticket buyers. 
 But Mr. Batman, a normally ebullient sort, was cautious in his assessments, saying that he was still refining the formula for what worked at the 410-seat theater. The current offering -- ''Oliver!,'' which closes Dec. 14 -- was playing at 55 percent to 60 percent of capacity, he said. ''We can't be overly optimistic.'' 
 Excessive optimism was not the problem for most arts groups, said Ms. Bessette, of the Hudson Stage. ''Everybody's nervous,'' she said, ''and we're trying to encourage them not to panic, because there's an atmosphere of fear-mongering that I think is really toxic.'' 
 Reflecting the anxiety of artists concerned about just how bad things could become down the road, Ms. Cassavale, of the Schoolhouse Theater, would not predict her company's future beyond next year. 
 ''Can I say for sure we'll be standing in two or three years? Who knows?'' She added, ''It's a scary time.''
 Whether speaking at the Palisades strategy session or in the weeks since, arts advocates have discussed a number of ideas to improve the odds for artists over the short and long term. Among them: sharing resources like office and rehearsal space; developing marketing approaches to regional ''branding''; and integrating the arts more fully into economic development. 
 To build good will and attract new audiences, arts groups are using proven strategies. Last Sunday, for example, 16 sites across the county opened their doors at no charge for a Free Arts Day. The event, conceived after the terrorist attacks in 2001 and held yearly since then, could have even greater resonance in the current economic climate, said Ms. Langsam of the Westchester Arts Council.
 Both Ms. Langsam and Ms. Hitchens, of the state arts council, said that artists and producers ultimately needed to think more boldly, moving away from restrictive nonprofit structures and a grant-making system that was uncertain at best.
 ''It's very serious,'' Ms. Hitchens said of the economic picture. ''But in crisis, there's an opportunity. There's a tremendous opportunity to rethink how we operate.''

HEADLINE: Liabilities Dec. 7-13

 BODY:
THE NEWS Investors wary of taking on any risk actually bid down the yield on short-term Treasury notes to zero and briefly even below zero, meaning they were paying more to buy the notes than they will receive in principal and interest when the notes mature. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS You know the financial markets are deeply nervous when a guaranteed loss on three-month Treasuries is seen as a better idea than taking a chance on any alternative investment, from stocks to bonds to commodities to bank deposits. Economists worry that such caution could slow a recovery by choking off investments in stocks and corporate bonds that businesses need to finance their operations.
 THE NEWS Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois was arrested and accused of conspiracy and corruption, including trying to sell an appointment to serve out the rest of President-elect Barack Obama's term in the Senate.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The blatant way in which the Chicago Democrat seemed to be peddling the Senate seat in wiretapped conversations dropped jaws across the country. Though Mr. Obama said neither he nor his staff had any improper dealings with the governor, the scandal threatened to drag out into a major headache for the president-elect, with each new twist a reminder of his Chicago hometown's reputation for sleazy politics. 
 THE NEWS For the first time on record, the total indebtedness of American consumers declined in the third quarter, the Federal Reserve said. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Sounds good, but even owing 0.8 percent less, consumers were still a lot worse off: household net worth dropped by a record 4.7 percent, eroded by the falling values of investments and especially houses. The average homeowner's equity fell to 44.7 percent in the quarter, the lowest yet recorded by the Fed. It has makings of a vicious spiral: Less household wealth and less borrowing both translate into less spending, which translates into less economic activity, which translates into less wealth and less borrowing. 
 THE NEWS After Indian and American officials accused the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba of carrying out the terror attacks in Mumbai, Pakistan took limited steps against the group and a charity it uses as a front. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Lashkar-e-Taiba was originally fostered by Pakistani intelligence to be a thorn in India's side in the disputed Kashmir region, but is now one in Pakistan's as well. Under American pressure, Pakistan outlawed the group in 2002 but did little to shut it down; now the new government must walk a fine line between angering Western allies by shielding terrorists and inflaming Pakistanis by cracking down at the behest of India and the West. 
 THE NEWS Efforts to enact a bailout plan for the Big Three American automakers sputtered on Capitol Hill.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Democrats, who hate the idea of a big automaker bankruptcy and the jobs it would cost even more than they dislike helping companies that have fought their environmental agenda tooth and claw, reached a deal with the White House for bridge loans and public oversight. But Senate Republicans blocked the deal, saying the United Auto Workers had been too grudging with wage concessions, which the union hotly disputed. Calling inaction ''irresponsible,'' the White House turned to Plan B: using the Wall Street bailout money to help Detroit.

HEADLINE: Two Cheers for Rod Blagojevich

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
ROD BLAGOJEVICH is the perfect holiday treat for a country fighting off depression. He gift-wraps the ugliness of corruption in the mirthful garb of farce. From a safe distance outside Illinois, it's hard not to laugh at the ''culture of Chicago,'' where even the president-elect's Senate seat is just another commodity to be bought and sold.
 But the entertainment is escapist only up to a point. What went down in the Land of Lincoln is just the reductio ad absurdum of an American era where both entitlement and corruption have been the calling cards of power. Blagojevich's alleged crimes pale next to the larger scandals of Washington and Wall Street. Yet those who promoted and condoned the twin national catastrophes of reckless war in Iraq and reckless gambling in our markets have largely escaped the accountability that now seems to await the Chicago punk nabbed by the United States attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald. 
 The Republican partisans cheering Fitzgerald's prosecution of a Democrat have forgotten his other red-letter case in this decade, his conviction of Scooter Libby, Dick Cheney's chief of staff. Libby was far bigger prey. He was part of the White House Iraq Group, the task force of propagandists that sold an entire war to America on false pretenses. Because Libby was caught lying to a grand jury and federal prosecutors as well as to the public, he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. But President Bush commuted the sentence before he served a day.
 Fitzgerald was not pleased. ''It is fundamental to the rule of law that all citizens stand before the bar of justice as equals,'' he said at the time.
 Not in the Bush era, man. Though the president had earlier vowed to fire anyone involved in leaking the classified identity of a C.I.A. officer, Valerie Plame Wilson -- the act Libby tried to cover up by committing perjury -- both Libby and his collaborator in leaking, Karl Rove, remained in place. 
 Accountability wasn't remotely on Bush's mind. If anything, he was more likely to reward malfeasance and incompetence, as exemplified by his gifting of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to George Tenet, L. Paul Bremer and Gen. Tommy Franks, three of the most culpable stooges of the Iraq fiasco.
 Bush had arrived in Washington vowing to inaugurate a new, post-Clinton era of ''personal responsibility'' in which ''people are accountable for their actions.'' Eight years later he holds himself accountable for nothing. In his recent exit interview with Charles Gibson, he presented himself as a passive witness to disastrous events, the Forrest Gump of his own White House. He wishes ''the intelligence had been different'' about W.M.D. in Iraq -- as if his administration hadn't hyped and manipulated that intelligence. As for the economic meltdown, he had this to say: ''I'm sorry it's happening, of course.'' 
 If you want to trace the bipartisan roots of the morally bankrupt culture that has now found its culmination in our financial apocalypse, a good place to start is late 2001 and 2002, just as the White House contemplated inflating Saddam's W.M.D. That's when we learned about another scandal with cooked books, Enron. This was a supreme embarrassment for Bush, whose political career had been bankrolled by the Enron titan Kenneth Lay, or, as Bush nicknamed him back in Texas, ''Kenny Boy.''
 The chagrined president eventually convened a one-day ''economic summit'' photo op in August 2002 (held in Waco, Tex., lest his vacation in Crawford be disrupted). But while some perpetrators of fraud at Enron would ultimately pay a price, any lessons from its demise, including a need for safeguards, were promptly forgotten by one and all in the power centers of both federal and corporate governance. 
 Enron was an energy company that had diversified to trade in derivatives -- financial instruments that were bets on everything from exchange rates to the weather. It was also brilliant in devising shell companies that kept hundreds of millions of dollars of debt off the company's bottom line and away from the prying eyes of shareholders. 
 Regulators had failed to see the iceberg in Enron's path and so had Enron's own accountants at Arthur Andersen, a corporate giant whose parallel implosion had its own casualty list of some 80,000 jobs. Despite Bush's post-Enron call for ''a new ethic of personal responsibility in the business community,'' the exact opposite has happened in the six years since. Warren Buffett's warning in 2003 that derivatives were ''financial weapons of mass destruction'' was politely ignored. Much larger companies than Enron figured out how to place even bigger and more impenetrable gambles on derivatives, all the while piling up unseen debt. They built castles of air on a far grander scale than Kenny Boy could have imagined, doing so with sheer stupidity and cavalier, greed-fueled carelessness rather than fraud. 
 The most stupendous example as measured in dollars is Citigroup, now the recipient of potentially the biggest taxpayer bailout to date. The price tag could be some $300 billion -- 20 times the proposed first installment of the scuttled Detroit bailout. Citigroup's toxic derivatives, often tied to subprime mortgages, metastasized without appearing on the balance sheet. Both the company's former chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, and his senior adviser, Robert Rubin, the former Clinton Treasury secretary, have said they didn't know the size of the worthless holdings until they'd spiraled into the tens of billions of dollars.
 Once again, regulators slept. Once again, credit-rating agencies, typified this time by Moody's, kept giving a thumbs-up to worthless paper until it was too late. There was just so much easy money to be made, and no one wanted to be left out. As Michael Lewis concludes in his brilliant account of ''the end'' of Wall Street in Portfolio magazine: ''Something for nothing. It never loses its charm.''
 But if all bubbles and panics are alike, this one, the worst since the Great Depression, also carried the DNA of our own time. Enron had been a Citigroup client. In a now-forgotten footnote to that scandal, Rubin was discovered to have made a phone call to a former colleague in the Treasury Department to float the idea of asking credit-rating agencies to delay downgrading Enron's debt. This inappropriate lobbying never went anywhere, but Rubin neither apologized nor learned any lessons. ''I can see why that call might be questioned,'' he wrote in his 2003 memoir, ''but I would make it again.'' He would say the same this year about his performance at Citigroup during its collapse.
 The Republican side of the same tarnished coin is Phil Gramm, the former senator from Texas. Like Rubin, he helped push through banking deregulation when in government in the 1990s, then cashed in on the relaxed rules by joining the banking industry once he left Washington. Gramm is at UBS, which also binged on credit-default swaps and is now receiving a $60 billion bailout from the Swiss government.
 It's a sad snapshot of our century's establishment that Rubin has been an economic adviser to Barack Obama and Gramm to John McCain. And that both captains of finance remain unapologetic, unaccountable and still at their banks, which have each lost more than70 percent of their shareholders' value this year and have collectively announced more than90,000layoffsso far. 
 The Times calls its chilling investigative series on the financial failures ''The Reckoning,'' but the reckoning is largely for the rest of us -- taxpayers, shareholders, the countless laid-off employees -- not the corporate and political leaders who led us into the quagmire. It's a replay of the Iraq equation: the troops, the Iraqi people and American taxpayers have borne the harshest costs while Bush and company retire to their McMansions.
 As our outgoing president passes the buck for his failures -- all that bad intelligence -- so do leaders in the private and public sectors who enabled the economic debacle. Gramm has put the blame for the subprime fiasco on ''predatory borrowers.'' Rubin has blamed a ''perfect storm'' of economic factors, as has Sam Zell, the magnate who bought and maimed the Tribune newspapers in a highly leveraged financial stunt that led to a bankruptcy filing last week. Donald Trump has invoked a standard ''act of God'' clause to avoid paying a $40 million construction loan on his huge new project in Chicago.
 After a while they all start to sound like O. J. Simpson, who when at last held accountable for some of his behavior told a Las Vegas judge this month, ''In no way did I mean to hurt anybody.'' Or perhaps they are channeling Donald Rumsfeld, whose famous excuse for his failure to secure post-invasion Iraq, ''Stuff happens,'' could be the epitaph of our age.
 Our next president, like his predecessor, is promising ''a new era of responsibility and accountability.'' We must hope he means it. Meanwhile, we have the governor he leaves behind in Illinois to serve as our national whipping boy, the one betrayer of the public trust who could actually end up paying for his behavior. The surveillance tapes of Blagojevich are so fabulous it seems a tragedy we don't have similar audio records of the bigger fish who have wrecked the country. But in these hard times we'll take what we can get.

HEADLINE: Final Days Fire Sale

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
Imagine if President Bush, on his last day in office, invited his friends to lift the Lincoln portrait from the White House Dining Room, take the 18th- century furniture from the Map Room and -- for good measure -- poison the Rose Garden on the way out.
 In essence, he is doing the same thing this month with land that belongs to every American -- the magical redrock country of the Southwest. 
 Well before it was a bumper sticker and a chant at Sarah Palin rallies, ''drill, baby, drill'' became the overriding mission of the political hacks who oversee more than 200 million acres of public land for Bush. At a frantic pace, they have opened up to oil and gas leasing canyons of golden slickrock, mesas once known only to hunters and pronghorn antelope, and little hideaways near the open-aired art galleries of the Anasazi.
 Take what you want, they said -- and get while the getting is good. It was a plunderfest that produced a gangster culture, with dozens of high-level Interior Department employees exchanging sex, cocaine and gifts with the industry they were supposed to be doing arms-length business with, according to a scathing and quickly forgotten report this year by the agency's inspector general.
 At the time of the report, with gas reaching $4 a gallon, many people shrugged and said we need the oil -- drill, baby, drill. Now gas is selling for a pittance, but that hasn't stopped the fire sale. Everything must go! 
 On Election Day, the Bush administration announced it would open 360,000 acres of public land in Utah to oil and gas leasing, including about 100,000 acres near Arches and Canyonlands National Parks, and Dinosaur National Monument.
 As with the $700 billion bailout that Bush insisted had to be given to the very bankers, insurance companies and other tassel-loafed failures who got us into the economic meltdown, the president now wants every dead-ender in the energy business to have one last treat.
 Solitude and ageless stone may not be commodities as easily quantified as a couple of thousand barrels of oil. But to the American inheritance, they are the equivalent of those first-edition Audubon books and presidential portraits in the White House. 
 The administration never even consulted with the parks before announcing they would have oil and gas rigs on their borders. 
 The giveaways went far beyond public land. For the coal industry, the parting gift was a federal rule that makes it easier to dump mining waste into streams. Anyone who has spent time in Appalachia of late has seen the handiwork -- entire mountaintops lopped off in an end-of-days rush for a dirty fossil fuel. 
 On Thursday, Bush handed out another goodie: a rule that largely frees federal agencies from having to consult independent biologists before constructing something that could lead to the extinction of birds, fish or other endangered species.
 Following a storm of outrage by park officials and the incoming Obama team, the government has now backed off from some of the more egregious sales in the Southwest. But on the upcoming Friday before Christmas, it will still auction off more than 150,000 acres near some of the most stunning scenery in the world.
 In a concession, officials promised that oil and gas operations would be camouflaged -- the rigs and drills painted a desert red so that visitors to the wildlands of Utah would not have industrial clutter marring their sunset picture.
 It would be one thing if we needed the fuel. Of nearly 9,000 oil and gas permits approved on public land in Utah, barely a third of them have been drilled. The way this game works is that oil companies buy the leasing rights -- in some case for as little as $2.50 an acre -- then wait for Saudi Arabia to force another oil price spike. Then they drill. 
 And the impact on price or domestic supply? Nothing. Even if all the accessible oil and gas were taken from federal land in Utah, it would have zero impact on prices, according to several studies.
 But the loss is incalculable -- ''geologic architecture that has inspired our American character,'' and places where ''the curvature of the earth is not only seen but felt,'' as the ever-lyrical Terry Tempest Williams wrote in a recent essay in The Los Angeles Times. 
 So why do it? Because they still can. The only urgency is Jan. 20.
 Eight years ago, in an act of frat-boy vandalism during their departure from the White House, members of Bill Clinton's staff ripped W's off computer keyboards and glued shut some shelves. If only Bush could revert to his college character type, and leave us with such a benign exit mark.
 My column of Dec. 7 incorrectly attributed a quote to Winston Churchill. It was George Orwell who said, ''Writing a book is a horrible, exhaustive struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness.''

HEADLINE: A Champion of Wall Street Reaps the Benefits

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ; Griff Palmer contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
''We are not going to rest until we change the rules, change the laws and make sure New York remains No. 1 for decades on into the future.''
 -- Senator Charles E. Schumer, referring to financial regulations, Jan. 22, 2007 
 WASHINGTON -- As the financial crisis jolted the nation in September, Senator Charles E. Schumer was consumed. He traded telephone calls with bankers, then became one of the first officials to promote a Wall Street bailout. He spent hours in closed-door briefings and a weekend helping Congressional leaders nail down details of the $700 billion rescue package.
 The next day, Mr. Schumer appeared at a breakfast fund-raiser in Midtown Manhattan for Senate Democrats. Addressing Henry R. Kravis, the buyout billionaire, and about 20 other finance industry executives, he warned that a bailout would be a hard sell on Capitol Hill. Then he offered some reassurance: The businessmen could count on the Democrats to help steer the nation through the financial turmoil.
 ''We are not going to be a bunch of crazy, anti-business liberals,'' one executive said, summarizing Mr. Schumer's remarks. ''We are going to be effective, moderate advocates for sound economic policies, good responsible stewards you can trust.'' 
 The message clearly resonated. The next week, executives at firms represented at the breakfast sent in more than $135,000 in campaign donations. 
 Senator Schumer plays an unrivaled role in Washington as beneficiary, advocate and overseer of an industry that is his hometown's most important business.
 An exceptional fund raiser -- a ''jackhammer,'' someone who knows him says, for whom '' 'no' is the first step to 'yes,' '' -- Mr. Schumer led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the last four years, raising a record $240 million while increasing donations from Wall Street by 50 percent. That money helped the Democrats gain power in Congress, elevated Mr. Schumer's standing in his party and increased the industry's clout in the capital.
 But in building support, he has embraced the industry's free-market, deregulatory agenda more than almost any other Democrat in Congress, even backing some measures now blamed for contributing to the financial crisis. 
 Other lawmakers took the lead on efforts like deregulating the complicated financial instruments called derivatives, which are widely seen as catalysts to the crisis. 
 But Mr. Schumer, a member of the Banking and Finance Committees, repeatedly took other steps to protect industry players from government oversight and tougher rules, a review of his record shows. Over the years, he has also helped save financial institutions billions of dollars in higher taxes or fees.
 He succeeded in limiting efforts to regulate credit-rating agencies, for example, sponsored legislation that cut fees paid by Wall Street firms to finance government oversight, pushed to allow banks to have lower capital reserves and called for the revision of regulations to make corporations' balance sheets more transparent. 
 ''Since the financial meltdown, people have been asking, 'Where was Congress? Why didn't they see this coming? Why didn't they provide better oversight?' '' said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America. ''And the answer for some, including Senator Schumer, is that they were actually too busy pursuing a deregulatory agenda. Their focus was on how we have to lighten up regulation on Wall Street.'' 
 In recent weeks, Mr. Schumer has worked closely with the Bush administration to try to mitigate the damage to New York's financial institutions. And as members of Congress and President-elect Barack Obama have called for new regulations to prevent future upheavals, Mr. Schumer has endorsed the need for reforms while still trying to make them palatable for Wall Street.
 Calling himself ''an almost obsessive defender of New York jobs,'' Mr. Schumer has often talked of the need to avoid excessive regulation of an industry that is increasingly threatened by global competition. At the same time, Mr. Schumer has cast himself as a populist who looks out for the middle class.
 In an interview, Mr. Schumer said that until the recent market turmoil, he did not fully appreciate how much risk Wall Street had assumed and how much damage its practices could inflict on ordinary Americans. ''It is a learning process, no question about it, an evolution,'' he said, adding that he now believed that investors and homeowners must be better protected. 
 But he defended his record. ''Wall Street and Main Street are tied together,'' he said. ''Often times, they are not in conflict. When they are in conflict, I tend to side with Main Street.''
 While Mr. Schumer has taken some pro-consumer stances, his critics fault him for tilting too far toward Wall Street in balancing his responsibilities.
 ''He is serving the parochial interest of a very small group of financial people, bankers, investment bankers, fund managers, private equity firms, rather than serving the general public,'' said John C. Bogle, the founder and former chairman of the Vanguard Group, the giant mutual fund house. ''It has hurt the American investor first and the average American taxpayer.''
 Navigating the Street
 Brash and brainy (perfect SATs and double Harvard degrees), Chuck Schumer, now 58, learned early in his career how to talk to the financiers and chief executives who would become a vital constituency for him. Though he did not grow up in that world -- his father owned a small exterminating business in Brooklyn -- he quickly showed a keen grasp of complex financial issues.
 And, recognizing how central Wall Street is to the city's economy, he committed himself to keeping it strong.
 ''So much of what happens in this town is because we are the world financial center,'' Mr. Schumer said at City Hall in January 2007. ''It helps support our museums, it provides the tax base for schools and health care. If we lose being the financial center, the rest goes down the drain.'' 
 Soon after arriving in Congress in 1981, Mr. Schumer snared a seat on the Financial Services Committee, which he viewed as the best way to help New York. While reliably liberal on many social issues, he established himself as a pragmatic Democrat willing to align with powerful business interests.
 Mr. Schumer's political rise -- he moved in 1999 to the Senate, where he now has a party leadership post -- paralleled Wall Street's growing influence in Washington. As more Americans invested in the markets and financial institutions had a greater global reach, the industry came to rival the manufacturing sector as a driving force of the United States economy. 
 And in the 1990s, Democratic officials developed close links to a new generation of Wall Street leaders -- labeled ''New Moneycrats'' by one author -- who shared a free-market agenda.
 Mr. Schumer became a magnet for campaign donations from wealthy industry executives, including Jamie Dimon, now the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase; John J. Mack, the chief executive at Morgan Stanley; and Charles O. Prince III, the former chief executive of Citigroup. And he was not at all reluctant to ask them for more.
 Donors describe the Schumer pitch as unusually aggressive: He calls repeatedly to suggest breakfast or dinner, coffee or cocktails. He enlists intermediaries to invite prospects to events and recruits several senators to tag along. And he presses for the maximum contribution -- ''I need you to max out,'' he is known to say -- then follows up by asking that a donor's spouse and four or five friends write checks, too.
 ''He was probably the kid that sold the most candy in grade school,'' said Julie Domenick, a Democratic lobbyist who has given to the senatorial campaign committee. ''He is not shy.''
 Mr. Schumer, in the interview, acknowledged his full-speed-ahead approach. ''Any job I do, I work hard at and I try to succeed at,'' he said.
 As a result, he has collected over his career more in campaign contributions from the securities and investment industry than any of his peers in Congress, with the exception of Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic nominee for president in 2004, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzed federal data. (By 2005, Mr. Schumer had so much cash in reserve that he shut down his fund-raising efforts.)
 In the last two-year election cycle, he helped raise more than $120 million for the Democrats' Senate campaign committee, drawing nearly four times as much money from Wall Street as the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Donors often mention his ''pro-business message'' and record of addressing their concerns. John A. Kanas, the former chief executive of North Fork Bank, said: ''He would solicit my opinion, listen to my advice and he appeared to take it into consideration.'' 
 Lee A. Pickard, a lawyer representing clients including the Bank of New York, whose employees have been significant donors to Mr. Schumer and other Senate Democrats, turned to Mr. Schumer last year to successfully beat back a regulatory initiative by the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''If you get Chuck Schumer on your side, you are O.K.,'' he said.
 That may help explain why some of the wealthiest financiers in Manhattan attended the Sept. 22 breakfast hosted by Mr. Kravis at his office overlooking Central Park. A Republican with long ties to the Bush family, Mr. Kravis spent much of this year trying to help Senator John McCain, the eventual Republican nominee for president.
 But last year, Mr. Kravis went to Capitol Hill to oppose a proposal that would have more than doubled taxes for executives at hedge funds and private equity firms like his, costing them up to $25 billion over 10 years. 
 Mr. Schumer had said publicly he would support the measure only if it also applied to executives at energy, venture capital and real estate partnerships, and he introduced alternative legislation that would do just that. His position was identical to that of lobbyists for a group paid by Mr. Kravis and other finance industry executives. 
 The Schumer bill, called a ''poison pill'' by the leading Republican advocate of the tax increase, went nowhere after provoking opposition from an array of industries.
 At the breakfast meeting, Mr. Schumer, accompanied by fellow Senate Democrats Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Maria Cantwell of Washington, assessed the political landscape as debate over the bailout was beginning.
 ''On the right, you have those who view any government intervention as a threat to free markets,'' one executive recalled Mr. Schumer explaining. ''On the left, you have people who choose to view this as a government handout to the rich. In the middle, you have everyone who knows and takes the Treasury secretary seriously and recognizes that if something is not done here, we could be staring into an abyss.''
 Within days, the businessmen sent out checks to the Senate campaign committee.
 'Their Go-To Guy'
 To Christopher Cox, the Republican chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the need for action was obvious in the spring of 2006.
 His agency, which would later be criticized for a 2004 ruling that let banks pile up debt, had grown deeply concerned about lack of oversight of the nation's largest credit-rating agencies, like Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Linchpins of the financial system, their ratings are vital to safeguarding investors by evaluating the risks of bonds and other debt. After the collapse of Enron and WorldCom, which had repeatedly been awarded favorable ratings, the agencies had agreed to meet voluntary standards.
 But the S.E.C. concluded that those agreements were inadequate, so Mr. Cox urged Congress to give his agency oversight powers. ''Without additional legislative authority, the S.E.C. will not be able to regulate in a thoroughgoing way,'' he told the Senate banking committee at an April 2006 hearing.
 The plan drew broad, bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. But executives at the credit-rating agencies soon began pressing Mr. Schumer and other allies in Congress to block the proposal or at least limit its reach, according to current and former employees.
 ''They knew Schumer would support them,'' said one former Moody's executive, who asked not to be named because he still works in the industry. ''He was their go-to guy,'' the executive said. 
 While the Manhattan-based agencies were not significant campaign donors to Mr. Schumer or the Senate campaign committee, their lobbyists and many of their clients were. 
 At that time, revenues for the agencies were skyrocketing. The housing market was robust, and Wall Street investment firms were paying the agencies to rate various mortgage-backed securities after first advising the firms -- and also collecting fees -- on how to package them to get high credit ratings.
 It was an obvious conflict of interest, financial experts now say. Despite their high ratings, many of those securities, based on risky loans, would prove worthless, roiling markets and threatening financial institutions worldwide.
 But Mr. Schumer argued that the companies voluntarily met requirements to eliminate such possible conflicts. He suggested that regulators simply encourage competition and disclosure of agencies' ratings methods. There was perhaps no need for an intrusive new law, he said in the spring of 2006. ''They've implemented their codes of conduct,'' Mr. Schumer told Mr. Cox at a Senate hearing. ''They're making good-faith efforts.''
 Mr. Schumer could not stop the legislation from passing, but he managed to get the measure amended so that it explicitly prohibited the S.E.C. from regulating the procedures and methods the agencies use to determine ratings.
 Richard Y. Roberts, a former S.E.C. commissioner, said the amendment Mr. Schumer won was troubling, adding that it could block the S.E.C. from punishing a credit-rating agency that consistently issued unreliable ratings. 
 Sean J. Egan, managing director of a small Pennsylvania agency, Egan-Jones Ratings, and a proponent of the tougher regulations, was more blunt. ''The bill was eviscerated,'' he said. ''You have stripped away basic safeguards for the investors.''
 At times in Congress, Mr. Schumer has teamed up with Republicans, like former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who aggressively promoted a free-market agenda. Mr. Schumer pushed for the Gramm-Leach-Bliley law, passed in November 1999, which knocked down the walls between investment banks and commercial banks and allowed financial supermarkets to flourish. The law also weakened regulatory oversight by fracturing it among different agencies.
 In 2001, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Gramm jointly proposed legislation that would cut fees paid by Wall Street firms and others to the S.E.C. in half, or by $14 billion, over the coming decade. Their proposal included some extra money for salaries of commission employees.
 But with trading volumes high, Mr. Schumer argued, the government was collecting far too much money from those fees and using it to subsidize other government operations. ''It is a tax, an unintended but very real tax, on all sorts of investors,'' he said at the time.
 But some Democrats, pointing to the recent corporate accounting scandals, argued that the S.E.C. budget should be doubled or tripled so it could more effectively combat fraud that could lead to a major economic collapse.
 ''We are making a tragic mistake,'' Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of New York, warned in arguing for a much smaller reduction in S.E.C. fees. 
 ''We give the industry what it asks for unwittingly.'' 
 Mr. Schumer's argument prevailed, and the fee cut passed overwhelmingly.
 Some consumer advocates laud Mr. Schumer for his stances on consumer finance issues, including combating high interest rates on credit cards, challenging predatory lending practices and advocating legislation to allow bankruptcy courts to force banks to accept lower interest rates so that families facing foreclosure could stay in their homes. 
 ''He is a strong advocate for families and homeowners to make sure they are not taken advantage of,'' said Eric Stein, senior vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit group that combats abusive lending practices.
 But those efforts mostly affect commercial banks and mortgage lending operations around the country and in New York, not the securities and investment businesses in Manhattan.
 ''He built his career in large part based on his ties to Wall Street,'' said Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics, which advises investors on the regulatory system. ''And he has given the Street what it wanted.''
 Mr. Schumer, though, has a surprising defender in Alfonse M. D'Amato, the onetime Republican senator he ousted.
 ''Don't take someone to task simply because a group has supported him politically and now he supports legislation that helps them,'' Mr. D'Amato said. ''The question is, is the legislation good or bad? With Chuck, it is clear he tries to do what is best for the state and city as a whole.''
 Doling Out Criticism
 For Mr. Schumer, Wall Street's crisis has been especially painful to watch. ''It is horrible, just awful,'' he said in the interview. ''And it affects everybody.''
 And he has already begun identifying those he faults for the devastation. Subprime lenders top the list, but he has lashed out with particular fury at the credit-rating industry, which he once defended but now says misled him and the investing public. 
 ''The work at these ratings firms was severely compromised, and the companies were some of the biggest contributors to the current financial crisis,'' Mr. Schumer said earlier this month in response to an S.E.C. move that same day to tighten control over the agencies. ''The lesson from this is that the three major firms' stranglehold on the ratings industry must be loosened.'' Mr. Schumer has also blamed the Bush administration for its push to ease rules. ''After eight years of deregulatory zeal by the Bush administration, an attitude of 'the market can do no wrong' has led it down a short path to economic recession,'' Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor in September.
 He has not assigned responsibility to himself or fellow Democrats, saying he had no way of knowing of the misdeeds going on on Wall Street. ''I wish I was omniscient,'' he said. ''I'm not.'' 
 Since the economy began to fall apart, Mr. Schumer has joined others in calling for new regulations to combat abuses. He has proposed tougher rules for credit-rating agencies, even changing the way they are paid so they are compensated by investors, not by the companies they are evaluating. He has said he is open to imposing regulations on hedge funds, which currently operate with limited government oversight.
 And while he previously succeeded in limiting consumers' rights to sue financial institutions, he says he now favors offering that remedy in certain circumstances. 
 But he is also warning that any new rules must be carefully crafted so they don't impose excessive burdens. 
 ''You need to provide safety and security to investors in order to attract them to the markets,'' Mr. Schumer told Wall Street executives in a speech last month. ''On the other hand, you must be sure that regulation does not snuff out the entrepreneurial vigor and financial innovation that drives economic growth and makes financial institutions successful and profitable.''
 And he is seeking some regulatory concessions for some Wall Street supporters. He has proposed, for example, that the government lift a cap on how big the giant banks can get, an issue important to institutions like JPMorgan Chase. Lifting the cap would allow the biggest banks to absorb weaker ones, but it would also limit competition and increase the risks to the financial system posed by failure of one of the giants.
 Mr. Schumer is also calling for the adoption of European-style regulations that impose far fewer rules and instead require banks to meet certain performance standards, a system institutions generally prefer but some banking experts criticize as not rigorous enough. 
 In recent weeks, Mr. Schumer has listened to Wall Street leaders for advice on what should come next. At a dinner at Morgan Stanley's headquarters the night before the presidential election, John Mack, the chief executive, and a dozen top hedge fund officials talked with Mr. Schumer about possible changes affecting their industry.
 ''People feel like he is going to be fair and reasonable,'' said one Morgan Stanley executive, who asked not to be identified because the session was private. ''He is mindful that this is a very big part of his constituency -- Wall Street.''

HEADLINE: We Need a Fair Reappraisal of Our Relations With Cuba

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Paris vs. Havana'' (column, The New York Times on the Web, Dec. 8): 
 Although I enjoyed Roger Cohen's lyrical prose, I take exception to two descriptions he used regarding Havana, which I also have recently visited.
 Mr. Cohen diminishes Cuba's real achievements in raising the standard of living for all its people with phrases like ''at a colossal price'' and ''thanks to socialist economic disaster,'' and seems to lay the blame for Cuba's limitations solely at its own feet. 
 Yes, Cubans are paying a price, but it is not ''colossal'' if you compare conditions for the majority of people there today to the conditions they endured during the Batista era. 
 And yes, while the socialist economy is responsible for the stagnation in living conditions, the United States' economic embargo on Cuba since the early 1960s and the loss of vital resources after the Soviet Union broke up have also contributed to the ''disaster.''
 There will be a serious reappraisal of our relations with Cuba when Barack Obama becomes president. Let us conduct it in fairness and without the usual exaggerations and misperceptions.

HEADLINE: Banks Use Free Pizzas and Humor to Calm Fears

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AS consumers continue to worry about the economy, banks and financial institutions are still running advertisements meant to allay those concerns. As Christmas approaches, many pitches are taking a less serious tack, replacing straightforward reassurances about safety and security with free pizzas and humorous advice about holiday gift-giving.
 ''If we could make people smile, that would be great,'' said Jonathan Schoenberg, a creative director at TDA Advertising and Design in Boulder, Colo., which created a campaign for FirstBank that offers the tongue-in-cheek gift suggestions, part of a campaign carrying the theme ''We're here to help you save.'' 
 Among the cheap gifts promoted on posters in malls are a phony ''certificate of star adoption'' and a jar of jam with a paste-on label that reads ''Holiday preserves, from the kitchen of ...''
 The ''somewhat terrifying'' state of the economy means that ''even if your circumstances haven't changed you still feel it,'' Mr. Schoenberg said, so the ''friendliness'' of the campaign ought to be appealing.
 Major marketers in categories like automobiles, retail and telecommunications have been slashing ad spending since the financial crisis began in September, but not banks, mutual funds and brokers.
 According to data from TNS Media Intelligence, spending in the financial services category rose 2.5 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2007. By comparison, ad spending in all categories that quarter fell 2 percent compared with the third quarter last year.
 ''Banks and investment companies are trying to shore up their deposit bases and shore up confidence,'' said Jon Swallen, senior vice president for research at TNS in New York, part of the Kantar Group division of WPP. 
 ''There's a lot of opportunistic advertising,'' he added, offering as an example brokers that are ''taking a long-term view'' of market conditions ''and telling consumers, 'We can help you with financial planning.' ''
 When data is compiled for the fourth quarter, the results will provide ''a clearer picture of the impact of the financial crisis on financial services advertising,'' Mr. Swallen said, ''and what to expect going forward.''
 Anecdotally, there are indications that ad spending in the category remains steady, in marked contrast to most others.
 ''There's definitely an uptick,'' said Rob Reif, president at the Media Networks Inc. division of Time Inc., part of Time Warner. Media Networks, based in Stamford, Conn., sells ad space in the local and regional editions of 41 national magazines published by 15 companies that include Hearst and Meredith along with Time Inc.
 More than 25 local and regional banks and bank companies have advertised with Media Networks recently, Mr. Reif said, spending more than $4.5 million. And revenue from financial services has increased 29 percent from the same period of 2007, he added, which is ''the highest percentage for a major category.''
 ''The banks have upped their presence in the market to set themselves apart,'' Mr. Reif said, ''for fear people would clump them in with Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.''
 And with the daily developments in the financial crisis drawing such attention, ''it's become harder for marketers to get their messages out,'' he added, ''but they've got to continue to communicate with customers.''
 Most of the ads ''are playing off the local roots of the banks to say, 'We're in your community,' '' Mr. Reif said. ''It's almost a comfort message, in the same way that in times of crisis people turn to comfort food.''
 Among the banks advertising with Media Networks are BB&T, Fifth Third Bank, First Tennessee Bank, Regions Financial and US Bank.
 ''If it's harder to get a dollar out of a consumer's pocket you have to be a lot cleverer,'' said Jez Frampton, group chief executive at Interbrand, a unit of the Omnicom Group that specializes in corporate and brand identity work.
 ''Half the problem is that people know they have less money, but they don't know how much less,'' Mr. Frampton said, and in many instances they do not have ''an issue with individual banks in the financial services system'' but rather with ''the financial services system'' itself. 
 What, then, can a bank do to stand out? That is where the free pizzas come in.
 Since Nov. 1, TD Bank, part of the TD Bank Financial Group, has been buying pizzas from pizzerias near its branches and giving them away to anyone who orders a pie to be delivered from those restaurants on, say, a Friday night.
 The estimated 20,000 pizzas come in boxes emblazoned with the logo of TD Bank, formed by the combination of TD Banknorth and Commerce Bank.
 ''I can't emphasize enough our desire to take advantage of the heightened awareness consumers have about banks, albeit for negative reasons,'' said John Cunningham, chief marketing officer at TD Bank in Mount Laurel, N.J. ''Typically, it's a Herculean task to get people to pay attention.''
 In addition to free pizzas, TD Bank is giving away 40,000 ''green'' laundry bags to customers of 600 dry cleaners in cities like New York and Philadelphia.
 And TD Bank is offering consumers in 22 malls in states from Connecticut to Florida free gift-wrapping for packages they are carrying as well as free shopping bags in which to carry them.
 The agency for TD Bank is Tierney Communications in Philadelphia, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which is creating a campaign with the theme ''America's most convenient bank.''
 ''It felt to us this convenience approach, which people respond to quite positively, was the way to stay the course as all this stuff started to happen,'' Mr. Cunningham said, referring to the financial crisis.
 ''What do you do?'' he asked rhetorically. ''Do you pull back and wait, or do you forge ahead?'' Then he answered his own question: ''My feeling is, full speed ahead.''

HEADLINE: The Railroad Disability Board That Couldn't Say No

BYLINE: By WALT BOGDANICH and NICHOLAS PHILLIPS; Andrew W. Lehren and Robert A. McDonald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After learning that most of her career employees were retiring early and getting disability payments, the Long Island Rail Road's president, Helena E. Williams, set out in October to learn more about the obscure federal agency in Chicago that was dispensing the money, a quarter of a billion dollars since 2000.
 But when Ms. Williams asked to attend the next meeting of the agency -- the federal Railroad Retirement Board, rail workers' version of Social Security -- she got a surprise. 
 The board, with about $34 billion in assets, had not met formally in nearly two years, and no new meeting was scheduled. The three board members, all full-time presidential appointees, rarely met even in private, employees of the agency say. 
 Operating out of public view, with little scrutiny from Congress and even from its former inspector general, the retirement board has become the agency that cannot say no, last year approving virtually every single disability application it received -- almost 98 percent. It did not matter where rail employees lived or where they worked. 
 An examination of the board by The New York Times, including dozens of interviews and a review of government records, found a disability program plagued by labor-management infighting, weak standards and a failure to use tests that could better weed out specious disability claims. 
 Since its inception, the board has been so riven with conflicts that it took a half century to update what were supposed to be temporary disability standards, leaving in place until 1998 archaic diagnostic terms like ''cretinism,'' ''imbecility'' and ''middle-class moronism.'' Simply having a ''repugnant'' scar could qualify someone as disabled.
 The board's newer standards have not made much of a difference. Nor has the $10 million the board has spent over the last five years on physician consultants to help evaluate applicants; the approval rate has actually risen since 1965, when it was 96 percent. 
 ''It doesn't require a lot of evidence,'' said Dr. Erlinda Berendi, a private contractor who reviews some of the board's occupational disability decisions. 
 The program's troubled history includes its former inspector general, William J. Doyle III, who chose to investigate waste, fraud and abuse from his home in Florida, 1,100 miles from the board's Chicago headquarters, records show. In the early 1990s, Mr. Doyle received thousands of dollars in awards from board members he was supposed to monitor -- two are still in office -- a practice that has since been outlawed. He later settled accusations of expense account fraud, agreeing to pay the federal government $35,000.
 If Mr. Doyle's tenure was unusual, the way he ended his career was not: He retired on a disability, records show.
 ''I found that there had been little oversight of the activities of the board members or the entire agency,'' said the current inspector general, Martin J. Dickman, who investigated Mr. Doyle and wrote a report on what he found. ''I admit that I had not anticipated the strange circumstances with which I was to be confronted.'' 
 The board has failed to heed several of Mr. Dickman's proposals to make the board work better, including that every disability applicant undergo two medical screenings, rather than one. 
 Investigations Under Way
 More than a half-dozen state and federal agencies are now investigating the retirement board's disability payments to former L.I.R.R. employees. In September, two days after The Times published the results of an eight-month investigation that documented those disability payments, federal agents raided the board's Long Island office.
 The L.I.R.R.'s disability rate, which since 2000 has ranged between 93 percent and 97 percent for retired career employees, is three to four times that of the average railroad. Workers at other railroads get disabilities just as easily, but they file for them less often because, unlike L.I.R.R. employees, they cannot retire early with a private pension plan to supplement their disability pay.
 The disability program is one of a range of benefits provided by the retirement board, which also include survivor, unemployment and sickness payments. Workers and their employers pay taxes to support the board. 
 Labor officials defend the disability program, saying that any possible problems affect only the L.I.R.R., and that changing the overall program would diminish protection for workers in a still-dangerous occupation. 
 ''It is a program that works,'' said James M. Brunkenhoefer, national legislative director for the United Transportation Union. ''If labor and management put the money in the pot and we decide how our money is distributed, and the only role government plays is to be the holder of that money -- what is the problem?'' 
 Rail industry officials say the entire program needs fixing. ''The fact that we continue to have a 98 percent grant rate evidences the fact that it is difficult to weed out people who try to game the system,'' said Jerome F. Kever, management's representative on the three-member board, each of whom makes about $150,000. 
 The labor representative, V. M. Speakman Jr., considered the board's most influential member, declined to be interviewed in person or by telephone. Aides said he was unavailable or out of the office. 
 Upon further checking, The Times learned that Mr. Speakman usually does not work from the retirement board's office. In e-mail exchanges, Mr. Speakman, who records show lives in the Chicago area, declined to say how many days this year he worked at headquarters. He added, ''Inasmuch as I telecommute, my primary office is my home and is fully equipped to handle all agency business.''
 As a presidential appointee, Mr. Speakman said, he is on duty at all times. ''I am fully engaged in all issues related to the Railroad Retirement Board,'' he said. 
 Mr. Speakman and Mr. Kever, the longest-serving board members in the agency's history, were appointed by the first President George Bush in 1992. Michael S. Schwartz, the board's public representative and its chairman, was appointed by the current President Bush in 2003. 
 Mr. Schwartz said the current controversy over disabilities was unfortunate, because the board spent most of its resources smoothly administering other services for its 600,000 beneficiaries. 
 The board has sought to portray the cost of occupational disability as an internal matter. In a statement, it pointed to its financing from the taxes on all railroad employees and companies. 
 But that is only part of the story. 
 The board automatically re-evaluates all occupationally disabled workers to see whether they qualify for total disability. In most cases, the board concludes that they do, entitling them to early Medicare coverage and lower taxes. What is more, under a 1951 law, the burden of paying most of these benefits has shifted to Social Security. Of the $3.6 billion that Social Security transferred last year to the retirement board, $418 million was for disability payments.
 At Social Security, which offers total disability benefits to nonrailroad workers, the approval rate is 55 percent. The retirement board's rate is 70 percent.
 The board has never studied why these grant rates are different. But Steven A. Bartholow, a board lawyer, said Social Security reviewed about a third of the cases and reached a different decision on just 4 percent in 2006 and 2007. 
 Setting Standards
 The retirement board, while accustomed to disagreements, had never seen anything like it. 
 In December 1996, outside its headquarters, just steps from the elegant shops lining the Magnificent Mile of Michigan Avenue, rail workers were picketing over the board's attempt to toughen disability standards. ''Don't Steal From the Cripple,'' one sign read.
 Inside the wood-paneled boardroom on the eighth floor, protesters turned up the heat. ''Stop the charade,'' they chanted over and over, becoming so loud that board members had trouble communicating. 
 The board was about to make one of the most important decisions in the disability program's 50-year history: establishing permanent standards for the first time. Congress had created the occupational disability program in 1946, when railroad work was particularly hazardous and injured employees found that they had no marketable skills outside the industry. 
 Mr. Speakman objected bitterly to what was taking place, saying the board had not fully vetted the proposed changes. He believed they needed updating, but with union members benefiting from the old rules, Mr. Speakman had not led the fight for changes. 
 That was left to the rail industry, which had to find workers to replace those who retired early. ''You can't just walk off the street and become a railroader,'' said Bonnie Huneke, Union Pacific's general director of disability prevention and management. ''It's a unique job and takes a pretty substantial amount of training.''
 Railroad officials complained that disability benefits were given for medical conditions regardless of whether they actually impaired one's ability to work. The conditions themselves were often vague. A worker, for example, could be considered disabled with ''moderately severe antisocial ideas.'' What constituted an antisocial idea was open to interpretation.
 Over the years, a succession of efforts to change those guidelines had failed. The board, meanwhile, had continued to award disability benefits -- with predictable results. In 1984, the General Accounting Office said it sampled total disability awards and found that the board had erred in 21 percent of the cases. 
 Six years later, a federal commission studying the board's solvency recommended that new employees be placed under Social Security and private pension plans, and that occupational disability benefits be limited to 24 months. 
 Those recommendations were quickly discarded after the board solved its money problems by raising taxes on workers and employers.
 To resolve the five-decade standoff, management hired a consulting firm, which in 1993 recommended discarding the old rules and having examiners focus more on whether specific physical ailments impaired one's ability to perform specific jobs. 
 This proposal eventually led to the protests at the retirement board. 
 ''This office will not participate in such actions, and we'll remove ourselves from the premises,'' Mr. Speakman announced. ''Let's go.'' And he walked out. Afterward, Mr. Kever and the board's consumer member and chairman at the time, Glen L. Bower, voted for the changes.
 A national rail strike was averted when both sides agreed to negotiate further. A compromise was reached in July 1997, and the old standards were finally updated early the next year. 
 As it turned out, the new standards had little effect on the board's grant rate. A 2000 internal audit by two doctors, one appointed by management, the other by labor, found that as many as 20 percent of the disability awards were unjustified.
 The board tinkered with the process again and settled on a procedure: An applicant's own doctor submits a physical evaluation but makes no decision on whether the worker is occupationally disabled. Claims examiners look at the quality of those evaluations and assess how ailments might affect one's ability to perform certain tasks.
 Examiners can request a physical evaluation by an independent doctor, but that occurs in fewer than 30 percent of the cases, a board official said. 
 For quality control, Dr. Berendi, the contractor working for the board, samples 120 occupational disability cases a year. Her company, Consultative Examinations, also filed more than 6,000 case reviews of workers being considered for a total disability, according to board officials. 
 Despite all this, the board's grant rate hardly budged. A second audit was released this past June. 
 ''I didn't realize how few were rejected until I did the audit,'' said Dr. Natalie Hartenbaum, one of two doctors hired to review a sample of 100 cases. All but one were approved, she said, and that denial was reversed once missing information was provided. 
 The labor-appointed doctor found that the medical evidence always supported the examiners' decision. Dr. Hartenbaum disagreed, saying she could find no evidence that the board even used a highly regarded test, called a functional capacity evaluation. 
 Dr. Robert K. McLellan, a specialist in occupational health at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, called the test ''a very important tool to better assess someone's work capacity,'' adding, ''We do it commonly.''
 Dr. Berendi, who has the authority to order a functional capacity evaluation, agreed that it was helpful. ''They can actually look at what the patient can or cannot do, rather than speculate,'' she said. Should the right situation arise, Dr. Berendi said, she would ask for the test even though it is expensive.
 So how many tests did Dr. Berendi order last year? Zero.
 And of the 120 cases she reviewed last year, how many disability decisions did she disagree with? According to board officials: zero. 
 Proposing Changes
 Since taking over as inspector general in the mid-1990s, Mr. Dickman has made a number of recommendations intended to improve the agency's operations. He has proposed that Social Security assume part of the agency's duties and that a chief executive replace the three-member board because it is inefficient and subject to internal conflicts. The board has rebuffed him each time. 
 Congress has not been much help. ''It might be the only program that two Congressional committees have fought over who would have to deal with it,'' said David Lucci, a former legislative counsel for the board. ''There's no glory in that work,'' he said, adding, ''It presents some hard problems just like Social Security does, and the population is very vocal.''
 The agency has remained a relatively low priority in Congress. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, whose jurisdiction includes the board, said in 2003 that it ''applauds the R.R.B.'s improvement efforts'' and supports its current structure ''so that rail beneficiaries will continue to receive excellent customer service.'' In the last couple of years, a committee staff member said, the panel focused on more pressing issues: Amtrak and rail safety. 
 The rail unions, which have remained powerful even as the nation's labor movement has ebbed, have aggressively defended their interests at the retirement board. Management has largely avoided a showdown, choosing to spend its political capital in other areas, including contract issues, according to current and former board officials.
 ''The unions have been successful not only in getting a separate system, but keeping it,'' said William G. Kaufman, a former director of retirement claims for the board. 
 Robert S. Jungbauer, a labor lawyer in Minneapolis, says that rail workers need a federal disability program, and he points to a Congressional hearing last year that examined unreported injuries in the industry.
 ''Management wants to understate and underreport the injuries to the government,'' he said. ''I would rather see an engineer on pain pills drive golf balls than drive a locomotive.''
 Ms. Williams, the L.I.R.R. president, believes that a lack of accountability is a problem for the board. ''I was certainly surprised and concerned to learn that they had not met in almost two years,'' she said. ''I'm not familiar with government boards or agencies that don't meet on a regular basis.''
 Board members say they communicate electronically, making frequent meetings unnecessary.
 Mr. Speakman, the labor representative since 1992, would not grant an interview to The Times because, he said in a statement, his words would distract officials from dealing with ''the Long Island Rail Road issue.'' 
 The Academy of Rail Labor Attorneys also encouraged members not to publicly discuss the disability controversy.
 Some policy analysts say that with the changing nature of railroad work, the board has outlived its purpose.
 ''That board should not exist,'' said Richard Parker, an economist who teaches at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Mr. Parker said there was nothing structurally unique about the rail industry that merited a system separate from Social Security. 
 ''They succeeded in creating this board,'' he said, ''that has essentially been self-recreating for no good purpose other than bureaucratic entropy.''

HEADLINE: Crashes, Goofs and Schadenfreude: Wild Ride in the Age of Financial Hysteria

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
''Panic'' is packaged to look like Michael Lewis's own 21-year chronicle of financial hysteria, beginning with the crash of October 1987. This book does cover that terrain. But it is an anthology of work by Mr. Lewis and many others rather than a single narrative, and in some ways that structure is liberating. By drawing on pre-existing journalism, Mr. Lewis, a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine, need not feign naivete to capture the conditions leading up to this and each successive money meltdown. Nor need he pretend to be surprised at the paucity of useful lessons that these crises have brought.
 Though he only edited ''Panic'' (a book whose full proceeds will go to the nonprofit teaching and publishing organization 826 National and to the Greater New Orleans Foundation), Mr. Lewis has thoroughly invested himself in presenting its stories. Some of his own work is excerpted here. And he has written illuminating introductions to the book's separate sections. Each section traces the arc of a single panic, with some (the collapse of the Thai baht in 1997) less fathomable than others (the late 1990s boom and bust of the Internet, culminating in the dot-com cataclysms of 2000). 
 In shaping each story Mr. Lewis starts with an excerpt illustrating unreasonable optimism, then others that capture the first hints of mounting worry. Then he moves to the full-throttle panic phase, and he cools down with assessments of how these crises have changed investor attitude and fiscal policy. ''Panic'' carries the cautionary message that the wisdom brought by a financial collapse is wisdom that rarely sticks.
 The range of ''Panic'' incorporates both fatuous, blue-sky feature writing (''If you do this carefully, it's like picking money off trees,'' says a screenwriter turned investor, in the summer of 1987) and densely theoretical analysis. This book includes a glossary of finance-related alphabet soup (M-LEC, LIBOR, CDO, SIV) and terms like tranche, quant and the Phillips curve. It would also have been helped, though perhaps dated, by a where-are-they-now index about the high rollers who turn up in these stories.
 Most of the book is quick, simple and straightforward. If ''Panic'' does not offer much in the way of long-range wisdom or prevention strategies, it's loaded with spooky nostalgia and mordant humor. It harks back to the days when the Dow Jones industrial average's surge past the 2,500 mark was ''now so high that investors sometimes get a kind of queasy altitude sickness,'' as Stephen Koepp put it in Time magazine. It quotes quaint talk of ''the rush to commercialize the global computing web known as the Internet'' (Laurence Zuckerman in The Times). It nods to the grandstanding righteousness of Eliot Spitzer when he was attorney general of New York State and the flashy excesses of James Cayne, the soon-to-be-Ozymandian chief executive of now-devastated Bear Stearns.
 Through all this, ''Panic'' provides a full range of gaffes, goofs and gotchas and a spirit of schadenfreude. Its governing principle: the best diversion from one's own mistakes is to read about everyone else's.
 ''A Brand-New Kind of Crash'' is the book's opening section, complete with one especially ominous warning. ''The crash of 1987 marks the beginning of the Age of Financial Unreason, when panic became just another, quotidian aspect of financial life,'' Mr. Lewis writes. ''At the time, to a lot of people, it felt like the end of something. In retrospect it appears to be more of a beginning.'' 
 The specific triggers of this event, like portfolio insurance, are duly taken into account. What interests Mr. Lewis just as much are the sound effects (''I-yi-yi-yi-yi,'' moans one woman looking at an electronic stock ticker, as reported in The Times), the anachronisms (General Motors stock is considered ''the bluest of the blue'' and a safe haven from turbulence) and the impact on individuals. Today, Faith Popcorn's 1987 prediction that compulsive yuppie spenders will become compulsive nonspenders (''one house, one car, one raincoat -- that's what it's going to be'') still seems to apply. 
 If there was one sea change revealed by this crash, it was an alteration in herd thinking, according to The Washington Post. Investors who once might have regarded falling stock market prices as an occasion to bargain-hunt had begun fearfully treating them as a signal to sell. The advent of computer trading would only worsen this kind of danger.
 ''Foreigners Gone Wild'' would be this book's flattest section were it not for an excerpt from ''How the Eggheads Cracked,'' Mr. Lewis's Tom Wolfe-ish 1999 story in The Times Magazine of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, describing the post-Salomon Brothers life of the firm's ''young professors,'' whose bodies were ''merely life-support systems for their brains, which were in turn extensions of their computers.'' His measure of this particular crisis is the way it flummoxed such heretofore-dauntless guys.
 ''The New New Panic'' describes the wild ups and downs of the Internet joy ride. This section is most frightening in showing what a single piece of doomsday journalism (Jack Willoughby's ''Burning Up'' in Barron's) could do to investors' expectations. It is most outlandish in describing, in ''Fumble.com'' from Salon, how dot-com advertising gravitated to the Super Bowl -- with ad rates so high that it was possible for a start-up to squander more than half its seed money ''in less time than it takes to soft-boil an egg.'' 
 The scariest part of ''Panic'' is ''The People's Panic,'' about the subprime mortgage collapse. Fortunately, Mr. Lewis has the wit to open this section with Dave Barry's views on how to get rich in real estate: ''You don't have to take any risk, or work hard, or even have a central nervous system. That's how profitable real estate is!''
 When this book went to press one big firm had collapsed, five chief executives had been fired, and 50,000 Wall Street jobs had been lost. Events have gotten way ahead of ''Panic'' since then. But early warnings are here. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are doing fine, because if they weren't, we'd be facing ''some economic scenario that is probably as severe as, if not worse than, the Great Depression,'' Freddie's chief economist tells The New Yorker in 2002. Moody's system of rating subprime mortgage-backed securities is said to be as good as ''observing 100 years of weather in Antarctica to forecast the weather in Hawaii.'' The cloud's silver lining, from The Wall Street Journal piece ''Trader Made Billions on Subprime,'' could be good ways to exploit bad debt.

HEADLINE: After Its Big Cuts, Detroit Makes Lots of Small Ones

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The threat of bankruptcy is evident every night at General Motors headquarters, when the lights are turned out early and the escalators and nearly all the elevators are shut down to save money.
 Even though G.M. is rapidly running out of cash, the company's top sales executive recently asked that elevators to his 39th-floor offices keep running so his staff could keep working.
 ''This cost-cutting has touched every aspect of the company,'' said Mark LaNeve, head of G.M.'s North American sales and marketing. ''But my people are working until 8 p.m. and need the elevators to stay on.''
 As G.M. and Chrysler await word from the White House about emergency financial assistance, the two troubled automakers are cutting costs furiously to stretch what is left of their cash reserves. 
 Both companies, as well as the Ford Motor Company, have already eliminated tens of thousands of jobs and reduced overhead costs by billions of dollars in the last few years.
 But as sales continue to plummet because of the weakening economy and the credit crisis, they are scrutinizing every budget line for potential savings.
 Chrysler has closed cafeterias in some of its plants, as well as the executive dining room at headquarters. G.M. is stocking office supply cabinets with cheaper pencils, turning down the heat in plants, and trimming back its inventory of replacement parts for factory equipment.
 ''It's like an individual who has lost his job,'' said Ron Harbour, a manufacturing consultant who for years has advised Detroit's Big Three on how to streamline their plant operations. ''If you absolutely don't need it, it's getting cut.''
 Even the industry's usually fancy coming-out party for new models -- the annual North American International Auto Show in Detroit next month -- will be a no-frills affair.
 Last year, Chrysler's show-stealing stunt was a cattle drive through city streets to garner publicity for its new pickup truck.
 There will be no theatrics this year, and Chrysler has even canceled its tradition of offering free food and drinks to hordes of executives and journalists in a Detroit firehouse near the auto show.
 ''We're going to have to tell them, 'Sorry guys, you're going to have to buy your own drinks and dinner,' '' said Chrysler's vice chairman, Thomas W. LaSorda.
 Time is running short for G.M. and Chrysler. Last week, their desperate bid for $14 billion in federal loans died in the Senate.
 President Bush has indicated that help could be forthcoming from the $700 billion financial rescue fund, and executives of both companies were in discussions over the weekend with White House officials on a bailout plan, according to several people with knowledge of the talks.
 A White House spokeswoman, Dana M. Perino, said Sunday that any action on the auto bailout would have to wait until the president returns from a trip to Iraq.
 Both G.M. and Chrysler have said they will run out of cash by the end of the year. Without federal aid, the companies are in danger of not paying suppliers for parts already delivered, which could start a wave of failures in the nation's vast network of parts manufacturers.
 Both companies have said that filing for bankruptcy is a last resort and that they will continue to cut costs at every opportunity.
 Last month, an additional 5,000 white-collar jobs were eliminated through buyouts at Chrysler, bringing to 32,000 the number of jobs cut at the company in the last three years.
 ''We must eliminate every unnecessary cost in every aspect of our business,'' Chrysler's chairman, Robert L. Nardelli, told employees by e-mail on Friday. ''While a bridge loan is critical to manage through this financial crisis, we must continue to manage the factors under our control.''
 G.M. said Friday that it would idle 20 of its North American factories in the first quarter to reduce vehicle production drastically.
 But companies are also making scores of cost cuts behind the scenes.
 At G.M., that means stocking offices with regular pencils instead of mechanical ones, holding dealer meetings on the phone rather than in person, and canceling sponsorships of charity golf tournaments and high-profile events like the Academy Awards.
 Mr. LaNeve said his staff had shrunk in the last decade from 7,000 employees to 1,300, including a 25 percent reduction in the past year.
 ''It fries me to hear people say we aren't getting lean,'' he said. ''I tell you, my people are working like dogs.''
 G.M. and Chrysler have slowed down or suspended work on a number of new vehicle programs and sliced their capital budgets.
 Mr. LaSorda said that Chrysler had cut $2.4 billion in fixed costs this year, bringing such spending to $11.6 billion a year. ''Next year, we'll be in the $10 billion range,'' he said.
 Some of the cutbacks are sizable, like the planned shutdown on Dec. 31 of its underused S.U.V. factory in Newark, Del. Others are incremental, like not removing snow from the top floor of the parking deck at Chrysler headquarters, or substituting lunch wagons for cafeterias at assembly plants.
 ''Closing the cafeteria down in a plant can save $250,000 a year,'' he said. He said that with fewer employees, Chrysler does not need the spaces on the top floor of its parking garage.
 During Congressional hearings on a proposed Detroit bailout, several lawmakers criticized the Big Three for not addressing their cost problems for decades.
 All told, G.M., Ford and Chrysler have cut more than 150,000 jobs in the United States since 2006. Still, the companies have stepped up their efforts this year because of the sharp decline in revenue amid a 16 percent decline in industry sales.
 The head of Ford's Americas division, Mark Fields, holds a weekly meeting with senior executives to review every expense request of $10,000 or more.
 ''We look at things we never used to,'' Mr. Fields said.
 One example he cited was eliminating daily cleanup crews for offices at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. ''Is it really important that we walk in our offices and there aren't fingerprint marks on the desk?'' he said. ''Now we clean them once a week.''
 Ford is not asking for immediate government assistance because it has a line of credit with private lenders it can tap into for some time.
 But at G.M. and Chrysler, the cash cushion is virtually gone. G.M. has probably fallen perilously close to the $10 billion it needs to have on hand to pay its suppliers and make payrolls and interest payments.
 To extend its cash -- even by a few more days -- the company is reducing its inventories of parts like axles, fenders and steering gears to bare minimums.
 It has also begun a program called ''share the spare,'' in which a group of nearby factories stock a single replacement part for production machines like conveyor belts.
 By idling 20 of its factories in the first quarter, G.M. will also save on heating bills, maintenance crews and waste disposal.
 Two days before Christmas, the entire company will begin its regular two-week holiday shutdown for all of its plants, offices and parts depots.
 Some of the plants have scheduled downtime after the holidays as well. And if a bailout is not forthcoming from Washington, the lights might not come back on for some time, if it all.

Accounts
 The Richards Group, Dallas, kept one large account and landed another. Home Depot, Atlanta, decided to keep Richards as its creative agency after a review for the assignment had been narrowed to Richards and three other finalists. Spending was estimated at $600 million. And the Farmers Insurance Group of Companies, Los Angeles, selected Richards to handle assignments like creative development, media buying and digital efforts. Farmers had previously worked with the Los Angeles office of Campbell-Ewald, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Spending was estimated at more than $100 million.
 Unilever is expanding its relationship with Lowe Worldwide, London, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, by naming the agency to create campaigns for its Knorr line of food products in the Asian-Pacific, European and Latin American markets. The assignment, with spending estimated at more than $150 million, had been handled by JWT, part of WPP, which continues to handle other Unilever assignments. ''We are disappointed,'' Bob Jeffrey, chief executive at JWT, wrote to employees, ''and have told Unilever we think it is an unfair decision.'' 
 Levi Strauss & Company, San Francisco, named Wieden & Kennedy, Portland, Ore., to handle the United States creative duties for its flagship Levi's brand, which had been handled by the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty. Spending was estimated at $80 million. Other offices of Bartle Bogle continue to create campaigns for Levi's in markets like Europe.
 The John Deere worldwide commercial and consumer equipment division of Deere & Company, Cary, N.C., hired Mindshare, New York, part of the GroupM unit of WPP, to handle national media planning and buying on its account. The assignment, with spending estimated at more than $25 million, had been handled by GSD&M Idea City, Austin, Tex., which continues as the Deere creative agency. A Mindshare sibling, Malone Advertising, Akron, Ohio, part of the JWT division of WPP, handles media for the Deere local dealer advertising. 
 Armour-Eckrich Meats, part of Smithfield Foods, Smithfield, Va., chose Schafer Condon Carter, Chicago, to create integrated marketing campaigns for brands like Armour, Eckrich, Healthy Ones and Margherita. The assignment, with billings estimated at $10 million, had been at Element 79 Partners, Chicago, part of the Omnicom Group.
 Einstein Moomjy, the carpet and furniture retailer with five stores in New Jersey and New York, selected Della Femina Rothschild Jeary & Partners, New York, to handle its account, which had been at Furman Roth, New York. Billings were not disclosed. The decision reunites Einstein Moomjy with Neil Drossman, who has worked on the account at various agencies since the 1980s.
 MillerCoors is expanding its relationship with Draft FCB, Chicago, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, by awarding the agency assignments for two beer brands, Killian's Irish Red and Molson, which had been at the New York office of Taxi. Spending was estimated at $10 million. The Integer Group, part of the Omnicom Group, will work on marketing materials and other assignments. Draft FCB already works on MillerCoors brands like Coors Light. MillerCoors is a joint venture of the Molson Coors Brewing Company and SABMiller. 
 Burt's Bees Canada, Toronto, part of the Burt's Bees unit of the Clorox Company, named Zig, Toronto, part of MDC Partners, as its first agency of record. Spending has not been determined.
 People
 Scott Hagedorn joined PHD USA, New York, part of the PHD Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, as chief executive. He succeeds Matt Seiler, who left to join Universal McCann, New York, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as chief executive. Mr. Hagedorn had been managing director for the Eastern region at a PHD sibling, OMD USA, New York, which is part of the OMD division of Omnicom.
 Pamela G. Bailey will join the Grocery Manufacturers Association, Washington, as president and chief executive, effective in January. She will assume duties from C. Manly Molpus, who had been serving on an interim basis after the departure of Cal Dooley; Mr. Dooley left to join the American Chemistry Council as president and chief executive. Ms. Bailey had been president and chief executive at the Personal Care Products Council, Washington.
 Miscellany
 More agencies are laying off employees in the wake of the recession and reduced spending by clients. Digitas, part of the Publicis Groupe, is dismissing about 70 employees, or 2 percent of its staff, at United States offices including New York. And Campbell-Ewald, Warren, Mich., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, laid off an estimated 100 to 150 employees, or 8 to 10 percent of the staff.
 AgencyLink, Toronto, a consulting company that specializes in client-agency relations, joined Scan International, a network of such consultancies in countries like Britain, France, Germany, Spain and the United States. Scan was formed by three European consultancies in 2005 and Joanne Davis Consulting, New York, became a partner the next year.
 eMarketer, New York, lowered its estimate for advertising spending on social networks in the United States, citing factors like the recession. The estimate for 2008 was revised downward to $1.2 billion from a previous forecast of $1.4 billion. The estimate for 2009 was revised downward to $1.3 billion from a previous forecast of $1.8 billion.

HEADLINE: An Obstacle to Sharing Reduced Hours

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Are Cuts in Hours and Pay an Alternative to Mass Layoffs?,'' by Adam Cohen (Editorial Observer, Dec. 6), doesn't emphasize that the lack of a universal health care coverage system is an important obstacle to sharing reduced hours. 
 Large employers who simply cut hours but still have to provide health care coverage clearly think that they are better off shedding workers along with their health and pension benefits. As a result, the terror of job loss is greater because it means health insurance loss. 
 In times of economic crisis, more of us should understand that we sink in the same boat and need the ''solidarity'' that characterizes many European forms of the social safety net, including universal health care coverage.
 Norman Daniels Boston, Dec. 6, 2008
 The writer is a professor of ethics and population health at the Harvard School of Public Health.

 BODY:
For the moment, investors who may have lost their shirts in Bernard Madoff's investment company have lots of urgent questions they need answered. But the more they learn, the madder they'll become and the more they're likely to try to get even. 
 For those who got in when they met Mr. Madoff or one of his intermediaries at one of the golf courses where he swung his driver, there may be little restitution. Ditto for those who invested through funds of funds with little capital of their own. Many of these will simply evaporate with the scandal. But, in some cases, there will be deep pockets for investors to go after. 
 And the deepest of these appear to be outside the United States. The list is still being drawn, but appears to include the investment subsidiaries of some of the biggest European banks. 
 First, there's Santander, the Spanish bank. Optimal, its Swiss-based fund of funds operation, had $3.1 billion invested with Mr. Madoff. Given that it had only $8 billion under management at the end of last year, that's lots of eggs in one basket. 
 Then there's Unicredit, the Italian banking group. Pioneer Investments, its Dublin-based fund manager, has indirect exposure to through ''feeder funds'' that channeled money into the Madoff operation. 
 Others that may have had similar indirect exposure to Mr. Madoff include a handful of Swiss private banks; the Man Group, the London-based fund manager; and the Japanese broker Nomura, which marketed a fund to its clients that had invested in Madoff Investment Securities.
 The losses, which are estimated to be as large as $50 billion, are hugely embarrassing to any institution that shunted client money to Mr. Madoff. At the very least, it will undermine their reputations as savvy investment advisers. 
 More likely, investors will demand compensation. 
 How will they then react? One option would be to say no. But they might then face a spate of lawsuits accusing them of negligence. 
 Lawyers, including the class-action firm of Sonn & Erez, are already chumming the waters in search of aggrieved Madoff clients. 
 Investors in other funds managed by these deep-pocketed firms, but who have not been affected, might also lose confidence and take their remaining cash out, damaging entire fund management franchises. 
 Another alternative to waging legal battles and suffering reputational damage would be to pay up. That's what Santander did this year after it had put some of its private bank customers into investment vehicles managed by Lehman Brothers. 
 Voluntary compensation can be costly, especially for banks whose capital bases are being hammered. But, in the long run, it may be less expensive than toughing it out.
 Return of the 'Bezzle'
 First come the losses and the stupidities committed by bankers working for their own self-interest. Then come the rogue traders, unable to 'fess up on market bets gone wrong. The last to arrive is the bezzle. 
 That was John Kenneth Galbraith's word for the outright frauds -- the ''inventory of undiscovered embezzlement'' -- that are built up when markets are good. These can be kept hidden for as long as the lies hold up.
 The perpetrators are in no hurry to be uncovered, as they face public wrath, not to mention the possibility of many years behind bars. But truth will out. 
 What is shaping up as the 2008 Madoff swindle would qualify as the first major scam of the current financial crisis. 
 As is fitting for a scandal of this scale, it was committed, according to a federal criminal indictment, by a highly respected member of the financial community, a one-time Nasdaq chairman and a legendary trader. 
 For students of Galbraith's seminal account of the 1929 stock market, ''The Great Crash,'' Mr. Madoff's suspected fraudulent accomplishments shouldn't come as a great surprise. In the Galbraith model of a speculative cycle, good times spawn the excess and corruption that eventually bring them to an end. The last good times were especially profitable, fertilizing the ground for especially large frauds. 
 If history is any guide -- and if the late economist's theory is to be believed -- the first frauds to be discovered are not the largest. Mr. Madoff's losses could be just a foretaste of what will eventually be exposed.

HEADLINE: Funds to Pay Unemployed Inch Toward Insolvency

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
With unemployment claims reaching their highest levels in decades, states are running out of money to pay benefits, and some are turning to the federal government for loans or increasing taxes on businesses to make the payments. 
 Thirty states are at risk of having the funds that pay out unemployment benefits become insolvent over the next few months, according to the National Association of State Workforce Agencies. Funds in two states, Indiana and Michigan, have already dried up, and both states are borrowing from the federal government to make payments to the unemployed.
 Unemployment taxes are collected by states from employers, but the rate varies from state to state per employee. In good times states build up trust funds so that when unemployment is high there is enough money to cover the requests for benefits, which are guaranteed by the federal government. 
 ''You don't expect the loans to happen this early in a jobs slump,'' said Andrew Stettner, the deputy director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy organization for low-wage workers. ''You would expect that the states should, even when they are not well prepared, to have savings.'' 
 The Labor Department said last week that initial applications for jobless benefits rose to 573,000, the highest reading since November 1982. It is recommended that states keep at least one year of peak-level benefits in their trusts, but many have not, and already some states are far worse off than others.
 Indiana's unemployment trust fund went insolvent last month, and has borrowed twice from Washington since then -- the first such loans to the state since 1983. It also expects to request an additional $330 million early next year. 
 Michigan, which has been borrowing money from the federal government for the past few years to replenish its fund, is now $508.8 million in the hole and unable to repay it. Next month the state, where the unemployment rate is more than 9 percent, will begin levying a special ''solvency tax'' against some employers to replenish its trust fund.
 California, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island and other states are inching toward insolvency as well, and may have to borrow from the federal government to get through at least the first quarter of 2009.
 In South Carolina, officials recently requested a $15 million line of credit. 
 ''Right now we have $40 million in our trust fund, and we are paying out around $11 million a week,'' said Allen Larson, deputy executive director for the unemployment insurance program at the South Carolina Employment Security Commission. ''So we think it is going to be very close as to whether or not we can get through this year. We have never experienced anything like this.'' 
 Officials in New York said the state's trust fund has about $314 million, compared with $595 million last year, and will most likely have to borrow from the federal government in January. 
 The situation puts states, many of them facing huge deficits, in an even tighter vise. As more people lose their jobs, the revenue base that the benefits are drawn from shrinks, making it harder to pay claims. Adding to that burden is that states will eventually have to pay back what they borrow.
 Some states are worried about next year because the lion's share of unemployment taxes are collected early in each year, and they are not sure the money will stretch through the end of the next year. The maximum amount of income the federal government can tax employers for each worker is $7,000. (The amount ranges from about $7,000 to about $25,000 for state taxes.)
 ''It is something that we are concerned about,'' said Kim Brannock, a spokeswoman for the Office of Employment and Training in Kentucky, where the unemployment trust fund balance now sits at $133 million, compared with $250 million a year ago. The fund has not borrowed money from the federal government since the 1980s. ''At this point we are solvent,'' she said, ''but we are monitoring the situation.'' 
 States that come up short have the option of borrowing from the federal government, but if the loan is not paid back within the federal fiscal year, 4.7 percent interest is accrued, which cuts into states' general funds.
 ''With longer term solvency issues due to the sharp increase in unemployment, federal borrowing quickly becomes expensive,'' said Loree Levy, a spokeswoman for the Employment Development Department in California, which is already facing a multibillion dollar budget gap. ''We are anticipating interest payments of $20 million in 2009-10 and if nothing is done to revise the revenue generation model the interest would be $150 million in 2010-11.''
 As such, they are then forced to raise taxes or cut services, or both. 
 Robert Vincent, a spokesman for the Gtech Corporation, a technology company for the lottery industry based in Rhode Island, said, ''Unemployment taxes are one of a number of taxes that make it difficult to do business here.'' 
 In many cases, states that have kept unemployment tax rates artificially low -- or in some instances decreased them -- find themselves in the worst pickle now. Indiana legislators, for example, reduced the tax rates to businesses by 25 percent in 2001. 
 ''So, frankly, they created the perfect storm,'' said John Ruckelshaus, the deputy commissioner for the Indiana Department of Workforce Development. ''The Legislature will have to go in and look at the whole unemployment trust find first thing when they begin their session.''
 At the same time payments have gone up in some states. 
 To recalibrate the balance, several states are raising taxes on businesses -- often through an automatic increase that is triggered when fund levels are endangered -- to keep the unemployment checks flowing. An example is the Michigan solvency tax, which will be levied against employers whose workers have received more in benefits than the companies have contributed in unemployment insurance taxes, to the tune of $67.50 per employee. 
 In Rhode Island, where the unemployment rate is 9.3 percent, the taxable wage base will go to $18,000 from $14,000 in 2009, the highest rate in a decade. 
 ''There is a possibility that we might be slightly under the funds we need come the end of the first quarter,'' said Raymond Filippone, the assistant director of income support at the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. The state has not borrowed from the federal government since 1980, he said. 
 ''Many states have not raised that tax in years,'' said Scott Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers in Washington. ''Some states have automatic triggers. But then of course you have businesses saying, 'Whoa, you are raising taxes on me when we are having a tough time and it is a recession, too.' ''
 Still, some said they were thinking beyond the dollars.
 ''In these times of financial stress every extra cost is a concern,'' said Linda Shelton, the spokeswoman for Lifespan, a large health care system in Rhode Island. ''However there are many things that worry us even more. We are much more concerned about Rhode Island's budget crisis, about rising unemployment, the rising number of uninsured and the continuing cuts to health care.''

HEADLINE: Battle Unfolds in a Poor Land For the Riches Beneath the Soil

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: AIR MOUNTAINS 

 BODY:
, NigerUntil last year, the only trigger Amoumoun Halil had pulled was the one on his livestock-vaccination gun. This spring, a battered Kalashnikov rifle rested uneasily on his shoulder. When he donned his stiff fatigues, his lopsided gait and smiling eyes stood out among his hard-faced guerrilla brethren. 
 Mr. Halil, a 40-year-old veterinary engineer, was a reluctant soldier in a rebellion that had broken out over an improbable -- and as yet unrealized -- bonanza in one of the world's poorest countries. 
 A battle is unfolding on the stark mountains and scalloped dunes of northern Niger between a band of Tuareg nomads, who claim the riches beneath their homeland are being taken by a government that gives them little in return, and an army that calls the fighters drug traffickers and bandits. 
 It is a new front of an old war to control the vast wealth locked beneath African soil. Niger's northern desert caps one of the world's largest deposits of uranium, and demand for it has surged as global warming has increased interest in nuclear power. Growing economies like China and India are scouring the globe for the crumbly ore known as yellowcake. A French mining company is building the world's largest uranium mine in northern Niger, and a Chinese state company is building another mine nearby. 
 Uranium could infuse Niger with enough cash to catapult it out of the kind of poverty that causes one in five Niger children to die before turning 5. 
 Or it could end in a calamitous war that leaves Niger more destitute than ever. Mineral wealth has fueled conflict across Africa for decades, a series of bloody, smash-and-grab rebellions that shattered nations. The misery wrought has left many Africans to conclude that mineral wealth is a curse. 
 Here in the Sahara, the uranium boom has given new life to longstanding grievances over land and power. For years, the Tuareg have struggled against a government they largely disdained. But this new rebellion has shed the parochial complaints of an ethnic minority, claiming instead that the government is squandering the entire country's resources through corruption and waste. Armed with a slick Web site and articulate spokesmen in Europe and the United States, the movement has gotten sympathy from Westerners drawn to the mysterious Tuareg and their arguments for justice. 
 It has also pulled in a wide variety of fighters -- not only illiterate herdsmen but also college students, aid workers, even former pacifists like Mr. Halil. 
 ''This uranium belongs to our people; it is on our land,'' Mr. Halil said. ''We cannot allow ourselves to be robbed of our birthright.'' 
 Useful or Useless
 When Mr. Halil was in high school, an old French map hung in his classroom. The verdant crescent along the southern border was labeled ''useful Niger.'' The vast, dun-colored swath across the north that he called home was labeled ''useless Niger.'' 
 It was a profound lesson, in politics as well as geography. The agricultural belt along the south had all the power. The herders of the north were irrelevant. 
 It had not always been so. The Tuareg have plied the barren peaks here for centuries, ruling over the caravan routes that crossed the Sahara with the riches of Africa -- from salt to slaves. With their camels and swords, they enriched themselves through tribute and plunder. 
 By the time Mr. Halil was born, that era was long gone. As a boy he dreamed of having a huge herd of camels, as his father had before the great droughts of the 1970s wiped out the herd. After excelling in school, Mr. Halil went to college in Benin, but he failed to get the Niger government to give him a scholarship to veterinary school abroad. 
 ''My family had no connections,'' he said. ''Unless you have a friend in government, your chances of getting a scholarship are zero.'' 
 Instead, he started a union of herders to try to get those notoriously individualistic people to band together for their common interests. 
 In his travels, Mr. Halil began to notice the stream of geologists from France, China, Canada and Australia scouring ever deeper into Tuareg grazing lands. Little seas of flags, used to mark potential mining areas, sprang up everywhere, he said. 
 ''I asked myself, 'What do we Tuareg get out of this?' '' he said. ''We just get poorer and poorer.'' 
 An Insurgency Begins
 Mr. Halil's efforts were part of a wave of civic activism that has swept over Africa in the past 15 years as the continent has become more democratic. Many of the new elected governments are deeply flawed, but because of a more youthful, urban population in touch with new technology, their citizens are often better informed and less willing to tolerate the corruption that has squandered so much of Africa's potential. 
 In February 2007, a group of armed Tuaregs mounted an audacious attack on a military base in the Air Mountains. A new insurgency was born. They called themselves the Niger Movement for Justice and unfurled a set of demands: that corruption be curbed and the wealth generated by each region benefit its people. 
 Far from useless, as Mr. Halil's high school map had said, Tuareg lands produce the uranium that accounts for 70 percent of the country's export earnings. But almost none of those earnings returned to those who lost access to grazing land and suffered the environmental consequences of mining, the rebels argued. 
 To fight the rebellion, the government has effectively isolated the north, devastating its economy. International human rights investigators have also documented serious misdeeds on both sides. The rebels use antivehicle land mines that have killed soldiers and civilians, while the army has been accused of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and looting of livestock. In all, hundreds of people have been killed, and thousands have been pushed from their land. 
 Despite the violence, mining and exploration continues largely unabated, but the rebels contend that corrupt officials siphon off much of that wealth. The country's prime minister was forced to step aside after being accused of embezzling $237,000, and last summer he was indicted. 
 ''This wealth needs to be used to help the people, not the politicians,'' said Aghali Alambo, president of the rebel movement. ''Otherwise it is just plunder.'' 
 The government argues that Niger is a democracy, if an imperfect one, with peaceful means of redressing grievances. 
 Officials dismiss the men fighting in the north as bandits and traffickers who have moved drugs, untaxed cigarettes, gasoline and even human cargo across the vast Sahara for decades. Some rebels admit to trafficking, especially of cheap gasoline smuggled from Algeria, to support the rebellion. 
 ''Niger is a democratic country that is ruled by laws,'' said Mohamed Ben Omar, Niger's minister of information. ''If someone has a grievance, let him form a political party and bring it to the ballot.'' 
 Poor Amid Riches
 The Tuareg have been fighting here for centuries. The warriors cover their faces with long, blue scarves that stain their skin. 
 After France lost its grip on most of its Saharan colonies in 1960, the Tuareg found themselves a small minority divided among new nations created by arbitrary borders that meant little to them. Worse, droughts reduced them to penury. 
 But the parched land on which they lived was valuable. A French nuclear company, Areva, was scooping hundreds of tons of uranium from northern Niger every year. Unlike southern farmers, who owned their land, nomads could use pastureland but had no title to it. 
 The hardships of global warming and desertification, which eats away grazing land, further impoverished the Tuareg, forcing many to abandon herding. Yet as its fertility degraded, their land became increasingly sought after as the global price of uranium rose steadily. This paradox would prove explosive. 
 Mr. Halil sat out the last Tuareg uprising, which began in 1990 and ended with a peace agreement in 1995. Back then, he was idealistic, hoping to avoid violence. But he knew his people's history well. 
 ''Tuareg are fighters,'' he said. ''It is our nature.'' 
 In June 2007, an army vehicle exploded after driving over a land mine planted by the rebels. Villagers say that the army then slaughtered three elderly men; the army says no one was killed. But the story of the slaughtered elders spread swiftly among the Tuareg. 
 For Mr. Halil, it was a sign that nonviolence was foolish. 
 ''If they were going to kill old, defenseless men, how could we even talk about negotiation?'' he said. ''Fighting was the only way to defend our communities and our way of life.'' 
 After months of indecision, Mr. Halil sent his 2-year-old daughter and his pregnant wife to stay with her parents. He set off for the Air Mountains. 
 An Oath With Exceptions
 Once there, Mr. Halil found a growing army. He learned to use a weapon and march in formation, but he was more useful in jobs closer to his former vocations -- healer and organizer. 
 Wounded fighters sought him out under his tree in the camp. He treated infections and counseled men on splinting broken bones. Fighters started calling him the doctor. 
 ''I felt that I was useful,'' Mr. Halil said.
 Each new recruit must swear a three-part oath on the Koran: never betray the movement; never attack civilians or take their property; serve all of Niger's people, not just one tribe or clan. 
 But the oath has exceptions, and stealing from outsiders is not only tolerated but encouraged. Armed men stole a new, white Toyota truck from Unicef's offices in April. The same vehicle turned up at a rebel base a few days later, its Unicef emblem scratched off. The rebels drove it to Mali to try to sell it. 
 Such slips made Mr. Halil uneasy.
 ''I was not born to be a soldier,'' he said. 
 The fighters spend little time actually fighting. Mostly, they drive around on patrols, take shelter under the meager shade of thorny acacia trees and prepare Tuareg tea, a potent brew poured into small glasses. 
 At such moments, Mr. Halil ached for home. He thought of his newborn son, whom he had never seen. He wondered if he had made the right choice, leaving his family and taking up the way of the gun. 
 ''Sometimes I have doubts,'' he said, stoking the embers of a campfire. 
 In late June, Mr. Halil was on a mission when the thwacking sound of helicopter rotors suddenly broke the desert silence, he said. There had long been rumors that the government had acquired attack helicopters, a power that would fundamentally change the conflict. 
 In the firefight, 17 rebels were killed. Mr. Halil managed to get away and fled to Algeria, leaving the rebellion and taking up his studies once again. He hoped, at last, to become a real veterinarian. 
 ''I won't abandon the struggle, but I will continue by other means,'' he said. 
 The fighters left behind, in bases deep in the mountains, vow that they are there to stay.

HEADLINE: University in Athens, Epicenter of Riots, Is Drawing a Potent Mix of Radicals

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO

DATELINE: ATHENS 

 BODY:
Early Saturday morning inside the gates of Athens Polytechnic, a dozen groggy young people in hooded sweatshirts slumped on folding chairs around a smoky fire. Others trickled in, holding cups of coffee. Gypsy children scampered around with wheelbarrows, collecting empty beer bottles. One child lit a cigarette.
 But the young people were not recovering from a long night of drinking or studying. They were preparing for revolution. 
 Many of the violent protests that have rocked Athens in recent days, since a 15-year-old was killed by a police bullet on Dec. 6, have taken place in and around the school, driven by a group of anarchists who have often occupied the buildings here. 
 Come sundown on many nights, the Polytechnic, three graffiti-covered neoclassical buildings set amid pine trees, became an apocalyptic scene. Garbage fires burned in its front courtyard. On nearby streets, youths throwing gasoline bombs and rocks clashed with riot police officers armed with tear gas. The hulks of burned-out cars lay like carcasses in the streets.
 Someone spray-painted ''Don't blame us, the rocks ricocheted'' on a wall -- a reference to a statement by the lawyer for the policeman who killed the teenager, who said the bullet did not hit the boy directly.
 The National Technical University of Athens, as the Polytechnic is officially called, is one of Greece's leading universities, training engineers, architects and scientists since 1836. It moved its main campus outside the city center in the 1980s, leaving its downtown buildings, which now house just the architecture and engineering departments and an auditorium, largely to the whims of protest groups. 
 The university administration has tended to view the demonstrators as uninvited houseguests who overstayed their welcome so long ago that they have become fixtures.
 But these protests have been different. ''In former times, a couple of years ago, there were only students protesting,'' said Konstantinos Moutzouris, the rector of the Polytechnic. ''This time there are all kinds of groups -- this is difficult to control.''
 Conversations with those inside the Polytechnic revealed a mix of students, older anarchists and immigrants protesting everything from police brutality to globalization to American imperialism. Some are simply thrill-seekers along for the ride. Mr. Moutzouris estimated that there were 50 protesters taking refuge inside the gates, joined by hundreds of others each evening.
 Under an asylum law instituted after the police crushed a student rebellion at the Polytechnic against the military junta in 1973, the Greek police are not allowed on universities' property unless requested by administrators.
 Tensions between the police and protesters are so high that Mr. Moutzouris said asking the police to intervene would cause even more disorder. ''We're not in the mood of inviting them,'' he said. ''I think we would have damages and even some people hurt.''
 He said the architecture and engineering faculty planned to meet with protesters Monday to urge them to leave.
 Greece has endured a steady level of political violence for decades. Starting in the mid-1970s, the terrorist group November 17 -- named for the date of the 1973 Polytechnic crackdown -- killed at least 23 people in several attacks until the Greek authorities largely dismantled it before the 2004 Athens Olympics. 
 Last year, another group fired a rocket-propelled grenade at the United States Embassy here, causing damage but no injuries.
 Adding to the tensions, the police are seen here as both overly aggressive and disconcertingly passive. Though the latest violence was sparked by a police bullet, the government told the police not to use force to tamp down the protests, to avoid further mayhem. The cost of the ensuing riots is estimated at $1.3 billion nationwide.
 That the authorities have not identified and arrested the protest ringleaders also seems a question of political will.
 Outside the university gates on Saturday morning, merchants were sweeping up broken glass from their vandalized shops. Asked what the stores and their owners had to do with the death of the teenager, one black-clad young woman at the university who declined to give her name said they represented ''the corporate machine.'' 
 Protesters have said that they will continue to demonstrate until the officer charged with killing the teenager, Alexandros Grigoropoulos, is tried and jailed.
 The young woman said the anarchists held ''collective meetings'' in the university auditorium. They also organize through text-message chains and on Web sites like indymedia.org. 
 Greek authorities have insisted that the violence has been driven by a radical handful, whom they refer to as ''the known unknown.'' 
 That term is ''nonsense,'' said Dimitris Liberopoulous, 44, a freelance book editor and anarchist sympathizer who discussed the protest movement over coffee in Exarchia, the neighborhood surrounding the university. ''It's a game of semiotics.'' 
 He said that the authorities did not know who the protesters were and did not understand their frustration at class division, the poor economy, a broken education system and a corrupt government. 
 It is unclear whether the anarchists have ties with terrorist groups. But security experts fear that terrorists might see the new unrest as fertile ground for attacks. They also worry that the anarchists themselves might up the ante. 
 Though Athens was largely calm on Sunday, more protests are expected this week. 
 ''There's a proverb,'' Mr. Liberopoulous said, ''that a civil war never ends.''

HEADLINE: Budgeting Holiday Tips During a Recession Year, and Worrying About It

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON; Martin Espinoza contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Scott Krauthamer, an asset manager for a financial services firm, says he has no choice -- he is trimming some expenses. He and his wife are having more dinners at home, and, as 2008 winds down, he is figuring out the tips for the doormen in their apartment building on the Upper West Side.
''We're going to knock 25 percent off,'' he said. ''My bonus wasn't as good this year.'' They are also facing new bills for their 2-month-old son, their second child.
So while he might have given the building's 12 doormen $100 apiece in past years, this year he is thinking more like $75 each. 
With the economic meltdown causing financial headaches all across the country, people are cutting everyday costs any way they can. One expense that is being squeezed is that end-of-year staple, the holiday tip. And there is probably no place where holiday tipping is more of a ritual -- or, this year, more endangered -- than in New York City, where there are many people who, one way or another, smooth the bumps of daily life.
Doormen. Building superintendents. Elevator operators. Plumbers. Letter carriers (although the United States Postal Service's Web site says they are not supposed to accept cash ''in any amount''). Milk deliverers. Garage attendants. Housekeepers. Hair stylists. Manicurists.
The list used to go on and on.
Not this year, some people say.
New York apartment dwellers who are suddenly cash-conscious are thinking twice about how much they can afford to give this year. They worry that reducing the tips they give will lead to a certain unspoken tension, a take-a-number attitude in their dealings with people who, in the boom years, could not jump fast enough to open a door or fix a leaky radiator. Will their packages be signed for when they are not home? Will their guests be dropped off at the right floor? Will they have to wait while someone else's toilet is unclogged before theirs is?
Some see holiday tipping as little more than blackmail, but they pay anyway because they do not want hostility on the home front, or worse.
Some people say that holiday tipping is a lackluster substitute for a fairer system of wages -- one that does better at recognizing each contribution to each resident's well-being. But some tippers complain that it is the tipping that is unfair. All that cash is tax-free, unless building employees are singularly honest and report it as income, while the Internal Revenue Service learns about everybody else's bonuses from their employers. Rick Lamonte, an executive director for an investment banking firm who lives in Battery Park City, said he was tipping this year the same as last year -- ''unhappily,'' he added.
''Everyone's salaries are getting cut,'' he said. ''Bonuses are down. I have a lot less money this year to give to charities and for Christmas gifts.''
So why not scale back on the money for the doormen? ''I feel bad for them because they work so hard, and they live off of their tips,'' he said. ''It's a big part of their income for the year.''
Doormen know that residents are doing uncomfortable calculations this year. Martin Hidalgo, a doorman at a condominium building on Queens Boulevard in Forest Hills, said some residents have hinted that they will not be as generous as in past years.
''They say, 'Maybe this year you're going to get less than last year,' '' Mr. Hidalgo said. ''They say it's because of the stock market.''
He has done some uncomfortable calculations himself. He said he is expecting less -- about $3,500, or roughly half of what his Christmas tips usually total.
''If $20 comes my way, that's fine,'' he said. ''The main thing is my salary and benefits.''
Some tippers say they will stick with their old, convoluted formulas for how much to give each person on their lists. ''These are the things you can't scrimp on,'' said Carol Peligian, an artist who lives in a loft building in Lower Manhattan. ''Their services are no less. I'm not saying we can all give increased tips, but to not acknowledge services that are generously rendered all year is Scrooge-like, and I don't think that's where we want to go as a city.''
That sounds so generous. So polite. So well mannered. In fact, Miss Manners herself could not have said it any better.
''That's the last place that you should cut,'' said Judith Martin, who writes the Miss Manners column and dispenses advice on challenges like this one, ''because what you're doing is cutting the income of someone who is much more on the edge than you are. I think the whole tipping system is rotten -- the money ought to be built into people's wages so they can count on it -- but given that it is the custom, these are the last people you should stiff.''
And no shortcuts, either, she said. ''A plate of cookies is no substitute'' for a tip, she said. ''You depend on them, and they depend on you.''
Her advice: Don't mess with urban co-dependency.
But what if you do not tip? Is retaliation permissible? After all, they not only know where you live, they probably have the master key.
''That's a very ugly idea,'' she said. ''That's one of the reasons I hate the tipping system -- the idea that people only do their jobs well because they get a bonus.''
But what if you have lost your job and are living on savings or, worse, credit cards? ''Maybe you have to cut everything,'' she said. ''I'm saying it should not be considered one of the optional items. There are people who are utterly wiped out, but I'm not talking about them. For people who are trying to hold out, but they're not reduced to utter poverty, I'm saying that in that case, they can probably find other ways to economize.''
Ezequiel Pellot, who has been a doorman for nine years at a nine-story building in Forest Hills, said he had heard people joke that they would cut the holiday tips this year. But maybe they were not joking. ''I wouldn't be surprised'' if this year's tips add up to less than last year's, he said. ''It's a tough economy.''
He said the low end of the tipping scale at the building, the Park Briar on Queens Boulevard, is about $10 per person. ''I'm not insulted by it,'' he said. ''This is something they don't have to give at all.''

HEADLINE: Killing Haunts Ecuadoreans' Rise in New York

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM and KAREN ZRAICK

 BODY:
Always crowded and often perilous, the twisting road that brought the Sucuzhanay family from Ecuador to New York City has transformed the city, first neighborhoods in Queens and more recently parts of Brooklyn where surging numbers of newcomers have made Ecuadoreans one of New York's largest Hispanic communities.
 The father came first. In the early 1990s, unable to support his family as a farmer in southern Ecuador, Florentino Hidalgo Sucuzhanay made his way to New York -- his family refused to say how he got here -- and found work as a dishwasher. Over the next decade, six of his children made the same journey. 
 His son Jose was among the most successful. Starting as a waiter, he became an owner of a Brooklyn real estate firm and bought several buildings. He sent money home to his family in Ecuador, where his two children live. 
 But on Dec. 7, a familiar story of immigrant striving took an awful turn. As Jose walked with his older brother Romel home from a bar in Bushwick, Brooklyn, their arms around each other, three men attacked them, shouting anti-gay and anti-Hispanic slurs and beating Mr. Sucuzhanay with a bat, the police said. He died on Friday night at a Queens hospital, one day before his mother, who had been awaiting a visa, arrived from Ecuador to see him.
 Though the murderous attack has provoked widespread anger, it has been particularly poignant for Ecuadoreans, who not only shared a homeland with the victim, but saw in the Sucuzhanay brothers (pronounced suh-KOO-shen-y'eye) the kind of success they were reaching for. And there was outrage because of the assault's setting in a neighborhood where Ecuadoreans had begun to carve out a niche. 
 The Sucuzhanay family -- there are 12 siblings, 6 of whom live in the United States -- joined thousands of their neighbors who, starting in the late 1970s, left Ecuador's impoverished southern highlands and made New York City home to the largest community of Ecuadoreans in the country. 
 In later years, as border security tightened, many Ecuadoreans paid enormous sums to migrant smugglers, or coyotes, who secreted them into the country on unsteady boats, or through safe houses and across the Mexican desert. 
 Most immigrants settled in Corona and Jackson Heights, two neighborhoods in Queens that have long been home to concentrations of Ecuadoreans. Some spent their first nights on camas calientes -- warm beds in cramped boarding houses -- before the lucky ones found their own places. The No. 7 subway line carried them to jobs in Manhattan. 
 In 1990, there were about 76,000 Ecuadoreans in New York. Today, there are about 170,000 Ecuadoreans, the fourth-largest Hispanic group in the city after Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Mexicans, according to census figures analyzed by demographers at Queens College. The community's growth has been fed by a succession of economic crises in Ecuador, and by people like Jose O. Sucuzhanay, whose accomplishments seemed to signal what was possible. 
 His younger brother Diego said Jose ''was ambitious.'' After arriving from Ecuador, Jose Sucuzhanay held down a number of jobs, including one at a pizzeria. Restless, he started to invest his money and became interested in real estate. After working for another real estate firm, Jose struck out on his own. ''He didn't like bosses,'' Diego said. Jose was able to put together enough money to buy buildings in Brooklyn and Queens. 
 At one building, on Hancock Street in Ridgewood, Queens, a tenant, Conrad Marshall, said Jose Sucuzhanay was so well known that he rarely had to list apartments; word of mouth was enough. Mr. Marshall, a banker, said Mr. Sucuzhanay was ''always professional.'' 
 His death was the second reported killing of an Ecuadorean immigrant in the New York area in a month. In November, Marcelo Lucero was attacked and stabbed by a group of teenagers in Patchogue, on Long Island, who wanted to attack a ''Mexican,'' the authorities have said. Mr. Lucero, like Florentino Sucuzhanay, had come from southern Ecuador in the early 1990s, to send money home.
 In both cases, the attackers almost certainly did not know that their victims were from Ecuador -- the men who beat Mr. Sucuzhanay called him a ''Hispanic'' -- but that did not stop Ecuadoreans from feeling vulnerable.
 Gloria Castro, who lives in Bushwick, close to where Mr. Sucuzhanay was attacked, said she did not allow her children to go out at night. There have been no arrests in the case.
 The killing of another Ecuadorean immigrant, in 1994, turned Walter R. Sinche into an advocate and led him to found a cultural group that works to preserve Ecuadorean identity. 
 The victim in that attack, Manuel Aucaquizhpi, a homeless man, was beaten to death in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, by attackers using lead pipes, chair legs and other weapons. One of the attackers was convicted of criminally negligent homicide. Mr. Sinche said he was trying to ensure that such an attack would never happen again.
 ''Our community is growing,'' he said, ''and so are all the problems and success.''
 There have been two or three waves of recent Ecuadorean migration to New York, according to people who study the community. Beginning in the late 1950s, middle-class immigrants came from Quito and the coastal cities of Guayaquil and Manta, said Jose Elias Rodriguez, an insurance wholesaler and the founder of the Ecuadorean World Federation.
 Visas were relatively easy to get, he said, and the mostly middle-class immigrants settled in areas with established Hispanic communities, joining Colombians in Queens and Puerto Ricans and Dominicans in Brooklyn. 
 A second wave of immigrants, most of them undocumented and working class, started coming about 20 years later, mainly from rural towns in the southern provinces of Azuay and Canar. Florentino Sucuzhanay, in fact, came from a small town in Canar. 
 David Kyle, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Davis, said that longstanding ties between New York and Ecuador were based in part on the once-lucrative trade in Panama hats: Ecuadoreans had produced them since the 1800s, forming relationships with banks and buyers in New York.
 Many southern Ecuadoreans were employed making the hats until the 1960s, when men stopped wearing them and cheaper versions in Asia undercut the business. ''The people who were most hurt were rural communities involved in the basic production of hat weaving,'' Professor Kyle said. ''Nothing ever replaced the hats.'' 
 The unraveling of the Ecuadorean economy and classic migration patterns that propel migrants towards people they know brought the rural southerners to New York in the 1980s. 
 ''It was all from a handful of communities in these two provinces,'' Mr. Kyle said, referring to Azuay and Canar, as he described an intensely communal phenomenon. ''All the men from one community are going, but in the neighboring town, no one is going.'' 
 The Immigration Reform Act of 1986 put many of those immigrants on a path to legal status, which led to even more migration, Mr. Kyle said. The first wave of Ecuadorean immigrants, like Mr. Rodriguez, provided services for the next. In southern Ecuador, new houses appeared, built with money sent from New York. The houses got bigger, but as more Ecuadoreans came to New York, many of the new homes sat empty.
 As border controls tightened in the 1990s, the trip to New York became more dangerous and more expensive. When Ecuador adopted the dollar as its currency a few years later -- sending prices rising -- a new surge of migrants headed to New York. That, combined with the heightened border security after 9/11, meant that Ecuadoreans who used to travel back and forth to their home country increasingly chose to stay in New York, Professor Kyle said.
 Gloria Castro's husband, Juan, a banana farmer, came to New York first, in 1998, paying smugglers $10,000. He flew to Panama, and then to Guatemala. From there, he traveled in a series of vehicles from one safe house to another, passed off from Ecuadorean smugglers to Mexicans. ''It was barbaric, without eating for two, three days at a time, without water,'' he said.
 Once in New York, he saved enough money to send back for his family, borrowing some from a relative. Juan worked at a construction company, and separated trash at a recycling plant. He paid coyotes about $50,000 so the rest of his family could join him. 
 The family lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Bushwick. ''I worked and worked and worked, and thanks to God, I brought my family,'' he said.
 If Queens was the beachhead for Ecuadoreans, Bushwick was regarded as something of a frontier. More than 4,000 Ecuadoreans moved there from 1990 to 2007, according to the census. Diego Sucuzhanay tried to persuade his brother not to. ''I said the neighborhood wasn't safe,'' he said. ''But he wanted to be useful.'' 
 Jose was planning to make a trip back to Ecuador later this year, Diego said. Instead, on Sunday, as mourners gathered at a vigil in Bushwick in Jose's memory, his mother made arrangements to send her son's body back home to be buried.

HEADLINE: Papers' Owner Faults Timing, Not Bad Bets

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: SAN JOSE 

 BODY:
Dean Singleton expanded his newspaper empire at the worst possible time, in the worst part of the country he could have chosen, and he has been paying the price ever since in plummeting advertising and shrinking papers. Yet somehow, even in today's adverse climate, he professes optimism.
 In 2006 and 2007, as prices for newspapers were peaking, Mr. Singleton's company, the MediaNews Group, bought this city's daily, The Mercury News, and more than 30 smaller San Francisco Bay Area papers. He gambled his company on California just as the bottom was about to fall out for newspapers, especially here.
 ''In retrospect, the timing was not good,'' said Mr. Singleton, the head of and a major shareholder in the company, which is privately held. ''But in our business, you buy newspapers when they're for sale. If we could have foreseen the current economic downturn in the state, it might have changed our views, but we couldn't foresee that.''
 The news about his industry seems to get worse by the day. Last week, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy protection. And Moody's Investors Service said that MediaNews was approaching the point where its debt, almost $1 billion, would be nine times its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- technically putting the company in default. 
 MediaNews's credit rating is far below investment grade, indicating a high risk of actual default, but Mr. Singleton insisted that the debt was manageable. He said that MediaNews's primary lender, the Hearst Corporation, was also a major shareholder, with a significant interest in keeping MediaNews afloat.
 ''I don't see any other large newspaper company in danger of following Tribune,'' which was much more leveraged than its peers, Mr. Singleton said. 
 In a rare burst of good news for him, new industry miseries could work to his benefit -- outside of California -- by weakening or eliminating competitors to his Denver Post and Pioneer Press in St. Paul. 
 The E. W. Scripps Company recently put The Rocky Mountain News up for sale and said the paper might close; and The Star Tribune of Minneapolis, which has defaulted on its debts, said it needed to cut $30 million in costs and win concessions from its unions.
 MediaNews had a lot of company in buying newspapers just as revenue began to collapse, for prices that, even then, analysts warned were inflated. The McClatchy Company bought Knight Ridder, the Tribune Company bought all its stock to go private, private investors bought the newspapers in Philadelphia and Minneapolis, and there were many smaller deals. All those buyers are suffering now, and newspapers cannot find buyers even at a fraction of the prices offered two years ago.
 Despite the risks, Mr. Singleton contends that in the long run, California -- particularly the Bay Area -- is the place to be. ''I have no doubt that The Mercury News's revenue base will perform better when things turn around than almost any newspaper in the country,'' he said.
 Others are not so sure. ''The Bay Area has been the canary in the newspaper coal mine, and that was recognized a long time ago by a lot of people,'' said Ken Doctor, a newspaper analyst at the firm Outsell. ''The impact of the Internet has been heavier here and earlier here than anywhere else in the country.''
 Sites like Craigslist and eBay, which have long fueled the migration of advertising to the Internet, began in the Bay Area, and are more entrenched there than in any other part of the country.
 Already known for squeezing costs as hard as anyone in the industry, Mr. Singleton and his team have cut spending at a furious pace, trying to keep pace with tumbling revenue. His detractors among analysts and journalists concede that in this market, any owner would have to make deep cuts. But they say that he was already inclined to a slash-and-burn approach that is little more than a prescription for having the papers do steadily less, and do it less well.
 ''There's no newspaper in the country that I know of that's not suffering,'' said John McManus, a journalism professor at San Jose State University. ''But Dean Singleton has hollowed out The Mercury News.''
 The Mercury News, the Silicon Valley paper that was long considered one of the nation's best, began shrinking years before MediaNews took over, under the now-dissolved Knight Ridder chain. The news staff, from a high of more than 400 people early in this decade, has fallen below 150, producing a much slimmer, more locally focused paper.
 It no longer has a movie reviewer. The science and book sections are gone. Most national and international news comes from wire services.
 A business section that was one of the nation's biggest has shrunk by about two-thirds in the face of competition in its bread-and-butter field -- technology -- from Web sites like CNet and TechCrunch. Matt Marshall, a reporter covering Silicon Valley's venture capital scene, left The Mercury News and has his own Web site, VentureBeat, covering much the same ground.
 ''My philosophy on pretty much everything these days is born of pure necessity,'' said Bud Geracie, the acting sports editor. ''There's no grand plan; it's how we get through today.''
 Dave Butler, the executive editor, acknowledged that the paper no longer had the ambitions it once did. Now, he said, ''we're protecting the core mission, which is good, hard local news and information.''
 Ownership changes and disputes over the direction of the paper have contributed to rapid turnover in the top ranks. The Mercury News has had six publishers and four executive editors in this decade.
 Early this year, Mr. Butler's predecessor, Carole Leigh Hutton, was forced out after proposing design changes in an attempt to attract readers. Just after her ouster, a former publisher, George Riggs, who had come to head MediaNews's California operations, resigned. 
 MediaNews, a national chain based in Denver, has been concentrating on California since the 1990s. It built two extensive networks, in the Bay Area and in Southern California, with dozens of small suburban papers and a few larger ones like The Oakland Tribune and The Los Angeles Daily News.
 But a complex set of deals in 2006 and 2007 greatly increased the company's California presence. They gave Mr. Singleton control of his two largest California papers, The Mercury News and the nearby Contra Costa Times; a string of small daily and weekly Bay Area papers; and The Daily Breeze, near Los Angeles.
 Mr. Singleton, 57, has assembled what was intended as his greatest achievement, an arc of papers around the Bay, dominating most of the region, with the Hearst Corporation's troubled San Francisco Chronicle in the middle. 
 ''We do make money, but I couldn't get into how much,'' said Mac Tully, publisher of The Mercury News. ''We're revenue-challenged, no question.'' Mr. Singleton said much the same about the company as a whole.
 The company does not publicly report financial data, but MediaNews executives acknowledge that its revenues, like the entire industry's, have fallen sharply. Last summer, the company negotiated new terms with its creditors, and paid down some debts.
 ''We still have more leverage than we wish we had,'' Mr. Singleton said. I don't know if we bought enough room for the long term or not, but we certainly believe we did.''
 At the peak of the dot-com boom, The Mercury News had more than $100 million a year in help-wanted classified ads; this year, executives say, the figure will be around $10 million.
 The paper's weekday circulation, 224,000, is 20 percent belowits 1990s high -- a fairly typical decline for the industry.
 It serves a fast-growing region, Santa Clara County, but immigration has driven that growth, making a tough market for an English-language paper. Half the adults in the county speak a language other than English at home, the Census Bureau reports, one of the highest levels of that phenomenon in the country.
 Many current and former Mercury News executives say that a lack of investment by Knight Ridder and MediaNews have given the paper a fairly ordinary Web site that has been slow to adopt practices that keep readers coming back many times a day, like publishing articles online well before they appear in print, updating them frequently, blogging and posting videos.
 ''The answer for newspapers has to lie in building their Web sites better and better, and promote, promote, promote,'' said Mr. Riggs, who was the Mercury News publisher under both companies. ''We haven't seen that.''
 Mr. Butler, the editor, said that with money tight, Web improvements have to wait. ''Until or unless we see that those things pay for themselves, we make a serious mistake in focusing too much on that,'' he said.
 He said that even in the heart of Silicon Valley, until recently his newsroom used a 14-year-old computer system that was incompatible with those at nearby MediaNews papers.
 ''And this building is pretty rundown,'' he said, waving his arm across a sprawling newsroom where some employees are surrounded by empty desks. The dinginess is made plain on his unadorned office walls, where lighter-colored rectangles show where pictures used to hang.
 In October, the company announced that it planned to sell the building and move to smaller quarters. This is a terrible time to be selling real estate -- or much of anything -- in the Bay Area, but executives say no deal would be complete until 2010, and by then everything might have changed.
 ''California has always been bigger than life, in the upturns and the downturns,'' Mr. Singleton said. ''This thing will turn around.''

HEADLINE: As Rates Near Zero, the Fed Turns to Unproven Methods

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Having printed more than $1 trillion in new money since September, yet still failing to stop the economy from sinking, the Federal Reserve is expected to enter a new era of cheap money this week. 
 On Tuesday, policy makers are expected to lower their target for the overnight federal funds rate to 0.5 percent, a record low.
 In itself, analysts said, the move will be anticlimactic. Because demand for interbank loans has been so low, the actual Fed rate has been close to zero for a month. The real change will be in how the Fed tries to fight the recession from here on. 
 After Tuesday, the Fed will have to resort to mostly untested tools for promoting growth, because it cannot reduce its benchmark interest rate below zero.
 Its goal will be to drive down borrowing costs wherever credit markets remain paralyzed. But the approach is much more complicated than raising or lowering a single rate, and it could have unintended consequences.
 Analysts say the current recession, which officially began a year ago, is all but certain to break the postwar record for duration, 16 months. But it could also set a record for depth. 
 The economy has already lost two million jobs this year. Analysts predict that unemployment, now 6.5 percent, could hit 9 percent by the end of next year.
 The Fed must now turn to an approach called ''quantitative easing,'' because it involves injecting money into the economy rather than aiming at an interest rate. The Fed has almost no experience with this approach.
 ''This is a whole new world,'' said Richard Berner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. ''You don't have a whole lot of historical precedent for knowing how this is going to work and what the unintended consequences could be.''
 The risks include provoking inflation or yet another speculative bubble. Economists generally agree that the Fed's long stretch of easy money from 2001 through 2004 contributed to the bubble in housing prices and the surge in reckless lending.
 For now, neither Fed officials nor most private economists see evidence of inflation or a bubble. If anything, forecasters are worried about the kind of deflation Japan experienced in the 1990s. 
 Indeed, the Japanese central bank used quantitative easing for years when Japan was mired in chronic price deflation and had reduced its benchmark interest rate to zero. The results were not good, and it took Japan nearly a decade to break out of the mire. 
 Although Fed officials have denied it, they actually began a form of quantitative easing months ago. Since the financial crisis erupted in August 2007, the Fed has created a raft of new lending programs that have lent hundreds of billions of dollars to banks, Wall Street firms and money market funds. 
 Until three months ago, the Fed financed that lending with its existing reserves, mostly Treasury securities. Because it was simply exchanging its cash or Treasury securities for hard-to-sell securities, the programs did not increase the total amount of money in the financial system.
 But since September, when the Fed started to run low on Treasuries, it has been creating new money at a blistering pace. As a result, the Fed's ''balance sheet'' has ballooned to just over $2 trillion last week from about $900 billion in September.

HEADLINE: Seeing Profit in Need to Locate a Toilet

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
A New York couple is betting on the idea that at least one thing is recession-proof: demand for a convenient and clean public toilet.
 SitOrSquat, an ad-supported Web site and mobile application created by Danika Landers and Jonathan Glanz, delivers a handy listing of public bathrooms in various cities, from the ones at Starbucks to Saks Fifth Avenue. The mobile version uses an iPhone or BlackBerry's location detection capability to find nearby bathrooms. ''Think of it as a restaurant review site, but for toilets,'' Mr. Glanz said. The site's database is generated by users, and people can add short descriptions and photos and indicate whether cleanliness levels make it advisable to ''sit'' or ''squat.'' 
 Ms. Landers, a 28-year-old graphic designer, came up with the idea. Mr. Glanz, who is a software engineer, developed an application for the iPhone, and the pair released it in early November.
 Since then, Ms. Landers says, the application has taken off. An estimated 25,000 users have downloaded it, and traffic on the Web site reached 1.2 million page views last month. That was enough to persuade Ms. Landers to quit her job of 18 months, giving up a salary of roughly $50,000 a year, to focus her efforts on SitOrSquat full time.
 In a start-up landscape that is rockier than ever for tech entrepreneurs, some see iPhone applications as something of a golden ticket. Tapulous, a group of iPhone application developers in Palo Alto, Calif., that has received venture capital backing, recently signed deals with the recording artists Weezer, Moby and Daft Punk to feature their tracks in its games.
 With more than 10,000 iPhone applications available for download in the iTunes store, the odds of a developer becoming an overnight success are slim. But at the very least, Ms. Landers says, the experience will be resume- and portfolio-bolstering. ''If I don't make it, this is me paying for a second education,'' she said, ''almost like grad school.'' Ms. Landers says she plans to give the venture four months before she starts looking for a job. JENNA WORTHAM COMMENTS
 Wow, good luck with that. Quitting a job to pursue an iPhone app is a level of confidence few mortals have. -- Tim, Dec. 11, 2008

HEADLINE: In Georgia, Stir Over Plan for Black Colleges

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
As Georgia faces a potential $2 billion budget deficit, a state senator has created a stir with a plan for reducing education spending: merge two historically black universities in Albany and Savannah with nearby mostly white institutions.
 The proposal was made this month by Seth Harp, a Republican who is the chairman of the State Senate Higher Education Committee, and quickly drew condemnation from many black educators, politicians and alumni. 
 But supporters say the plan would not only save millions of dollars but also reduce racial segregation in state-run universities. 
 ''Institutions supported by taxpayers should be diverse, educating men and women of all colors and creeds,'' wrote Cynthia Tucker, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial page editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, who is black. ''There is no longer good reason for public colleges that are all-white or all-black.''
 The plan appears unlikely to be adopted by the Georgia Board of Regents, in part because of the vocal opposition from black educators. 
 ''Historically black institutions play a vital role in the community, the state and the nation,'' said Dwayne Ashley, the president of the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund, which supports black colleges. ''They provide educations to a number of young men and women who might not otherwise attend college.''
 Research suggests that black students often perform better academically at historically black universities. These institutions, which are legally required to admit students of all races, achieve graduation rates similar to mostly white universities, even though they often admit students with less preparation, said Marybeth Gasman of the University of Pennsylvania, an expert in black higher education.
 Mr. Harp's plan would merge the historically black Savannah State University with Armstrong Atlantic State University, and the historically black Albany State University with Darton College. In both cases the black schools would keep their names.
 ''When you look at Savannah and Albany, those communities really need only one school each,'' Mr. Harp said. ''The fact that two of these schools are historically black has less to do with my proposal than the economics.''
 But he added, ''We really need to close the chapter of segregated schools and create a unified system.''
 The Board of Regents is not seriously considering the plan, said John Millsaps, a spokesman for the board. ''It's not really on the radar screen,'' he said. ''There's not a lot of traction. It's mainly a proposal by one individual.''
 But that did not stop an outpouring of opposition. Alumni and faculty members of the black universities sent letters of protest to the governor, and Ruby Sales, the founder of SpiritHouse Project, a social justice organization, drafted a petition to save the black schools.
 ''This proposal would continue a long history of white officials implementing an economic plan that disintegrates institutions in the black community,'' Ms. Sales said. ''Black educational history has been decimated under these types of desegregation plans.''
 Mr. Harp's proposal is not without precedent. During desegregation, white and black schools were routinely merged, including the landmark 1979 union between the historically white University of Tennessee campus in Nashville and the black Tennessee State University. 
 But Peter J. Sireno, the president of Darton College, said in a statement that the school was ''surprised by the idea suggested by Senator Harp.'' 
 ''It is my understanding that discussion of institutional mergers is not on the Board of Regents' agenda at this time,'' Mr. Sireno said. ''If and when it is on the agenda, we will address it at that time.''

 BODY:
A long and intense primary campaign, the chance to elect the first African-American or the first woman to the Oval Office, a general election played out as the country fought wars on two fronts while mired in a recession. All these events, and the coming 200th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, combined to form the right climate for books about American presidents and politics.
 Readers sought insight in many places, from books about candidates Hillary Rodman Clinton and John McCain to those about Presidents Eisenhower and Roosevelt.

HEADLINE: Jobs for Students

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 A Dec. 8 editorial did not mention a key reason it is vital for President-elect Barack Obama to boost opportunities for young workers. 
 For students, especially those from moderate- and low-income families, employment is a critical part of financing a higher education. 
 Here at Long Island University's Brooklyn Campus, for example, a vast majority of students hold down one or more jobs while taking classes, struggling to cover costs from meals and MetroCards to education expenses. They will be even more job-dependent if, as the New York Student Aid Alliance has warned, their state support becomes a victim of budget cuts.
 With the unemployment rate estimated to be four times greater for those without a college education, earning a degree is an imperative for reaching the American dream. Barack Obama must devise a jobs program that not only stimulates the economy but also prevents a deepening of the economy's educational divide.

HEADLINE: Taxes and Fees To Rise $4 Billion In Budget Plan

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and JEREMY W. PETERS; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson will propose a $4 billion package of taxes and fees on a range of items, from sugary soft drinks made by Coca-Cola and Pepsi to luxury items like furs and boats, when he unveils his plan to close a deficit that has ballooned to $15 billion, people with knowledge of the plan said on Sunday. 
 Higher taxes will also be imposed on health insurers and a sales tax exemption on clothing and footwear under $115 will be eliminated, though the administration will propose a two-week holiday for goods under $500, under the budget the governor will introduce on Tuesday.
 A number of fees will be increased, with users of the Department of Motor Vehicles and the state parks bearing much of the burden, people with knowledge of the plan said. Tuition at the State University of New York and the City University of New York will also be increased. 
 The governor's executive budget, which is subject to approval by the Legislature, is sure to touch off months of protests from an array of interest groups, as well as battles with lawmakers. 
 One element that Mr. Paterson left out of his budget was any broad-based tax increase affecting people in higher income brackets, a measure that some in Albany believed would be part of the plan. But ever since taking over as the state's chief executive in March, Mr. Paterson has steadfastly opposed raising income taxes as a way to prop up the state's worsening finances.
 Mr. Paterson said his plan is meant to fill a budget gap totaling $15 billion for the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, and the following fiscal year. State law requires that the budget be balanced.
 Mr. Paterson's plan relies most heavily on cuts -- roughly $9 billion, with the largest amounts aimed at state aid to education and Medicaid. The governor will also propose rollbacks of benefits for state workers, a measure that will almost certainly lead to a standoff with powerful public-employee unions. 
 The administration is also expected to propose eliminating the controversial Empire Zone program, which offers tax incentives for business development across the state, but has often been criticized for failing to deliver promised job growth. 
 ''It is just prohibitive and it's painful to have to make some of these decisions,'' Mr. Paterson said at an appearance on Sunday night in Manhattan. ''I've been forced to veto legislation that I've sponsored.'' 
 He called tuition increases at state schools ''a very hard step to take.''
 ''We're going to try to remediate that with some other services to the colleges and universities, but when a person whose whole career has basically been for the advocacy of higher education, such as myself, has to take that kind of step, it gives you an idea of what kind of a number $15 billion is.''
 Trying to put the best face on what will be a bleak budget year, the Paterson administration gave a limited budget briefing on Sunday in which administration officials discussed a small number of social initiatives whose financing would be increased. Several of the initiatives were aimed at helping the poor through what is certain to be a trying economic future. ''The nation and the state are in midst of the greatest economic crisis we have endured since the Great Depression, and there are families struggling to provide basic needs for their loved ones,'' the governor said in a statement on Sunday. 
 The most significant move was a proposed increase to welfare grants for the first time in 18 years, though more money would not be made available until the beginning of 2010. The administration plans to seek a 30 percent increase over three years, with the eventual cost of the increase exceeding $100 million a year.
 The basic welfare grant would eventually rise to $387 a month from $291 for a family of three, or $3,492 per year, where it has remained since 1990. 
 That the administration was pushing the measure foretold how little money was available this year; the increased welfare grants will have little impact on the budget for the coming fiscal year, which ends in March 2010. 
 The administration also said it would expand a state-financed health insurance program, Family Health Plus, to cover 19- and 20-year-olds who no longer live with their parents. Enrolling in such programs would also be made easier by, among other things, ending requirements for face-to-face interviews.
 Those who provided details about Mr. Paterson's plan did so on condition of anonymity because the plan has yet to be made public. In describing the fees on nondiet soft drinks, those familiar with Mr. Paterson's plan called them an ''obesity tax.'' 
 Expecting a protracted battle with lawmakers and interest groups, the governor is introducing his budget more than a month earlier than is traditional. Assembly leaders were expected to push for broader-based tax increases to offset cuts to social programs, and spent much of last year advocating tax increases for the richest New Yorkers. 
 One of the biggest obstacles Mr. Paterson will have to overcome is a Senate narrowly divided between Democrats and Republicans that has yet to settle on a leader for next year, amid continued wrangling among Democrats. 
 Hospitals, nursing homes and other health care centers, already pinched by the first round of budget cuts earlier this year, are bracing for a fight. 
 ''I expect it to be an unmitigated disaster for health care institutions in New York,'' Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said in an interview on Friday. ''I expect we will see a significant downsizing of the health care delivery system, and it's at a time when people can least afford the cutbacks.''
 Layoffs among health care workers are seen as likely. A recent survey by the Health Care Association of New York State found that 18 percent of hospitals are considering letting employees go to cope with their financial problems, 30 percent are weighing service cuts and 68 percent are contemplating scaling back improvement projects.
 ''Our hospital system is already short nurses, lab technicians and physicians,'' said Dan Sisto, president of the health care association, a hospital advocacy group. ''So it's very difficult to cut back on a labor force that is already complaining about being shorthanded.''
 Education advocates offered a similarly bleak view.
 ''We understand there will be cuts,'' Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said on Friday. ''The real question is, will there be cuts, not just cuts against growth, but real cuts that will turn back the clock?'' 
 Billy Easton, executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, an advocacy group, agreed. ''School districts now have to plan that they're not going to get the money that's due to them.''
 Education advocates are particularly concerned that the depth of the expected cuts will risk core educational programs and not just extracurricular activities, which are often the first to be slashed when budgets tighten.
 ''It takes a lot to help make sure there's programs for kids,'' Ms. Weingarten said, ''but it takes very little to have this whole thing collapse.''

HEADLINE: Questions for Mr. Geithner

 BODY:
Timothy Geithner, President-elect Barack Obama's choice for Treasury secretary, has some explaining to do. 
 As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. Geithner was a key decision maker last September when the government let Lehman Brothers fail and then, two days later, bailed out the insurer American International Group for $85 billion. 
 Those decisions proved cataclysmic. The markets and the economy have yet to recover from Lehman's failure. The bailout of A.I.G. dealt a further blow to the Fed's credibility -- and, by extension, Mr. Geithner's -- because it was an abrupt reversal from the no-new-bailouts stance that had applied to Lehman and, initially, to A.I.G. Together, the decisions showed that several months into the financial crisis, officials lacked the information and the insight to correctly call the shots. 
 Making matters worse, the Fed and the Treasury have now changed their story about how the calamity unfolded. No one expects a perfect performance in the thick of a crisis. But an after-the-fact revision of what happened at best raises questions and worse, looks like an attempt to dodge accountability. 
 In testimony before Congress on Sept. 24, about a week after Lehman's collapse, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave an accounting consistent with comments and news coverage at the time. ''The Federal Reserve and the Treasury declined to commit public funds to support the institution,'' he said. He said that the failure of Lehman posed risks but that the firm's troubles had been well known for some time and investors recognized that bankruptcy was a significant possibility. ''Thus,'' he said, ''we judged that investors and counterparties had had time to take precautionary measures.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke said Lehman's default, ''while perhaps manageable in itself,'' combined with the ''unexpectedly rapid collapse of A.I.G.'' to create a global financial tempest. In other words, Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Geithner and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson believed the system was stable enough to withstand Lehman's downfall. 
 The story changed as they were proved wrong and as the government's obligations to prop up the financial system rose precipitously. In a speech on Dec. 1, Mr. Bernanke said ''legal constraints'' had prevented the Fed from rescuing Lehman, making a bankruptcy ''unavoidable.'' Translation: Not our fault!
 The law allows the Fed to make emergency loans when the financial system is in danger, provided that the lending is ''indorsed or otherwise secured'' to its satisfaction. The Fed has accepted all manner of dubious assets in exchange for its various loans as the crisis has deepened. In a speech on Oct. 15 and in his Dec. 1 speech, however, Mr. Bernanke said Lehman's collateral was insufficient. Secretary Paulson also invoked a lack-of-legal-authority argument in a speech last month to explain Lehman's demise. Why didn't they say so at the time?
 Mr. Geithner has made few public comments during the serial crises, but a spokesman for the New York Fed recently disputed this page's characterization that the Fed ''allowed'' Lehman to fail, saying -- you guessed it -- that the Fed had no legal authority to intervene. 
 The lack-of-legal-authority line also surfaced in video interviews by Fortune magazine of executives at its recent Fortune 500 conference. Peter Peterson, the co-founder of the private equity firm Blackstone Group and a former chairman of Lehman Brothers, was asked about the prevailing view that Lehman's collapse was ''the straw that broke the camel's back.'' 
 Mr. Peterson said he had talked to Mr. Geithner about that and was told that the Fed did not have the authority to intervene. Mr. Peterson suggested that the media might want to explore the issue in more depth, ''before there is too much criticism of what Mr. Geithner's role was.'' He added: ''You can probably see I'm a little defensive about Geithner. I was involved in picking him'' to lead the New York Fed.
 The burden is on Mr. Geithner to clear up the matter. If legal constraints precluded a Fed intervention in Lehman, why weren't they mentioned at the time? Did Fed officials consider asking Congress for the necessary authority? There was plenty of time to do so because, as Mr. Bernanke noted last September, the collapse of Lehman was a long time coming. 
 In the absence of an explanation, the changing Lehman story seems like an attempt to deflect public attention from what could go down in history as an epic blunder. It also reinforces the impression of bias created by the disparate treatment of Lehman and A.I.G. Lehman was left to die, while A.I.G.'s counterparties were saved.
 The revised version of the story (in which there is no disparate treatment, only officials following the letter of the law in each case) sidesteps questions about whether the bailout of A.I.G. -- arranged by Mr. Geithner -- was influenced by the specific needs of some of the insurer's counterparties, like Goldman Sachs. 
 The Times's Gretchen Morgenson reported that Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman, was the only Wall Street executive at a meeting at the New York Federal Reserve on Sept. 15 to discuss the A.I.G. bailout. A Goldman spokesman said Mr. Blankfein was not there to represent his firm's interests, but rather that Goldman ''engaged'' the issue because of the implications to the entire system. 
 Adding to the opacity, the Fed recently decided to keep confidential one of two reports that it made to Congress on the A.I.G. bailout. If the Fed had not insisted on confidentiality, that report would have been made public.
 Mr. Geithner should be asked at his confirmation hearing to explain which firms were threatened by an A.I.G. collapse, in what amounts and how those entanglements justify an ongoing bailout. Mr. Geithner must also explain how such entanglements came to be the norm on his watch. His answers will help shed light on whether he is sufficiently distant from Wall Street to reform a system that has proved catastrophically unstable.

HEADLINE: A Church in Guantanamo

BYLINE: By Roger Cohen

DATELINE: GUANTANAMO, Cuba 

 BODY:
 I confess that I came here for the dateline. It beats Dusseldorf or Lille. Like Sarajevo or Falluja, it is one of those datelines that incline a reader onward.
 I was in Santiago de Cuba, where the 50th anniversary of Fidel Castro's revolution will be celebrated on Jan. 1. It was hot, nobody knew if the ailing Fidel would appear, nor where exactly the festivities would take place. I thought, I'll drive out to, you never know.
 The night before I left, a band showed up on the terrace of my Santiago hotel and played ''Guantanemara,'' the wistful melody about the peasant girl from Guantanamo. I thought it strange that a place once associated with a love song now summons grim images of George W. Bush's war on terror. 
 Guantanemara: once I heard it, I couldn't get the chorus out my head. Would some proud, sultry-eyed woman fit the image? Purposeless journeys bring pleasant surprises. Yes, I'd go to Guantanamo for a glimpse of the U.S. naval base and whatever else I might find. 
 It's a two-hour drive from Santiago, complicated by the absence of road signs, a Cuban idiosyncrasy. I went past the town to a hillside where the bay glimmered silver and the U.S. control tower glinted far away. What a place for bunch of Yemenis to end up.
 On the way back to Guantanamo, I gave a ride to a woman who told me she worked in a prison in Havana for $20 a month and had come here to visit her children, whom she had entrusted to her mother after a painful divorce.
 I asked her if she'd like to leave Cuba. ''No,'' she said, ''but I'd like to have relatives abroad sending me money!''
 In Guantanamo, we pulled up by the main plaza. Dusk was falling. Old folk sat on benches under the palms. I set out across the square with its lengthening shadows toward a whitewashed church, Santa Catalina de Ricci, whose heavy wooden doors were flung open.
 A surprise awaited me. The church was full. A young priest in luminous green vestments was holding Mass. His words met me as I entered: ''La Misa es siempre un encuentro con Dios'' -- ''Mass is always an encounter with God.''
 I am a stranger to faith. Yet a wave of physical relief swept over me. After 10 days in Cuba, with its hymns to the heroism of Fidel, Che Guevara, the Revolution and socialism, the priest seemed a merciful figure. Instead of the deification of Fidel and the utopian perfectibility of mankind, he posited human fallibility and consoling salvation.
 Graham Greene's masterpiece, ''The Power and the Glory,'' came to me, with its condemned priest in his cell: ''When you visualized a man or woman carefully, you could always begin to feel pity -- that was a quality God's image carried with it.''
 I was spellbound, standing in the doorway, a breeze coming in. Cuba's relations with the Catholic Church have improved in recent years, especially since the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1998. Atheism has ceased to be a revolutionary tenet. 
 The priest began to tell the Parable of the Talents. How a wealthy man, parting on a journey, gave five talents to one of his servants, two to another, and one to a third. And the servant with five talents invested wisely and earned another five. And the servant with two talents did the same, also doubling his money. But the third, fearful of his master, hid the talent in the ground and earned nothing.
 And the first two enter ''into the joy of thy lord,'' but the third ''wicked and slothful'' servant is cast into ''outer darkness.''
 ''Where is this parable told?'' the priest asked.
 A child's hand shot up. ''Saint Matthew!''
 The child was right. But what of this parable in a land where there's nothing to invest in? Was it a ''free-enterprise parable,'' as John Howard, the former conservative prime minister of Australia once called it, a reminder that if you are given assets you must add to them, just as if you are entrusted with the word of God, you must spread that word?
 Or was it, rather, a parable about the cost of standing up to authority, of being a whistle-blower like the third servant, who calls his master a ''hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown?'' Was it about the courage to face down totalitarianism and its rich apparatchiks?
 I wondered, but preferred mystery to answers. I'd seen America's Guantanamo prison. I'd felt the suffering of the woman in the car. I'd left New York's financial disaster, based on greed for redoubled assets, and found the economic ravages of Cuba's head-in-the-ground Communism.
 Yes, pity. And if this priest had the power to turn the wafer into the flesh and blood of God, and if the people gathered here believed that and were consoled, I was ready to bow my head in silence.
 That, it seemed, was why I had come to Guantanamo.

HEADLINE: European Crass Warfare

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
So here's the situation: the economy is facing its worst slump in decades. The usual response to an economic downturn, cutting interest rates, isn't working. Large-scale government aid looks like the only way to end the economic nosedive. 
 But there's a problem: conservative politicians, clinging to an out-of-date ideology -- and, perhaps, betting (wrongly) that their constituents are relatively well positioned to ride out the storm -- are standing in the way of action. 
 No, I'm not talking about Bob Corker, the Senator from Nissan -- I mean Tennessee -- and his fellow Republicans, who torpedoed last week's attempt to buy some time for the U.S. auto industry. (Why was the plan blocked? An e-mail message circulated among Senate Republicans declared that denying the auto industry a loan was an opportunity for Republicans to ''take their first shot against organized labor.'')
 I am, instead, talking about Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and her economic officials, who have become the biggest obstacles to a much-needed European rescue plan.
 The European economic mess isn't getting very much attention here, because we're understandably focused on our own problems. But the world's other economic superpower -- America and the European Union have roughly the same G.D.P. -- is arguably in as much trouble as we are. 
 The most acute problems are on Europe's periphery, where many smaller economies are experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in Latin America and Asia: Latvia is the new Argentina; Ukraine is the new Indonesia. But the pain has also reached the big economies of Western Europe: Britain, France, Italy and, the biggest of all, Germany. 
 As in the United States, monetary policy -- cutting interest rates in an effort to perk up the economy -- is rapidly reaching its limit. That leaves, as the only way to avert the worst slump since the Great Depression, the aggressive use of fiscal policy: increasing spending or cutting taxes to boost demand. Right now everyone sees the need for a large, pan-European fiscal stimulus.
 Everyone, that is, except the Germans. Mrs. Merkel has become Frau Nein: if there is to be a rescue of the European economy, she wants no part of it, telling a party meeting that ''we're not going to participate in this senseless race for billions.'' 
 Last week Peer Steinbruck, Mrs. Merkel's finance minister, went even further. Not content with refusing to develop a serious stimulus plan for his own country, he denounced the plans of other European nations. He accused Britain, in particular, of engaging in ''crass Keynesianism.'' 
 Germany's leaders seem to believe that their own economy is in good shape, and in no need of major help. They're almost certainly wrong about that. The really bad thing, however, isn't their misjudgment of their own situation; it's the way Germany's opposition is preventing a common European approach to the economic crisis.
 To understand the problem, think of what would happen if, say, New Jersey were to attempt to boost its economy through tax cuts or public works, without this state-level stimulus being part of a nationwide program. Clearly, much of the stimulus would ''leak'' away to neighboring states, so that New Jersey would end up with all of the debt while other states got many if not most of the jobs. 
 Individual European countries are in much the same situation. Any one government acting unilaterally faces the strong possibility that it will run up a lot of debt without creating much domestic employment.
 For the European economy as a whole, however, this kind of leakage is much less of a problem: two-thirds of the average European Union member's imports come from other European nations, so that the continent as a whole is no more import-dependent than the United States. This means that a coordinated stimulus effort, in which each country counts on its neighbors to match its own efforts, would offer much more bang for the euro than individual, uncoordinated efforts.
 But you can't have a coordinated European effort if Europe's biggest economy not only refuses to go along, but heaps scorn on its neighbors' attempts to contain the crisis.
 Germany's big Nein won't last forever. Last week Ifo, a highly respected research institute, warned that Germany will soon be facing its worst economic crisis since the 1940s. If and when this happens, Mrs. Merkel and her ministers will surely reconsider their position. 
 But in Europe, as in the United States, the issue is time. Across the world, economies are sinking fast, while we wait for someone, anyone, to offer an effective policy response. How much damage will be done before that response finally comes?

HEADLINE: Sometimes, It Takes A Scandal

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For the last few years, newspapers have been smacked around for lacking relevance, but the industry has finally found a compelling spokesman: Rod R. Blagojevich, Democratic governor of Illinois.
 According to the criminal complaint that the United States attorney filed, Governor Blagojevich, while allegedly trying to set a price for a United States Senate seat, also spent a significant amount of time going after the press, especially The Chicago Tribune, whose editorial page had been calling for his impeachment. 
 The governor said he would withhold financial assistance from the Tribune Company in its effort to sell Wrigley Field unless the newspaper got rid of the editorial writers. ''Our recommendation is fire all those [expletive] people, get 'em the [expletive] out of there and get us some editorial support,'' he told his chief of staff, John Harris. 
 Who says the modern American newspaper doesn't matter? 
 There is no evidence that Sam Zell, the chief executive of the Tribune Company, or any of his colleagues followed through on Mr. Blagojevich's demand for retribution. (Gerould Kern, editor of The Chicago Tribune, told me Sunday, ''Since I have been editor, I have not been pressured in any way on our coverage of the governor, our editorial page positions or the staffing of our editorial board.'')
 The Tribune Company has acknowledged that that the company received a subpoena, but declined to comment further. 
 In a city and state where corruption is knit into the political fabric, a solvent daily paper would seem to be a civic necessity. But if another governor goes bad in Illinois -- a likely circumstance given the current investigation and the fact that the last governor, George Ryan, is serving six and a half years on corruption charges -- what if the local paper were too diminished to do the job? 
 It is not an academic issue. Last week, it was reported that the two daily newspapers in Detroit, a city whose politicians have been known to get their hands in the till as soon as voters pull the lever, will cease home delivery on most days of the week, printing a pared-down version for newsstands, with cuts in staff to match.
 And last Monday, the day before Mr. Blagojevich and Mr. Harris were arrested, the Tribune Company, which has almost $13 billion in debt, filed for bankruptcy protection. It was less than a year after Mr. Zell, a man with a fondness for distressed assets, took control of the Tribune chain -- which owned 11 other newspapers, including The Los Angeles Times, and 23 television stations -- in a deal structured around an employee stock ownership plan that involved $8 billion in new debt.
 Things have not gone as planned since then. The worst ad recession since the Depression, combined with that crushing debt, has compelled the company to sell assets -- Newsday, a daily newspaper in Long Island, was sold last spring for $650 million -- and cut staff. The Chicago Tribune newsroom, which had a staff of 670 in 2005, has gone through several rounds of cutbacks and buyouts that left the newsroom with 480 employees. 
 Some of the losses have been dear. This summer, Maurice Possley, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the paper's premier criminal justice reporter, left, in part because he didn't believe the newspaper was still interested in the kind of long-form investigative stories he worked on. 
 Last month, John Crewdson, another Pulitzer-winning reporter, was laid off from the newspaper's Washington bureau. Two of the newspaper's five staff members who covered state government full-time are now gone. Ann Marie Lipinski, the newspaper's editor and a longtime enabler of The Chicago Tribune's journalistic aggression, left last summer, and in September, a redesign with fewer articles arrayed over less space was put in place.
 Almost since the day Mr. Blagojevich took office, The Tribune has shown readers that the governor's primary interest was not always the public interest. And the paper's reporting helped expose the outside clout of Antoin Rezko, the convicted fixer with ties to both Mr. Blagojevich and President-elect Barack Obama. 
 Although much of the current investigation is being led by the office of the United States attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, the newspaper did its own work, including pointing out that the governor's wife, Patti, received over $700,000 in real estate commissions, with much of the money coming from people who did business with the state. In the indictment, she too pays tribute to the newspaper's effectiveness, shouting in the background as her husband talked about Tribune.
 ''Hold up that [expletive] Cubs [expletive],'' she said. ''[Expletive] them.''
 It is the highest sort of compliment, if rather profane. 
 This week, Dan Mihalopoulos, Ray Long, John Chase, David Kidwell and others at the paper continued to work every angle on the Blagojevich investigation, and follow some of their own. But some people at the newspaper, and those who have left, wonder whether The Tribune's commitment to covering corruption is sustainable.
 ''I couldn't be prouder of the people that are there and the job that they have done,'' said David Jackson, an investigative reporter who worked on the Rezko coverage and is now on a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard. ''But both as a citizen and a journalist, you have to wonder whether the paper will have the resources moving forward to continue to do that work. I am worried that the paper will be so diminished under Zell that it won't be able to play that role.''
 Mr. Crewdson, who had worked in the Washington bureau, was not so concerned.
 In an e-mail message, he said the financial condition of his former paper would not ''have kept Fitzgerald from finding out what he wanted to know and going wherever he wanted to go.''
 Financial problems aside, Mr. Zell has publicly ridiculed the focus on long-term investigative projects, telling a New York investors' conference, ''I haven't figured out how to cash in a Pulitzer Prize.'' 
 In a speech last month at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, James Warren, a former managing editor of the paper who was asked to leave after a new editor was appointed, denounced the shift away from investigative efforts. 
 ''Journalistically, it is hard, even impossible, to imagine the current Tribune hierarchy, bent on what it sees as more 'utilitarian' and locally 'relevant' work, championing such a time-consuming, original and inherently catalytic effort,'' he said.
 Mr. Kern, the current editor, said that this week confirmed that The Tribune had the conviction and muscle to cover its backyard aggressively.
 ''This was an extraordinary week for The Chicago Tribune,'' he said. ''On Monday, the company filed for bankruptcy protection, and on Tuesday, this huge story broke. There are two messages there. One, that the business model has to be reinvented and two, the importance of doing public service reporting. In the future, we will be doing fewer things and doing them better, and this kind of reporting will be a pillar of what we continue to do.'' 
 Mr. Possley, who left the newspaper last summer, said he was encouraged that someone, at least the current governor of Illinois, felt that the biggest daily in Chicago was important, however reduced its circumstance.
 ''What The Tribune was doing with its reporting and on its opinion page was clearly a source of deep concern to Blagojevich and in a sense, you love to see that,'' he said. ''You have to worry when they start not to care. Then they begin to act as if they are in a vacuum, and that won't be good for anyone.''

 A DEFENSE SECRETARY
 Serving Two Bosses
 Robert M. Gates is making a transition of his own, from secretary of defense under President Bush to the same role under President-elect Barack Obama. He admitted that working under two commanders in chief would not be without certain strains, but a recent trip to Afghanistan by Mr. Gates indicated that Mr. Obama would be continuing much of the Bush administration's latest policies in Iraq and Afghanistan, at least for now.

 SOMALI LEADER FIRES PRIME MINISTER
 President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed of Somalia announced that he was unilaterally firing the prime minister because he had ''failed to accomplish his duties'' -- despite the fact that the country's transitional charter says that only Parliament can do so. The bickering has thrown Somalia's beleaguered government, and the nation itself, into further disarray. PAGE A12

 Defying Terror and Hanging Out
 The Leopold Cafe in Mumbai has become something of a shrine to the defiance of terrorism. Six customers and two waiters were killed there during the attacks two weeks ago, and the cafe, long popular with tourists and now scarred by holes from bullets and shrapnel, has been filled with locals and is often standing-room only.

 Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain shuttled from India to Pakistan in an attempt to defuse tensions between the two countries. But he also demanded that Pakistan do more to stop terrorism, saying, ''The time has come for action, and not words.'' PAGE A10
 RUSSIAN PROTESTERS DETAINED
 Dozens of protesters were taken in by the Russian police for trying to hold an unsanctioned rally in Moscow. The demonstration was meant as a protest of the Kremlin's handling of the financial crisis, as well as its plans to change the Constitution to extend presidential and parliamentary term limits -- which critics say could lead to Vladimir V. Putin's return to the presidency. PAGE A8

 STIR OVER PLAN FOR BLACK COLLEGES
 A Republican state senator in Georgia has created a stir with a plan to reduce spending by merging two historically black universities with nearby mostly white institutions.

 With his record sixth Billabong Pipeline Masters victory in hand, the surfer Kelly Slater reflected on the recent past, and on the future. At 36, he has a companion whom he misses while on tour, a budding interest in surfboard design and nothing left to prove. And so the almost inevitable thought: ''Right now would be a great time to retire and just watch from the sidelines.'' After all, it would not be the first time. PAGE D2

 The game, and perhaps the season, was saved in the last two minutes when the defensive lineman Shaun Ellis picked up a fumble by the Buffalo quarterback J. P. Losman and rumbled into the end zone. So the Jets won 31-27 on a heroic play by someone who a week ago was arrested and charged with speeding, driving without proof of insurance and possession of marijuana. Is all forgiven?

HEADLINE: As the Economy Falters, Obama's Goodwill Grows

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
The six weeks after Election Day have produced an extraordinary juxtaposition: the worse things have become for the country, the better they've become for President-elect Barack Obama.
 Since Mr. Obama defeated John McCain for the presidency, the federal government has been forced to bail out another huge financial institution, Citigroup. The Labor Department announced that employers cut 533,000 jobs in November. 
 Now major American auto companies teeter on the brink. Some in Congress and the business community alike have criticized the president-elect as being passive as he continues a genial transition process with the outgoing President Bush. 
 Yet while Mr. Bush remains saddled with rock-bottom approval ratings, Mr. Obama floats above a bleak political landscape. Polls show his performance during the transition is receiving the approval of 7 in 10 Americans, including a majority of Republicans.
 ''People need to have hope,'' said Bill McInturff, the Republican pollster who advised Mr. McCain's campaign this fall. ''They want this guy to succeed because they are so concerned with the direction of the country.''
 That goodwill represents a formidable asset -- so long as it lasts. But history suggests this fortunate phase for Mr. Obama will prove temporary.
 Historical Parallels
 Before the age of polarization, Americans often swung behind new presidents in overwhelming numbers. Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter also received approval ratings comparable to Mr. Obama's in their first weeks in office.
 Today's sharper partisan differences make that much harder to achieve. Ronald Reagan, the first President Bush, Bill Clinton and Mr. Bush all made their debuts at more-modest approval levels.
 Both Presidents Bush experienced periods of near consensus support. ''But that was more of a rally-round-the-flag effect,'' said Fred Steeper, a pollster who advised each of them. Bush 41 rose in response to the Persian Gulf war; Bush 43 rose after the national shock of the 9/11 attacks.
 Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, sees evidence of an economic version of that 9/11 response in the most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey, which he conducted with Mr. McInturff. Nearly half of those polled called 2008 one of the worst years for the United States, 9 in 10 said the economy had deteriorated, and 7 in 10 criticized the federal government's handling of the economic crisis. 
 Set against those harsh judgments are majority support for Mr. Obama's appointments, values and ability to deliver change. ''He speaks with confidence,'' Mr. Steeper said. ''You get a sense of confidence from him. He has a friendly smile. You like to watch him.''
 Reagan displayed similar characteristics. Mr. Steeper sees a more fitting parallel with Kennedy, another charismatic Democrat who entered the White House with an attractive young family.
 That goodwill will hardly vanish immediately once Mr. Obama moves into the White House and inherits an overstuffed briefcase of national problems from Mr. Bush. He can expect instant dividends when he raises his hand to take the oath of office on Jan. 20; by making history as the first black person to be elected president, he will alter perceptions of the nation's highest office within the United States and around the world.
 Preserving Momentum
 So far, Mr. Obama has carefully tended his popularity -- resigning his Senate seat quickly, prodding Congress and the Bush administration intermittently, affirming that America has ''one president at a time.'' Even after taking office, said Mark Penn, a top adviser to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's primary campaign and the Clinton White House before that, Mr. Obama will ''be judged on the hope of what he will do'' for his first year as president.
 So Mr. Obama's team intends to capitalize on his standing quickly with a huge economic stimulus package that will encompass his tax cut, infrastructure and alternative energy goals. The key to preserving the new president's momentum, said John D. Podesta, his transition director, is for him to be ''passionate and active and productive.''
 But three factors may gradually change the lens through which Mr. Obama is judged. One is the approach of midterm elections in 2010, as voters begin to associate their economic circumstances with Mr. Obama's stewardship rather than Mr. Bush's.
 Another is Mr. Obama's choice of which parts of his agenda to pursue -- and when. Pursuing tax increases on the affluent or his pledge to make union organizing easier, for instance, would sharpen partisan lines with Republicans. Just last week, Senate Republicans found the United Automobile Workers an inviting target in their successful battle to stop legislation to bail out the auto companies. 
 The third is external events that no president can plan for. The arrest last week of Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois has generated questions, though not accusations of wrongdoing, of Obama aides about their contacts with the governor's office concerning the appointment to Mr. Obama's vacant Senate seat. Even if answered satisfactorily, those questions underscore Mr. Obama's imperative to capitalize on his standing while it lasts.

HEADLINE: At the Apollo, a Theater Gets Religion

BYLINE: By A. E. VELEZ

 BODY:
In a neighborhood with no shortage of places to worship, a new religious service may not draw much attention. But when the program is in one of the best-known venues in Harlem -- the Apollo Theater -- and focuses on realities like the economy, people take notice.
 Led by a prominent local minister, the Rev. Dr. Suzan D. Johnson Cook, the nondenominational worship series, called Harlem Hallelujah, began on Sunday, drawing more than 800 people to the Apollo. 
 Until now, the closest event to a religious service hosted on the heralded stage may have been the funeral for James Brown. ''It was inevitable that church would come to the Apollo,'' said Nina Flowers, a spokeswoman for the Apollo. 
 To Dr. Cook, it is the season for change. 
 ''It's an idea whose time has come, just like our new president,'' she said. 
 Known to many as Dr. Sujay, Dr. Cook was the first woman appointed chaplain of the New York City Police Department, the only religious leader appointed to President Bill Clinton's Initiative on Race and the first black woman to be elected a senior pastor in the 200-year history of the American Baptist Church. 
 ''She's on the cutting edge of prophetic ministry,'' the Rev. Johnnie G. McCann of St. Luke's Baptist Church of Harlem told a congregation at the John Street United Methodist Church on Wednesday, where Dr. Cook has led ''Wonderful Wall Street Wednesdays'' services since 2001. 
 Her ministry combined an energetic punch and an elegant poise. At a recent Wall Street Wednesday service, chords trickled from the piano, the choir broke into another refrain, and syncopated claps from the crowd broke free of cadence as they swelled into a clamor, roaring through Dr. Cook's encouragement: ''We need to turn our 401(k)'s into 401(j)'s!'' she said, with an emphasis on the ''j,'' for Jesus.
 ''People need spiritual translation -- other than the King James Bible -- that applies to their realities,'' said Dr. Cook, who was an adviser to President-elect Barack Obama's campaign. ''Twenty-first century ministry has to have the same 'change' and relevancy that Obama's campaign had. Both our finances and our faith need revival.'' 
 To that end, Dr. Cook will host her hourlong services with no dress codes and no liturgical expectations in the Apollo, a celebrated New York landmark that has survived hardships of all kinds, including the 1968 riots and its own bankruptcy.
 ''Let us thank Dr. Sujay for bringing God into the Apollo Theater,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, addressing the crowd on Sunday. ''Although these are hard economic times, we have hope and prayer to keep us on.'' 
 In the last five years, Harlem has seen a surge of private investment from firms like A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers, but the recent recession has had a serious impact, affecting even the Apollo's long-running Amateur Night, a program that, while not in jeopardy, is currently sponsored in part by the failed Washington Mutual bank. And the tightening credit market has wounded brownstone makeovers in the neighborhood and small business openings along 125th Street. 
 The services on Sunday were a way for Harlem to help itself; some of the proceeds went to the Multi-Ethnic Youth Center, which is run by the Bronx Christian Fellowship Baptist Church, where Dr. Cook is the pastor. Future services will be offered free on Sundays at 11 a.m. through the spring at the theater on West 125th Street.

HEADLINE: Afghanistan and Neighbors Discuss Close Cooperation

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Afghanistan and most of its neighbors agreed at an informal conference here on Sunday to work together to stabilize the country, restrict narcotics traffic and coordinate action against terrorist groups.
 The conference of foreign ministers, organized by France, was aimed at shoring up regional relations in the interest of security and stability.
 ''There is a consensus that there can be no peace, security and prosperity in Afghanistan without the strong involvement of its neighbors,'' the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said after the meeting. ''And there can be no peace, security and prosperity for the region without a stable Afghanistan.'' 
 But the notable absence of Iran left a gaping hole in French hopes for the meeting. Though Iran had said its foreign minister would attend -- then said no, then said yes and then said it would be represented by its ambassador to France -- no Iranian official showed up, according to the French Foreign Ministry spokesman, Eric Chevallier. 
 ''It's unfortunate, but when nobody showed up this morning, everyone sat down to work,'' Mr. Chevallier said. ''No one explained why.'' 
 Iran was annoyed with the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, for remarks he made last week criticizing constant threats by Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, against Israel. It may be that with Iranian elections coming in June, it was more politic for the Iranian foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, to stay home.
 The conference was meant to bring together all the countries touching on Afghanistan, including former Soviet republics like Turkmenistan and Tajikistan as well as China, India and Pakistan. Held behind closed doors at the Foreign Ministry residence at La Celle-St.-Cloud, west of Paris, the conference also included the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, Kai Eide, and senior European Union officials responsible for foreign policy and aid.
 Germany, which provides significant financial backing for NATO operations in Afghanistan, was also invited, and it will be asked to do more on the ground there, with civilian and police trainers, if not with many more troops. Russia also attended, along with all countries with troops in Afghanistan, including the United States and Britain.
 With President-elect Barack Obama vowing to increase the number of troops and civilian advisers substantially to try to stabilize Afghanistan, the French, who hold the European Union presidency until the end of the year, wanted to present a forward-looking European initiative, French officials said. 
 Although Iran did not attend, Pakistan, another critical player in the region, did. Pakistan has been accused of not doing enough to prevent cross-border operations by the Taliban, and NATO convoys and supply depots for the military effort in Afghanistan have recently been attacked in Pakistan itself. 
 On Sunday in Bahrain, Gen. David H. Petraeus, head of American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the problems in Pakistan brought ''new urgency'' to finding alternate supply routes through the ''stans'' of Central Asia: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 
 The Paris conference also provided an opportunity for a high-level diffusion of tensions between India and Pakistan after the terrorist attacks on Mumbai last month, which have been linked to a Pakistani militant group. 
 Pakistan's foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said at the meeting that the siege ''was an attack on us all'' and promised to do more to stop terrorism, a French official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in accord with normal diplomatic practice.
 An Indian minister of state for external affairs, Anand Sharma, called for ''effective, visible and coordinated cooperation,'' the French official said. 
 The conference became more detailed on economic regional cooperation, officials reported, with the European Commission offering to host a meeting of economic experts to prepare better for a regional economic conference planned for Islamabad, Pakistan, early next year.
 A French official, in answer to a question, said that issues of the Afghan government's competence and reputation for corruption ''did come up, in the context of the interests of the Afghans themselves.'' Neighbors and allies all wanted ''better compliance and implementation of programs,'' the official said.

 WARSHIPS FROM SEVERAL NATIONS
 Are No Match for Pirates in Skiffs
 The sailors from the half-dozen nations hunting Somali pirates in the Arabian Sea may feel as if they are tanks attacking toothpicks. The pirates are stunningly low-tech, with machine guns, fiberglass skiffs and perhaps a few rocket-propelled grenades. But the toothpicks are winning, earning more than $120 million this year in ransom payments and consistently evading the authorities. Page A6 
 BRITAIN'S (SMALL) TROOP INCREASE
 Britain has the second-largest troop presence in Afghanistan, behind the United States. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has announced an increase of 300 troops, bringing the total to 8,300. The small increase may be a sign that President-elect Barack Obama may find it hard to persuade NATO to increase troop levels in Afghanistan. Page A6 
 PHILIPPINE FERRY ACCIDENT KILLS 23
 A ferry off the coast of the Philippines capsized, and of the 120 passengers, 23 are dead and 33 are unaccounted for. The vice admiral of the Philippine Coast Guard promised that criminal charges would be filed against the ferry's owners for overloading it, as the boat was authorized to carry only 50 passengers.

It's called the greatest friend of Portugal -- the fish is nearly a national symbol. Bacalhau's history is not in question, but its future is as modern methods makes it far easier to freeze the fish. Quotas on cod fishing have driven up its price and turned it into a luxury rather than a staple. Page A8 
 IRAQ COURT MISSES MARK, PANEL SAYS
 Iraq's central criminal court was created in 2003 by a United States-led coalition to deal with serious offenses, including terrorism, and according to a report by Human Rights Watch, it fails to meet Iraqi and international constitutional standards. The report tells a story of people held, sometimes for years, without seeing a judge and defendants are abused while in custody. Page A14 
 ISRAEL EXPELS U.N. INVESTIGATOR
 Israel expelled Richard Falk, a United Nations investigator of human rights, and denied him entrance to the Palestinian territories, putting him on the first flight to Geneva. An Israeli spokesman said that Mr. Falk was told that his entry would be barred given what was described as his hostile position toward Israel. He has been criticized for what Israelis call his unfair views, and has described the treatment of the Palestinians by Israel as akin to Nazi atrocities. Page A14

 TIPS FROM THE POTLATCH, WHERE GIVING KNOWS NO SLUMP
 Common sense says useless gifts and lavish presents have no place in a crunched economy. But take the Kwakwaka'wakw Indians of British Columbia. They are famous for the potlatch, a gift-giving ceremony vital to their society. Courtesy of Kwakwaka'wakw elders are just a few of the lessons that John Tierney found for dealing with the holiday mess:
 Simplify and economize: ''Chief Cranmer will be shopping for 1,000 guests, but he makes it sound easy. He buys in bulk and goes for a lot of basic items.''
 Turnabout is fair play: '' Returning a gift was done routinely in the old potlatches; the donors didn't object as long as it was accompanied by an interest payment that might be 100 percent per year.'' 
 Share the wealth: Despite objections raised by Joe the Plumber, at potlatches, ''In return for recognizing the greatness of the host chief, the low-status guests were given food and gifts without any expectation of repayment.''

HEADLINE: Global Car Industry Fearful for Detroit

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: MUNICH 

 BODY:
For years, the overseas operations of Ford and General Motors helped buoy Detroit when times were difficult in the United States.
 But there are growing concerns that the automakers' problems in the United States will weigh down their more successful units in Europe, Asia and Latin America -- even with a short-term lifeline that the Bush administration has signaled it will provide to G.M. and Chrysler, which sells almost exclusively in the United States.
 Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, warned that the indirect effect of a potential G.M. collapse for American parts makers would be severe. He added that German manufacturers in the United States, like Mercedes and Bayerische Motoren Werke, the maker of BMW cars, would have to rethink not just their American supply chains but their global ones as well. 
 ''There would be no winners, only losers,'' Mr. Dudenhoffer said. ''This would create a huge mess around the world.'' 
 Both G.M. and the Ford Motor Company were profitable in Europe last year and in the first half of 2008. But neither of their European operations is large enough to survive on its own, said Graeme Maxton, an economist who has long tracked the car industry.
 ''They'd need a parent of some sort,'' Mr. Maxton said.
 Other automakers may be reluctant to assume that role, given the slack sales of European giants like Renault, Fiat and Daimler. The tight credit markets would also inhibit any large deals.
 ''Two drowning men clinging together don't make a good swimmer,'' Mr. Maxton added.
 Already, Mr. Dudenhoffer said, the image of Opel, G.M.'s German subsidiary, is suffering among German consumers because of bankruptcy speculation, and suppliers could become nervous if the talk persists. 
 Because of this, many analysts say they are skeptical that Opel can survive as an independent company if G.M. seeks bankruptcy protection. A more workable solution might be to combine G.M.'s entire overseas business, they said, which would produce roughly three million to four million cars annually.
 The parallel downward moves in the United States and international automotive markets are a turnabout from the usual pattern in which strength in one market offsets weakness in another. And markets outside the United States have generally been much more stable, in part because governments keep gasoline prices steadier by imposing hefty fuel taxes.
 ''Normally, North America and Europe don't move in tandem,'' said Louis E. Lataif, a former president of Ford in Europe and now dean of the School of Management at Boston University.
 In fact, he said, one reason Chrysler is in even worse shape is because its overseas business is limited. Chrysler had a German base when it was owned by Daimler from 1998 to 2007, but its operations are now largely confined to North America.
 Over the years, Ford has tended to be stronger in Europe while G.M. has been more successful in China, said Peter Morici, a professor at the School of Business at University of Maryland. And in recent years both companies have enjoyed hefty profits in Latin America, especially Brazil.
 ''Until now, overseas operations have not been drains on cash,'' said Rod Lache, a Deutsche Bank analyst in New York. ''But with sales now down 35 percent-plus in Brazil and off 30 to 35 percent in Western Europe, every market in the world looks like it will burn cash.''
 While it has been largely obscured in the current debate in Washington over aid to the ailing industry, Detroit and Europe are closely intertwined.
 Ford and G.M. employ a combined 120,000 workers across Europe and together sold roughly four million cars there last year. Nearly a quarter of the 9.37 million cars G.M. sold worldwide in 2007 were purchased by European customers.
 European executives at G.M. have appealed to Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, for more than $1 billion in loan guarantees, while the Swedish government said on Thursday that it would provide $3.5 billion in aid for Volvo Car and Saab, as well as suppliers. Volvo Car is owned by Ford, and G.M. controls Saab.
 The Spanish province of Aragon, which is home to G.M.'s largest European plant, in Zaragoza, has also agreed to provide up to $200 million in credit guarantees.
 In late November, the head of G.M. in Europe, Carl-Peter Forster, who has long compared his efforts to revitalize the carmaker's European business to those of a long-distance runner, told engineers at a meeting at Opel's headquarters that now the situation resembled running a marathon up a mountain.
 He acknowledged in an interview that parts suppliers were nervous. ''They ask, 'Can you guys survive?' '' he said. ''We can. We do have cash in hand, and that's also why we've asked governments for help. We need the credit guarantees to sustain the relationship with suppliers.''
 John Fleming, chief executive of Ford in Europe, said he was concerned about a ripple effect if G.M. failed. ''In the current financial situation,'' he said, ''you'd have to worry about the implications on the supplier base.'' 
 Both companies have deep roots on this side of the Atlantic: Ford's British business dates to the era of Henry Ford, and G.M. acquired Opel in the 1920s. 
 Most of their success there is in the small-car market. More than 60 percent of their sales come from the Focus and Fiesta at Ford, and the Corsa and Astra at G.M. By contrast, Detroit has long depended on light trucks and sport utility vehicles to generate most of its profits in the United States. 
 Ford, in fact, plans to reintroduce the Fiesta in the United States in 2010 to satisfy demand for smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. But actually making money on those small cars has proved more difficult than moving them off the lot, especially for G.M.
 Its market share has shrunk to about 9.5 percent from roughly 12 percent, and G.M. remains under pressure to cut overhead. With 55,000 workers spread across 20 plants, G.M.'s work force in Europe is now down 40 percent from a decade ago. 
 Though Ford lost billions trying to crack the luxury market with brands like Jaguar, which it sold to Tata Motors of India this year, and Volvo Car, industry experts say it has done a better job of reducing capacity, slimming payrolls and selling global winners like the Fiesta over the last five years.
 Mr. Fleming suggested that overseas units benefited the North American parent in profit as well as better products, like the fuel-efficient Fiesta, which Ford could adapt to North America quickly because it already existed in Europe.
 He also pointed to his success in turning around Ford in Europe as a template for what both automakers could do in the United States if they survive through the current crisis.
 ''We didn't have the right products, we didn't have the right capacity,'' Mr. Fleming said of the early years in the decade, when Ford lost billions in Europe. ''We had the same issues as the U.S. industry does now. But we were able to accelerate development of the right products and get capacity in line with demand.''

HEADLINE: Pirates in Skiffs Still Outmaneuvering Warships Off Somalia

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Mohammed Ibrahim contributed reporting from Mogadishu, Somalia.

DATELINE: ON THE ARABIAN SEA 

 BODY:
Rear Adm. Giovanni Gumiero is going on a pirate hunt.
 From the deck of an Italian destroyer cruising the pirate-infested waters off Somalia's coast, he has all the modern tools at his fingertips -- radar, sonar, infrared cameras, helicopters, a cannon that can sink a ship 10 miles away -- to take on a centuries-old problem that harks back to the days of schooners and eye patches. 
 ''Our presence will deter them,'' the admiral said confidently.
 But the wily buccaneers of Somalia's seas do not seem especially deterred -- instead, they seem to be getting only wilier. More than a dozen warships from Italy, Greece, Turkey, India, Denmark, Saudi Arabia, France, Russia, Britain, Malaysia and the United States have joined the hunt. 
 And yet, in the past two months alone, the pirates have attacked more than 30 vessels, eluding the naval patrols, going farther out to sea and seeking bigger, more lucrative game, including an American cruise ship and a 1,000-foot Saudi oil tanker. 
 The pirates are recalibrating their tactics, attacking ships in beelike swarms of 20 to 30 skiffs, and threatening to choke off one of the busiest shipping arteries in the world, at the mouth of the Red Sea.
 United Nations officials recently estimated that Somali pirates had netted as much as $120 million this year in ransom payments -- an astronomical sum for a country whose economy has been gutted by 17 years of chaos and war. Some shipping companies are now rerouting their vessels to avoid Somalia's waters, detouring thousands of miles around the Cape of Good Hope, at the southern tip of Africa.
 The pirates are totally outgunned. They continue to cruise around in fiberglass skiffs with assault rifles and at best a few rocket-propelled grenades. One Italian officer said that going after them in a 485-foot-long destroyer, bristling with surface-to-air missiles and torpedoes, was like ''going after someone on a bicycle with a truck.''
 But the pirates -- true to form -- remain unfazed.
 ''They can't stop us,'' said Jama Ali, one of the pirates aboard a Ukrainian freighter packed with weapons that was hijacked in September and was still being held. 
 He explained how he and his men hid out on a rock near the narrow mouth of the Red Sea and waited for the big gray ships with the guns to pass before pouncing on slow-moving tankers. Even if foreign navies nab some members of his crew, Mr. Jama said, he is not worried. He said his men would probably get no more punishment than a free ride back to the beach, which has happened several times.
 ''We know international law,'' Mr. Jama said.
 Western diplomats have said that maritime law can be as murky as the seas. Several times this year, the Danish Navy captured men they suspected to be pirates, only to dump them on shore after the Danish government decided it did not have jurisdiction. 
 The American warships surrounding the hijacked Ukrainian freighter have intercepted several small skiffs going to the freighter, but let the men aboard go because American officials said they did not want to put the freighter's crew in danger.
 This seeming impunity is especially infuriating to the new cadre of private security guards, fresh from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, hired to tag along on merchant voyages to add a layer of protection. Burly men with tattooed forearms and shaved heads sipping Heineken and checking their watches are now common sights on the beaches of Oman, Kenya and Djibouti. They have their own ideas for dealing with seafaring outlaws.
 ''We should make 'em walk the plank,'' one British security guard said.
 Despite tough talk, the guards are unarmed (because most countries do not allow them to bring weapons into port), so they are often forced to confront machine-gun-toting pirates with fire hoses. 
 Or worse. There was even a recent case, according to several security contractors, in which Filipino crew members pelted pirates with tomatoes in an attempt to stop them from scaling the hull of their ship. It did not work.
 The Italian naval officers say the piracy patrols are helping -- already the Italians have rescued several merchant vessels surrounded by pirate skiffs. The Italian destroyer is part of a NATO mission that began in October.
 ''But the answer is to have a good, strong government on land,'' Admiral Gumiero said. ''That's the only way to end this, for sure.''
 That said, strong government is nowhere to be found. The piracy epidemic is not so much a separate problem as a symptom of the failed state of Somalia -- a place crawling with guns, gangs and criminals that has not had a functioning central government since 1991. 
 Many Somalia analysts think that it is about to get even worse. The Ethiopian military, which has been shoring up a weak and unpopular transitional Somali government, says it will pull out within a month.
 The transitional government, split by poisonous infighting, seems on the brink of collapse. Islamic militants with links to Al Qaeda are poised to take over. Famine is steadily creeping toward millions of people, many withering away in plastic huts that are no match for the intense sun or the drenching rains. 
 United Nations officials are swinging into crisis mode, calling high-level meetings in East Africa and New York to address piracy and the greater Somali mess. Some United Nations officials are pushing to send in peacekeepers, but no countries are rushing to offer troops.
 Some American officials have proposed chasing the pirates on the shore and raiding their dens, which are well known but so far untouched. Somalia's transitional leaders, anxious for any help, said they would welcome that.
 ''This is a cancer and it's growing,'' said Abdi Awaleh Jama, an ambassador at large for the transitional federal government. ''We have to extract it once and for all.''
 More than 100 ships have been attacked off Somalia's coast in 2008, far more than in any previous year on record. The economic costs are piling up, with higher insurance payments for shippers, higher fuel costs because of detours and new private security bills, not to mention the million-dollar ransom payments.
 The cash-starved Egyptian government is poised to lose billions of dollars if ships from the Middle East and Asia stop using the Suez Canal, one of Egypt's biggest foreign-exchange earners, and go around Africa instead. 
 But the end of piracy could be an economic catastrophe -- for many Somalis. Their country exports almost nothing these days, and more legitimate forms of business have largely died off. 
 Entire clans and coastal villages now survive off piracy, with women baking bread for pirates, men and boys guarding hostages, and others serving as scouts, gunmen, mechanics, accountants and skiff builders. Traders make a nice cut off the water, fuel and cigarettes needed to sustain such oceangoing voyages.
 Pirates are known as the best customers of all.
 ''They pay $20 for a $5 bottle of perfume,'' said Leyla Ahmed, a shopkeeper in Xarardheere, a notorious pirate den on the Somali coast.
 Maritime experts say that the naval efforts will take time. ''Let's wait and see,'' said Pottengal Mukundan, director of the International Maritime Bureau in London. ''You must appreciate it's a very large stretch of water, a massive area,'' he said, referring to the several hundred thousand square miles of sea where the naval ships are patrolling.
 Then there is the nettlesome question of what to do with the pirates. Italian officers on pirate patrolseemed uncomfortable at the thought of actually capturing a real live pirate. There is not even a brig or place to hold the pirates on the destroyer.
 ''Our main goal is providing safe passage,'' said Fabrizio Simoncini, the destroyer's captain.
 So far, they have done a decent job at that, escorting at least eight humanitarian ships, with 30,000 tons of badly needed aid for Somalia. 
 The Indian Navy recently announced that it had arrested 23 pirates, though it is not clear where the suspects would be prosecuted. Last week in Nairobi, Kenya, at an antipiracy conference, British officials outlined a plan for their navy to capture Somali pirates and hand them over to Kenyan courts.
 But according to Kenneth Randall, dean of the University of Alabama School of Law and an international law scholar, ''Any country can arrest these guys and prosecute them at home, under domestic laws that apply.
 ''I'm actually surprised people think it's unclear,'' he said. ''The law on piracy is 100 percent clear.''
 He said that international customary law going back hundreds of years had defined pirates as criminals who robbed and stole on the high seas. Because the crimes were committed in international waters, he said, all countries had not only the authority but also the obligation to apprehend and prosecute them.
 The Italians clearly have the resources. Out on the front lines, or front waves, beefy Italian marines prowl the decks with machine guns. Radar screens blip and beep. Sailors make announcements over the destroyer's radio, telling nearby cargo ships to put out an S O S with their position as soon as they spot any pirates.
 The Italians said that, deep down, pirates were creatures of the sea, no matter how many navy ships were hot on their tail. ''When the sea is calm, the moon is bright, the weather is good, it's easy to see how the pirates are encouraged,'' said Enrico Vignola, a lieutenant on the ship.
 For visitors on board, lunchtime was the highlight. The officers summoned up from the oily bowels of the destroyer a banquet of homemade pasta, marinated eggplant sliced paper thin, prosciutto-wrapped dates and tiramisu, finished off with cool glasses of spumante.
 It seems that when Italians hunt for pirates, they hunt in style.

HEADLINE: Big Oil Projects Put in Jeopardy By Fall in Prices

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
From the plains of North Dakota to the deep waters of Brazil, dozens of major oil and gas projects have been suspended or canceled in recent weeks as companies scramble to adjust to the collapse in energy markets.
 In the short run, falling oil prices are leading to welcome relief at the pump for American families ahead of the holidays, with gasoline down from its summer record of just over $4 to an average of $1.66 a gallon, and still falling. 
 But the project delays are likely to reduce future energy supplies -- and analysts believe they may set the stage for another surge in oil prices once the global economy recovers.
 Oil markets have had their sharpest-ever spikes and their steepest drops this year, all within a few months. Now, with a global recession at hand and oil consumption falling, the market's extreme volatility is making it harder for energy executives to plan ahead. As a result, exploration spending, which had risen to a record this year, is being slashed. 
 The precipitous drop in oil prices since the summer, coming on the heels of a dizzying seven-year rise, was a reminder that the oil business, like those of most commodities, is cyclical. When demand drops and prices fall, companies curb their investments, leading to lower supplies. When demand recovers, prices rise again and companies start to invest in new production, starting another cycle. 
 As familiar as the pattern may be, the changes this time are taking place at record speed. In June, some analysts were forecasting oil at $200 a barrel and companies were scouring the earth for new places to drill; now, no one knows how low prices may fall. 
 ''It's a classic -- if extraordinarily dramatic -- cycle,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and author of ''The Prize,'' a history of the oil business. ''Prices have come down so far and so fast, it's become a shock to the supply system.'' 
 The list of projects delayed is growing by the week. Wells are being shut down across the United States; new refineries have been postponed in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and India; and ambitious plans for drilling off the coast of Africa are being reconsidered. 
 Investment in alternative energy sources like biofuels that had flourished in recent years could dry up if prices stay low for the next few years, analysts said. Banks have become reluctant lenders, especially to renewable energy projects that may prove unprofitable in an era of low oil and gas prices. 
 These delays could curb future global fuel supplies by the equivalent of four million barrels a day within the next five years, according to Peter Jackson, an energy analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. That is equal to 5 percent of current oil supplies.
 One reason projects are being shut down so fast is that costs throughout the industry, which had surged in recent years, are still elevated despite the drop in oil prices. Many companies are waiting for those costs to come down before deciding whether to go forward with new projects.
 ''The global market has been turned upside down since the summer,'' the International Energy Agency, a leading energy forecaster, said in a recent report. 
 In today's uncertain environment, a slowdown in spending is inevitable, according to energy executives who are devising their budgets for next year. Last year, spending on exploration and production amounted to $329 billion, according to PFC Energy, a consulting firm. That figure is certain to fall.
 ''We're in remission right now,'' said Marvin E. Odum, the vice president for exploration and production for Royal Dutch Shell in the Americas. But once the economy picks up, he said, ''the energy challenge will come back with a vengeance.'' 
 Oil demand growth has weakened throughout the industrial world. The International Energy Agency projects that worldwide demand will actually fall this year, for the first time since 1983.
 So much surplus oil is sloshing around the world right now that some companies, including Shell, are using oil tankers for storage. 
 Oil prices have declined by more than $100 a barrel since July, returning to levels last seen more than four years ago. They settled at $44.51 a barrel, down $1.77, on Monday in New York, as concerns about the economy outweighed efforts by oil producers to stem the slide in prices. 
 Prices could drop below $30 a barrel, according to Merrill Lynch and other forecasters, if the Chinese economy slows drastically next year, which looks increasingly likely.
 Different companies have different price thresholds for going forward with drilling projects. But across the industry, a price drop this big has ''a dampening effect,'' according to Mr. Odum of Shell. ''The big uncertainty is how long this economic environment is going to last.'' 
 The biggest cutbacks so far have been in heavy oil projects in Canada, where some of the world's highest-cost production is concentrated. Some operators there need oil prices above $90 a barrel to turn a profit. 
 StatoilHydro, a large Norwegian company, recently pulled out of a $12 billion project in Canada because of falling prices. Similarly, Shell, Nexen and Petro-Canada have all canceled or postponed new ventures in the province of Alberta in recent weeks. 
 Producers are bracing for a painful contraction, and the drop in prices could crimp investments even in places where production costs are low. The Saudi monarch, King Abdullah, recently said he considered $75 a barrel to be a ''fair price.''
 The kingdom, which has invested tens of billions of dollars in recent years to increase production, recently announced that two new refineries, with ConocoPhillips and Total of France, were being frozen until costs go down. In neighboring Kuwait, the government recently shelved a $15 billion project to build the country's fourth refinery because of concerns about slowing growth in oil demand. 
 The list goes on: South Africa's national oil company, PetroSA, on Thursday dropped plans to build a plant that would have converted coal to liquid fuel. The British-Russian giant TNK-BP slashed its capital expenditure budget for next year by $1 billion, for a 25 percent reduction from this year.
 In North Dakota, oil drillers are scaling back exploration of the Bakken Shale, a geological formation recently seen as promising, where production is more expensive than in conventional fields. 
 ''People are dropping rigs up there in a pretty significant way already,'' Mark G. Papa, the chief executive of EOG Resources, a small natural gas producer, recently told an energy conference.
 Another domestic producer, Callon Petroleum, suspended a major deepwater project in the Gulf of Mexico, called Entrada, weeks before completion because of what it described as a ''serious decline in project economics.'' 
 According to research analysts at the brokerage firm Raymond James, domestic drilling could drop by 41 percent next year as companies scale back.
 ''We expect operators to significantly cut their activity in the coming weeks due to the holiday season, and many of these rigs will not come back to work,'' the report said.
 As scores of small wells are shut down, analysts at Bernstein Research have calculated that oil production in North America could decline by 1.3 million barrels a day through 2010, or 17 percent, to 6.14 million barrels a day. This decline, rather than cuts by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, ''will be the catalyst needed for oil prices to rebound,'' Neil McMahon, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said in a conference call this month. The United States remains the world's largest oil consumer. 
 The drop in energy consumption could afford some breathing room for producers, which had been straining in recent years to match fast-rising demand. But analysts warn the world can ill afford a lengthy drop in investment in energy supplies. To meet the growth in global population and the rising affluence expected in the future, the world will need to invest $12 trillion in order to increase its oil and natural gas supplies, according to the International Energy Agency. 
 ''If we cut back dramatically on investments, we could end up in a situation where supply growth goes flat when the economy starts to recover,'' said Mr. Jackson, the analyst. ''The steeper the decline, the steeper the response.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. Stumbles as News Stays Bleak

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Wall Street slumped on Monday as investors continued to favor the safety of government debt, pushing the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds to its lowest level in 30 years.
Investors, betting that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates to new lows at its meeting this week, clamored to invest in Treasuries ahead of the rate announcement Tuesday afternoon. The yield on the 30-year bond, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 2.96 percent Monday.
Economists expect the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark overnight rate, currently set at 1 percent, by a quarter or half of a percentage point as it tries to jump-start the flagging economy. But analysts said they doubted another rate cut would have much immediate impact on stock markets or the mentality of investors. 
''People would like a silver bullet, but at this point there are no silver bullets,'' said David Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors. ''The Fed or the Treasury aren't going to be able to fix anything with one quick swipe.''
Indeed, economists said they would pore over the Fed's public statement on Tuesday for a willingness to print money or other clues indicating how it would combat the recession if interest rates were effectively cut as low as they could be cut.
''I think what the Fed says tomorrow will be more important than what they do,'' said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Company.
Stock markets fell as another round of grim economic data arrived from America's industrial sector. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 65.15 points, or 0.75 percent, to close at 8,564.53. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.16 points, or 1.27 percent, to 868.57, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 32.38 points, or 2.10 percent, to 1,508.34.
Two new reports showed that industrial production in New York State and across the country continued to slide in the last months of the year, and that businesses were bracing for a slow 2009.
''The decline in November production was steep and broad-based across most manufacturing industries,'' Brian Bethune, United States economist at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note. ''Production is now being slashed pretty much across the board in response to weak domestic and overseas demand.''
Crude oil prices tried to rebound from their lowest levels in years, but after an early rise above $50 a barrel, they fell $1.77 to settle at $44.51 a barrel in New York trading. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, seeking to stabilize the plunging price of oil, signaled that it was willing to make a ''severe production cut'' at a meeting on Wednesday. Energy stocks, which rose Monday morning, finished the day mixed.
And while investigators continued to map the wreckage of the financier Bernard L. Madoff's suspected $50 billion Ponzi scheme, a growing number of publicly traded companies stepped forward to acknowledge millions -- or billions -- of dollars of exposure to the scandal. They included BNP Paribas of France, Banco Santander of Spain, Nomura Holdings of Japan and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Shares in those financial companies, and the financial sector as a whole, ended lower.
''It really is shocking to me that otherwise sophisticated people failed to miss these basic things,'' said Christopher N. Orndorff, managing principal at Payden & Rygel. ''It's just another thing you layer on top, another chapter in the 2008 horror story.''
Goldman Sachs, which is expected to end an 80-year string of positive earnings on Tuesday by posting a quarterly loss, fell 1.9 percent on Monday to close at $66.46 a share, down more than 60 percent for the year. Shares of Morgan Stanley, which is expected to post a quarterly loss of 37 cents a share on Wednesday, fell 1.5 percent on Monday to close at $13.64.
Shares of General Motors and the Ford Motor Company rebounded on Monday after the Bush administration said last week that it was prepared to intervene to prevent the collapse of the Big Three car companies after Republican senators blocked a rescue plan. General Motors closed up 3.6 percent while Ford was 4.6 percent higher.
In Europe, markets finished lower as the ripples of Mr. Madoff's case spread. The FTSE 100 index in London and the DAX in Frankfurt closed down slightly while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.87 percent.
The dollar fell against other major currencies. The euro rose to $1.3665, from $1.337 late Friday in New York, while the British pound rose to $1.5253, from $1.4969. The dollar fell to 90.60 yen, from 91.12.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bill rose 17/32, to 110 25/32, and the yield which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.51 percent, down from 2.57 percent late Friday.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Rise of Bankruptcy Rate in Region Outpaces Rest of Nation

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Bankruptcy filings are accelerating in the New York metropolitan area at a faster pace than in the rest of the nation, according to figures released on Monday by the federal bankruptcy courts.
 In the federal courts that serve the region, filings for bankruptcy protection -- by individuals and businesses -- were pouring in at the rate of about 175 per day in the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, the data showed. The filings in the city, New Jersey and Connecticut increased by more than 36 percent in the quarter, faster than the nationwide increase of 34 percent.
 The statistics show that the rising tide of American bankruptcies that had already reached the surrounding areas of New Jersey and Connecticut has now rolled into the city. As unemployment rises, more consumers are falling behind on their debts and creditors have been increasing pressure on them to repay, bankruptcy lawyers said. 
 ''We are seeing debt-collection efforts really being ratcheted up over the last couple of months,'' said Jay S. Fleischman, a bankruptcy lawyer in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ''What we're seeing is the debts being sued upon far earlier in the process. That leaves consumers with the feeling that they don't have the options they once did.''
 Rather than seeking to work out repayment terms with the lenders or through credit counselors, more borrowers are filing for court protection from their creditors, Mr. Fleischman said. ''Our clients now tend to be people who had better-paying jobs. More of the middle class and upper-middle class is being forced to consider this option as a result of job losses and the erosion of home values.''
 The two federal courts in the city -- one in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn -- recorded about 36 percent more filings in the third quarter of 2008 than in the same period last year. In the second quarter, filings in those courts rose about 30 percent, slower than the nationwide pace.
 As usual, the bulk of the filings were made by individuals under Chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy code, known as liquidations. For example, in the Eastern District Court in Brooklyn, nearly 75 percent of the 4,323 bankruptcy filings were personal Chapter 7 liquidations, while just 126, or 3 percent, of the filings were by businesses.
 In Southern District Court in Manhattan, business filings made up about 8 percent of the 2,641 filings in the third quarter. But filings by businesses looking to reorganize their debts were rising at a fast rate, up about 45 percent in the quarter, compared with the same quarter of 2007. Among the biggest filings in the quarter were those of Lehman Brothers, the failed investment bank, and Steve & Barry's, a chain of discount clothing stores.
 Bankruptcies among businesses are likely to continue piling up for months, said Michael P. Richman, chairman of the bankruptcy practice group in the Manhattan office of Foley & Lardner, a law firm.
 ''A lot of us in the profession believe that once we get through the Christmas and holiday shopping season, that there will be a literal wave of new Chapter 11 cases, largely in the retail arena,'' Mr. Richman said. ''We're going to see a continued increase on a regular basis for a long period of time, a period of time that's going to outlast the recession, I think, for years.'' 
 In the federal courts in New Jersey and Connecticut, bankruptcy filings rose at a slightly faster pace than in the two New York City courts in the last quarter. In New Jersey, there were 6,874 filings, up from 5,036 in the third quarter of 2007; there were 6,696 filings in the second quarter of this year. In Connecticut, the total number of filings in the third quarter -- 2,119 -- was up 37 percent from a year before, but was slightly lower than in the second quarter of this year.
 The Southern District handles cases from Manhattan, the Bronx, Westchester and a few other counties north of the city. The Eastern District handles cases from Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island. Outside the metropolitan region, the state is divided between the northern and western districts, where bankruptcy filings rose at about half the pace of filings in the metropolitan region.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THE conflict in eastern Congo over the past 12 years has been as much a surrogate war between Congo and neighboring Rwanda as an internal ethnic insurgency, as a United Nations report underscored last week. The only way to end a war that has caused five million deaths and forced millions to flee their homes in Congo's two eastern provinces is to address the conflict's international dimensions. The role of Rwanda -- which borders the provinces and which denied the accusations in the United Nations report over the weekend -- is of prime importance.
 The international community has worked hard to resolve the conflicts among the various parties: the sovereign states of Rwanda and Congo as well as the assorted militias and private armies that are sponsored by these two governments and by opportunistic local warlords. But despite the deployment of 17,000 United Nations peacekeepers, and many efforts at mediation with constructive American support, the situation appears intractable. 
 The failure of international diplomacy is related to the economic roots of the problem, which began with the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Until the economic conundrum is addressed, there is little prospect for a solution. 
 The genocidal war between the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi in Rwanda spilled into Congo, and the eastern part of that vast country has been unstable ever since. When Tutsi rebel forces took power in Rwanda in June 1994, more than a million Hutu fled to Congo, where they settled into refugee camps on the Rwandan border. 
 After two years of cross-border raids from the refugee camps by exiled Hutu soldiers who had participated in the genocide, the Rwandan Army attacked and destroyed the camps, with the quiet but unambiguous approval of the United States in the absence of another solution to the violence. Most of the Hutu refugees returned to Rwanda, but about 100,000 of them, along with the exiled Hutu soldiers, moved westward as a disciplined group into Congo's interior. 
 The Rwandan Army pursued the escaping Hutu and caught up with them near the city of Kisangani at the headwaters of the Congo River. The refugees were massacred, but the former Hutu soldiers escaped to neighboring countries. 
 The move against the refugee camps was the first step in a well-planned action by Rwanda in 1996 and 1997 to overwhelm the weak Congolese Army and, with the help of the Congolese opposition, overthrow the 30-year dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko. With logistical support from Uganda and Angola, the military action succeeded in less than three months. A new government in Congo was installed under President Laurent Kabila, an exile handpicked by the Rwandans.
 And from 1996 to today, the Tutsi-led Rwandan government has been in effective control of Congo's eastern provinces of North and South Kivu. This control has been maintained through intermittent military occupation and the presence of Congolese militias financed and trained by the Rwandan Army. 
 During these 12 years of Rwandan control, the mineral-rich provinces have been economically integrated into Rwanda. During this time, Congo's governments have been preoccupied with internal and external wars elsewhere, and have been unable to combat foreign control of the eastern provinces, a thousand miles from the capital, Kinshasa. 
 But two years ago, Congo held multiparty elections that were judged to be transparent and credible by international observers. For the first time in a decade, there was hope for stability. President Joseph Kabila (the son of Laurent Kabila, who was assassinated in 2001) turned his attention to trying to gain control of the eastern provinces. 
 Unfortunately, this has led to increased conflict and suffering. The main source of the current violence is an insurgent force of ethnic Congolese Tutsi commanded by Laurent Nkunda, a former general in the Congolese Army. He claims to be fighting to defend the Tutsi community from discrimination and from the former Rwandan Hutu fighters who have returned from neighboring countries and now operate in the forested hills of eastern Congo. 
 General Nkunda's military operations, however, are aimed mainly against the Congolese Army's efforts to restore Congo's sovereignty over its eastern provinces. His force is well armed and financed by the Rwandan government. The armed Hutu presence in the provinces provides the Rwandan government with a pretext to justify its interference there. 
 Having controlled the Kivu provinces for 12 years, Rwanda will not relinquish access to resources that constitute a significant percentage of its gross national product. At the same time, Congo's government is within its rights to take control of the resources there for the benefit of the Congolese people. This economic conflict must be taken into account.
 This provides an opportunity for the incoming Obama administration. Acts of war and military occupation aside, there is a natural economic synergy between eastern Congo and the nations of East Africa, including Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda. The normal flow of trade from eastern Congo is to Indian Ocean ports rather than the Atlantic Ocean, which is more than a thousand miles away. 
 After his inauguration, Barack Obama should appoint a special negotiator who would propose a framework for an economic common market encompassing Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. This agreement would allow the free movement of people and trade. It would give Rwandan businesses continued access to Congolese minerals and forests. The products made from those raw materials would continue to be exported through Rwanda. The big change would be the payment of royalties and taxes to the Congolese government. For most Rwandan businesses, those payments would be offset by increased revenues.
 In addition, the free movement of people would empty the refugee camps and would allow the densely populated countries of Rwanda and Burundi to supply needed labor to Congo and Tanzania.
 If such a common market could be negotiated, Rwanda and Congo would no longer need to finance and arm militias to wage war over the natural resources in Congo's eastern provinces. Without government backing, the fighting groups would either dissolve on their own or be integrated into legitimate armed forces. 
 If undertaken with enough will and persistence, an American-led mediation to create a common market in East Africa could end the war and transform the region.

HEADLINE: As Orders Decline, Industrial Production Drops 0.6%

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Manufacturers are ending a bruising year with a new round of bad news and grim outlooks for 2009.
 Industrial production fell 0.6 percent in November as the country's output of cars, automotive goods, home electronics, appliances and furniture tumbled in the face of declining orders, the Federal Reserve reported on Monday. Consumers and commercial buyers reduced their spending in the face of the worst economic slowdown in two decades. Industrial production rose 1.5 percent in October, revised up from an initial increase of 1.3 percent. 
 The Fed's manufacturing report did list some bright spots. The output of mines and electric and natural gas utilities increased despite slumping energy prices as drilling and extraction recovered from shutdowns after Hurricanes Gustav and Ike raked the Gulf Coast. And the output of transit equipment surged 40 percent in November after Boeing restarted factories that had been idle during a monthlong machinists' strike.
 The disturbing message behind the data was that even a rebound from rare events like hurricanes and labor strikes could not buoy the country's overall industrial output for November, said Stephen Stanley, chief United States economist at RBS Greenwich. 
 ''I think it's an indication of extreme contraction in the manufacturing sector,'' he said. ''Right now, I think people are sitting on their hands.''
 Capacity utilization, the percentage of plants in use, fell to 75.4 percent, from 76 percent in October.
 The Empire State Manufacturing Survey, a gauge of production in New York State, slid to a record low in December as sales deteriorated, new orders and shipments continued to slump and the number of unfilled orders dropped to record lows. 
 The index, released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, fell to negative 25.8 points, from its previous low of negative 25.4 in November. 
 Nearly half of the manufacturers interviewed for the monthly survey said that business conditions had worsened in December and said they were scaling back their work forces and cutting the hours in the workweek.
 They reported that the prices they received for their goods had tumbled, but said that falling energy prices had eased their costs of production.
 Manufacturers were also bracing for a difficult year in 2009. They said that wages would grow at a slower pace than in 2008, and expected to tighten their spending on capital projects and technology.

HEADLINE: Ways to Get Detroit Out of the Ditch

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''White House Ready to Offer Aid to Auto Industry'' (front page, Dec. 13):
 When World War II broke out, American industry rapidly converted to wartime products. Shirt manufacturers changed production to mosquito netting, model train factories became bomb fuse factories, metal weather stripping production turned into mortar shell production, kitchen sinks became cartridge cases, and the auto manufacturers made tanks.
 Let the automakers use the bailout funds to convert to green technologies. Toyota and the rest can pick up the slack in automobiles. General Motors, under new leadership, can develop new and more efficient alternative energy products for ourselves and the rest of the world. 
 As the economist James K. Galbraith has written, ''By helping to save the physical world, we may be able to save our currency, our credit and our economy as well.'' Finley Schaef 
 Saugerties, N.Y., Dec. 13, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Providing car loans to the automakers may help them in the long run, but ultimately they need to sell cars and they need to do so now. What good will it do to provide them with money if the consumer doesn't have the financial resources to buy their product?
 I submit that a much better use of the money might be to offer government-guaranteed car loans to consumers, provided of course that they be able to meet certain financial requirements and with the condition that the consumer buys from the Big Three.
 This way General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get to move their current inventories, receive the money for future investment, and the government doesn't actually make the investment, unless the consumer defaults.
 Paul Hauser
 Wellington, Fla., Dec. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Instead of simply transferring billions of dollars into a Detroit abyss, why not have our government deal with the actual problem, a lack of automobile purchases and foresight by the industry?
 The government places a huge order for electric cars. It requires all Detroit employees to reduce their pay package by 10 percent. The government places a 20 percent down payment. When the vehicles are ready for delivery, the government sells them to dealerships.
 In this way, we drastically reduce our losses from importing petroleum, help reduce the adverse health consequences of pollution, reduce global warming and spawn a whole new industry that requires more electricity production, battery storage and electricity transfer. 
 We Americans can actually produce something real for taxpayer money.
 Leonard Gehl
 Pittsburgh, Dec. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 As a political progressive, I rarely find myself lauding the backbone of the Republican Party, but I must say that in this instance it is the Democrats who are buckling to misplaced labor worries about auto jobs and the Republicans who realize that the American auto industry's engine has finally died. 
 No amount of bailout will keep these notoriously inefficient companies afloat. Is this a rerun of an old 1979 Chrysler show? 
 We've been here before, and it's time to consolidate our losses and support new green companies that can hire these workers for profitable and sustainable enterprise. Yogi Hendlin
 Santa Monica, Calif., Dec. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Imagine an act of leadership by the Senate: it says to the autoworkers, We are acting to reduce our salaries by 15 percent; we ask you to accept a 10 percent reduction. We do this in the interest of the well-being of the country.
 Is it hard to imagine our elected representatives acting selflessly and in the country's interest?
 Charles E. Welles
 South Bristol, Me., Dec. 13, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''A Finger in the Dike'' (column, Dec. 14):
 Nicholas D. Kristof argues that the auto bailout ultimately must go through because more than a million jobs are at stake. Those making this argument are completely disregarding economic truths.
 Mr. Kristof parallels the automobile industry to the financial sector by examining the aftermath of the Lehman bankruptcy. With Lehman, there was a clear market failure that justified government intervention. Credit markets were frozen; loans were not being made. There is no similar failure in the automobile market. If the Big Three should fail, there will still be plenty of great cars on the market made by companies other than General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
 Second, when the Big Three fail, the associated job losses will be temporary. American demand for automobiles will still very much exist. Consequently, there will be a huge supply gap left for foreign car companies to expand their American production or for new domestic companies to enter the market. Either way, new job opportunities will replace the old. Kenan Yount
 Charlottesville, Va., Dec. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 How is it that so many still do not get it? How is that so many still do not understand how desperate things are with our economy and the importance of the American auto industry in that economy? 
 And yes, enough of all that free-market purist nonsense about having to let things play themselves out in a capitalistic way, particularly when our financial institutions have failed even more miserably than the auto industry and are surviving thanks only to the government's huge bailout.
 As Nicholas D. Kristof says, one thing is more than clear: the American dike is about to crumble, and for our own good, we had better plug it through whichever way possible before we do even more irreparable damage to the economy.
 Carl Mattioli
 Newtonville, Mass., Dec. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''When the Cars Go Away,'' by Bill McGraw (Op-Ed, Dec. 13):
 There is much angst about whether to bail out the Big Three automakers. Proponents rightly point out the devastating ripple effect of their closing. Those against government financial rescue justly question using huge amounts of taxpayer money to help those who have been incompetent, greedy, terminally shortsighted and self-serving in the extreme. 
 Why not allow existing auto manufacturers like Toyota, Honda and so on to buy out General Motors, Ford and Chrysler? That, of course, assumes that they would have any interest. 
 These makers are proven innovators and consummate administrators. A requirement of such a sale would be that the new owners keep the current workers in place. It would dissolve existing union contracts. It would, however, require the work forces of the Big Three to be compensated at rates commensurate with those of the new owners' other American plant work forces. 
 Even if an ''auction'' of the companies were held resulting in a fire-sale, liquidation purchase price, it would generate some cash and would not cost the taxpayers a nickel. Basically, the only ones hurt would be the executives and the shareholders. 
 And that, I'm afraid, is a big, Oh, well. We as nonparticipating taxpayers should not be required to cover their poor business decisions.

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Political Corruption, New York Can Hold Its Own

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
New Yorkers have every reason to feel demoralized in this season supposedly of good cheer.
 The economy is -- well, you know what it is. The city budget is in a deep hole, and the state is staring at a deficit of $15 billion, a figure larger than the gross domestic product of about 50 countries.
 As for some of those who still have lots of money, their priorities seem grotesquely skewed. While thousands of poor schnooks are losing jobs and homes, the Yankees find this the perfect time to spend nearly a quarter of a billion dollars -- that's right: billion with a B -- to hire two pitchers. This as they boo-hoo-hoo about needing hundreds of millions in municipal aid for their new stadium. 
 But perhaps the most serious blow to New Yorkers' morale is a sense that we have been thoroughly outclassed in an area where we have always excelled. We're referring to corruption and other forms of wrongdoing by public officials. When it comes to bozo politicians, we like to think of ourselves as king of the hill, top of the heap (though a colleague correctly points out that our neighbors in New Jersey and Connecticut are hardly slouches in this regard).
 Then along comes Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, he of the implausible hair and the hard to pronounce name. The damage that he has done to New Yorkers' self-esteem cannot be overstated. It's not easy topping someone who, if the federal charges against him are true, tried to sell the Senate seat of the president-elect. Years ago, Mike Royko, the great Chicago columnist, called his hometown ''the city of the big wallet.'' That label may well apply to all of Illinois.
 So New Yorkers are understandably smarting. We don't mind being taken nearly as much as we do being overtaken, and there is an unsettling sensation that Illinois has gotten the better of us.
 But in the spirit of the holidays, we come to say: Buck up, New York! Don't let the Blagosphere get you down. Hold your heads high at the breadth and depth of your leaders' misdeeds.
 In this week's New Yorker magazine, Roger Angell revives a tradition that had gone AWOL for a decade, this being his name-crammed holiday poem called ''Greetings, Friends!'' What a field day Mr. Angell might have had if he'd focused solely on our miscreant politicians.
 We have Spitzer, Hevesi and Fossella,
 Kerik, Rangel and of course Velella.
 Really, how can a state feel second-rate when it has a preternaturally sanctimonious governor who is forced out of office after hanging out with prostitutes? That would be Eliot Spitzer, in the unlikely event that you forgot. Nor is there anything second-rate about having a state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, who also had to resign because of scandal, in his case because he misused state money.
 Representative Charles B. Rangel is being investigated for an impressive array of possible ethical lapses. Bernard B. Kerik continues to face federal corruption charges, a fine mess for a former police commissioner and nominee (for something like an hour and a half) for homeland security secretary. Former State Senator Guy J. Velella was jailed for being more sticky-fingered than was absolutely necessary -- and then made us all proud by whining about his punishment.
 Of late, we have the spectacle of the drunken-driving Vito J. Fossella, the congressman who was caught both red-handed and red-lipped from all the wine he had knocked back. Mr. Fossella's disgrace did not deter the mayor and other politicians from gathering on Sunday to say what a swell fellow he was. He even heard himself compared to -- we kid you not -- Jesus, Benjamin Franklin and Rocky Balboa.
 You want corruption, be it proved or alleged?
 We have Joseph L. Bruno, until recently the State Senate majority leader, under investigation. Our City Council has been investigated for hiding millions of dollars in secret accounts with phony names. A former assemblyman and former Democratic leader in Brooklyn, Clarence Norman Jr., is doing time for extortion and other crimes. Another former assemblyman, Brian M. McLaughlin, pleaded guilty this year to racketeering charges. Corruption also earned former Assemblywoman Diane M. Gordon a prison sentence.
 The list of officials who have run into trouble with the law includes, but is most definitely not limited to, Assembly members Roger L. Green, Gloria Davis and Anthony S. Seminerio, who was indicted last week on federal charges of trading favors for buckets of cash.
 And to show how diverse we are in New York, judges land in hot water, too. The latest to be indicted is Judge-elect Nora S. Anderson of Surrogate's Court in Manhattan, who may well be suspended moments after she takes the oath of office on Jan. 1.
 So yeah, Illinois, give us your best shot. New York will go toe to toe with you any time. We might even claim a motto in Latin that Mike Royko proposed for Chicago four decades ago. It works for us, too: Ubi est mea.
 Where's mine?

HEADLINE: At 85, More Peaks to Conquer and Adventures to Seek

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
He had been called a vagabond, a recluse and a schemer, a cantankerous mountain man hiding his little black book of secret climbing techniques from the world. In seven decades, he had claimed more virgin ascents than any mountaineer alive. Some ascribed his feats to vengeance of a long-ago slight, others to the murder of his own fears. He was said to howl at tourists. His past was the stuff of lore, his plans the stuff of mystery.
 Then, this fall, word of his next expedition spread among the worldwide network of contacts whose telephone numbers he kept scribbled on notecards wrapped with rubber bands in the gearbox pocket of his station wagon. The plan was announced in disarmingly casual fashion.
 ''Hi everyone, Fred Beckey called yesterday and he is going to northern Spain in early to mid-December,'' began one posting this autumn at an online rock climbing forum. ''Might be a long shot, but he's looking for a partner to hook up with in Barcelona.'' 
 Wolfgang Paul Heinrich Beckey: The name, shortened and altered when his family had emigrated from pre-war Dusseldorf to the Pacific Northwest, resounded across the archives of mountaineering journals, the pages of literary guidebooks and the maps of newly discovered peaks. His own reluctant namesake, Mount Beckey, rises some 8,500 feet in a largely uncharted subrange near the Cathedral Spires of southeastern Alaska.
 By the turn of the latest century, any self-respecting young climber could recite the high points of the Fred Beckey legend: Born in 1923 to a father who practiced medicine and a mother who performed arias, a teenage Fred rejected the life of a city intellectual for the pursuit of wild things. Learning to climb in the Boy Scouts, he joined the first ascent of Mount Despair in 1939.
 As a young man, Beckey earned a master's degree in business administration and entered the printing industry, but the assignments he accepted, like driving a delivery truck, traded career ambitions for precious time.
 From his first expeditions in the North Cascades, Beckey cast himself as a renegade. Defined by defiance, he ascended peaks termed unclimbable by the Mountaineers, a local outfit renowned for classes and publications promoting the sport. In return, the Mountaineers rejected his guidebook manuscripts.
 Many of the climbers of Beckey's era, their lives staked on trust and cooperation, grew wary of his gruff manner, his outlier reputation, his intransigence. He was labeled a showboat, a womanizer and worse. When his partners were hurt or killed on expeditions, including Charles Shiverick in the Coast Range of British Columbia in 1947 and Bruno Spirig in the Himalayas in 1955, Beckey was criticized. In the early 1960s, as the first American team was assembled to summit Mount Everest, no one invited Beckey.
 Setting out with his brother, Helmy, Beckey put up new routes across Wyoming, Colorado, California, British Columbia and Alaska. Though he preferred Alpine scenery, he climbed desert rock formations, icy crags and boulders, the Gunks, the Bitterroots and the Bugaboos.
 As other mountaineers began to focus on repeating ascents for speed, Beckey roamed Europe, China and the North American backcountry in search of unconquered peaks. By his own account, he climbed Mount Rainier, a two-hour drive from Seattle, only five times. In the summer of 1954 alone, he scaled Mounts McKinley, Hunter and Deborah in the Alaska Range, an accomplishment that became known as his Triple Crown of First Ascents. By 1963, when he logged 26 first ascents in a single year, his legend was secure.
 ''He's been everywhere, he's done amazing things everywhere,'' said Dave Burdick, known as Alpine Dave, a 28-year-old climber from Seattle. ''And it's just this drive he has.''
 But in the fullness of time, Beckey's legacy emerged as something grander than a list of records. That drive, born of a wanderlust once characterized as recklessness, fermented into a sort of sublime seeking. It appeared most vividly in his guidebook prose, a stirring amalgam of technical analysis, historical insight, geographical research and a sense of wonderment.
 ''If Thoreau and Emerson describe the transcendental American theme, then Beckey -- after Ahab, akin to Kerouac -- describes the oddly manic drive to scale and map and detail the wilderness in a modern way,'' said Steve Costie, executive director of the Mountaineers, which eventually accepted Beckey as a member. ''Almost adversarial; never transcendental.''
 Far past retirement age, Beckey has kept hard to the road, recruiting younger companions to split the cost of travel.
 ''In my climbing lifetime, he was well known for being on the trailing edge of his career -- that was 30 years ago, too -- but still being ambitious,'' said John Middendorf, 49, a onetime climbing partner, speaking by telephone from Tasmania. ''His mode of operation was to invite climbers on expeditions, things he wanted to do but couldn't necessarily do.''
 This fall, despite the crumbling economy and the weak dollar, the chance to join the 85-year-old Beckey in Europe became a source of temptation for climbers around the world.
 ''I'm essentially going because, yeah, I like to climb, never been to Spain, but I'm mostly going to hang out with Beckey,'' said Diane Kearns, 49, an instructor from Winchester, Va. '' The opportunity to get to know Fred is tremendous. He's a legend in his own time.''
 A few miles northeast of downtown Seattle, on a narrow lane of wood pines and berry trees, where the bumper stickers of parked cars promote Democrats, motorcycling and the concept of coexistence, an open garage door exposed stacks of mountain gear. Beside a ''No Soliciting'' sign, a lean, hunched figure emerged from a clapboard house. He extended a greeting: two thumbs up.
 His breathing was labored, his hearing aid out of commission. His long fingers, swabbed with paint, turned slightly inward. His lips folded over his teeth and his silvery blue eyes were rimmed red. He wore a zippered Patagonia jacket, a huge digital watch and a ball cap that read, ''Red River Gorge Climbing Coalition.''
 Inside the kitchen, coffee was brewing. From the radio Don Henley sang about how those days are gone forever and he should just let them go. Where other people's houses might display portraits of family members, framed pictures of mountain peaks covered the walls here. The table was cluttered with photographs and notes for a new manuscript, a career retrospective to be entitled Classic Climbs.
 ''You've got to be physically pretty strong to be any good at it at all,'' Beckey said. ''You've got to have a hard-core mental attitude. You've got to have the right mantra. You've got to have dedication, a sense of security, safety and sensitivity with your partners, and a good sense of balance. It's a combination of many, many things. You need to have the capability or desire to accept a certain amount of risk. A lot of it is maybe spiritual, not a religious type, but you have to have an affinity with the outdoors.''
 To complete his opus, he said, a handful of ascents remained, including routes up Mount Monarch in the Coast Range, Longs Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park and Mount Assiniboine in the Canadian Rockies. The coming European trip he ascribed partly to whim, partly to a desire to visit his brother, who has returned home to Germany.
 ''One of my reasons to do it is I hate Christmas shopping,'' Beckey said. ''I'm single, I don't have kids, it's going to be raining here.''
 At late morning, he drove down to the new waterfront headquarters of the Mountaineers. As officials showed him an outdoor climbing gym constructed of composite rock and plastic complete with a short trail of rocks and an eight-inch layer of shredded tires designed to cushion a fall, two young women backed away in reverence, snapping photographs and speaking in hushed tones of ''Mr. Beckey.''
 Later, in a reflective moment, he would say: ''You're putting yourself on the line. Man used to put himself on the line all the time. Nowadays we're protected by the police, fire, everything. There's not much adventure left. Unless you look for it.''
 But for now, Beckey dug around inside the manmade crevices, finding his grip, pulling himself up a foot, two feet, five feet into the air. Asked by the Mountaineers about his next expedition, he said he did not know. Then he slid down onto the bed of shredded rubber, remarked upon the fineness of the weather and walked up the hill and away.

HEADLINE: How the Fed Reached Out To Lehman

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook

 BODY:
It's a $138 billion mystery.
 In the early hours of Sept. 15, after the government refused to rescue the foundering Lehman Brothers, something odd happened. The Federal Reserve lent tens of billions of dollars to a subsidiary of the newly bankrupt bank. 
 In other words, government officials who had refused to risk taxpayers' money on Lehman before it collapsed did just that after it collapsed. 
 On Monday the Fed lent the Lehman unit $87 billion through JPMorgan Chase. After being repaid on Tuesday, it lent another $51 billion -- putting the bailout, arguably, in the same league as the initial $85 billion bailout for the American International Group.
 This mystery loan is just one piece of the larger Lehman puzzle. Who lost Lehman? Why, and how? Three months later, those questions still nag. 
 A series of court documents that detail the Fed's loan have dribbled out in recent weeks, but they raise more questions than they answer.
 Lehman might seem like ancient history by now, some ghost of a crisis past. Lehman -- that was before A.I.G., before the Big Three, before Madoff Securities. But no one, least of all government officials, has fully explained why Lehman, one of the grand old names of Wall Street, was allowed to fail while so many others were rescued.
 Many people, at least on Wall Street, have come to view the decision to let Lehman die as one of the biggest blunders in this whole financial crisis. Christine Lagarde, France's finance minister, called the decision ''a genuine error.'' 
 Judge James Peck, who approved the sale of Lehman's carcass to Barclays, the British bank, said it was a shame that Lehman had failed. 
 ''Lehman Brothers became a victim,'' Judge Peck said in bankruptcy court when he approved the sale. ''In effect, the only true icon to fall in the tsunami that has befallen the credit markets. And it saddens me.'' 
 The authorities are investigating whether Lehman executives misled investors about the firm's financial condition before the firm failed. But the authorities might be asking similar questions about executives at other banks if, like Lehman, those institutions had been allowed to go under. 
 The recently disclosed documents detailing the Fed's loan to Lehman's subsidiary cast some light on a failed effort to prevent Lehman's implosion from cascading through the financial system. 
 The loan, according to these documents, was a ''carefully thought-out decision'' to stabilize the market by propping up Lehman's broker-dealer business, called LBI New York, so it could stay afloat long enough to ''facilitate an orderly wind-down'' of tens of thousands of trades with the other Wall Street firms. The unit was kept out of the Lehman bankruptcy. 
 That might seem like a reasonable explanation. But Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, and Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, have said that they did not have legal authority to lend any money to Lehman. The firm, officials said, did not have enough collateral. 
 ''We didn't have the powers,'' Mr. Paulson insisted. He also said Lehman's bad assets created ''a huge hole'' on its balance sheet, adding that he had actually tried to find a way for the government to provide money to help support a deal between Lehman and Barclays, but legally could not. His explanation has evolved over time, however. He told reporters the day after Lehman went bankrupt: ''I never once considered that it was appropriate to put taxpayer money on the line in resolving Lehman Brothers.'' 
 Whatever the case, the Fed's loan to the Lehman subsidiary makes all these explanations increasingly hard to square. Mr. Paulson said Lehman had lacked the collateral for the government to backstop a deal between Lehman and Barclays. But then the Fed turned around and lent a Lehman subsidiary billions, based on that same collateral. 
 People involved in the process said that the Fed only lent the money as part of ''an orderly wind-down,'' which would have been different from lending money to an ongoing, or in this case, insolvent concern.
 Fed officials are not talking much about the loan. Mr. Bernanke and Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Treasury secretary nominee, have kept quiet on the topic. A spokesman for the New York Fed, which orchestrated the loan, declined to comment. 
 The Fed's loans were made through JPMorgan Chase, which, as a clearing bank, acted as a conduit for the money. JPMorgan, if you recall, was the bank that bought Bear Stearns, with the government's help, as that firm was collapsing last spring. 
 If there's a silver lining in this mysterious cloud, it is that Lehman paid the Fed back. Taxpayers did not lose a dime. As part of Barclay's deal to buy Lehman out of bankruptcy, Barclays agreed to take over the Fed's lending role and ''step into the shoes of the Fed.'' (The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation ended up staying open late to make the transfer.) 
 Still, Barclays and JPMorgan had a brief fight over the collateral posted for the loan, according to court documents. They eventually reached an agreement. The values of the collateral and the specifics are part of a confidential sealed agreement, making it difficult to determine exactly what happened.
 Maybe the Fed's belated loan to Lehman helped avoid an even deeper crisis. As Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee said on ''60 Minutes'' on Sunday: ''The problem in politics is this: you don't get any credit for disaster averted.'' But until officials explain what happened, it will remain a mystery.

HEADLINE: Actors Petition Their Guild To Cancel Vote Over Strike

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Leaders of the Screen Actors Guild came under pressure on Monday from a long roster of A-list stars to call off plans for a vote next month to approve a possible strike against movie and television studios. 
 In a petition, more than 130 well-known actors -- including George Clooney, Tom Hanks, Alec Baldwin and Sally Field -- urged guild leaders to halt the strike authorization vote. 
 ''We support our union and we support the issues we're fighting for, but we do not believe in all good conscience that now is the time to be putting people out of work,'' the petition stated.
 A SAG spokeswoman had no immediate comment. There was some confusion on Monday about the authenticity of all of the signatures, with some agents and publicists confirming that their clients participated and others saying they were not certain. Among the other names: Kevin Spacey, Charlize Theron, Helen Hunt, Josh Brolin, Billy Crystal, Steve Carell and Matt Damon.
 The petition was organized in part by the actress Rhea Perlman and Richard Masur, a former national president of the union. 
 It was sent shortly after SAG canceled an emergency national board meeting that was to discuss public pleas from New York-based union officials to cancel the strike vote. The meeting was canceled after internal squabbling over how it should be conducted.
 SAG announced last week that it would mail strike authorization ballots to members on Jan. 2. Of those who vote, 75 percent must approve the authorization for it to pass. 
 SAG leaders have been telling managers and agents in private meetings that if the authorization fails, the guild will be forced to accept a contract offer from studios that has been on the table since June 30.
 The guild released a list of 31 high-profile members late Friday in support of a yes vote, including Mel Gibson, Holly Hunter, Martin Sheen and Sandra Oh. 
 ''We must arm our negotiating committee,'' that group said in a statement.

Well
 From Tara Parker-Pope's blog, nytimes.com/well. 
 Anyone who has ever tried to lose weight knows it's hard to stay motivated. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania wondered if cold, hard cash might do the trick. 
 The investigators recruited 57 prospective dieters who were obese but otherwise healthy and divided them into three groups. One group was given $3 a day plus matching funds for meeting weight-loss goals, meaning they could earn up to $168 during a four-week period. A second group was eligible to compete in a cash lottery for $10 to $100 a day during the study period if they achieved weight-loss goals. A third, the control group, simply attended monthly weigh-in sessions.
 At the end of 16 weeks, the dieters in the lottery group had lost an average of 13.1 pounds each, while those in the matching-funds group had lost an average of 14 pounds each, compared with just 3.9 pounds in the control group, according to a report in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
 Dot Earth
 From Andrew C. Revkin's blog, nytimes.com/dotearth.
 The climate talks that concluded Saturday in Poznan, Poland, underscored a deep and persistent global ''climate divide.'' On one side are the industrialized nations, which largely built their wealth through a century of fossil-fuel combustion; on the other, poorer countries whose path out of poverty depends for now on the same energy sources. 
 And there are other divides that may make it difficult to achieve a global climate treaty in Copenhagen a year from now. In the United States, where the Senate must approve any treaty by a two-thirds vote, Congress remains divided not just by party but by geography.
 President-elect Barack Obama's climate team includes seasoned environmental regulators who see global warming mainly as a traditional pollution problem; and a nominee for energy secretary, Steven Chu, who recognizes the need for big leaps in science and engineering. Sustaining a focus on both aspects of the climate/energy challenge will not be easy.
 The New Old Age
 From Jane Gross's blog, nytimes.com/newoldage.
 Few subjects have generated more interest here than long-term-care insurance. And I've found myself both alarmed and amazed at how many of you think that such a policy is the all-purpose solution to exorbitantly expensive nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other forms of ''custodial care'' for the incapacitated elderly.
 My mother had such a policy, a new product in the 1970s and very different from the policies of today. Leaving aside the eye-glazing technical details, nothing she needed was covered. Still, I have my own policy now. My annual premium is $1,700, and the benefits include many things my mother's didn't, including home modification, a small portion of the costs of assisted living (although not the apartment itself), inflation protection and other bells and whistles I can't recall.
 But, often I think about canceling it, because my gut tells me that once the huge baby boom cohort starts filing claims, not even the biggest players in the field will be able to cover the costs.

HEADLINE: Japan's Manufacturing Confidence Index Drops Sharply

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
A key measure of business confidence released on Monday foreshadowed more bad news ahead for the Japanese economy, which is already in recession and struggling to maintain competitiveness in the face of a steadily-appreciating currency. 
 The Tankan survey of leading manufacturers suffered its sharpest fall in decades, and is now at its lowest level in seven years, reported the Bank of Japan, which compiles the closely-watched quarterly survey.
 The deterioration in sentiment was in line with what economists had expected. Japan, the United States and much of Europe have slid into recession as a global credit crunch hampered consumers and companies' willingness and ability to invest.
 However, the speed of the fall in Japan's sentiment -- the index for large manufacturers plunged to minus 24 from minus 3 in the September survey -- also highlights how rapidly the crisis has swept into the Asia-Pacific region in recent months. The region's export-oriented economies, like Japan's, have seen demand for cars, consumer goods and IT evaporate in their key U.S. and European export markets, with weak demand at home unable to compensate.
 Japanese exporters have suffered the added burden of a steadily appreciating currency, which makes their goods more expensive in the United States and Europe. The yen last Friday hit a 13-year high against the dollar, and was trading at 90.85 to the dollar on Monday morning. A year ago, it was at 111.60.
 Japan's stock market shrugged off the survey results, and rose Monday morning amid hopes that the struggling U.S. auto industry may receive a lifeline. The Nikkei 225 gained 5.2 percent. Other markets in the region rose as well. The Kospi in South Korea registered a 4.9 percent advance, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 3.1 percent and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 2.3 percent. 
 Nevertheless, the overall outlook is gloomy, and Monday's Tankan survey ensured that Japanese companies will tighten their belts further as the extent of the downturn becomes apparent.
 Sony last week announced it would shed 8,000 jobs at its ailing consumer electronics unit, which has suffered especially badly from shoppers' unwillingness to open their wallets for anything but the bare essentials. Further job losses are likely, economists say -- and this in turn will depress consumer sentiment in Japan, already at a record low, even further.
 The government has announced a series of stimulus measures in a bid to stimulate the economy, most recently with a beefed-up package on Friday, and the Bank of Japan has cut its already low interest rates to 0.3 percent. This leaves the BOJ with little leeway to cut rates further it its
 next policy meeting on Thursday and Friday.

HEADLINE: Closing Time on the Farm Is Dinner Time for Pheasants

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
The governor says: Let them eat pheasant.
 It may sound odd, but the economic pinch on New York State's government may result in thousands of needy families dining on pheasant this Christmas. 
 Ending a long tradition of operating pheasant farms for hunting, New York State officials have announced that they will close the last state-run pheasant farm, the Richard E. Reynolds Game Farm, which opened in 1927 in Dryden, N.Y., near Ithaca.
 The farm's approximately 8,000 pheasants will be slaughtered over the next three weeks and distributed to food pantries throughout the state's Southern Tier, said Yancey Roy, a spokesman for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation.
 Many, but not all, of the birds will be ready to donate by Christmas, Mr. Roy said.
 ''It will take up to three weeks to line up and budget the processing of the pheasants, which will take us through the holiday season,'' he said. Running the farm, which breeds and releases pheasants into the wild for hunting, costs the state $750,000 annually. The farm's operating budget includes four full-time staff members and up to 10 part-time employees during busy times of the year, Mr. Roy said. 
 Some of the flock may be taken by private game breeders or farms, but over all, the birds remaining on the farm cannot be released into the wild. Because they have been used for breeding, they have had their wings clipped, and other stocking centers are not equipped to take them, the governor's office said.
 The closing was being done ''to assist in closing our record budget deficit and also offer struggling families nutritional food this holiday season and into the New Year,'' a press release from Gov. David A. Paterson's office read. 
 The savings would be reflected in the 2009-10 executive budget, which the governor is to issue on Tuesday, according to the release. The projected state budget deficit for next year has been estimated at $12 billion.
 Harold Palmer, president of the New York State Conservation Council, a sportsmen's advocacy group, said his group had been negotiating with state environmental officials to keep the farm open, including working out a way to raise money by creating a separate license for pheasant hunting for the estimated 60,000 pheasant hunters in the state.
 ''The next thing we know, we hear they're closing it,'' he said on Monday. ''This was an inexpensive way for the state to grow pheasant, which they'll now have to buy from private farms.''
 ''The hunters generate more than enough to make up for what the state says they're saving by closing the farm,'' he said.
 Mr. Roy said that the agency ''conducted an across-the-board evaluation of its programs to find cost savings at a time the state is dealing with a record deficit.''
 Bruce Friedrich, vice president of policy and government affairs for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, hailed the closure. 
 ''It is a scandal that taxpayers were subsidizing hunters' sick fetish to the tune of almost a million dollars per year to begin with,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The City Bolsters Its Effort To Shelter Homeless Veterans

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
On any given night, a virtual army of 150,000 veterans are homeless across the nation, including an estimated 1,200 in New York City.
Bracing for the return of thousands of soldiers from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the midst of a deep recession, city officials have taken some unprecedented steps to prevent a next wave of veterans from also sleeping on its streets.
During the past year, the city has spent $2.3 million to remodel a dingy veterans shelter in Long Island City, Queens, replacing a large room filled with cots with 243 military-style prefabricated living cubicles, and given $14.8 million to build two apartment buildings, where residents will have access to on-site counseling within a mile of the James J. Peters V.A. Medical Center in the Bronx. It has also lobbied to transform empty annex buildings at a veterans medical center in suburban Montrose into 96 units of two-year transitional housing, the first of its kind in the state. 
And, perhaps most important, the city's Department of Homeless Services and the federal Department of Veterans Affairs have integrated with Project Torch, where veterans can pursue short- and long-term housing as well as other services, all in the same office -- something no other city has done, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The moves are being watched closely in Washington as a possible model for other communities hoping to avoid a homeless debacle like the one that followed Vietnam, and even those who have long been critical of the federal bureaucracy's handling of homeless veterans are cautiously optimistic. Rosanne Haggerty, whose group, Common Ground, pioneered the model of supportive housing -- in which counseling and other services are provided to enable residents to function independently -- and is running the Montrose project, said, ''There is a lot to suggest that what New York is doing is really setting the standard.''
Ms. Haggerty added, ''We don't know if the perfect system has been built yet, but the relationships have been put in place so we don't repeat the shameful patterns of the past.''
Peter H. Dougherty, director of homeless programs for the Veterans Affairs Department, said that over the past three and a half years, the department has worked with about 2,000 homeless veterans of the current wars; the city's Department of Homeless Services said that there have been a few dozen filtering though its system.
Mr. Dougherty predicted that there would be fewer homeless veterans from this war than from Vietnam, noting, ''It is a very different demographic.'' The volunteer service members in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said, particularly those in the National Guard, are older, more likely to be married and have attained higher levels of education -- and have stronger social networks to lean on.
But some advocates look at the crumbling economy and the high number of warriors with post-traumatic stress disorder and see an approaching tsunami of need. And they point out that Vietnam veterans did not appear on the streets in any large numbers until the mid-1980s, about a decade after the war ended.
New York, like many cities, at first treated the rise in homeless veterans as a short-term crisis. But the city estimates that on any given night, 625 veterans remain scattered across the shelter system and another 560 or so live on the streets (local homeless advocates say that number is low).
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who made reducing chronic homelessness a priority upon his election, created a task force two years ago that focused on homeless veterans and was headed in part by Robert V. Hess, who retired as an Army sergeant in 1979 and is the commissioner of the city's Department of Homeless Services.
A first goal was remodeling the city's veterans-only shelter, on Borden Avenue in Queens, a cavernous space that once housed 400 veterans on cots in communal rooms. Now, the rows of cots have been replaced by 10-by-6-foot cubicles with room for a bed, a dresser and a desk. The cubicles are subject to military-style spot inspections in which neatness can earn occupants privileges like the right to have a television or a radio.
Annie Belton, who served in the Army from 1989 to 1992, called the remodeled shelter one of the best in the system, which she has used periodically for years. ''I like the fact that I close my door and lock it,'' she said.
Next month, Jericho Project, a New York-based nonprofit organization, will break ground on the first of the two low-rise apartment complexes near the James J. Peters V.A. Medical Center, in the Kingsbridge Heights neighborhood of the Bronx, designed with copious amounts of blond wood and stainless steel doors.
Sixty percent of the 132 units, which will be subsidized by government grants and private donations, will house currently homeless veterans; the rest are reserved for veterans on the verge of trouble. ''We are looking to focus on Iraq and Afghanistan veterans,'' said Victoria Lyons, Jericho's executive director. ''We think we can catch them before they hit the street.''
The most fundamental change, and the most challenging, has been coordinating efforts between Mr. Hess's operation and the sprawling Veterans Affairs bureaucracy.
The federal government has never provided permanent supportive housing -- the main tool now used by New York and other cities to keep mentally ill or addicted populations off the street. Conversely, New York generally has done well at providing housing, or at least short-term shelter, but has long waiting lists for substance-abuse and other counseling programs -- automatic entitlements for veterans.
Since early this year, any veteran who attempts to enter New York's vast municipal shelter system, or who is known by a Veterans Affairs medical facility to be in need of housing, has been sent to the same place: Project Torch, a few blocks from the Brooklyn Bridge, where four people from the city and at least eight from the federal veterans' agency work side by side to match people and needs, whether for hot showers, hot meals, doctors or housing advice.
Harold M. Edmonds, who served on the aircraft carrier Intrepid as a jet mechanic in Vietnam, took advantage of the service over the summer after he tired of sleeping in the band shell in Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Over Thanksgiving, Mr. Edmonds, 62, said he moved into an apartment that Project Torch found for him on White Plains Road in the Bronx. ''It's on the first floor. Everything is new.''

HEADLINE: Everglades Plan Under Fire as Vote Nears

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
State water managers on Monday began their final review of a proposed $1.34 billion deal in which Florida would buy 181,000 acres of land to help restore the Everglades. But with a vote expected Tuesday, criticism was already flowing like the swiftest of rivers. 
 At a public hearing, high school students, a banker, a pastor, a rival bidder for the land and a wide array of other people said the state's arrangement to acquire the vast swath from the United States Sugar Corporation should be rejected. 
 ''You've got an all-or-nothing deal here,'' said the other bidder, Gaylon Lawrence Jr., whose company, the Lawrence Group, would buy United States Sugar and then resell part of its land to the state. ''It's not fair to the community. It's not fair to the Everglades.''
 The criticism voiced at the hearing, before the board of the South Florida Water Management District, is just the latest complication for a deal that was at first highly praised but has become highly questioned in the six months since Gov. Charlie Crist first announced it.
 Florida has struggled for decades with how to balance competing demands for water, but given the current national fright over the economy, and with a deal this large, the scrutiny has become especially intense. In the last week alone, state lawmakers, other sugar companies and some environmentalists have all declared that the plan's benefits may not justify its costs.
 Mr. Crist in particular has come under fire for what critics see as a giveaway to United States Sugar, a struggling private company. Twenty-five members of the Florida Legislature from Miami-Dade County, including several of his fellow Republicans, said in a letter to the board last week that the acquisition ''appears to be nothing more than a corporate bailout.''
 The company's main competitor, Florida Crystals, filed suit in state court on Dec. 11 making essentially the same argument. The suit says the contract being considered is illegal because it would transfer taxpayer dollars to United States Sugar with ''no significant corresponding public benefit.'' 
 Erik Eikenberg, the governor's chief of staff, said the argument was shortsighted. ''This vision is bold,'' Mr. Eikenberg said. ''It will allow the state of Florida to move back in the direction of true Everglades restoration.'' 
 But even a number of environmentalists have begun to look warily at some elements of the plan, especially its lease arrangement: production by United States Sugar would not halt until after seven years, during which it would lease back the land from the state at $50 an acre -- as much as $200 less than the market rate, according to industry estimates. 
 Drew Martin, the Everglades chairman of the Sierra Club of Florida, said the discount undermined restoration in two ways: first, by making the deal more expensive, cutting into money that could otherwise be used for hydrology projects; and second, by giving the company an incentive to keep farming as long as possible.
 ''The feeling is that the deal could be better,'' Mr. Martin said, though adding, ''We don't want to lose the deal because of that.''
 At Monday's session, the district's board seemed at least partly divided. Michael Collins, the only one of the eight members not appointed by Mr. Crist, repeatedly questioned the cost, as did Charles J. Dauray.
 ''Six months ago, people worked for Lehman Brothers,'' Mr. Dauray said, adding: ''This is a very perilous time. If I had my druthers, I'd like not to be considering going for $1.34 billion into the debt markets.'' 
 Other members urged that the acquisition be seen not simply as a business decision. ''It's a policy decision, it's a value decision,'' said Shannon A. Estenoz, the board's vice chairwoman. ''There are a lot of dimensions to this.'' 
 Several environmentalists also tried to steer the debate toward Everglades restoration, expressing frustration that the discussion had become centered on short-term economics. Similarly the governor, in a letter to the board on Monday, said that ''your decision will have an impact not just for the next seven years but for the next 700 and beyond.''
 But the great concern over a lack of financial certainty was undeniable. For instance, the district estimates that the purchase of the land would force it to cut its operational budget by anywhere from a manageable 2 percent to a backbreaking 22 percent. Estimates of the total cost of the purchase, including that of the necessary borrowing, range from $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion.
 The potential for such expense seems to have raised doubts among some environmentalists. Cynthia H. Plockelman, an advocate with the Audubon Society of the Everglades, said that she strongly supported the idea of buying land from United States Sugar but that ''I am not tied in to one process for what we need.''
 Standing at a lectern before the board, she said, ''I will understand if you decide to junk the whole thing and start over.'' 
 Mr. Lawrence, the rival bidder, said he was hoping for exactly that. ''What we offer is an alternative,'' he said. Ms. Estenoz and others asked for details: How much land would you be willing to sell for Everglades restoration? How much do you need to run the mill?
 Mr. Lawrence declined to give a number or even a range. In an interview afterward, he said he did not want to overcommit, giving up more land than absolutely necessary. 
 Under the contract, Tuesday is the deadline for the board to act on the deal, and at least some members seemed willing to consider scrapping it.
 ''I remember going to a dance with one girl and leaving with another,'' Mr. Dauray said. ''We may be undergoing that occasion again.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Hidden Travels of the Bomb'' (Dec. 9.): William J. Broad draws from a new book and makes the suggestion that I. I. Rabi helped Israel develop its nuclear know-how. The accompanying graphic is just as damning: a straight line from the United States to Israel labeled with Mr. Rabi's name. To my knowledge, this implication has no basis in fact. 
 Mr. Rabi was regarded as a physicist of the highest integrity by President Eisenhower, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hans Bethe at Los Alamos and scores of others. He never ''worked'' on the Manhattan Project; rather, he served Mr. Oppenheimer as a senior adviser and was never paid a dollar. He contributed to the U.S. war effort as associate director of the Radiation Laboratory at M.I.T.
 John S. Rigden St. Louis The writer is author of ''Rabi: Scientist and Citizen.'' 
 To the Editor:
 The quotation from Robert Oppenheimer, that nuclear weapons were ''not too hard to make,'' reminded me of my father's experience as a pioneering chemist in the 1930s. He decided to hire unemployed colleagues as fellow inventors in an ''idea factory'' lab. My mother opposed the project on the grounds that very few scientists were as creative as he was. Time proved her right. Perhaps even the seemingly arrogant Oppenheimer couldn't fathom that a project ''not too hard'' for him might prove impossible for others.

HEADLINE: From Detroit to Jerusalem

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
As a sitting president and a president-elect maneuver over how to bail out Detroit and ultimately how to convince the Big Three to radically change their ways -- there may be some instructive lessons in the Middle East peace process. 
 The Middle East? At first blush it may seem a bit farfetched. But all complex, intractable negotiations especially those involving ancient, entrenched interests in which sheer survival is at stake share something in common. 
 In Jerusalem, as in Detroit, all the parties in their hearts know roughly what the final economic settlement will look like they just can't figure out how to get there. In the case of the Israelis and the Palestinians, a political map of a proposed boundaries between Israel and a Palestinian state has been kicking around for nearly a decade; while there are countless arguments about how to divide specific neighborhoods the broad outlines of a deal are well understood. It's the trust that's absent. 
 In the case of the Big Three, the map shows of which plants stay open and which close, how many jobs must be eliminated, and what kind of cars need to be produced before Americans will buy them instead of foreign models that are, increasingly, made-in-America. There's even a widely-discussed two-state solution: GM and Ford, with Chrysler, now privately owned, merging into the surviving parts of GM. The arguments are mostly over how fast it happens and whether there is still enough time left to strike a deal. Again, there is no trust: the unions believe the companies are trying to break them, the retired think their pensions are under assault, the company executives don't want lectures about prudence and planning for the future from a Congress that has run up trillions in deficits. 
 The analogy, granted, is imperfect. Already, I hear some skepticism: 
 In the Mideast, the negotiations are all about survival which is why no one is willing to give ground. But in the Midwest, isn't there broad agreement about what where the industry needs to head?
 Maybe so, but that broad agreement has existed for 30 years and we're still talking about the same goals. Now we're running out of time, fast. So I called Dennis Ross, who negotiated arms-control agreements before he tried to negotiate Mideast peace accords, to see if he could diagnose what was going wrong in dealing with the Big Three.
 ''One of the things I find in most negotiations is that even if you can figure out what the ultimate outcome is, the mystery is in how you create conditions to get to that outcome,'' Mr. Ross said. ''It's always about convincing people it's time to move, that there won't be a better time, and the longer you wait the worse it gets.''
 In this case, it's clear that American automakers need to be producing more fuel efficient cars, spewing less carbon into the atmosphere, at costs competitive with Japanese, German and South Korean manufacturers who are operating in the U.S. without the legacy costs of big pensions and health-care benefits. But no one wants to be the first to take the hit. That was clear last week, when the United Auto Workers refused to agree to a plan that would cut their total compensation to the level of workers in the Japanese and German plants in the U.S. at least until they knew whether the manufacturers, their creditors and their suppliers would also suffer.
 Isn't that the negotiation the car czaris supposed conduct, once we get one?
 Maybe. But imagine what happens when the car czar finally gets the automakers, the unions, the creditors and the suppliers into one room. What happens when he tells the unions how much their compensation will be cut, when he tells the creditors they can expect to 30 cents on the dollar, and when he tells the car companies that they have exactly five years to get their fuel efficiency to 40 miles per gallon and to drastically cut emissions?
 ''As the czar makes each pronouncement,'' predicts David Rothkopf, a former Commerce Department official, ''every one of those guys is going to stand up, one by one, and say 'Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.' They'll be dialing back to members of Congress, looking to neutralize everything the czar is doing.'' 
 O.K., so how does the czar's plan turn into law?
 It's not easy. If it had become law, the legislation that passed the House but died in the Senate would have allowed the czar to force the companies into bankruptcy court meaning a judge would be in charge. (It's harder to make a phone call to turn around a judge but it's not unheard of in some jurisdictions.) 
 Of course, everyone hates the idea of bankruptcy would you buy an SUV from a company in Chapter 11? An alternative would be to give the czar the powers of the military's base closing commission. The idea of the commission was to take the politics out of the decision over what bases would be abandoned. Congress got the commission's list and could vote to approve it or disapprove it, but not mess with it. Imagine the same for a plan to bail out the companies in return for specific factory closings, new product standards, energy efficiency and environmental targets. 
 Any other bright ideas out there?
 There's one with a lot of appeal: Cash for clunkers. As Alan Blinder, the professor of economics at Princeton and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve wrote earlier this year, the overall economy, the environment and the carmakers all stand to profit from these programs, which pay drivers ofr truly aging cars say, more than 15 years old to get them off the road. One study in California has estimated that cars built before 1995 contribute 75 percent of all the pollution spewed out of America's tailpipes. The exact number is hard to confirm, other experts say, but the notion is right: If the government could get 5 million old cars off the road, by offering up $5,000 each for cars that may be worth only a few hundred dollars to a wholesaler or junk dealer, it would clean up the air and create some demand for Detroit's newest offerings.
 Mr. Blinder estimated that program would cost less than $20 billion, which seemed like an impossibly large number when he proposed it in July, but sounds like the cost of an oil change today. It's nothing new: Several cities and states have tried versions of the program over the years, meaning there is a lot of experience out there for the Federal government to tap.
 But there's no guarantee people will turn in the clunkers, especially if they cannot get financing for the purchase of a new car. And some people are as attached to their cars as they are to their homes and they won't bite.
 I tool around Washington in a 1996 mid-life crisis classic with six figures on the odometer, a dead radio and a Blue Book value that hovers below what the government would probably pay me to crush the thing into a small cube. It's expensive to run, and more expensive to fix. But I love my clunker, and you can tell the czar I'm not giving it up.

HEADLINE: A World of Issues Waiting, Obama and His Foreign Policy Squad Brush Up

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
He has read ''Ghost Wars,'' the history of the long adventure by the Central Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan and its fruitless effort to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. He has sought the counsel of an old Republican realist -- Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser -- who has long argued against an ideologically driven foreign policy. 
 And he has one-upped President Bush's six intelligence briefings a week by demanding seven, prompting Mike McConnell, who handles presidential briefings as the director of national intelligence, to joke, ''I don't know if there's some kind of competition going.'' 
 As Barack Obama gets ready to assume the presidency on Jan. 20, he has been boning up on the many national security issues that await his first day in the Oval Office. The list spans the globe, from the obscure -- whether he should break with the Bush administration's pro-Morocco policy in its dispute over independence for the region known as Western Sahara -- to the familiar, as in whether his planned increase of troops to Afghanistan is feasible. 
 In his transition period, John F. Kennedy was meticulous about consulting his predecessor, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, about national security issues. In his, President Bush sought out Condoleezza Rice and other so-called Vulcans, his team of foreign policy experts, for cramming sessions. 
 And Mr. Obama? ''He has been voracious,'' one senior adviser said. He has had several long sessions, on the telephone and in person, with Gen. James Jones, whom he has named as national security adviser, in what the general has described as a ''walk around the world.'' 
 On Monday, Mr. Obama went a step further, meeting for five and a half hours with his national security team. In addition to General Jones and Mr. McConnell, the assembly included Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, who is just back from a trip to Iraq; Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the choice for secretary of state; Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general-designate; and Susan Rice, Mr. Obama's pick for ambassador to the United Nations. 
 Perhaps surprisingly, Mr. Obama has also been seeking foreign policy guidance from some Republicans and conservatives. Besides reaching out to Mr. Scowcroft, Mr. Obama has also called former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, a Reagan administration official who is known in some foreign policy circles as the father of the Bush doctrine because of his advocacy of preventive war. It is unclear what the two men talked about.
 Mr. Obama has sought advice from Richard L. Armitage (Colin L. Powell's deputy at the State Department, who advised Senator John McCain in the presidential campaign), Gen. Tommy Franks (commander of the Iraq invasion), and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the onetime Democrat and now independent who supported Mr. McCain in the election and is known for breaking with Democratic criticism of the Iraq war. 
 But even as Mr. Obama moves to the center, some classic liberalism has also become a part of his study program. Mr. Obama, having finished Steve Coll's ''Ghost Wars,'' is now reading ''Common Wealth: Economics for a Crowded Planet,'' by the economist Jeffrey D. Sachs. Mr. Sachs argues that big governments like the United States could successfully tackle global warming, environmental destruction and extreme poverty by refocusing just a small fraction of global income toward those issues. 
 Mr. Obama has also been making use of a military that he is soon to inherit as commander in chief. Three weeks ago, he called Admiral Mullen to Chicago for a 45-minute private session.
 ''It struck the chairman very much that the president-elect is working very hard to bring himself up to speed, that he's willing to listen, and to learn as he moves his way through the education process,'' said a senior military official familiar with the meeting. 
 Like many presidents before him, Mr. Obama expects the early months of his term to be dominated by the economy, Democratic advisers said, and indeed, the proposed auto industry bailout and the recession have controlled how he has spent much of his time. But he has also quickly learned -- as his predecessors did -- that issues of national security do not sit back and wait for the president to finish dealing with domestic policy. 
 ''Mumbai was a little bit of a wake-up call,'' one foreign policy adviser to Mr. Obama said.
 In the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama had spent far more time talking about Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan, particularly along the lawless border regions of the two countries, than Pakistan's long-running dispute with India over Kashmir. The Mumbai attacks, which officials have attributed to the guerrilla group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been preoccupied with Kashmir, moved South Asia's other simmering security crisis-in-waiting to the front burner.
 On the day of the Mumbai attacks, Mr. Obama was in Chicago, getting ready to host 60 guests at his Hyde Park home for Thanksgiving the next day. He did not cancel his Thanksgiving plans, but ended up spending part of the day in briefings with two Central Intelligence Agency officials on the response to Mumbai. He called Ms. Rice several times to get updates about the crisis and the American response. One Bush administration official with knowledge of the conversations characterized Mr. Obama's questions as ''gathering information.''
 ''He wasn't telling her how to run policy,'' the official said.
 And that Friday, Mr. Obama placed a 10:30 p.m. phone call to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, ostensibly to offer condolences about the loss of life in Mumbai.. 
 Mr. Obama had already been accused in the Indian news media of giving India short shrift, by calling President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan before he connected with Mr. Singh, as he returned some of the hundreds of congratulatory phone calls from world leaders about his election.
 Mr. Obama began getting daily intelligence briefings two days after his election victory, and quickly demanded that he receive seven intelligence briefings a week instead of the six that Mr. Bush gets.
 ''We go through a great deal of substance, on any topic you can imagine in the context of national security and potential threats to the United States,'' Mr. McConnell told an audience at Harvard last week.
 But Mr. Obama may have already discovered that the daily briefing is not enough, said Robert Dallek, the presidential historian. ''During the crisis in India, would the daily briefing suffice to tell Obama what was happening?'' Mr. Dallek asked. ''I don't think so.''
 Mr. Dallek said that former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger once scoffed to him about the daily briefings. ''He said, 'If there was something vital or crucial or a crisis developing, these daily briefs end up being just pro forma business that didn't bring you up to speed.' ''
 Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Dallek said, ''didn't think they always gave you an up-to-the-minute picture of what's going on.''

HEADLINE: Top Court Lets Smokers Sue for Fraud

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Tobacco companies that marketed ''light'' cigarettes may be sued for fraud, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday in a 5-to-4 decision that will bolster dozens of lawsuits claiming billions of dollars in damages.
 The case was brought by three smokers from Maine as a proposed class action. They sued Altria and its Philip Morris USA unit, alleging fraud under Maine's Unfair Trade Practices Act and saying they had been injured by what they called the false statements of the companies. 
 They sought compensation for economic rather than medical harm. They claimed, in other words, that they had overpaid for cigarettes based on deceptive advertisements suggesting that ''light'' cigarettes were safer than regular ones; they did not seek money for injuries caused by smoking itself. 
 It is undisputed that brands like Marlboro Lights, made by Philip Morris, register lower levels of tar and nicotine than ordinary cigarettes when smoked by machines under a standard method authorized by the Federal Trade Commission. But many smokers compensate by puffing harder, smoking more cigarettes or inhaling deeper.
 The question before the court was not whether use of the term ''light'' amounted to fraud. It was, rather, whether plaintiffs should be allowed to sue at all given the federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, which required tobacco companies to place rotating warnings on their packaging and advertising. 
 The law also said that ''no requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion'' of cigarettes so long as the law's labeling requirements were followed.
 Sixteen years ago, in a decision that produced no majority opinion, a four-justice plurality said the phrase ''based on smoking and health'' in the labeling law did not apply to pre-empt suits under state laws based on the ''general duty not to make fraudulent statements.'' Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by three justices no longer on the court, wrote the plurality opinion in the case, Cipollone v. Liggett Group Inc. He conceded that the distinction he drew lacked ''theoretical elegance.'' 
 Indeed, the lower courts have struggled to make sense of that fractured decision. At the argument of the Altria case in October, its lawyer, Theodore B. Olson, called the plurality opinion in Cipollone ''baffling, confusing, litigation-generating.''
 Justice Stevens asked Mr. Olson whether the court would need to ''reject the fraud analysis in Cipollone'' for Altria to win. Mr. Olson said yes.
 But Justice Stevens, writing for the majority on Monday, instead reaffirmed his plurality opinion in Cipollone and turned it into binding law. He was joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
 Alan E. Untereiner, the author of a book on the pre-emption defense and a lawyer who often represents business groups and companies arguing for pre-emption, said Monday's decision was ''a step backward in the recent trend of making pre-emption law more coherent. I can't remember the last time the court took a plurality opinion that caused this much confusion and bewilderment in the lower courts, and elevated it into a majority opinion.''
 The majority also rejected Altria's backup argument, that the Federal Trade Commission's policies and actions had pre-empted the plaintiffs' claims by implication. Altria argued that the commission had authorized the use of words and phrases like ''light'' and ''low tar.'' The majority flatly rejected that assertion, in language that may be helpful to the Justice Department in a separate racketeering suit against the tobacco industry pending in the federal appeals court in Washington. 
 ''It seems particularly inappropriate,'' Justice Stevens wrote, ''to read a policy of authorization into the F.T.C's inaction'' given tobacco companies' failure to tell the commission about studies concerning how ''consumers of 'light' cigarettes actually inhale.''
 The plaintiffs in the case, Altria Group Inc. v. Good, No. 07-562, were supported on the implied pre-emption argument by the federal government, which took no position on whether the labeling law pre-empted the Maine statute in so many words.
 David C. Frederick, who represented the plaintiffs, said the tobacco industry should view the decision as an opportunity. ''It would be appropriate for the tobacco companies to take a very hard look at how they market their products, because they have for decades been making deceptive claims about their products.''
 ''When people buy 'light yogurt,' '' Mr. Frederick added, by way of example, ''they expect they're getting less fat.''
 Justice Clarence Thomas dissented Monday in an opinion joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. ''The court's fidelity to Cipollone is unwise and unnecessary,'' he wrote, noting that five members of the court that decided the case found the distinctions drawn by it unprincipled. 
 ''The alleged misrepresentation here -- that 'light' and 'low tar' cigarettes are not as healthy as advertised -- is actionable only because of the effect that smoking light and low-tar cigarettes had'' on the plaintiffs' health, Justice Thomas wrote. 
 The essence of the plaintiffs' claim, Justice Thomas said, was that they had been misled into buying cigarettes they believed were safer than regular ones, meaning their claims fell squarely within the labeling law's ban on state suits concerning ''smoking and health.''
 Justice Thomas said that some kinds of fraud claims against cigarette makers may go forward, just not those concerning ''smoking and health.'' 
 ''Thus,'' he wrote, ''if cigarette manufacturers were to falsely advertise their products as 'American-made' or 'the official cigarette of Major League Baseball,' state-law claims arising from that wrongful behavior would not be pre-empted.''
 Forbidding lawsuits based on health claims, Justice Thomas said, would not mean consumers lack protection, as tobacco marketing is subject to regulatory oversight. 
 The suits affected by Monday's decision still face significant hurdles. They typically claim damages based on overpayment for a product less valuable than that advertised, meaning the sums of money involved in individual suits are not particularly large. But fraud claims, which generally require proof of reliance by the each plaintiff, are not ideally suited to class-action treatment.

HEADLINE: Some Athletes Prompt the Question: Where's the Cheer?

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
If the holiday season feels less festive than in years past, the free-falling economy might not be the only culprit. Some athletes -- and former athletes and caddies, even -- are littering the season with unpleasantness as we sort through our ''Peace on Earth'' greeting cards. 
 We could give Tiger Woods's caddie, Steve Williams, a pass for sniping at Phil Mickelson. Perhaps the holiday spirit spins backward in Williams's native New Zealand this time of year. But Kiwis are known for their good humor no matter the season, so what should we make of Williams's pronouncement to a British newspaper that he ''hates'' Mickelson?
 And in case anyone thought for a second that Williams was misquoted or misunderstood, he repeated the sentiment for a New Zealand paper: ''I don't particularly like the guy. He pays me no respect at all and hence I don't pay him any respect. It's no secret we don't get along, either.''
 Mickelson did not respond charitably. Instead of merely taking Williams off his Christmas card list, Mickelson decided to take a shot at Williams by rhetorically employing his own caddie, Jim Mackay, who is nicknamed Bones.
 ''After seeing Steve Williams's comments, all I could think of was how lucky I am to have a class act like Bones on my bag and representing me,'' Mickelson said in a statement.
 Williams and Mickelson were merely following the example of Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens, who can be a drama king for all seasons, and the former Giants running back Tiki Barber, who decided to rekindle talk of an old spat just to tamp down any stray happiness over the weekend.
 Last week Owens complained to Cowboys coaches that quarterback Tony Romo favored passing to tight end Jason Witten over passing to him. You are forgiven if you think this sounds like a 5-year-old complaining that his older brother gets all the cool presents.
 After the Cowboys defeated the Giants on Sunday night, broadcasters and others were happy to declare the Owens-Witten spat over. ''I think they kissed on Friday,'' Cowboys Coach Wade Phillips said. ''But what they do on their own time, I have to stay away from.''
 Barber's contributions to the holiday cheer came on NBC's ''Football Night in America'' on Sunday when, in an interview with Giants quarterback Eli Manning, Barber asked Manning, his former teammate, how he felt when he derided Manning's leadership skills last year.
 Manning, who snapped back at Barber after the original slight, gamely handled the question, but you could again be forgiven for wondering just why Barber wanted to bring this up again.
 After all, it is not as if fans are overflowing with holiday cheer.

 BODY:
Michael S. Dell has grown tired of discussing his company's reinvention. 
 ''It's O.K. if everyone doesn't understand what we're doing,'' Mr. Dell said in an interview at the headquarters of Dell, the computer maker. 
 He mocks suggestions that the company he founded takes more risks than in the past. With a grimace and a curt comment -- ''I don't appreciate the tone of your reference'' -- he parries questions about how Dell's culture has changed. 
 Mr. Dell's weariness toward questions about what has gone wrong at the company, once the world's largest PC vendor, is understandable. He was famous for gloating about Dell's consistency and relentless growth, but its heralded direct-sales business model and cost-squeezing supply chain management no longer give Dell the advantages they once did. Mr. Dell has further cut costs and experimented with retail sales. 
 The company, based in this small town just north of Austin, needs to do more. It plans a run of acquisitions to restore growth. But it finds itself playing catch-up in one of the most difficult economic times in its history. Its strategy hinges just as much on big bets as precise execution. 
 ''It appears they are boxed in on all sides,'' said Ashok Kumar, a securities analyst with Collins Stewart. ''I don't know how they can possibly extricate themselves from the hole they are in.'' 
 Analysts fear that after all of Dell's revamping, the company will end up right where it is -- largely dependent on the whims of businesses that buy PCs. In that case, Dell's second act would look very much like its first, with the company remaining a distributor. Except this time, it will be fighting in a world that has moved on to favor well-rounded, more flexible rivals. 
 Fellow tech giants like Hewlett-Packard, EMC, Cisco Systems and Oracle have spent the last several years bulking up through a steady stream of acquisitions. H.P., for example, has increased its annual revenue to a projected $130 billion for the coming year, from $45 billion in 2001. 
 Oracle has doubled its annual revenue over a similar period to more than $22 billion. EMC traced 76 percent of its revenue to hardware in 2000, but it now derives 57 percent from software and services thanks to acquisitions. 
 These companies, along with Sun Microsystems and I.B.M., have scooped up many of the prized assets that either survived or thrived in the era after the dot-com bust, fattening their software and services arsenals.
 Dell's growth, to revenue of $56 billion in 2006 from $5.3 billion in 1996, has come from within. But company executives now concede that they need to make a large acquisition, or a series of them, to tap the repeating, higher-margin revenue streams that come from the software and services businesses. 
 But the company trails the major technology companies. Dell has $9 billion in cash, but a deflated share price, its unique culture and inexperience with absorbing a major acquisition raise serious questions about just how much change and breadth Dell can buy. 
 ''It's not a question of size,'' said Brian T. Gladden, chief financial officer at Dell. ''I think the question is more around diversifying our revenue base and becoming bigger in some things that are attractive for the long term.''
 Dell executives point to any number of acquisition possibilities: servers and storage systems, software and services. ''That is where we have to do an acquisition to become relevant,'' Mr. Gladden said. ''There is no question.''
 Wall Street analysts speculate that Dell was gearing up to make the largest acquisition in company history. Dell spent close to $7 billion on share repurchases over the last year, while Mr. Dell has also spent his own money buying close to $200 million in Dell stock. With these gestures of confidence, Dell's share price rose to more than $25 in late August from an eight-year low of $18.24 in April.
 But Dell, like many of its peers in the tech industry, has been rocked by the overall slump in the stock market, and its shares closed last week at $11.48, a level investors have not seen since 1997. The shares closed at $11.13 on Monday.
 Dell has also made relatively few acquisitions. The largest buy in its history was the November 2007 deal for the storage start-up company EqualLogic. Dell shelled out $1.4 billion for the company in a bid to outpace rivals in the market for an emerging type of storage technology called iSCSI. 
 This technology works well with the latest hot technology in corporate data centers, virtualization software, which is used to run many applications on a single server. Dell paid a premium for moving early; H.P. bought a company with similar technology a few months later for just $360 million. 
 Dell also bought small services-focused companies like Everdream and SilverBack, using their software as the backbone of a revamped services business. Here again, H.P. outshone them. It bought Electronic Data Systems, one of the world's largest data services companies, for $13.9 billion. 
 H.P. has turned the process of acquiring companies and then cutting costs out of the operations into a science, while Dell is just experimenting with it. In addition, Dell must now learn to exploit and embrace purchased intellectual property after spending most of its history relying on partners' software. 
 When asked about how critical a large purchase is for Dell's long-term strategy, Mr. Dell would say only that the company has been making more buys than in the past. 
 ''If you look at the first 22 years of the company's life, we made basically zero acquisitions,'' Mr. Dell said. ''In the last two years, we made about nine acquisitions.''
 Mr. Dell deflects discussions toward Dell's internal growth, where consumer and some emerging markets sales grew by double-digits last quarter. 
 ''We don't have a problem of not enough opportunity,'' Mr. Dell said. 
 Dell has responded to a changing market by investing heavily in design, and it offers some of the sleekest systems on the market. It also consults with companies in the cosmetics, medical and aerospace industries to create ever stranger products, including a proprietary bamboo sheath that wraps around a line of compact PCs. 
 While the consumer line drives the impression of Dell's brand with both consumers and businesses, company executives complain that far too much attention is paid to its consumer operations, which account for just 20 percent of Dell's $60 billion in annual revenue. 
 Dell executives prefer to talk about opportunities in corporate hardware and services. 
 Dell has applied some of the same design focus seen on consumer laptops to its server business. The company now makes server and storage parts out of metal rather than plastic, saying that customers respond well to the feel of metal handles and the firm clicking sounds of a fan or hard disk sliding into place. ''You can make a cheaper product, but we're trying to make a better product,'' said Ken Musgrave, Dell's director of industrial design. 
 Dell has also created a start-up within the company that makes custom hardware for large data centers run by Microsoft and Amazon.com. In just over two years, the division has grown to the point where it would be the fifth-largest server maker in the world if it were an independent company. As a result, Dell now sits at the heart of the next Internet build out. 
 Its services hopes are pinned on providing new automated tools for managing PCs in corporate offices and data centers. The company looks to undercut rivals like I.B.M. and H.P. with the software-based services push, while also opening up Dell-scale PC services to smaller companies, which have traditionally turned to local companies for help managing their equipment. 
 Today, Dell brings in about $7 billion a year from services and is banking on the businesses growing at pace in the coming years. 
 Wall Street analysts continue to question whether the sum of these measures will translate into a more well-rounded company. 
 Mr. Dell is dismissive of such doubts. He is particularly piqued by those who say Dell's lateness to various markets was the result of deeper cultural issues. 
 ''You mean by growing 10 times in a decade?'' Mr. Dell asked. ''Was that a mistake?''
 Mr. Dell disagrees with suggestions that the company is taking more risks as a reaction to complacency.
 ''Here was a company that was manically focused on an approach to its business which caused an enormous amount of success,'' Mr. Dell said, ''and when it kind of realized that that wasn't working as well as it did in earlier periods, decided to make a number of changes.''

HEADLINE: Hard Task for New Team On Energy and Climate

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and ANDREW C. REVKIN; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The team President-elect Barack Obama introduced on Monday to carry out his energy and environmental policies faces a host of political, economic, diplomatic and scientific challenges that could impede his plans to address global warming and America's growing dependence on dirty and uncertain sources of energy.
 Acknowledging that a succession of presidents and Congresses had failed to make much progress on the issues, Mr. Obama vowed to press ahead despite the faltering economy and suggested that he would invest his political capital in trying to break logjams.
 ''This time must be different,'' Mr. Obama said at a news conference in Chicago. ''This will be a leading priority of my presidency and a defining test of our time. We cannot accept complacency, nor accept any more broken promises.'' 
 Shortly after Mr. Obama spoke, transition officials confirmed that he would select Senator Ken Salazar, a first-term Democrat from Colorado, as interior secretary. Mr. Salazar's appointment will complete the team of environmental and energy officials in the new administration.
 The most pressing environmental issue for the incoming team will almost certainly be settling on an effective and politically tenable approach to the intertwined issues of energy security and global warming. 
 The point person for these issues will be Carol M. Browner, who was named on Monday to the new position of White House coordinator for energy and climate. Ms. Browner, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, will oversee two former aides, Lisa P. Jackson, who was selected as the new agency administrator, and Nancy Sutley, who will be the chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Joining the group will be Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics whom Mr. Obama designated to lead the Energy Department.
 Mr. Salazar, a former director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and state attorney general, is a farmer and rancher whose family has lived in Colorado for five generations. He is known as a staunch conservationist and an opponent of developing oil shale on public lands. 
 His appointment will leave a Democratic vacancy in the Senate. Colorado, which voted for Mr. Obama 53 percent to 45 percent, has a Democratic governor, Bill Ritter, who will name a replacement to complete the final two years of Mr. Salazar's term. Mr. Salazar's brother John, a congressman, is among potential appointees to fill the Senate seat. 
 The intense ideological and regional rivalries that have stalled climate change legislation in Congress for years have not suddenly melted away. And even though Mr. Obama promises to give energy legislation a high priority, he first must stabilize an economy that is shedding jobs by the hundreds of thousands each month.
 The new team faces political urgency to deliver on promises made by Mr. Obama on the campaign trail. One was his pledge to use a cap-and-trade bill for curbing heat-trapping gases as both the means of shifting investments away from energy sources that cause emissions of such gases and also as the source of the $15 billion a year he promised to invest in advanced energy technology. That figure may be dwarfed by spending on stimulus programs, including so-called green projects like building wind farms and making buildings more energy efficient.
 Previous efforts to move a comprehensive climate bill through Congress stalled even without the deepening recession the nation confronts today, said Rafe Pomerance, a negotiator in the Clinton administration on international climate agreements and the president of Clean Air-Cool Planet, a Washington nonprofit group.
 Mr. Pomerance said the challenge would be to devise a scientifically rigorous bill that would satisfy lawmakers who fear the costs.
 Left unclear on Monday was how the new president's advisers intend to use the levers of government to get to the ''new energy economy'' Mr. Obama described. Also uncertain was what relationship they would forge with his powerful economic advisers.
 ''In policy terms, I think there are big questions about what priority will be given to direct public infrastructure spending versus tax-based incentives versus environmental markets versus direct regulation,'' said Paul Bledsoe of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan advisory group. ''There is still a very profound debate on all of that.'' 
 The diplomatic tension is driven by the steps required to work toward a new global climate treaty, which the United States and nearly all other nations have committed to completing by December 2009. The last round of talks ended last weekend in Poland with few signs of progress on the main goal, limiting emissions of heat-trapping gases without hampering economic development.
 It is widely felt that if the United States does not demonstrate concrete domestic steps to curb its emissions from burning fossil fuels, fast-growing developing countries will continue to balk at taking on obligations to cut their emissions. And while Mr. Obama will enjoy a larger Democratic majority than Mr. Clinton did in his two terms, the Senate has long made such steps a prerequisite for its required consent to any climate treaty.
 The scientific urgency comes from the unanticipated recent growth in emissions of carbon dioxide in China, India and other countries with fast-expanding economies. This heat-trapping gas is the biggest concern because its long life, once the gas is released, causes it to build in the atmosphere, something like unpaid credit-card debt, as long as reductions are not made.
 Additional pressure comes from growing recognition that market forces alone are unlikely to drive the spread of nonpolluting energy technologies fast enough to matter where all the growth in energy use is at its peak, in the rapidly growing countries of Asia and Latin America.
 Nathan Lewis, who leads a team at Caltech pursuing ways to greatly improve solar energy technologies, said the appointment of Dr. Chu as energy secretary sent a strong signal that Mr. Obama understood that any program on climate-friendly energy had to have three prongs: increasing efficiency, moving existing nonpolluting energy technologies more quickly into the market, and advancing on the frontiers of energy science in search of radical breakthroughs.
 ''Energy efficiency cannot be seen as Job 1 and the other stuff Job 2,'' Dr. Lewis said. ''You've got to do them all as Job 1 because they all have to work.''
 Dr. Chu has spoken of using coal to generate electricity as an environmental ''nightmare,'' but he acknowledges that the nation lacks the technology to replace it or clean it up in the near term. Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for utilities, said that any solution to the climate problem must address these costs and provide consumers and electricity producers time to adjust.
 ''There will be major costs,'' Mr. Kuhn said. ''It's a question of trying to mitigate the costs as much as possible.''
