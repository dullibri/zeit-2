HEADLINE: Opening Up Japanese Skies

 BODY:
The market for airline service between the United States and Japan works nothing like a market. Governments, not customers, decide which airlines fly, where they fly and what they charge. The system serves passengers badly because fares are high and flight schedules are skimpy. The system also badly serves the carriers. Many are shut out of the market entirely. Others find that Japan restricts their right under a 1952 agreement to fly passengers or, in FedEx's case, cargo between Japan and other countries in Asia.
The two sides are now talking. The politics of these talks is as arcane as the economics. American carriers are at each other's throats every bit as much as they are at Japan's. That is also true of the Japanese carriers. Northwest and Japan Airlines jockey to preserve their privileged status under the existing accord, while several American carriers and All Nippon Airways fight for increased access. 
 Northwest, for one, has urged Washington to demand complete deregulation -- a pro-consumer policy started under the Bush Administration that Washington has negotiated with about 25 other countries. But few believe Japan will swallow "open skies" because its inefficient national carriers would never survive competition with their American rivals. Washington's bargaining strength is limited because Japan can always call off negotiations, renounce the 1952 accord and thereby end Washington's constant carping that Japan is violating its treaty obligations.
If Washington must accept less than open skies, the question is how much less. A new accord must guarantee the right of many more American passenger airlines, as well as FedEx, to fly into Japan and then on to other Asian countries. For that guarantee to work, Japan must go further and guarantee takeoff and landing rights at its crowded Tokyo and Osaka airports.
A new accord must also permit American carriers to cut their fares at will, at least for flights originating in the United States. Under the current agreement, Tokyo can veto price cuts to protect its high-cost national carriers. Indeed, if the new accord does nothing more than guarantee substantially more takeoffs and landings, the right to shuttle between Japan and the rest of Asia and the right to cut fares, then the impact will not fall that far short of complete open skies. After all, Japan's airports are too small, and will likely remain too small, to provide unlimited travel no matter what a new accord might promise.
If Japan refuses to budge even this far, the United States could take FedEx's plea to pick up packages in Japan and fly them to other parts of Asia to arbitration, backed up by trade sanctions if Japan refuses to abide by the ruling. That would leave passengers no better off than they are today, but it would preserve the domination of American passenger carriers over Japan's, and give Tokyo strong reasons to negotiate more seriously in the future.

HEADLINE: Will Wall Street Now Have to Pull In Its Horns?

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
The not-quite-finished office building in Stamford, Conn., is an apt symbol of Wall Street's health and boundless optimism. It cost some $200 million to build, contains an up-to-date trading floor and by year-end will have created some 2,200 new jobs for the region.
For SBC Warburg Dillon Read, the building's proud owner, the project's scale signals the firm's ambitions as an aspiring Wall Street powerhouse, despite its site an hour out of New York. 
 Wall Street has indeed been expansive as the markets have boomed, but with this week's reversals many Wall Street executives and people who do business with them are questioning whether these firms will be forced to pull in their horns, reining in expansion plans and hiring -- not to mention trimming year-end bonuses.
Up until this week, brokerage firms whose stocks trade publicly have been the juggernauts in an impressive market, gaining 73 percent as a group for the year, more than double the market as a whole.
To the extent that Wall Street processed a record number of trades this week, there will be some increase in commission income. Fifteen percent of all brokerage firms' revenues now come from commissions, versus 24 percent 10 years ago.
But the flux in volume could be short-lived if investors sit out until markets calm. And these gains could be eroded if firms were caught with sizable investments in Southeast Asia when those markets collapsed.
"The firms absolutely, whether they should or not, trade as leveraged stock market proxies, so their movements are exaggerated" on both the upside and the downside, said Sallie L. Krawcheck, a research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who expects earnings for these companies to dip 10 to 15 percent.
"Absolutely, we can benefit from volatility," said Donald B. Marron, chairman of Paine Webber Inc., cautioning that this was possible as long as "what you're seeing is a correction in price, without fundamentally damaging the market."
For its part, SBC, a subsidiary of the Swiss Bank Corporation, is moving ahead with plans to consolidate several offices into its new corporate headquarters in Stamford, where ribbon-cutting ceremonies were held on Tuesday. So far, about 150 of the firm's equity traders have moved in. Workers continue to hook up terminals in the vast trading room, readying it to house the firm's approximately 660 equity, fixed income and foreign exchange traders. And it can be expanded to hold about 1,000 traders.
"We're not concerned at all," Simon Canning, chief executive of SBC, said of the market selloff. "We believe we can add value in any market environment, and we're committed in the long term."
The move to Stamford has allowed the firm, which had recently added Dillon, Read and before that S. G. Warburg to its stable, to upgrade its computer systems. So while some brokerage firms struggled on Tuesday with the highest volume ever on the New York Stock Exchange, trades were executed at the one occupied end of the two-story-high trading room "without a hiccup," said Joel Nachman, an information and technology executive director at SBC. "The system wasn't even stressed," he said.
But "I'm glad it didn't happen two weeks ago," the day the firm handled its first trade in its new building, Mr. Nachman said, referring to Monday's 554.26-point drop in the Dow. "That would have really gotten everyone's adrenaline pumping."
Other Wall Street firms are also staying with their expansion plans, at least for now. Merrill Lynch is moving ahead with plans to hire 175 newly minted M.B.A.'s from the country's top business schools as associates, an official says, up from the 162 hired from last year's class.
But market performance during the next few months may have an impact on such decisions, says Joan Zimmerman, executive vice president of G. Z. Stephens Inc., an executive search firm.
And with characteristic bravado, this year's M.B.A. candidates still feel confident enough to say they expect to get several job offers and weigh them before making a choice.
"If there has to be a correction, we'd rather have it now before we start working and our compensation is tied to the market," said Craig Livingston, president of Columbia Business School's sales and trading club. "People at Columbia are very market savvy. No one's panicking."
Career placement directors say the pace of interviewing, which begins in earnest at this time of year, has not slowed. Still, to be safe, Columbia is inviting a more diverse group of firms from international banks expanding in the United States to firms in Latin America and Europe to recruit its M.B.A. candidates. It is also suggesting that its students consider careers in technology if they are dead set on a Wall Street job.
"We've been planning for a downturn and we've been getting to know lots of people in lots of regions," said Thomas E. Fernandez, assistant dean of career services.
But on Monday, that confidence temporarily wilted, as M.B.A. candidates at business schools around the country nervously watched the market dive.
"The halls were packed," said Portia Fultz, another Columbia student. "People were just watching the television. Some people who had job offers were like, 'I need to decide what I'm going to do.' Others were saying, 'I've already accepted. Does this lock me in?' "
Another concern is whether Wall Street bonuses will be cut. Wall Street firms in New York City paid out about $9.4 billion in bonuses in 1996, a 50 percent increase from 1995, according to estimates prepared by the New York State Comptroller's office. Over all, securities industry wages accounted for more than 15 percent of total wages in New York City in 1996, even though the jobs make up only 4 percent of the city's work force.
And investment bankers are not the only ones affected by the hefty cash infusion. Beyond the helpful lift their dollars give New York City's economy, Wall Street bonuses are believed to have a sizable impact on the national economy as well.
At this point, analysts and recruiters say the signals look good for bonuses to increase again this year.
"Strategically, people would be foolish not to pay well this year," said Gary Goldstein, president of the Whitney Group, an executive search firm. "This was a really stellar year and there are enough players out there who will pick up the good people" if they decide to move elsewhere, he said.

HEADLINE: Global Rally Lifts Markets As Tumultuous Week Ends

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
A global rebound in share prices helped buoy Wall Street yesterday, ending a tumultuous week of trading that some global investors feared would result in more wrenching declines.
Markets around the world, which had been roiled by an economic and currency crisis in Southeast Asia, appeared to stabilize after Hong Kong stocks soared early in the day. 
 That rally spread to Tokyo, London, New York and Sao Paulo, Brazil, at least temporarily reversing the domino effect of price drops that had infected markets the last two weeks.
 In Latin America, one of the hardest-hit regions, stock prices rose despite concerns that a banking and currency crisis may be developing. In Brazil, for instance, the main stock market index rose 1.5 percent.
 In New York, the recovery helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average 60.41 points, to 7,442.08. Still, the Dow -- the most widely followed market barometer -- has suffered one of its worst monthly setbacks in recent years, falling 6.3 percent in October.
 That decline came entirely from Monday, when the Dow plummeted 554 points, or 7.18 percent, its biggest rout in a decade.
Since then, investors around the globe have endured a roller coaster ride of buying and selling. Indeed, on the New York Stock Exchange, nearly four billion shares traded this week, easily surpassing the record of three billion shares set a week earlier. By comparison in the early 1970's, it could take a year to trade three billion shares.
The weekend could not have come too soon for many Wall Street traders and analysts who had long been expecting a violent setback to one of the greatest bull markets of all time.
But few analysts believe the crisis in Asia will undermine the United States stock market, largely because most of the problems are in countries like Thailand and Malaysia, which account for only a small portion of United States trade.
"This isn't a fundamental crisis, it's a crisis of confidence," said Alfred Goldman, the director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards Inc., a St. Louis investment firm. "The impact of Asia on our domestic economy is small. The impact is going to be fractional."
 The reason, many analysts contend, is that the United States economy's diversity is such that problems in isolated parts of the world cannot have a substantial impact.
Underscoring this point, the Government reported yesterday that even though growth accelerated in the third quarter, inflation dropped to its lowest level since 1964.
 "The statistics in this country are just fabulous; you just couldn't write better numbers," Charles Pradilla, a market strategist at Cowen & Company, said. "Our figures look better and better in comparison with the rest of the world."
 The economy's strength sent interest rates modestly higher yesterday, as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.15 percent from 6.14 percent on Thursday. But the week's powerful rally in bond prices -- fed by global investors seeking a safe haven from instability elsewhere -- was largely undisturbed.
 The resilience of the United States economy and financial markets also helped strengthen the dollar in global foreign exchange dealings. In New York, the United States currency rose to 120.37 yen, up from 120.28 Thursday, and 1.7257 marks, up from 1.7189.
But most analysts agree that it could be weeks, if not months, before the stock market regains enough momentum to resume its powerful advance.
 "What we're seeing is a classical reaction; this is usually the way markets work after a big downturn," Mr. Pradilla said. "Until the issues that caused the break are clarified, we're probably going to tread water."
 But Laszlo Birinyi, a market analyst, said the demand for United States equities has not declined, even during the selloff earlier this week. "My big thing is money flows, and you'll find that even when the market cracked, people kept buying," he said.
 According to Mr. Birinyi, even as the prices of blue-chip shares were falling, demand for them was surprisingly strong. In Hong Kong, however, his research showed prices and demand both weakened.
 Few analysts are sayign the worldwide economic turbulence will subside in the next week. The International Monetary Fund has assembled an emergency aid package for Indonesia, but there are indications that Thailand has failed to heed some provisions of its I.M.F. agreement.
 Barton M. Biggs, the global strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, said world markets could be in store for even greater disruptions.
 "The sharp breaks in stock markets around the world are a warning to investors," he said in a report issued Monday when Hong Kong's free fall set off stock carnage around the world. "The global bull market has become very dangerous. The contagion has spread around the world, and no market, anywhere, is invulnerable to infection."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE GOVERNOR;
Whitman Works to Shore Up Her Softer Areas of Support

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: CRANFORD, N.J., Oct. 31

 BODY:
With the clock ticking down until Election Day and new polls showing that her re-election remains in doubt, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman turned her attention today to some of her softer areas of support, giving a speech on personal responsibility that seemed intended to appease social conservatives in the Republican Party and expressing her solidarity with minority voters who traditionally favor Democrats.
Mrs. Whitman, whose positions in favor of abortion and gay rights have alienated some fellow Republicans, told hundreds of teen-agers at Cedar Grove High School in Cedar Grove that she wanted to begin a dialogue with children in New Jersey about the importance of choosing between right and wrong. 
 Alluding to a number of widely publicized crimes by teen-agers in New Jersey over the last year, Mrs. Whitman said, "We as adults have not been doing a very good job of communicating to you and the people coming up after you about consequences and responsibility.
"When you make a decision and take an action, there are going to be consequences," she said.
Later, Mrs. Whitman stood on a dais outside the Oak Avenue School in Orange, a relatively poor city that has traditionally been a Democratic stronghold, and accepted endorsements from several local black leaders.
The words she chose to thank them tacitly acknowledged the broad spectrum of support she needs to win on Tuesday.
"To have people such as this come across party lines, step forward and be willing to back a Republican woman governor means that everything we've been doing over the last three-and-a-half years to help people is being recognized," Mrs. Whitman said.
"We didn't put policies in place that helped black people or white people or Oriental people," she said.
"We put them in place to help people. We didn't put them in place to help Democrats or Republicans or independents. We put them in place to help people."
The Governor made more than a half-dozen campaign stops in three counties in northern New Jersey today. For the most part, the events were short of speechifying and heavy on symbolism.
She teetered delicately on an undersized chair, looking like Gulliver among the Lilliputians, to read stories to young children at a day-care center in Bloomfield. She embraced elderly people who were waving red, white and blue pompoms at an assisted-living residence in Cranford.
And as she had been almost every day last week, Mrs. Whitman was flanked by prominent Republicans whose presence underlined her own stature.
The people accompanying her today were former Gov. Tom Kean and United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.
At a stop in Union, Mrs. Whitman announced that a major pharmaceutical company, Pharmacia & Upjohn, had decided to relocate its worldwide headquarters from London to New Jersey, though the exact place has not been determined. Mrs. Whitman framed the announcement with upbeat assessments of economic vigor in New Jersey during her administration.
Mrs. Whitman began the day in a more defensive posture, sparring with her Democratic challenger, State Senator James E. McGreevey, during a taping in New York City of a segment of WNBC-TV's "News Forum" that is scheduled to broadcast on Sunday.
In what was expected to be their last meeting before Election Day, the candidates turned to familiar points of contention: auto insurance rates and government debt.
But Mrs. Whitman jettisoned such prickly topics for the rest of the day, focusing instead on shaking hands and posing for photographs with just about anyone who strayed near her.

HEADLINE: Miami's Election for Mayor Rouses Sour Mood in Voters

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 31

 BODY:
The mood of Miami voters was in evidence on Tuesday at Bayfront Park, where 20,000 baseball fans celebrating the Florida Marlins' World Series victory lustily booed the Mayor who had promised to build a stadium to keep the team here.
"We're No. 1!" Mayor Joe Carollo shouted into a microphone as the boos got louder. 
 The same mood was apparent a day later at a meeting of the Shorecrest Homeowners' Association, whose board refused to endorse any candidate for mayor in Tuesday's election after hearing a debate between two other candidates, including Mr. Carollo's main contender, former Mayor Xavier L. Suarez of Miami. But board members did not stop there.
"We will encourage people to vote for two candidates and invalidate the ballot to say we have no confidence in any of them," said the association's director, Christopher Morson.
After a corruption scandal last year that sent the city manager and a city commissioner to prison and the subsequent discovery of a financial crisis that required state intervention, Miami voters last September approved a strong-mayor form of government in which an elected official, not an appointed administrator, would be held accountable for the city's management. The problem for many voters now is that in this effort to break with the past, they are faced with what seems to be a choice between political dinosaurs.
Mayor Carollo, 42, a Cuban-American businessman, served as a Miami commissioner from 1979 to 1987, a tenure characterized by strident anti-Communism and unpredictable behavior. (He once showed up at a news conference at which he had been expected to endorse a mayoral candidate but instead denounced him as a demagogue, to the shock of those present.) After voters returned him to the commission in 1995 and elected him Mayor last year, Mr. Carollo has scored points among voters by simmering down and helping to steer Miami out of a $68 million deficit attributed to mismanagement.
"We have brought the honesty and the professionalism that you rightfully expect from city government," the Mayor said at a recent campaign appearance. "Judge me on what I've done in the last 14 months."
Mr. Suarez, 48, a lawyer, was Miami's first Cuban-American Mayor, from 1985 to 1993, and last year ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Dade County, whose government is responsible for the Miami metropolitan area. Mr. Suarez counts on supporters satisfied with his performance as mayor -- his nuts-and-bolts style of governing earned him the nickname "the pothole mayor" -- and puts great stock in his Harvard University education.
But many voters are disturbed that contrary to almost universal opinion, including a state panel of experts, Mr. Suarez insists that Miami has no fiscal emergency and that Mr. Carollo exaggerated the financial troubles to appear as the city's savior and in the process ruined its credit and image.
"I promise to give you common sense and efficient government, and you'll see how much money you have available," Mr. Suarez told a neighborhood group last week.
Polls show a dead heat between Mr. Carollo and Mr. Suarez in one of the few hotly contested mayoral races in a major city this year. Their battleground has been the Hispanic neighborhoods where more than half of the electorate resides. In competition with three other candidates who are expected to receive only a small fraction of the vote, Mr. Suarez or Mr. Carollo must get more than 50 percent of the ballots to win and avoid a runoff on Nov. 13 for the top two finishers.
But even among Hispanic residents, who make up more than 60 percent of the city's population of about 360,000, there are groans at the familiar faces and shenanigans. Although Miami has suffered corruption and financial trouble before, the one-two punch of last year has left many voters with little tolerance for business as usual.
At the Dr. Armando Badia Senior Center, a campaign stop for both candidates, many of the Hispanic elderly eating lunch last week said they were weary of the personal attacks in debates that are mostly conducted on Spanish-language television and radio. In one particularly raucous face-off at a Cuban restaurant, the candidates and their supporters even came close to a physical confrontation, according to published news reports.
"Its shameful," said Dolores Ramos, 67, who said she would vote for Mr. Suarez only because "he's not as dirty as the other one."
There is consensus among the candidates and economic experts that what Miami needs most is to attract business and expand its tax base to insure financial stability. In an interview, Mr. Carollo emphasized that the city was well on its way to recovery with a five-year budget plan and $2.5 billion in new construction over the next three years, including new hotels and office buildings.
Mr. Suarez, in a separate interview, said he would sell "unnecessary" city-owned buildings and reduce the salary of top city executives to reduce taxes and attract more private investment. But on the stump, Mr. Carollo is more often heard calling Mr. Suarez "Pinocchio" while Mr. Suarez condescendingly corrects Mr. Carollo's Spanish and declares him "incapable" of understanding Miami's finances.
Meanwhile, many voters listen skeptically, unwilling to exonerate longtime city politicians for problems of corruption and ineptness that were years in the making.
"I have to feel that part of the blame is with these gentlemen," a member of the Brickell Homeowners Association said as both candidates looked on at a meeting last week.
The same night, residents of Brickell, in an upper-middle-income neighborhood of condominiums near the downtown financial district, also heard from candidates for one of five city commission posts. They included Humberto E. Hernandez, a 35-year-old former city commissioner who is under indictment on Federal charges of mortgage fraud and money laundering and is seeking re-election while he fights in court.
The audience listened with politeness and a heavy heart.
"It's very sad," Joe Wilkins, a 47-year-old schoolteacher and Miami native said as he left the meeting at a local church. "It's not an encouraging election."

HEADLINE: The Economic Stakes in Asia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
When the Clinton Administration explained today why it was contributing $3 billion to a fund to stabilize Indonesia -- and with it the economies of Southeast Asia -- it argued that far more than stock market shocks and fluctuating currencies were at stake.
"Financial stability around the world is critical to the national security and economic interests of the United States," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in a statement. "These countries are not only key markets for U.S. exporters, but are also crucial to our efforts to promote growth, peace and prosperity throughout the world." 
 This is hardly the first time the Administration has linked America's security interests with quelling an economic panic. That was the major argument for rescuing Mexico during the 1995 peso crisis, when the United States stepped in with $12 billion in aid. Mexico, though, was not only about the peso, it was about drugs and illegal immigrants.
But can the same case be made for Indonesia? If so, what about the next crisis, perhaps in Brazil -- where interest rates doubled on Thursday to 40 percent on an annual basis.
"It is a very, very sticky question," a senior Administration official said as the last touches were being put on the Indonesia package this week. "We can't step into every economic mess. But when the problem of contagion across markets becomes this serious, then it's hard to do what America once did -- regard an economic crisis as a confined event, like a civil war."
What prompted the Administration to move, officials say, was fear that the instability that first racked Asia, then sped to markets around the globe, could turn into something more virulent. Economists have been talking about the dampening effects that continued turmoil in the Asian markets -- and a slowdown in growth -- could have on American exports. That was certainly a concern, Administration officials say. But it was the least of the worries.
The bigger strategic concerns come in many varieties and cross a number of Washington's bureaucratic boundaries.
The immediate objective of the American action, of course, is what the Treasury calls "market contagion" -- the odd ways in which a loss of investor confidence in one nation spreads to others. Often that seems irrational: There is no reason that concerns about Indonesia or Thailand, for example, should rock confidence in Brazil. But currency crises have a way of gathering steam. And in this case, the willingness of governments in Asia to devalue their currencies because their neighbor has -- making their goods more competitive -- has prompted market speculators to suspect that other governments will follow suit lest they be priced out of the export race.
President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina explicitly discussed that issue today when he gathered reporters to say that he had been assured by Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, that Brazil would not follow the Thais and the Indonesians.
"I spoke with the President of Brazil," Mr. Menem said, "a great friend, who told me in these very words: 'Carlos, we have no doubts about this. If we devalue, then you'll have to devalue and who knows where we will end up?' "
"I told him we must stay firm," Mr. Menem said, "and we'll overcome this crisis."
That may be both exaggeration and bravado -- the world seems pretty prosperous these days, even with the market instability -- but Mr. Menem was clearly trying to signal to the speculators that they should go elsewhere.
The second level of concerns in Washington center on one of the central goals of the Clinton Administration: To open world markets.
Mr. Clinton has made market-opening a centerpiece of his foreign policy and the market turmoil threatens his agenda.
No one yet knows how the instability of the last week will play out in Congress as it debates giving President Clinton "fast track" authority to negotiate new trade accords.
The third set of worries focus on the question of what happens if market instability turns into something more ominous.
Indonesia has had only one major transition of power in recent times. The 1965 fall of Sukarno and the rise of Suharto were accompanied by the deaths of an estimated half a million Indonesians. At the time, Washington's concern was to keep Communism from overtaking the country.
Today the concerns are very different. But Indonesia is now not only a major market for the United States, and a huge producer and consumer of goods for all of Asia, it intersects a critical shipping route for oil. That helps explain why the American military command for the Pacific, based at Pearl Harbor, has been searching around to beef up its team of regional economic analysts.
And one of the other major concerns arising from the currency crisis, Clinton Administration officials say, has been to make sure that Asians know that the United States is engaged in the region's economic stability. No sooner had the troubles began than Japan proposed the creation of a separate Asian stability fund, one that would sidestep the American-influenced International Monetary Fund.
Several Asian countries warmed to the idea, especially those that chafe at the conditions that the I.M.F. places on its loans -- closing failing banks, opening markets, breaking up cozy monopolies. All of those conditions were part of the I.M.F.'s package for Indonesia, which will provide the country with $15 billion to $18 billion in immediate financing, and another $12 billion to $15 billion in backup financing if the Asian crisis worsens.
Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, frequently calls rescue operations like the I.M.F.'s part of "preventative diplomacy."
"These are all part of promoting prosperity," he says, "and maintaining stability."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE VOTERS / CAMPAIGN STOP -- Views From the Neighborhoods;
Park Slope's Proud Democrats Feel Tug of Strained Loyalties

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
Susan Friedland, a 29-year-old city planner, sounds a lot like many Park Slope residents when she talks about the mayoral election. She's a Democrat, she detests the Republican Party, and she thinks Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's popularity shows that voters have abandoned the ideal of social change to vote for their narrow personal interests.
"I'm a Democrat and I'll vote Democratic in the election," Ms. Friedland said the other day. "The Mayor's policy on welfare reform is cruel and inhumane. The economic regeneration is not due to increased jobs at all levels of the economy. All my friends are old-style New York Democrats. No one I know is voting for Giuliani, but I think the Democratic Party is falling apart." 
 "I think people are voting in a pretty selfish way," she said of polls showing Mr. Giuliani with a substantial lead over his Democratic challenger, Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. "I think it's a national trend. People no longer think government can play a role in improving the lives of people."
This Brooklyn neighborhood on the northwest edge of Prospect Park, with its exquisite brownstones, funky coffee shops and a reputation for social tolerance, is a place where Mr. Giuliani is well liked, but Ms. Messinger is perhaps even better respected as a symbol of the kind of unabashed liberalism that many people fear has fallen out of favor.
Interviews this week on the Seventh Avenue commercial strip in the heart of Park Slope suggest that Ms. Messinger is likely to do well there. But they also indicated that Mr. Giuliani may do better in the neighborhood than he did in 1993, when he won only 29 percent of the vote against Mayor David N. Dinkins.
In the random but unscientific survey, 21 of 40 people said they were planning to vote for Ms. Messinger. In addition, 14 people said they would vote for Mr. Giuliani. Five were undecided, but three of those were leaning toward the Mayor. Most said they had voted for Mr. Dinkins, a Democrat, in 1993.
Park Slope is a predominantly white, well-educated, middle-class enclave, a place where residents say issues like the environment and race relations, as well as crime and education, are important to them. It is the kind of area where Ms. Messinger must do extremely well if she is to have a chance at an upset on Tuesday.
The neighborhood is 74 percent Democratic and only 7 percent Republican; almost three out of four voters supported President Clinton last year.
With one exception, all of those who said in interviews that they would vote for Mr. Giuliani were Democrats. They said they would support him for the same reasons cited in other neighborhoods: they felt safer, the city looked better and they believed the economy was on track. Even so, some supporters faulted Mr. Giuliani for lacking compassion or not paying enough attention to the poor.
"There are a lot of things in his character I disapprove of, but he gets the job done," Ida Deboissiere, who with her husband owns a neighborhood store called Mail Boxes on Fifth, said of the Mayor. "I'd like to see the city more conservative. I think it's half and half now. The city was more liberal five years ago."
Nancy Ivan, a 31-year-old television director who voted for Mr. Dinkins four years ago, now supports Mr. Giuliani. "I am thinking about my personal life," she said. Ms. Ivan has never voted for a Republican before, but she said, "I don't feel like I'm crossing any major line."
"The subway is cleaner," she added. "I feel better. I am voting for Giuliani because of the crime issue, mostly. I'm pretty impressed with what he's done in the past four years. We need to give him a chance to take it to the next level."
Some people said they did have compunctions about crossing party lines, but no one saw Mr. Giuliani's expected victory as a referendum on his party. Many noted that he is a moderate Republican, with a pro-choice stance and the backing of many prominent Democrats.
Kathleen McShane, a 33-year-old art professor, said she is bothered that as a Democrat she plans to vote for Mr. Giuliani. "He used to be a Democrat so I trust him," she said. "I never voted Republican before, but I will because I think he'll do a good job. It does actually bother me. To commit to a party whose values I don't agree with, that's difficult."
Joe Mangano, a 41-year-old health administrator, said he was undecided, but leaning toward Ms. Messinger. Mr. Mangano said neither candidate had done a good job of discussing issues like health care, the environment and education.
A Democrat, Mr. Mangano said he believed Mr. Giuliani's likely re-election reflects the power of the incumbency and underscores the importance of the sharp decrease in crime. "Policy-wise, there is not much difference locally between Republicans and Democrats," he said. "It's not like at the national level where you have Jesse Helms."
Others, like Janet Mann, a 51-year-old high school teacher, are undecided because they are weighing their traditional liberal ideology against more pragmatic concerns.
"It's depressing," Ms. Mann said. "I don't agree with Mayor Giuliani, but I don't think Ruth Messinger will make a good mayor. It's not so much who I want, but the message I want to send. I don't think Giuliani cares."
The hard-core liberals in the neighborhood saw no philosophical fences to straddle. They said they thought Mr. Giuliani trumpeted the interests of the privileged, was shortsighted in his efforts to combat crime, and in general displayed bias in an incredibly diverse city.
"As someone who made his presence felt through law and order, I don't see him having much vision about what it'll take to make things better," Raphael Rudnick, 64, an editorial consultant, said of Mr. Giuliani. He supported Ms. Messinger based on previous encounters with her, but he also said she was running an anemic campaign. "I'm convinced about her wanting to make things better," Mr. Rudnick said. "The city is becoming more conservative. It's that principle of selfishness. The chances of people looking each other in the eye is lessened."
The election reflects class divisions more than anything else, said another Messinger supporter, Molly Fox, a 43-year-old manager for the Equinox fitness clubs.
"I think people who are comfortable will be more comfortable, people who have less will continue to have less," she predicted of Mr. Giuliani's likely second term. "Things go in cycles. We had Jerry Brown, then we had Pete Wilson in California. I think we're in a conservative cycle. We're reactive, we're fearful, we want to hold on to our money. Social issues go by the wayside."
Liza Cowan, a 48-year-old artist who also supports Ms. Messinger, agreed. "I think Giuliani hides a lot of biases in his quality-of-life ideas -- race, sexuality and class biases -- and that angers me," Ms. Cowan said. "If you're a middle-class, and particularly a white middle-class New Yorker, there is an illusion of safety, but it's so superficial. I don't think people are looking beyond their own issues."
Many of the most ardent Messinger supporters said they did not expect her to upset the popular incumbent. Jeff Prant, a photographer who sat with a friend on a stoop eating lunch, said he saw the election as a referendum on Mr. Giuliani's record and not much else.
"The crime issue is the big thing that does it for people," said Mr. Prant, who is 41. "I'll be voting for Messinger. I think she has a more well-rounded view of what quality-of-life issues should be in the city. Crime is important, but no attention has been paid to air quality, traffic and noise."
Mr. Prant said he thought the election would be closer than many people expect. "With the vast majority of registered Democrats in this city, the turnout will tend to favor her," he said. "I just don't think she'll win."

Stocks Rebound Modestly, Ending Week of Turmoil
A punishing week in world stock markets closed on a slightly upbeat note as prices rebounded in a modest rally that started in Hong Kong and worked its way through Asia, Europe and the Americas. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.41 points, to 7,442.08.
But the Dow still ended October down 6.3 percent, one of its worst monthly setbacks, because of the rout last Monday that erased nearly 7.2 percent from the widely followed average. Moreover, many traders and Wall Street analysts said they expected more wrenching volatility because the underlying causes -- economic and currency problems in Asia and other emerging markets -- will not abate anytime soon. Page D2.
 
Court Blocks Rail-Fire Verdict
The Louisiana Supreme Court delayed enforcement of a $3.4 billion jury award until injuries suffered by all 8,000 victims of a 1987 New Orleans rail tanker car fire could be evaluated. The ruling relieved the CSX Corporation of posting a $2.5 billion bond, its share of the award, and reduced the possibility that the railroad company will have to pay the full amount. D3. 

Jury Favors Tobacco
A jury in Jacksonville, Fla., decided R. J. Reynolds was not negligent in the lung-cancer death of a 30-year smoker, a victory for the tobacco industry in a widely followed case that could increase the prospects for Congressional approval of the proposed national tobacco settlement. A11.
 
More Stamina, Less Inflation
The American economy grew vigorously this summer even as inflation dwindled to a level unseen since 1964. The data showed that the economy grew in the third quarter at an annual rate of 3.5 percent, up from 3.2 percent in the spring. The extraordinary performance provided some reassurance of the economy's resilience after the week of global financial market upheaval. A1.
 
Broad Goal in Indonesian Aid
In helping to quell an economic crisis in Indonesia with a $3 billion contribution to an aid package, the interests of the United States may not be as apparent as they were when the Clinton Administration rescued Mexico during the peso crisis. But what prompted the Administration to move was fear that Asia's financial instability could turn into something more virulent. News Analysis. A4.
 
US Airways Pact Ratified
Pilots at US Airways overwhelmingly voted in favor of a five-year contract that opens the way for the nation's fifth-largest carrier to reduce costs and expand through the purchase of new Airbus Industrie planes. D3 .
 
Gold Drops on Swiss Sale Plan
Gold tumbled 2 percent, its second big drop in a week, after the Swiss Government endorsed a sale of 800 metric tons. D11.
 
May a Thousand Stocks Bloom
President Jiang Zemin of China visited Wall Street, whose denizens are more likely to quote the Dow than Mao. He toured the New York Stock Exchange, where the flag of China flew outside for a day. Mr. Jiang even rang the bell to begin trading. "Good morning," Mr. Jiang said on the balcony of the exchange, "I wish you good trading." A1.
 
Metal Industry Merger
Allegheny Teledyne will buy Oregon Metallurgical for $560 million in stock, a merger that will create a specialty metals producer capable of taking advantage of the booming aerospace market. D2.

Excerpts From Mayor's Conversation With Editors and Reporters

 BODY:
In an interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani discussed his mayoralty and his top priorities. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Mr. Mayor, the polls show that most people think of you as a law enforcement mayor. That's the primary thing they know about you. I'm wondering if you want to change that perception in your second term, broaden your reputation so that you are as well known for something else, and what that would be. 
 A. Obviously if I have a second term, I would like to build on what we've been able to achieve in the first term. And I've always been a person that likes to think that I grow and change and try to absorb the different things that are needed at different times. I think that in the first years -- I think even during my administration, I changed.
I think the first year that I was the Mayor, I think it would be fair to say that I was a law-and-order mayor. I thought that was the major priority because I felt that was the biggest crisis the city faced. And as soon as that began to turn somewhat, we were able to keep the emphasis on that, and I began focusing on the economy a lot more. . . .
The priority I began when I was Mayor was that we had to dramatically reduce crime. Shortly after getting elected, I realized that I'd also have to be a mayor who made very tough decisions. . . .
I truly believed that the deficit I had to face was about 8 or 900 million even though the prior mayor said it was 300 million. I thought it was about three times more. I never realized it was like five or six times more. And, so, I had to start two kinds of mayors from the very beginning, law and order and reorganizing the city budget, because if I didn't reorganize the city budget, we would have had a disaster. . . .
In the second year, we began to devote a lot of attention to reorganizing city agencies. And in the third year we devoted a lot of attention to schools. I know that a lot of the focus on schools people tie to the election. But that really isn't true. I've been trying to reform schools from the time that I got into office. My focus has been to try and have accountability for the school system. It's been very consistent.
What I wanted to achieve was the same thing that Mayor Daley achieved in Chicago, which is that the Mayor being accountable for the school system so that I could have made the difficult decisions about the school system that I had to make in other parts of the city government: remove the boards, make the superintendents responsive to performance, remove the principals that aren't performing. And I realized a year ago, almost to the day because it was around October of last year, that I realized that there was a possibility of making a compromise if I were willing to achieve for Rudy Crew what I was trying to achieve for myself.
And I put that compromise together because the opportunity was there to do it. So, I'd like to build on that. And I think what I'd also like to be able to do over the next four years is guide the welfare-to-work transition in a way that sets New York apart.
New York used to be known as the crime capital and welfare capital. We changed the stereotype of being the crime capital. I think we're now the leader in how to reduce crime. People come here from all over the world to learn how to reduce crime from New York City.
I'd like us to be in the same position with regard to transitioning from welfare to work. The scale on which we've reduced welfare is greater than any place else in America. The scale of our workfare program is larger than any place else. And the opportunities of moving people from welfare to work are much greater in New York. So, I'd like to see us be able to achieve that.
And I'd also like to see us be able to achieve massive reduction in drug dependency, because I think it's at the core of maintaining the crime reductions, quality-of-life improvements that we've had. And it's critical to really helping young people have an opportunity to be free and independent.
Q. Might it be a concern for those who are going to vote for you that you're only going to be a two-year mayor?
A. Two-term mayor.
Q. Two-year mayor.
A. I intend to be the Mayor of New York City for the next four years. I resist all of the old games that are played, because I always hate to make the same mistakes that people have made in the past. So I have, I don't rule options out. I rule them in, and my intention is to be Mayor of New York City for the next four years. . . . And there's another reason why it would be foolish for me to rule out options.
Possibilities make my job as Mayor easier to bargain, leverage and fight for the City of New York. Particularly as the Mayor who is a lame duck mayor on the day that I get sworn in. It ain't bad for people who are saying, 'This guy has possibilities.' It makes it a lot easier for me to negotiate with Albany, Washington, for the benefit of the city. Most of our best mayors and governors have recognized that.
Q. What do you see as your biggest regret about your first term?
A. I have no doubt what my biggest regret is. There's more than one. The biggest one is not having anticipated, not having begun to reform the Child Welfare Administration on Day 1 the way I began the reform of the Police Department and Fire Department, even began the reform of the school system, but it took a lot of changes to have it really start happening two years later. I didn't anticipate it, didn't understand it enough, didn't know enough about it.
And because I think if I had started it literally two years earlier, we'd be that much further ahead now in understanding what has to be done to change it. I realized it because when Elisa Izquierdo died, I started to pay a lot of attention to it. I asked Howard Wilson, who was then the D.O.I. Commissioner, who was the best efficiency expert I ever worked with, the best beyond being a D.O.I. Commissioner. One of the reasons I hired him as D.O.I. Commissioner was to help me try to make city agencies more efficient. . . . He spent a month looking at child welfare, and he came to me and said it's an absolute disaster. . . . There are no standards for hiring people, there is no sense of mission, the priority is totally reversed. The priority is reuniting families, which is a wonderful thing to do, but it was like a dominant philosophy that overwhelmed, sometimes, common sense. And so I spent a lot of time focusing I wish I had done that.
Q. Are the city and the electorate changing?
A. The answer is yes to both. The city is still a Democratic city, and it is now a city that is more willing to move off party if it sees reasons to do that. This is the third time I've run for mayor, and each time the party identification becomes less significant. But it's still significant. . . .
Q. Do you think there's a chance that a Republican can win the mayor's office in 2001?
A. Sure.
Q. Do you think it's likely?
A. No, there's a chance. Just talking pure political strategy, there is one advantage to being a Republican, and then a disadvantage. The advantage is you don't have to be in a Democratic primary, which very often narrows the choice to the one who has the least chance of winning the general election. Because primaries tend to bring out the most extreme voters. They tend to be much more ideologically driven than a general election.
General election, all those people come out to vote who don't live, breathe and die for the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. They may be registered as a Democrat, may be registered as a Republican, but they tend to be more like average people, which is they'll vote either way. And if you are a Republican candidate, you can stay out of that primary and stay out of having to move yourself significantly over to one end of the spectrum or have to deal with group politics in a way in which eventually you define yourself away.
The disadvantage is the registration numbers are huge. They're still 5 to 1, and there is a stereotype of Republicans, actually a prejudice. It really is. It's like a form of prejudice, as it isn't as evil as a racial, religious or ethnic prejudice, but it's irrational. It has the same irrational concept to it.
Q. Have you given any thought to try to groom a successor?
A. No. I haven't given any thought to a successor, not any more than I have running for another office. But I'm not going to rule out giving thought to a successor.

HEADLINE: U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT A STRONG PACE IN THE 3d QUARTER

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
The American economy grew at a vigorous pace over the summer and a key measure of inflation dwindled to a level not seen since 1964.
The extraordinary economic performance, reported today by the Commerce Department, provided a bit of reassurance after a week of turmoil on Wall Street and in the world's financial markets. 
 Despite concerns about the impact of slower growth in Southeast Asia and Latin America, the economy actually gathered steam in the three months ended in September, growing at an annual rate of 3.5 percent, up from 3.2 percent in the spring.
The expansion pace has surpassed 3 percent for four consecutive quarters, the most consistent gain of that magnitude since 1984, when growth surged after the economy emerged from the worst postwar recession.
"The United States economy continues to rumble along at an astounding pace," said Mark Vitner, vice president and economist at the First Union Bank.
Soaring business investment and a sudden rebound in consumer spending led the growth over the summer. Businesses are pouring huge amounts of capital into new plants and equipment at a stage in the business cycle when investment usually tails off. Such investment is growing even faster than the economy at large, helping to keep strong demand from pushing up prices.
"When you do that, it's unambiguously positive," said Mickey D. Levy, a senior economist at Nationsbank.
Indeed, inflation remained thoroughly subdued in the last quarter. According to one measure in the Commerce Department report, inflation crept up at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent, the lowest since 1964.
Such remarkable price stability has made it possible for the Federal Reserve to keep its foot off the brakes while the economy accelerates. Though the economy has grown rapidly for a full year, periodically renewing concerns that inflation lurks just around the corner, the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates by only one-quarter point, back in March. Otherwise, the central bank's main effort to keep growth and inflation in check has been to make periodic comments, like the cautionary words about overenthusiasm in the stock markets by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
Still, today's economic report was somewhat stronger than expected and might edge the Federal Reserve closer to a rate increase later this year. A rate increase is considered unlikely at the Fed's Nov. 12 policy meeting in part because it could further disrupt the world securities and currency markets. A stock rout in Hong Kong, on the heels of a series of currency devaluations and economic troubles in weaker Asian nations pulled the Dow Jones industrial average down 554 points on Monday. After seesawing throughout the week, the Dow finished on a positive note, up 60.41 points today, narrowing the week's loss to 273.33 points.
If the worldwide markets settle down, economists said, the Federal Reserve may want to raise rates at its mid-December meeting. Among other things, the central bank will be looking for signs of inflationary pressure in the October jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday. Labor markets have shown signs of tightening -- first-time claims for jobless benefits dipped below 300,000 last week -- and the unemployment rate hovers close to a quarter-century low, at 4.9 percent.
The White House responded to the report by citing a host of recent figures that point to the best overall economic conditions since the early 1960's.
"The fundamentals of the economy remain strong," Janet L. Yellen, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement. "Growth is robust; businesses are investing in new and better equipment; unemployment remains low at 4.9 percent; workers are experiencing real wage gains; inflation is in check and consumer confidence is high."
Americans opened their wallets wide in the latest quarter. Consumer spending grew at a 5.7 percent annual rate, rebounding from less than 1 percent in the spring. Major purchases like autos were largely responsible.
Economists said this torrid spending pace was unsustainable and would probably be curbed in part by the recent correction in the stock market, which shrank the paper assets of millions of Americans and injected a note of uncertainty about their financial futures.
"When you see declines of this kind, it makes individuals and businesses pause and reflect," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities, referring to the market drop. "And consumers don't have a lot of savings left to dig into."
To finance their spending spree over the summer, households drew down their bank accounts. Personal saving as a percentage of disposable income fell to 3.6 percent in the third quarter, the lowest since early 1994, from 4.2 percent in the spring.
During the summer, business investment leaped at an eye-popping 18.7 percent annual pace after a 14.6 percent jump in the spring. Equipment investment grew at an annual rate of $33.3 billion, seven times the rate for structures.
Inventories expanded, but at a markedly slower pace than during the first half. If the buildup had not slowed, the gross domestic product would have grown 4.8 percent instead of 3.5 percent, the Commerce Department said.
Reflecting strong demand for foreign goods, imports surged at a 14 percent annual pace, more than twice as fast as export growth.
As for inflation, the price index for gross domestic purchases rose at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the latest quarter, up from eight-tenths of 1 percent in the spring. When food and energy are excluded, this gauge fell to 1 percent from 1.6 percent.
The price deflator, a very broad measure of price movements, eased this summer to a rate of 1.4 percent, the lowest in 33 years, from 1.8 percent in the April-June period.
Lee Price, Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, said at a briefing that the outlook remained favorable for continued healthy growth and low inflation but declined to speculate how much damage might be inflicted by economic distress in Asia and the recent decline in American stock markets.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE MAYOR;
Mayor Foresees Better Relations With Minorities

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani predicted yesterday that his relationship with many minority groups would improve in a second term, as residents of poor neighborhoods realized they were sharing the benefits of lower crime and an improved economy.
In an hourlong discussion with reporters and editors of The New York Times yesterday morning, the Republican-Liberal candidate for re-election said he no longer finds the same resistance in neighborhoods that voted against him in his previous races against David N. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor. The endorsement of his candidacy by several prominent black elected officials shows that his policies are now appreciated outside his core base of support, he said. 
 "There used to be 1,000 shootings in East New York a year," he said. "Now there are 200. Those are things you feel in your life, and I think that that has created a certain amount of support and a relationship that wasn't there before. We have to build on that. So I don't think the barriers that we faced in the first two years will exist in the next four."
A recent poll by The Times shows that a plurality of black and Hispanic residents believes that life in the city has worsened during the last four years, but not as high a percentage as felt that way in 1993. Blacks residents tend to have an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Giuliani, while Hispanic residents hold a more favorable opinion; among both groups, however, Mr. Giuliani is held in higher regard than he was four years ago.
The Mayor did not outline any new priorities or outreach efforts to heal what has been a persistent rift between blacks and whites in their perception of the city, and in fact resisted the idea that he needs to address race relations at all. Instead, he said he hopes to continue trying to redefine the way New Yorkers relate to one another by concentrating on their shared experiences rather than their differences.
As in the rest of his campaign, the Mayor spent most of the discussion talking about his record during the last four years, deflecting repeated attempts by questioners to learn about new policies in a second term. Asked, for example, if he hopes to be remembered as more than a just a mayor who reduced crime, Mr. Giuliani said he likes to think of himself as someone who grows and changes and responds to different needs at different times. But he immediately began a year-by-year recounting of the various efforts in his first term, without describing his vision of a second.
In general, he said, he plans to build on his first-term accomplishments in law enforcement, economic matters and welfare, while beginning an intensive program to reduce drug abuse.
Only once, in response to a question, did Mr. Giuliani discuss his Democratic opponent, Ruth W. Messinger, saying she has "romanticized homelessness" and has been one of the strongest proponents of allowing poor people to become dependent on government. In contrast, he said, his administration believes in making people independent, and has done more for homeless people than any administration in years.
In the last two years, Mr. Giuliani has begun a policy of turning away thousands of families from the city's Emergency Assistance Unit for the homeless because they could not demonstrate that they truly needed shelter. Although the Mayor said that represented a more realistic, unromantic way of dealing with homelessness, a spokesman for Ms. Messinger said yesterday that the policy was simply uncaring.
"The Mayor is not making people independent of government," said Leland T. Jones, Ms. Messinger's spokesman. "He's cutting people loose. He's cutting kids loose from schools that don't give them a good education, cutting people from welfare-to-work programs that don't give them work, cutting families from soup kitchens and food pantries."
Although he has been repeatedly criticized by Ms. Messinger for his record on education, Mr. Giuliani said he was so satisfied by the performance of Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew that he would not spend any political capital in Albany trying to assume personal control of the school system, which he once demanded. He said he would rather fight the smaller battle of ending tenure for principals, possibly reserving the issue of mayoral control for late in his term, when suspicious legislators won't think he wants control for himself.
"I think that maybe we could win that battle fighting it for a future mayor," he said. "If you fight it for yourself, you get involved in Republican-Democratic politics."
He said he planned to continue scrutinizing each agency's budget for more reductions, and hoped to reduce the long-term projected deficit of $2.6 billion by about 40 percent. But he said he had no plans to reduce that number to zero, despite the demands to do so from outside budget monitors, because it is politically useful to him to show a long-term projected deficit.
"If there were all zeros here, the mayor would have no defense against a City Council that wanted to spend $10 billion more," he said. "This is a valuable thing to have, to restrain the desire of any legislative body to spend more money."
The Mayor gave a similar glimpse into the workings of his political calculus when discussing his future career, which is limited by law to one more term as mayor. Although he says he intends to serve out a full term, he would not rule out resigning early to run for higher office because, he said, it keeps his fellow politicians off guard.
"Possibilities make my job as mayor easier to bargain, leverage and fight for the City of New York," he said, "particularly as the mayor who is a lame duck mayor on the day that I get sworn in. It ain't bad for people who are saying this guy has possibilities. It makes it a lot easier for me to negotiate with Albany, Washington, for the benefit of the city. Most of our best mayors and governors have recognized that."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Congress Brace for Trade Fight

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
As White House aides scurried to barter promises of economic aid and worker assistance in exchange for crucial Democratic votes on free-trade legislation, President Clinton took his campaign for the bill out to the country today.
The President's push came as the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, tried to bring the trade bill to the floor but was blocked by Democrats, some of whom have signaled that they will fight to keep the measure from ever coming to a vote. 
 The first big test of the opponents' strength in the Senate was set for Tuesday, when the bill's supporters will try for the 60 votes needed to shut off a filibuster.
While the battle gathered steam in Washington, Mr. Clinton was in Florida, a state whose citrus and tomato industries are already buffeted by competition from Latin America.
In West Palm Beach, the President signaled that he would offer a package of aid for displaced workers to address Democratic fears that Americans would lose jobs as a result of free-trade deals flowing from the expanded authority the legislation would give him. That authority, he said, is "key to U.S. leadership in the world economy."
The legislation at issue would grant the President fast-track authority: the ability to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could then either approve or reject, but not amend. Just as he did when he pushed through the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, Mr. Clinton will be relying largely on Republican votes. But he still needs to convince enough Democrats that the legislation is important enough for them to defy the wishes of one of their strongest constituencies, organized labor.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which contributes heavily to Democratic campaigns, opposes the bill, saying it does not take strong enough steps to stop competitor nations from producing cheap goods by exploiting workers and cutting corners on environmental protection.
Mr. Clinton's biggest hurdle is expected to be in the House, where the Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, is leading the fight against the bill, with Speaker Newt Gingrich cast in an unlikely role as the President's ally.
House Republicans say that of the 218 votes that will be needed for passage if all members vote on the measure, they can provide only about 150. So Mr. Clinton must corral a significant number of votes from his own party.
The vote-gathering has taken the form of deal-making, with one Administration official declaring privately that the "bazaar is open." Assistance for displaced workers is a cornerstone of that effort.
Mr. Clinton spoke briefly in West Palm Beach today, addressing about 400 workers and their families who had waited more than four hours for him in the parking lot of Tropical Shipping, the leading carrier in United States-Caribbean sea trade. He said the company would benefit greatly from the bill. As a fellow Democrat, Gov. Lawton Chiles, told the audience, Florida's "No. 1 cash cow" is trade, not tourism.
Mr. Clinton was hampered by laryngitis, which left him in the awkward position of having his Commerce Secretary, William M. Daley, read the President's most definitive statement to date on the trade issue.
But later in the day, his voice returning, Mr. Clinton said the answer to Democratic concerns over the trade legislation was to help workers whose lives might be disrupted by it.
"We ought to provide more education and better transition for people who lose their jobs through trade or technological changes -- not walk away from trade," he told about 20 people over lunch at a mansion where he raised $180,000 for the Democratic Party.
The worker-assistance package is not expected to be unveiled until the middle of next week. But aides said it would include about $500 million over five years in trade-related assistance and training programs, and additional sums for economic development and for communities that suffer from expanded trade.
White House officials, who sounded out members of Congress throughout the day, said the package was still "evolving."
Gene Sperling, the chief economic adviser at the White House, said that the worker assistance package would involve "policies we will say we will commit to put in the budget and fight for," but that the aid would not be attached to the trade bill.

HEADLINE: Reuters Given Big Tax Deal For Its Project In Times Square

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and executives of Reuters American Holdings announced yesterday that the giant British media company would build a 32-story headquarters in Times Square with the help of tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks.
Reuters, which had threatened to move to New Jersey or Connecticut, plans to build an 855,000 square-foot tower at the northwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue for about 1,800 employees now working at eight buildings scattered across Manhattan. 
 In return, officials said yesterday, the city and the state are to provide the company with a $12.5 million sales tax exemption on computers, desks and other equipment over the next 20 years. Reuters would get up to $13.5 million in additional tax incentives if it creates new jobs over the life of the deal.
Reuters would also benefit from large tax incentives, already tied to the site, that were approved in the 1980's to lure development to Times Square, until recently a seedy district with little appeal for developers.
"Reuters could have gone somewhere else, but they chose to stay in the media capital of the world," Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference in the MTV music studios overlooking Times Square. "This is great news for Reuters and New York."
The announcement of a new tower in Times Square is the second in the past 18 months: the developer Douglas Durst is building a 48-story tower across the street from the Reuters site for Conde Nast Publications. And, in the past two years, Disney, Warner Brothers, Virgin Superstore and others have moved into the area.
But as the economy has improved, the city has come under increasing criticism for continuing to grant tax breaks to corporations for moving to a booming Times Square and other sites in midtown Manhattan.
The total value of all the tax breaks for Reuters is more than $60 million. Asked to place a value on the first round of tax breaks that were tied to the site, Mayor Giuliani and Reuters executives refused.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said Reuters would get $36.9 million over 20 years; other city officials said the figure was $32 million and some developers and urban planners said it was much higher.
Critics say the city is giving too much away. "Giuliani has made Times Square the tax break or corporate welfare capital of the world," said State Senator Franz Leichter, a critic of the city's tax policies for more than a decade. "The next neon sign to go up should flash dollar signs with the amount of tax breaks going to corporations that fill Times Square."
After Conde Nast threatened to move employees out of the city last year, the publishing company got a $10.75 million incentive package to move to a Times Square site that already enjoyed significant tax breaks. MTV and its parent company, Viacom, got a $15 million tax break in 1994 from the Giuliani administration.
Next door, the Marriott Marquis hotel got a $90 million tax break in the early 1980's, and across the street, Bertelsmann AG, the German media conglomerate, got an $11 million tax break at 1540 Broadway, an office tower built with property tax abatements. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, got a $100 million tax package when it purchased 1585 Broadway and 750 Seventh Avenue, two office towers also built with property tax abatements. Both companies had threatened to move at least some employees out of New York.
Mayor Giuliani said the tax breaks are necessary to retain the city's major corporations, especially when New Jersey and Connecticut are offering competing incentives, and to spark new construction in the city. Since January 1994, the Giuliani administration has struck 35 so-called corporate retention deals worth nearly $700 million.
As a result of their economic development policies, officials say, the city has saved 79,700 jobs and produced 40,000 new jobs.
But those numbers are difficult to confirm, since most corporations threaten to relocate only a portion of their employees, while city officials count the entire workforce as jobs saved if a company agrees to stay. To make matters more complicated, the city's list of deals includes Republic National Bank, even though the city canceled the $6.4 million tax break in 1996 when the company slashed its payroll.
Although the announcement yesterday ended Reuters's yearlong search for new space, the news did not lift the spirits of some 600 union employees negotiating a contract with Reuters. The company has asked for 104 concessions, union officials said.
"The timing of this is incredible," Peter Szekely, chairman of the Reuters unit of the Newspaper Guild in New York. "The same week they're asking us for monumental cuts in wages and benefits, they're getting a sweetheart tax deal. Yet this company has been very profitable for a long time."
Robert Crooke, a spokesman for Reuters, said the contract demands were consistant with the company's "desire to reduce costs, focus our business efforts and consolidate our operations in an amenable environment" in Times Square.

HEADLINE: No Accord, and Little Optimism, at Bonn Talks on Global Warming

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: BONN, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Delegates from 143 countries ended their preliminary talks on global warming here today with no agreement on key issues and growing concern about the prospect for success at the concluding meeting, to be held in Kyoto, Japan, in early December.
The United States' long-awaited proposal for cutting emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases has been scornfully attacked as too weak by delegates and environmentalists from around the world. And there is no sign that American negotiators are about to yield. Still, the Americans themselves said there was more than a little cause for hope, and they have been lobbying their counterparts here, urging them to take a closer look at the American proposal. 
 Meanwhile, several small-scale but higher-level meetings will be held between now and Dec. 1, when the Kyoto conference begins. The goal of the conference is to revise the climate treaty negotiated in Rio in 1992, which set voluntary limits on emissions.
"There are enough ideas out there to have an agreement," a senior State Department official said here, speaking on condition of anonymity. "We just don't see all the kinds of coalescence that you need yet" for that to happen.
On the surface, the American proposal looks like the weakest on the table. The proposal would require industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels in the period 2008 to 2012. By contrast, the European Union wants to cut emissions 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. But the American official said that the American plan compares more favorably with other countries' positions once the details are inspected, and that it is superior to a major alternative plan advanced by Japan. Japan calls for a 2.5 percent to 5 percent reduction in emissions by about 2010.
Other American officials here today released an analysis by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency which suggests that the American position actually occupies a middle ground between those of Japan and the European Union. The contention is based mainly on the fact that under the United States' proposal, emissions of a full array of six different greenhouse gases would be controlled. The other proposals would control only three.
Some critics said the the American estimate that its plan occupies the middle ground were based on uncertain projections of future emissions of the less abundant gases. The Administration countered that even if the projections of future emissions are cut in half, the basic conclusion still holds.
The conclusion is "a valid point," said Dr. Daniel Lashof, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. "I think the U.S. proposal is stronger than the Japanese position, but it still falls short" of the European position.
With the Bonn phase of the talks over, key players must "review their options so that they can come to Kyoto with more flexible positions," said Michael Zammit Cutajar, the executive director of a 1992 climate treaty under which the discussions are proceeding.
The State Department official, however, said that "before we start perhaps working toward any compromises, we want to be sure that people understand" the full scope of Washington's position.
It may be, said Mr. Zammit Cutajar, that the Kyoto session will produce "an agreement based not on a single target, but on different targets for each country." The individual targets for emissions cuts would be based on an array of economic and social characteristics. The possibility of differentiated targets received much attention here over the last few days.
Talks between now and the Kyoto conference are to take place in a number of forums and through a number of channels, some of them at higher levels, between now and the start of the Kyoto conference on Dec. 1. Among the forums coming up is a meeting involving ministers from key countries in Tokyo Nov. 8 through 10. The American official said there was "great scope" for resolving many issues before the Kyoto talks begin.
Aside from the question of what cuts in emissions industrialized countries will make, and when, the biggest outstanding issue is the role of developing countries. While the 1992 Rio climate treaty generally requires them to control their emissions, it does not bind them to any specific commitments. The rationale is that since the richer countries are responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions so far, they should take the lead in reducing them. The negotiators in Bonn had no authority to consider new commitments for the developing world.
But the Kyoto meeting involves a higher-level conference of parties to the 1992 treaty, and it can take up the issue. The United States has insisted it will sign no agreement in Kyoto that does not include "meaningful" participation by the developing countries. Everyone agrees that eventually, the poorer nations will have to take on specific commitments if greenhouse gases are to be controlled, since their emissions are expected to surpass those of the industrialized world in the early decades of the next century.
"If all the industrialized countries shut down their economies, it wouldn't solve the problem," said Bert Metz, a prominent European negotiator from the Netherlands. But the issue of the developing countries' future role has proved intractable so far. In part, that is because these countries argue that the industrialized countries have become rich through a century of increasing emission of greenhouse gases. They argue that initially, the rich countries should bear most of the burden of preventing climate change.
The American diplomat here said that since the issue is so difficult, it may be possible to resolve only part of it in Kyoto, with negotiations continuing beyond that.
The Clinton Administration says that under its proposal to include all six greenhouse gases, total greenhouse emissions in the United States would be reduced by some 30 percent from what they would otherwise be around 2010.
The most important of the six heat-trapping gases is carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. The others are methane, which forms in landfills and is emitted in part as waste natural gas, and nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexachloride, which are produced by a variety of industrial processes and have a variety of uses.

HEADLINE: THE JIANG VISIT: THE CHINESE-AMERICANS;
Welcome, A Bit Blase, For Fellow Traveler

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
For many Chinese in New York, President Jiang Zemin's trip yesterday to their new hometown was in a strange way not that different from their own journeys to America.
They had come from China and Taiwan to the center of the financial world searching for business opportunities and better lives. 
 And he came to visit not the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building, but the citadels of capitalism, including the New York Stock Exchange and I.B.M.
"I hope that Jiang Zemin can open up the country more, but he still needs more time," said Su Bin, a musician from Beijing who immigrated here in the early 1980's.
Mr. Su, who plays the erhu, a Chinese stringed instrument, took a break from one of the Blimpie's outlets he manages in New York City to discuss the visit.
"People who complain about human rights in China -- all they do is make noise here so they can advance their own careers and get a green card," said Mr. Su, 49, wearing a red apron that bore the words "Mrs. Field's Cookies."
For all the attention to the hundreds of protesters who have dogged Mr. Jiang on his visit, the reaction in the Chinese neighborhoods yesterday was underwhelming, even indifferent, as people went about their business as if it were any other Friday.
Many residents asked to size up the visit had the same response: His visit doesn't affect us much, but he is welcome, nonetheless.
In Chinatown, one man sitting on a bench near the statue of Confucius at the corner of Division and Bowery clutched a copy of the newspaper Sing Tao and said he had read all about President Jiang's visit.
"I'm just a worker," said the man, who declined to give his name. "But as a person, he clearly has distinguished himself and he deserves to be respected and welcomed."
Even those whom one might have assumed would have strong misgivings about the visit seemed to suggest that business was more important than politics.
Take Dr. Wang Shou-dong, 39. He grew up in a middle-class family, the son of a factory manager in Liaoning province. But when his father fell victim to Communists and the Cultural Revolution, the family suffered mightily: Dr. Wang was twice sent to rural labor camps, while his father was beaten and lost the vision in one eye.
Later he became a doctor, specializing in Chinese herbs and acupuncture. Still, he said, he felt stifled by the Chinese bureaucracy and his own scars from the Cultural Revolution -- to the point that he was afraid to do his best and become too prominent a doctor. So in 1995 he emigrated to New York.
Now he works at the Beijing Chinese Medical Hospital of New York, a small second-floor clinic in Flushing, where he has paper the walls with newspaper clippings about his work. He is happy to be in America, he said, and grateful that "you can learn a lot of things and do anything you want, as long as you work hard."
And yet, for all the bad memories of his youth, he said, he still welcomed the leader of a Government that he does not trust.
"This is a good thing, because he can see what's good and what's not so good about American business, and then he can take it home to China," he said. "The most important thing is that China raise its standard of living and develop its economy."
Lin Go, an immigrant from Taiwan and a former taxi driver in Taipei who now runs an jade store in Flushing, shared the sentiments of immigrants from the mainland. "We are all Chinese, and I think he has the same attitude that we Chinese immigrants do when we come here," said .
"For us, we come to New York to learn about business and support our families. For him, his country is his family. So he wants to learn about business and support his family."
There were, of course, some reminders that not all views were benign. In Flushing, for instance, several minivans decorated like Chinese jails circled the block, displaying anti-Jiang banners and chanting slogans of protest.
When the subject of the Tiananmen Square crackdown came up, several people interviewed said they could not forget or forgive what had happened, but many gave Mr. Jiang the benefit of the doubt.
"New York is the place where business is Number 1," said Joe Si, owner of Joe's Shanghai, a popular dumpling house in Flushing. "If he is able to reform and improve China because of what he learns in New York, then this trip will have been very productive for all the Chinese people."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE RECORD;
Whitman Stands on Record, But Newer Issues Stir Voters

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was elected four years ago on the strength of a bold promise: she would cut state income tax rates by a third. Her opponents said it couldn't be done. She did it in two years, not three.
The tax cuts made Mrs. Whitman a national celebrity: the politician who kept a promise. But that has not been enough to appease New Jersey's voters in this fall's gubernatorial campaign. They are fed up with paying the highest auto insurance rates in the nation, and angry that their property tax burden continues to rise. 
 Those two issues did not rise to the top of Mrs. Whitman's agenda until this year, giving her Democratic challenger, State Senator James E. McGreevey, plenty of fodder to barrage her with criticism. What had been expected to be a dull race has turned into a close one.
The campaign's fixation on auto insurance and property taxes has overshadowed Mrs. Whitman's record in other areas. Cutting taxes was her most notable achievement, but not her only one.
Working with a Republican-controlled State Legislature, she imposed strict time limits and work requirements for people on welfare, but her plan also offers job training and child care to help recipients move into the workplace.
She established new statewide academic standards for public schools. She has signed one bill after another, imposing tough penalties on convicted criminals and requiring insurance companies to allow women to stay in the hospital up to 48 hours after giving birth and up to 72 hours after a mastectomy. She has also imposed new state regulations on health maintenance organizations, giving patients more rights and doctors more say in how they should do their jobs.
But some decisions are expected to cost her votes in this election, particularly among conservative Republicans who oppose abortion rights. Mrs. Whitman refused to sign legislation to ban certain late-term abortions unless the bill included an exception that would protect the health of the woman. She also has not pushed legislation that would let parents send their children to private schools with taxpayer dollars.
There have also been some notable policy failures, particularly during the last two years, when the tax cuts have not dominated the political agenda.
On school financing, the New Jersey State Supreme Court rejected Mrs. Whitman's argument that academic standards would end the disparity between rich and poor school districts. The court required the Governor and the Legislature to come up with another $250 million.
On property taxes, Mrs. Whitman has given municipalities some tools to lower rates, but she has also kept municipal and school aid flat during most of her first term. The average statewide property tax increase has been about 4 percent during each of the last four years, the lowest in decades. Yet local taxes still rose from a high base, making New Jersey's property taxes the nation's highest.
And while Mrs. Whitman did win legislative approval to eliminate auto-insurance surcharges and end automatic rate increases, lawmakers rejected the cornerstone of her proposal: lowering rates by giving consumers the option of reducing coverage.
 
Jobs and Business Focus of First Term
When Governor Whitman took office on Jan. 18, 1994, auto insurance was not New Jersey's most pressing concern. Its economy was beginning to show distinct signs of improvement, but the electorate was beset with economic anxieties. Home prices were falling. Major corporations were downsizing, and manufacturing companies were moving out.
Determined to lure jobs to New Jersey, Mrs. Whitman began her first term with a much-publicized "Open for Business" campaign. As she had hoped, her celebrated income tax cuts sent a signal that New Jersey was now friendlier to business. She also lowered 11 other taxes, from the tax on apple cider to the corporate tax on small businesses, which is now the lowest in the New York metropolitan region at 7.5 percent.
To the dismay of some environmental groups, however, she rolled back some of the tough environmental regulations that industry here had long complained about. She also sought to negotiate with companies that violate environmental laws rather than first take them to court, a sign that many environmentalists viewed as weakening enforcement.
Mrs. Whitman says that the state's economy is now humming. A Dun & Bradstreet study placed New Jersey eighth in the nation in the number of jobs gained by luring businesses from other states.
While the tax cuts did not produce the 450,000 new jobs that Mrs. Whitman once projected, more than 200,000 more jobs have been created since she took office, wiping out the losses of the early 1990's recession.
Total personal income has jumped 15 percent. But not everyone in every part of the state is thriving, and Mr. McGreevey has pointed this out regularly in his campaign. The cities have not shared in the economic recovery. The poverty level has not improved. The number of people without health insurance has risen. Many of the new jobs have been in the service industries, offering lower wages and fewer benefits than the manufacturing jobs that have disappeared.
"Her record is like the economic recovery that she has presided over," said Henry J. Raimondo, an economist and professor of public policy at Rutgers University. "It is very uneven."
 
Variety of Maneuvers Slows Budget Growth
Governor Whitman proclaims that she has slowed growth in the state budget to its lowest level for any four-year period in the last 50 years. But a review of her last four budgets suggests that she did not do it the old-fashioned way, by cutting programs or services. Over all, state spending has risen by more than $1.5 billion since she took office.
With legislative approval, she used budgetary maneuvers that included reducing the state's contribution to its seven pension funds by $3 billion, stretching out debt payments for $1.3 billion in state transportation bonds to 20 years from 10, and pulling millions of dollars from various state trust funds that had been designated for specific purposes.
But Mrs. Whitman has succeeded in controlling costs in important areas. She reached agreement on a four-year pact with the state's largest public employee union, freezing wages for two years and reducing the state's cost of providing health care benefits. She has also cut about 3,000 state jobs, mostly through attrition.
Any attempts by the Governor to bill herself as a strong fiscal conservative, however, were undermined this year when she pushed through a plan to borrow $2.75 billion for the state pension system. The borrowing, the first of its kind in the nation, allowed the state to reduce its scheduled pension payment to $220 million from $810 million, freeing $590 million to help balance an election-year budget.
Instead of using her political capital this spring to win support for her auto insurance plan, Mrs. Whitman found herself devoting a great deal of attention to pushing her borrowing proposal through the Legislature.
"For better of worse, the pension bond plan probably undermined much of the impact that she hoped to gain from the income tax cuts," said Donald Linky, president of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey, an independent, nonpartisan public policy organization in Princeton. "It gave her opponents an easy way to attack her tax-cutting record by simply saying that she borrowed in order to make up for the lost revenues."
Mrs. Whitman firmly defends her decision, pointing out that the state replaced one liability with another. The state put about 60 percent from the proceeds of the borrowing into the stock market, hoping to earn a higher return than the 7.65 percent payments on the bonds. But the sudden market downturn just days before the election enabled Democrats to point out that Mrs. Whitman had put the state at risk should stocks tumble steadily downward.
Mayor George Spadoro of Edison, a Democrat who fought an unsuccessful court battle against the borrowing for the pension system, said that the market drop confirmed "our worst fears about Governor Whitman's $2.75 billion pension bond gamble."
"The hard lesson learned on Wall Street is that Governor Whitman's borrow-and-spend policies don't work," he said.
 
Crackdown on Crime, But Crowded Prisons
Since Mrs. Whitman took office the crime rate has fallen steadily in New Jersey, as it has in many other states, according to the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety.
Crime fell by 7 percent last year, with violent crimes down 11 percent -- better than the 7 percent drop reported nationwide. The drop in crime was particularly steep in New Jersey's cities. In Camden, the number of murders dropped more than 50 percent. In Newark, violent crime fell 16 percent, and murders fell about 10 percent.
Governor Whitman can point to numerous tough new crime laws that she has signed since taking office. One requires violent criminals to serve up to 85 percent of their term before being paroled. Another requires anyone convicted of three violent crimes to be imprisoned for life without parole.
Mrs. Whitman has also pushed through several laws as a result of crusades by families of crime victims. In her first year in office, she signed "Megan's Law," named after a 7-year-old girl murdered by a neighbor who was a convicted sex offender. The law, which requires that communities be notified about the presence of convicted sex offenders, became a model for a new Federal law and similar state laws across the nation.
She has also signed "Joan's Law," named after another 7-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted and murdered by a neighbor. The law bars parole for anyone convicted of molesting and murdering a child.
Mrs. Whitman has also opened military-style boot camps for juvenile offenders. But the state and county prisons remain overcrowded, and with her new tough crime laws, the state prison population is expected to continue to swell. A new state prison opened this year, but prison officials acknowledge that it does not begin to address the demand for more jail cells. And no new prisons are planned.
 
School Spending Still Causing Conflict
Closing the spending gap between New Jersey's poorest and wealthiest school districts has bedeviled every New Jersey governor from Brendan T. Byrne to Jim Florio. Ordered by the New Jersey Supreme Court to end the disparity, Mr. Byrne pushed through the state's income tax in 1976. Mr. Florio pushed through a $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990, part of which was earmarked for schools. The tax increase helped lead to his defeat for a second term.
Mrs. Whitman tried a different approach. She sought to shift the debate away from how much money should be spent to what students should be learning. By imposing statewide academic standards, and promising to increase spending on public schools by $235 million, she contended that her plan satisfied the State Constitution's stipulation that all children receive a "thorough and efficient" education.
But the State Supreme Court rejected the plan in May. While the justices gave Mrs. Whitman credit for setting new academic standards, they ordered that New Jersey come up with more money for 28 urban school districts. Mrs. Whitman and the State Legislature complied and agreed to spend $250 million more.
But the problem is far from settled. Now 25 rural and suburban school districts are planning to sue the state, arguing that homeowners in their communities cannot bear the cost of imposing the new academic standards. They are not the only school districts complaining. During Mrs. Whitman's first three years in office, state aid to more than half of the state's school districts remained flat or declined, placing a heavier property tax burden on homeowners.
Mrs. Whitman herself acknowledges that she has not done enough to lower property taxes and auto insurance rates, and promises to do so in a second term. She says she believes voters will give her another chance.
"I think people do appreciate elected officials who keep their promises," she said. "And I think that will be reflected on Election Day."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CANDIDATES;
Giuliani and Messinger Plot the Endgame

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
The two leading mayoral candidates entered the last weekend before Election Day with a flurry of televised appearances, new advertisements and Halloween parades, as they prepared for the final frenetic days of campaigning that will include a visit by President Clinton for Ruth W. Messinger and a 48-hour bus tour of the city by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Yesterday, the Messinger campaign previewed one of its last two television commercials, in which Mr. Giuliani is castigated for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions. 
 The advertisement, a farcical cartoon that shows the Mayor's ever-expanding head gradually blotting out the Manhattan skyline, also paints Mr. Giuliani as an opportunist more interested in running for higher office than in being Mayor for four years. Mr. Giuliani has refused to pledge that he would serve a full second term.
As for Mr. Giuliani, he continued to emphasize his record in his final television advertisements and ignore Ms. Messinger, even as his commanding lead in the polls seemed to embolden him to spend more time seeking the votes of the city's minority groups.
In recent days, Mr. Giuliani has also begun to address one of the longstanding criticisms from the Democrats: that the economic revival in the city has been unequal and that he is the mayor of the city's elite.
"We still have people that are left out and we still have people that feel they aren't part of it," he said during the taping of the WCBS-TV news program "Sunday Edition."
"It's my job to reach them," Mr. Giuliani said. "That's why I'm really doing this 48-hour tour. I want to go into the next term just reaching out to every neighborhood in the city and basically say that there's no neighborhood that we can't go to, no neighborhood that really shouldn't be part of this renaissance that New York City is going through."
The Mayor's change in tone reflected not only his growing confidence but also his campaign's push for a large margin of victory, which his admirers and critics believe would help position him to run for higher office.
Last night, Mr. Giuliani marched in a Halloween parade in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, one of the predominantly white ethnic neighborhoods outside Manhattan that make up his base of support. But a couple of hours earlier, he walked in a Halloween parade in Jackson Heights, Queens, a multi-racial and multi-ethnic district.
The Mayor received a polite, though not enthusiastic, reception. He threw himself into the largely Hispanic crowd only a few times, and his advance people failed to rouse many of the spectators along 37th Avenue.
At a news conference in City Hall Park, Ms. Messinger received the endorsement of leaders of several immigrant-rights groups. Ms. Messinger, the Democratic candidate, said that Mr. Giuliani had tailored his views on immigration for his political benefit.
"I am a little confused because when Rudy Giuliani worked for the Reagan Administration he helped run a Haitian policy that ignored human-rights abuses," Ms. Messinger said, flanked by a dozen representatives from organizations including the Guyanese-American Workers Unite and the American-Bangledesh Coalition for Immigrants' Rights. "Now, all of a sudden, the Mayor is a champion of immigrants."
Ms. Messinger arrived late at the event after her tan Ford Windstar minivan broke down on Broadway outside her campaign headquarters in lower Manhattan. She also encountered an awkward moment during the taping of "Sunday Edition" when the host, Marcia Kramer, asked her to say something positive about the Mayor.
"Love his hair," Ms. Messinger said. Slightly taken aback, Ms. Kramer said, "Um. O.K."

HEADLINE: Homeowners Record Is Set in Third Quarter

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
There is nothing special about the beige house with the burgundy door, except of course to its owner, Shari Crittendon.
The two-story, wood-frame house sits on a cul-de-sac in a new development near the city limits. It abuts a forested expanse where raccoons, foxes and deer often emerge to creep close to the rear deck. Out front, yellow and maroon mums, planted in the spring, are beginning to turn brown from an autumn frost. 
 But while the dwelling itself carries no great significance, its purchase by Ms. Crittendon last year was part of an important economic and psychological milestone for the country.
In mid-October, the Census Bureau reported that the percentage of American families owning homes had recently reached the highest level ever. According to the bureau, in the third quarter of 1997, 66 percent of the households in the nation owned their home, beating the record of 65.8 percent set in the third quarter of 1980. All told, 67.6 million households own their home, the bureau reported.
Independent analysts, as well as those in the Clinton Administration, say that the rising number of homeowners -- including many, like Ms. Crittendon, who are first-time buyers -- is the result of several factors. These include low interest rates, low unemployment, rising incomes, a number of Federal assistance programs, increased competition among mortgage lenders, and better enforcement of fair-housing laws.
But the main factor, many experts say, is growing consumer confidence. Indeed, the burgeoning rate of home ownership is perhaps the most tangible sign that after six-and-a-half years of economic expansion, the belief in the robust economy is now so entrenched that a record number of people are willing to undertake the biggest investment they will ever make in their lives: buying a home.
"It's not just that it's a strong economy," said Andrew M. Cuomo, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. "It's that people are willing to believe that they'll have a job long term, that their house will appreciate and that their incomes will grow."
Census Bureau and HUD data, as well as that from private researchers, indicate that much of the growth in home ownership has been fueled by increasing numbers of buyers among minorities, single women, low- and moderate-income families and urban dwellers. While the number of non-Hispanic white households owning homes rose by 4 percent from 1993 to 1996, black home owners jumped by 7.5 percent and Hispanic home owners by 16 percent, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.
These increases stem in part from rising incomes and lowered unemployment among minorities and single women. The rise is also the result of several policies adopted by the Bush and Clinton Administrations. Starting in 1991, for example, Federal regulators, when asked to approve bank mergers, began to include a bank's lending history in low- and moderate-income areas as part of their review.
In 1992, Congress ordered the two Federally chartered lending companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to increase their loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers. In 1995, seeking to save his department from elimination by the newly elected Republican-led Congress, Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros adopted a "national homeownership strategy" that eased requirements to qualify for Federal Housing Administration-insured loans and reduced closing costs by as much as $1,200 on those loans for first-time buyers.
Stephan O'Connor, the senior director for residential loan production at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, also noted that banks in recent years have discovered the potential profits from lending in low-income neighborhoods and begun to look for potential mortgage customers in areas that had previously been ignored.
All regions of the nation have participated in the increase. For the third quarter of 1997, 63 percent of households in the Northeast owned their own homes; 70.7 percent in the Midwest; 68.2 percent in the South, and 59.8 percent in the West.
The nexus of forces and policies that lifted home ownership can been seen in Ms. Crittendon's neighborhood, a development called The Woodlands at Cold Spring. Of the 101 houses there -- nearly all of which are owned by African Americans -- about 80 per cent are owned by first-time home buyers.
Ms. Crittendon, who is 35, is president of the home owners association for the development. She is a single mother whose daughter was born when she was a sophomore at Syracuse University. Since 1991, Ms. Crittendon had worked in sales at the Xerox Corporation while attending law school at the University of Maryland at Baltimore.
Law school tuition ate up whatever savings she had, as well as the pension she had accrued at Xerox. As a result, she did not have money for a down payment on a house, and was worried that she might not be able to move from her two-bedroom apartment in a rough neighborhood near downtown Baltimore.
Last year, Ms. Crittendon qualified for a program run by the City of Baltimore that provided a $5,941 interest-free loan for a down payment on the four-bedroom home, which cost $166,500. The loan for the down payment is not repayable until the mortgage on the house is paid off or the house is sold.
In addition, the city let Ms. Crittendon phase in the full payment of her property taxes. She is required to pay only 60 percent of her assessed taxes in the first year, with the amount rising in 10 percent annual increments for the next four years.
Ms. Crittendon, a lawyer for Morgan State University in Baltimore, now finds herself caught up in the kinds of activities indicative of a new home owner. She gardens, decorates and plans changes to her house.
"I spend most of my Friday nights at Home Depot," she said.

President Jiang on the Path To the Cradle of Capitalism
The President of China spent most of the day in New York, ringing the bell to begin a day of trading at the New York Stock Exchange and inviting 200 top executives from America's largest companies to dine at the Waldorf. Some scattered protests marked his visit. A1 

Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright waited for President Jiang to leave Washington and then appointed a special coordinator to focus on China's suppression of Tibet. A8
 
U.N. to Defy Baghdad
The leader of a United Nations arms inspection team in Iraq said the monitors, including 10 Americans whom Baghdad has ordered expelled, would defy President Saddam Hussein's ban on Americans' taking part in the inspection. Iraq's representative at the United Nations said his country was not interested in a confrontation, but an official in Baghdad said Iraqis had prepared themselves for the worst. A4
 
Pope Addresses Anti-Semitism
Misinterpretations of Christian teachings contributed to the Holocaust and to centuries of persecution of Jews in Europe, Pope John Paul II told a group of Christian theologians meeting to discuss the origins of anti-Semitism. The Pope did not apologize directly for the Church's role in anti-Semitism, but said "wrong and unjust interpretations of the New Testament," particularly blaming Jews for the death of Jesus, had circulated for too long and had increased hostility against Jews. A6
 
Vichy Case Hears Historian
The French heard again from Robert O. Paxton, the American historian who provided France with the first comprehensive picture of the crimes of the Vichy regime in Nazi-occupied France during World War II. He testified at the trial of Maurice Papon, a senior Vichy official charged with crimes against humanity for deporting 1,560 Jews from Bordeaux to concentration camps in Germany. Mr. Paxton did not testify about the role Mr. Papon played, but said in an interview that Mr. Papon was a "fairly important cog in the wheel." A3
 
Irish Elect a Belfast Woman
Mary McAleese has been elected President of Ireland, according to official results. Ms. McAleese, 46, is a law professor in Northern Ireland and will be the first British subject ever to hold the office. She will replace Mary Robinson in the largely ceremonial position; Ms. Robinson is the next United Nations Human Rights Commissioner. A6
 
Russia Approves Weapons Ban
The lower house of the Russian Parliament voted 288 to 75 to approve a treaty banning chemical weapons. Russia was one of the first nations to sign the accord in 1993, but some legislators have worried about the estimated $5 billion cost of destroying its arsenal of poison gases, the world's largest, at a time when Russia struggles to pay pensioners.

Thompson Opts to End Senate Campaign Hearings
Senator Fred Thompson put an end to the Senate's hearings into campaign finance abuses, complaining that he had not been afforded enough time to do a thorough job. Mr. Thompson's decision to forgo further public sessions brings a less than dramatic close to hearings that began sensationally in July with a promise to delve into allegations that the Government of China had a plan to influence some United States elections last year. A1
 
Civil Rights Nomination Blocked
An important Senate Republican is linking his support for the nomination of Bill Lann Lee, which would put the first Asian-American into the Government's top civil rights post, to the Clinton Administration's willingness to not support a challenge to California's law against affirmative action programs. A13
 
Nanny Sentenced to Life
A 19-year-old British au pair, Louise Woodward, was sentenced to life in prison in Massachusetts for the murder of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen, who was in her care. Ms. Woodward continued to steadfastly disavow responsibility for the boy's death. A10
 
Britain reacted to the murder conviction with shock, bewilderment and anger at American judicial practices and pledges of solidarity with Ms. Woodward. A10
 
Saccharin Suspicions Remain
The artificial sweetener saccharin, which for 20 years has been dogged by the suspicion that it causes cancer, was denied the scientific equivalent of parole when a board of independent experts recommended that it remain on the Government's list of suspected carcinogens. A13
 
New Uranus Moons Found
Astronomers using a 200-inch-diameter telescope on Mount Palomar in California have discovered two pint-sized moons orbiting the planet Uranus, bringing the number of its known satellites to 17. The two moons, with respective diameters estimated at only 50 and 100 miles, are the faintest planetary satellites ever detected from the ground. A11
 
Census Agreement Likely
Negotiators from the White House and Speaker Newt Gingrich's office have reached a tentative agreement that would allow the Census Bureau to test its hotly debated new method for estimating the country's population, Administration and Congressional officials said. A12

A jury in Florida ruled in favor of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and declined to order the cigarette maker to pay damages to a Jacksonville woman who smoked for 30 years and developed lung cancer. A11
 
House May Get Campaign Bill
A day after Senate Republicans agreed to allow an important vote on a campaign finance bill by next March, Speaker Newt Gingrich said the House should take up similar legislation by early next year. A12

Rumors of Gang Attacks Empty Schools on Holiday
On a Halloween Day filled with rumors that took on an almost "War of the Worlds" tone, hundreds of thousands of New York City students stayed away from public schools because they, or their parents, feared a rash of gang-related attacks. Those who did venture out to school often found additional police officers patrolling in and near their classrooms and even escorting them to and from subway stations to keep them safe. By various accounts, they were. At Martin Luther King High School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, for example, the hallways were deserted as some teachers sat at their desks reading novels, their classrooms completely empty. Only 1 out of 10 students showed up. A1
 
Mayor Sees Better Relations
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani predicted that he would have an improved relationship with minority communities in New York City if he was elected to a second term, as residents of impoverished neighborhoods realized that they were sharing in the benefits of lower crime and an improved economy. In a discussion with reporters and editors of The New York Times, the Republican-Liberal candidate for re-election said he no longer finds the same resistance in neighborhoods that voted against him in previous races against David N. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor. A1

U.S. Economy Grows
The American economy grew at a vigorous pace over the summer and a key measure of inflation dwindled to a level not seen since 1964. The extraordinary economic performance, reported by the Commerce Department, provided a bit of reassurance after a week of turmoil in the world's financial markets. Despite concerns about the impact of slower growth in Southeast Asia and Latin America, the American economy gathered steam in the three months ended in September, growing at an annual rate of 3.5 percent, up from 3.2 percent the previous quarter. For four straight quarters, the pace has surpassed 3 percent, the most consistent surge since the lingering effects of the worst postwar recession were overcome 13 years ago. A1
 
Global Share Prices Rise
A global rebound in share prices helped buoy Wall Street, ending a tumultuous week of trading. Markets around the world, which were roiled by an economic and currency crisis in Southeast Asia, appeared to stabilize after Hong Kong stocks soared early in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.41 points to close at 7,442.08. D2

Although this action does not reverse that verdict, it lessens the possibility that CSX will have to pay nearly so much. D3

HEADLINE: THE JIANG VISIT: THE OVERVIEW;
Mao's Heir Finds Path: Wall Street

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
President Jiang Zemin of China trod a capitalist road yesterday from Wall Street to the suburban campuses of hi-tech American industry.
Free of all the irksome talk about human rights he had had to endure in Washington, Mr. Jiang concentrated in his trip through New York yesterday on a matter closer to his heart: money. It was an interest enthusiastically reciprocated by American business executives eager to cash in on the world's most populous market. 
 When Mr. Jiang dropped by I.B.M.'s Madison Avenue offices to ogle some of the company's most advanced gadgets, the company's chairman and chief executive, Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. greeted him in practiced Mandarin.
"Lao pengyou, ni hao," Mr. Gerstner intoned, to satisfied chuckles all around. "Old friend, how are you?"
And if Chairman Mao had once warned that the revolution is not a dinner party, President Jiang underscored the dramatic changes in China today by throwing a party -- swordfish at the Waldorf, where the guest list included some 200 top executives of blue chip companies like Boeing, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Fedex, Ford and Philip Morris.
Mr. Jiang even rang the bell in the balcony overlooking the trading floor to open the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, standing next to the bright red, gold-starred flag of China like a Socialist Realist hero -- except he was wearing a dark suit.
When he was introduced by the chairman of the exchange, Richard A. Grasso, there was a polite round of applause. But there were also audible boos.
"Good morning," Mr. Jiang said with a stiff little wave. "I wish you good trading."
The market had fallen sharply the day before and the mood was tense when Mr. Jiang pushed the button to clang the bell a few seconds early, 9:29:57 by the electronic clocks scattered above the floor. Whatever the correlation, the market was up 52 points at 9:32:53 and 77.85 points a few minutes later.
Mr. Grasso and William Johnston, the white-bearded president of the exchange, escorted Mr. Jiang for a brief walk through the hurly-burly of the trading floor, but by then the traders were too engaged in the shouting, waving and running about of their profession to pay much attention.
Mr. Jiang was not the first post-Cold War Communist to have rung the traditional opening bell, which actually began as a Chinese gong in 1870, said Wall Street veterans, who recalled that the last President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had also done so at the beginning of the decade.
But the act had a certain resonance with the bold economic reforms that President Jiang announced at the 15th Communist Party Congress in September, which included a sweeping plan to sell most of China's 13,000 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, as well as most of its 300,000 smaller companies.
Although cloaked in revolutionary language -- the plan was entitled "Hold High the Great Banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory for an All-Around Advancement of the Cause of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics to the 21st Century" -- the changes could include opening up the state-run economy to private stock ownership.
Mr. Jiang entered and left the exchange through its Wall Street entrance, out of sight and hearing of about a hundred protesters clustered behind police barricades more than a long block away at Broad Street and Exchange Place.
"Shame on China!" the protesters chanted. "China out of Tibet!"
Rinchen Dharlo, a Tibetan organizer of the demonstration, said that he doubted the Chinese President could see them, but that about a dozen people on the way to the demonstration had seen his cavalcade and were able to wave their Tibetan flags at it.
Mr. Dharlo added that he was grateful to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki for refusing to meet Mr. Jiang, adding, "At least they stood on moral principles, which I feel is very important."
Even at the Waldorf dinner, when the orchestra stopped playing, shouts of protesters outside could be heard by the 200 or so guests.
But if New York's political leaders snubbed Mr. Jiang over the issue of human rights, business executives showed little reticence.
The lure of the China market to American business dates back more than a century -- many of the great family fortunes in Boston were built on the China trade -- and early industrialists dreamed of great profits to be made "if every Chinese bought just one shoe."
The dream was revived when Deng Xiaoping, Mr. Jiang's predecessor, opened China to the West in the late 1970's, but the results thus far have been disappointing.
All but a few American companies are losing money in China as a result of Government restrictions, bureaucracy and corruption, experts say. Yet most large companies -- like I.B.M., which has eight joint ventures in China, A.T.&T. and Lucent Technologies -- feel they have to invest in the country or risk losing out when the vast China market finally begins to pay off in the next century.
Good relations with the Government are widely seen as the key to success, as Mr. Gerstner, the I.B.M. chairman, suggested with his frequent references to his long friendship and many meetings with Mr. Jiang.
In addition to his morning visit to I.B.M., Mr. Jiang went to New Jersey in the afternoon to visit the A.T.&T. network operations center in Bedminster and Lucent Technologies in Berkeley Heights, where he donned a white gown, white shin-high boots and a hoodlike mask and gloves to go into a sealed "clean room" where new, more powerful microchips trademarked Scalpel are made.
The visits were displays of high technology, and Mr. Jiang, trained as an engineer before he began his political rise as Mayor of Shanghai, seemed fascinated. At I.B.M. he voiced many key words in English -- "integrated circuits . . . prototype . . . chip" -- indicating that he understood the descriptions of the three devices he was shown.
One allows the transmission of data between two people when they shake hands, using an electronic device the size of a credit card; a second, called kiosk banking, allows complex financial dealings via the Internet; the third involved advanced numerical weather prediction for specific regions.
Joking that he had not practiced his engineering profession in years, Mr. Jiang told the I.B.M. officials, "when I saw your office, I was reminded of using a slide rule, because your calculators are so thin."
One of Mr. Jiang's major stated purposes on his trip is to learn more about American technology and its possible uses in China, a preoccupation he also emphasized during a midday meeting at his hotel with about 300 representatives from the city's Chinese communities.
He told them that China needed to catch up technologically, one of the people at the meeting said later, then posed for pictures and made a short speech about his visit.
"He said that as a youth, he read many books about the West and studied the languages," said the participant, an immigrant from Fujian. "But he said, 'You can read a hundred books on a subject but you get so much more seeing it, even if just once.' "
Beaming and looking relaxed, Mr. Jiang shook hands with heads of major companies who had come to greet him tonight, making small talk and patting acquaintances on the shoulder at the Waldorf banquet, given in his honor by the U.S. China Business Council and the China Chamber of Commerce in U.S.A.
In his address tonight, Mr. Jiang had some harsh words regarding the annual review required to renew China's preferred trade status.
"American entrepreneurs doing business or making investments feel the sword of Damocles over their heads," he said.
But he painted a bright future for Chinese commerce, promising to "continue to open our market steadily, speed up the opening of our infrastructure like energy and transportation, and gradually open up our service sector, including banking and insurance."

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An Oct. 28 news article reports that new teaching positions are to be awarded to City University of New York colleges on the basis of graduation rates. As any educator in public higher education knows, our students are not upper-income children routed from private schools or middle-income children who have graduated from parochial schools. Half are from other countries -- some with excellent educations but learning English; others with educations as bad as those provided by the city's public schools. 
 Our students are working at any jobs they can get to support themselves and their families. The slightest break in earnings knocks them out of school for a semester or a year. Our students are also as mobile as the rest of the country's workers and may transfer to the University of Texas or Florida without our knowledge.
To reward public colleges with appointments on an incentive system for graduation rates rather than meeting their real needs is Alice in Wonderland logic. The economy determines graduation rates. New York has a 9.5 percent unemployment rate: test the correlation with student jobs.

ECHOES OF A
 NATIVE LAND
 Two Centuries
 of a Russian Village.
 By Serge Schmemann.
 Illustrated. 350 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50. 
 "How beautiful life was," Talleyrand is supposed to have exclaimed, "before the revolution." Modernity leaves us incurably nostalgic for anciens regimes. The whips and the chains of the American Old South get airbrushed out of the lush images of the plantation; the sepia-toned melancholy that infuses our mental image of the long sunlit afternoon of Russia under the last Czar spirits away the drunken misery of the Russian village. Our appetite for lost paradises is insatiable.
The recollection of paradise has produced one masterpiece -- Vladimir Nabokov's "Speak, Memory," a work of genius precisely because its author mastered the tidal force of his own nostalgia. He did so by forcing his memory to wrest unmistakably real detail -- the sight of his father appearing magically in midair in front of a third-story window, lofted up there by peasants who were tossing him in a blanket -- from the boggy compost of sentimentality. But where Nabokov led, others have found it difficult to follow. I know something about the undertow of sentimentality and the lure of czarist kitsch, having written one such memoir myself.
With the fall of the Communist empire, the genre -- and the nostalgia -- have taken on a new lease on life. Grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the vast Russian emigration that flooded out of the Soviet prison-house after 1917 are now able to revisit the estates and town houses that had become the holy sites of family lore. But the search for roots often ends in disappointment. Face to face with the corruption, cynicism and chaos of Russian life, many in the second and third generations decided that they were actually less Russian than they had thought. Besides, the great houses had been burned down, ransacked or turned into shabby orphanages; the family graves had been plowed under.
Serge Schmemann, a correspondent for The New York Times in Moscow during the 1980's, takes this genre of the exile's return into new territory. Unlike that of many second-generation memoirists, his Russian is excellent and his knowledge of Russia is intimate. As a journalist, he was able to get access to hitherto unvisited Russian archives to track down his family's past.
Schmemann had grown up in Europe and America hearing tales about Sergiyevskoye, his family's estate on the Oka River, 90 miles south of Moscow. His family -- the Osorgins and the Schmemanns -- were gentry in service to the czar. One relative was governor of Tula during the 1905 revolution and dispatched the Cossacks to put down the demonstrations. But he was so horrified by the sight of whips lashing the backs of the fleeing students that he sought to call the Cossacks off, screaming -- in vain -- "Back! Don't!" This is the very image of the liberal gentry at the end of its tether.
Liberal in politics, pious in religion, indulgent and improving as landowners, Schmemann's ancestors were also affecting and talented memoirists. In
his unpublished recollections, Schmemann's grandfather insisted that, even in exile, his family's Russian patrimony had not been lost: "You, my grandchildren, you are not foreign, you have your rightful, personal place by my side, on that same dear Sergiyevskoye soil, which will nourish you and give you life, if only you do not turn away from it. So listen to your father and grandfather. I will try, as I can, to show you our sacred, unforgettable Sergiyevskoye."
When Schmemann reached Sergiyevskoye in 1990, he discovered that the manor house had burned down in 1923, as the peasants' revenge not against the old masters but against the Bolsheviks, who had seized the house and were forcing the peasants into collective farms. Only remnants of the glorious past remained: a gutted bell tower, a crumbling stable and a former parish school.
Schmemann might have left matters there, as most exiles do. Instead he struck up acquaintances with the villagers and discovered his true subject, and the core of this book -- the history of the village after his family had gone into exile. It is a story of the Russian 20th century in miniature. Through the villagers' recollections, their photographs and their own memoirs, we watch the revolutionary hope that dawned when the first tractors arrived, and then the descent into disillusion that followed forced collectivization and Stalin's terror.
This microcosmic viewpoint, centered on Sergiyevskoye, allows Schmemann to ask a key question about Soviet history: what really changed for ordinary people? On the surface, it seems, terribly little. Schmemann is nostalgia-proof when it comes to the czarist past: the villagers were drunk and miserable in his ancestors' time; czarist rule was despotic; material conditions were hard and the roads were often impassable. In the 1990's, everything seems nearly the same: drunkenness and misery, incompetent despotism in Moscow, muddy roads.
In some ways, conditions in the village are worse now than they were in 1900. Schmemann -- whose father was an Orthodox priest -- demonstrates that Communism ripped the spiritual heart out of the village. The villagers told him how the family's church had been taken apart by the drunken local commissar, who sold the bricks for vodka. He interviews old-timers who remember how, as fiery young Bolsheviks, they were incited to go out and taunt the Orthodox Easter processions. One of Schmemann's most trusted and responsive informants finally confesses that as a young woman, she worked in a secret K.G.B. plant in Moscow that melted down the icons, chalices and miters seized from Orthodox churches. "It was our youth!" she confesses plaintively. "We were convinced we were ushering in a better world!"
Schmemann's visits precipitated villagers into a confrontation with their own history. The daughters of peasants, who had been devoted Communists, began writing memoirs themselves, to assist Schmemann but also to make peace with a past that since Soviet times they could discuss only in whispers. The most affecting and interesting part of Schmemann's book describes the way he and the villagers jointly assembled the history of the village. After Schmemann let one local read his grandfather's memoirs, with their account of the well-kept church, the pious landowner and the alley of limes, he kept repeating: "All this we lost. All this we threw away."
Repeated visits to the village in the early 1990's -- he even bought an old wooden cottage there -- led Schmemann to be deeply pessimistic about the prospects for turning Russia into a thriving capitalist economy. The peasants' basic ethic had not changed in a century -- "he who had too little was due more, and he who grabbed too much was denying it to others."
The more Schmemann learns of Sergiyevskoye's 20th-century history, the more he learns the village's secrets -- the drunkenness, the violence, the murders -- the less charmed he is by the squalor at Russia's heart: "I was Russian enough to feel for these people, even to love them, but too foreign to tolerate their maddening fatalism and disorder. And they, who met me with open arms and shared with me their memories, they did not need me. . . . I was an exotic visitor from a distant land . . . and I came to represent a past they did not want to be reminded of, and a hostile world that was seeking to undermine their fragile security."
"Echoes of a Native Land" is that rare achievement: a Russian memoir that subverts the conventions of the genre and tells us, in clear, elegant and understated prose, that you can't go home again.

Southeast Asia Tourism Is Smothered by Smog

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia

 BODY:
WHEN athletes from around the region gathered in Jakarta, Indonesia, last month for the Southeast Asia Games, officials were unable to light the ceremonial torch. A huge magnifying glass was to have beamed a ray of sunlight into a giant bowl, but there was no sun.
Sunshine has been gloomily scarce throughout much of Southeast Asia for many weeks now as a pungent smog from vast Indonesian forest fires has blanketed a broad swath of the region. It is expected to continue at least into this month or December until monsoon rains, long delayed by El Nino, arrive to drench the fires. 
 People cough and wheeze. They stay home from work. On bad days, they wear surgical masks. Health officials say there could be a significant long-term toll in diseases like cancer and leukemia if the smog persists. Foreign residents have begun to worry. The American Embassy here has allowed dozens of employees to leave the country and several multinational companies have sent parts of their staffs home. And tourist arrivals have fallen in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines and southern Thailand, where the popular resort island of Phuket has periodically been blanketed in what people here delicately call the "haze." The sun and the smog alternate depending on wind patterns, but tour organizers in Europe and the United States have reduced their business throughout the region, officials here say. "If you look at tourism, it's a major factor," Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, said recently as he enumerated the ill effects of the smog.
It is a severe economic blow to the region's $26-billion-a-year tourism industry, one of the region's fastest-growing industries. And it is particularly painful coming as it has during a sharp economic downturn that has slowed several regional economies.
That downturn, paradoxically, has made tourism more attractive. Currencies in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines have tumbled by 20 to 30 percent or more and the dollar now stretches much further. The full force of the slump still lies ahead, following attacks that began in the spring on regional currencies.
A surge in tourism was to have been one of the few silver linings to the economic slump, but officials in Thailand say they have not yet noticed a hoped-for increase in arrivals. They blame the bad publicity resulting from the smog. Several governments in Europe and Asia, as well as the United States, have issued travel advisories warning their citizens against visiting smoggy areas, particularly Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Some tour operators have begun to offer full refunds to people who have booked trips to these nations.
Airports in hard-hit areas like Borneo and Sumatra have been forced to close periodically, and hundreds of flights have been canceled when conditions deteriorate. Notably, the smoke from Indonesia's fires has mainly been drifting northward, so the main island of Java has been less affected. The tourist destinations of Bali and Lombok have mostly escaped the smog.
But some resorts to the north have suffered badly. On the Malaysian island of Langkawi, tourism officials say hotel occupancy has dropped to 10 percent, from a more typical 75 percent. They say economic losses run into the millions of dollars as Japanese and Taiwanese tourists as well as European visitors have canceled their visits. Particularly hard-hit has been Singapore, a hub for travel in the region, where tourism generates $7.2 billion a year. Pollution levels there have reached historic highs, and Yeo Cheow Tong, the environment and health minister, said people had been changing their routines to avoid the unhealthy air.
"There has definitely been an impact on the economy," he said. "People are going out less, restaurants have been reporting lower business levels, hotels have been reporting cancellations."
Four doctors surveyed by the Sunday Times newspaper in Singapore said the number of their patients with respiratory problems had increased by 20 percent during the haze. "People are experiencing watery eyes, more nasal discharge and throat problems," said Dr. Chan Tiong Beng, president of the Asthmatics Association.
In mid-October, the Health Ministry issued an alert saying: "The elderly and persons with heart or respiratory diseases should reduce physical exertion and outdoor activities. The general population should reduce vigorous outdoor activities."
Even in the sealed skyscrapers of Singapore's modern business district, people are coughing, blowing their noses and complaining of headaches. One evening in September the smog was so thick that the faint odor of wood smoke from the smog permeated the air-conditioned Victoria concert hall during a performance of Benjamin Britten's opera "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
Wildlife is also being affected, from the wild jungles of Borneo to the tidy parks of Singapore. In Borneo, tigers, elephants and great apes are fleeing the fires and flying foxes have emerged in a desperate search for shelter. In Singapore, the birds have stopped singing. Bird owners, who traditionally gather outdoors with their cages, complain that their birds have grown listless. They now stay home.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Back on That Infuriating But Irresistible Broadway

BYLINE: By SYLVIANE GOLD 

 BODY:
EMANUEL AZENBERG, universally known as Manny, has a habit. Even though he suspects that at 63 he ought to know better, he keeps producing Broadway plays.
He thought he had the habit licked two years ago, when, with great fanfare, he took Neil Simon's "London Suite" Off Broadway, abandoning the arena where he had worked as a producer for some 30 years and won seven Tony Awards. But this season, after decrying a system that seems to defeat everything but runaway hit musicals, he is back in the expensive seats, surprising himself and everyone else not once but twice. 
 Two weeks ago, he opened "Side Show," an offbeat musical based on the lives of the Hilton sisters, the Siamese twins who had a vaudeville career. And on Thursday, he opens Neil Simon's newest play, "Proposals," at the Broadhurst Theater.
Mr. Azenberg, who has been producing Mr. Simon's plays since 1972, is something of a dinosaur, and feels like one. There are now only a few of his generation of old-fashioned, individual producers in the increasingly combine-driven theater industry -- producers like Robert Whitehead, who have the experience to help shape properties long before they reach the stage.
"I had planned on fading out," Mr. Azenberg said in his photo-filled aerie above the Neil Simon Theater, on West 52d Street, a few days before the "Side Show" opening. "An old soldier, fading away. Then these two shows happened." He makes it sound as if it were involuntary. "What else can I do?" he shrugs, his inflection redolent of his Bronx roots and Yiddish-speaking family. "It's too late to become a doctor."
In an office crowded with reminders of his past, it is no wonder he is feeling his age. There are photos of his parents. There are shots of him with Israeli notables, the legacy of a lifelong involvement with Zionism learned literally at his father's knee. (He remembers being pulled out of school in 1948 to meet Chaim Weizmann when he came to New York as the first president of the new Israeli state.) There are pictures of theater friends like Mike Nichols and Athol Fugard and Tom Stoppard, and political friends like Bill Bradley and Alan Simpson; and most telling of all, right in his line of sight, is a portrait of a young, young Manny Azenberg, in the uniform of the United States Army.
Still, the fading-away talk seems a bit improbable, coming from this imposing white-haired figure in bleached jeans and dusty-pink sweatshirt. He looks as if he could still play a mean shortstop in the Broadway softball league, which is where he first met Mr. Simon. But he is in an autumnal frame of mind, mulling over the passage of time and his own mortality, as well as that of the theater world he has been part of since the 1950's. He talks about how the students he has been teaching at Duke University keep getting younger and how his five children, who range in age from 7 to 37, keep getting older.
"When you're 23, in 20 years, you're going to be 43," he said. "That's a trillion years away. But when you're 63, in 20 years, you may not be. You get very selective about where you spend your time."
The fact that he has spent time producing "Side Show" and "Proposals" does not mean he has changed his mind about the business climate of Broadway. "The economics aren't any better than they were when we decided not to do it," he acknowledged. "In fact, they're worse. We outpriced ourselves. The victims are the culprits. No one planned for the future; we thought it would go on forever. And the 'we' is all-inclusive. I didn't know any better."
Of course, there are those who say that Mr. Azenberg knows the ins and outs of financing shows very well indeed. "Better than anyone," says Mr. Simon, who adds that this reputation is the reason the producers of the musical "Rent" hired Mr. Azenberg to manage that show when they took it to Broadway.
Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, has another reason for having Mr. Azenberg manage his commercial transfers. "He's a tummler," Mr. Gersten said, using the Yiddish word for a live wire. "He plays. And if you don't play in the theater, you might as well go work somewhere else."
Nevertheless, what Mr. Azenberg calls "the boring stuff" -- how much it will cost for an extra stagehand or an extra line in the daily ad -- is one reason he has a winning record in the notoriously risky world of Broadway investing. He reckons it at "about 60 percent," and can go through a list of his more than 40 shows -- starting in 1966 with "The Lion in Winter" and "Mark Twain Tonight!" -- and tell you which returned a profit and how close the others came.
The losers (like the 1993 musical version of Mr. Simon's play "The Goodbye Girl" and his 1981 "Fools") hurt more than Mr. Azenberg's pride. He always invests in his own shows: "How do you go to somebody and ask them for money if you don't put your own in?"
So once again, he is putting both capital and pride on the line for an enterprise he now finds dubious. But his relationship with Broadway has always been a contentious one. In fact, it began with a row. As a young Off Broadway company manager, he wanted to work on Broadway but was barred by union work rules. Angered by his interview with the union's officials, he overturned the table they were sitting at and stormed out.
He has subsequently feuded with Roger L. Stevens over management of the Kennedy Center in the 1970's; with the Tony nominating committee in 1983, when it failed to nominate Mr. Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs" as best play; with a Dallas newspaper over the perceived unfairness of its theater critic; with the League of American Theaters and Producers over financial and policy issues. And given the fuss he made in 1994 over leaving Broadway, the question of why he is back practically poses itself.
To answer it, Mr. Azenberg goes into his fading dinosaur routine: "We want it. We want to have that old experience that we had in the heyday. Can you go home again? I hope so. At least for a minute."
Mr. Simon's "Proposals" was inspired by his courtship of his first wife during the summer of 1953. Set in the backyard of a summer cottage in the Poconos, it mixes the familiar Simon humor with darker intimations of mortality. "It's different from everything Neil's ever done," Mr. Azenberg said. "And it moves me. I think that's an old requirement."
"Side Show," he said, fills the requirement as well. "To say that we did a musical about Siamese twins is just untrue. It's about 'Who Will Love Me as I Am,' " said Mr. Azenberg, quoting the show's climactic song. "It's about how we're all freaks. At 3, 4 o'clock in the morning, the hour of the wolf, when all that posturing you do during the day is over, and you're lying in bed with your doubts, misgivings, failures, you ask yourself, 'Who could love me? Does this person next to me really know? And even if I told her, would she know?' "
"When you do Neil Simon," Mr. Azenberg said, "he has an audience, you get an advance, you have a cushion. When you do something out of the ordinary, you have to sit and worry. And you don't get a lot of compassion."
"Side Show" has received some positive reviews, but an equal number have been mixed or negative, and initial sales of tickets have been slow. Mr. Azenberg has taken chances with risky material before, doing plays about euthanasia ("Whose Life Is It, Anyway?"), cannibalism ("Devour the Snow") and the education of the deaf ("Children of a Lesser God"). And he has produced serious foreign plays like " 'Master Harold' . . . and the Boys" by Athol Fugard, "The Real Thing" by Tom Stoppard and "Molly Sweeney" by Brian Friel.
"I had a luxury," he explained. "And the luxury was Neil Simon." But even Mr. Simon's much-envied ability to print box-office money has faltered in recent years, with such critical and commercial disappointments as the musical "Goodbye Girl" and "London Suite."
"Proposals" is Mr. Simon's 30th Broadway production. He has been writing, rewriting and reworking it for about eight years. "I rewrite more than I write," he said, and it has now gone through more than 20 drafts.
The fulcrum of the play is the family maid, Clemma, played by L. Scott Caldwell. She presides over an afternoon of crises and reconciliations as the daughter of the house decides which of her beaus to marry and her ailing father helps her come to terms with the mother who walked out on them both.
Clemma is the first black character created by Mr. Simon, but he said that he had no problem getting inside the head of a black woman: "I soon found I was in love with her. So I didn't worry."
Like Mr. Azenberg, Mr. Simon has qualms about returning to Broadway. "It's not the Broadway I grew up in," Mr. Simon said. "Broadway is now the place where you go to see musicals." But his much-ballyhooed Off Broadway experiment with "London Suite" did not provide a viable alternative. Looking back on it, he said, he now believes that "neither Manny nor I thought that 'London Suite' was really good enough yet for Broadway." Nevertheless, when it was well-received at the Seattle Rep, they decided to proceed to New York.
"But there was still some doubt," Mr. Simon added, "so we said, 'Why pay a million and a half when we can do it for so much less Off Broadway?' "
Working with Mr. Simon and Mr. Azenberg for the first time is Joe Mantello, the director of Terrence McNally's "Love! Valour! Compassion!" He compares Mr. Azenberg to "a good parent" who "lets you make your mistakes and find your way."
THAT'S WHAT Mr. Azenberg aims for, once a production is under way. "There's the cast, the director and the playwright," Mr. Azenberg said. "And then, peripherally, there's this producer guy. I don't believe that producers are part of the creative group. I think you make a contribution. But in an ideal situation, they all work it out themselves."
And, in an ideal situation, the shows run. "They don't have to be big hits," he said. "But I want them to run. Partly for the sake of all the people connected with them, and partly for my own. It will justify my taste, my choice of material. And it will say I'm not outdated -- or any of those other confusing things that happen when you're 63." He wants Broadway to love him as he is.
 
Sayings of Manny
When you're young and you love the theater, you go for acting. But after I got out of the Army, I was older. The idea of walking around with my picture -- it had no dignity.
If you could win the Congressional Medal of Honor for doing "Hamlet" well, perhaps the theater would come back.
Actors used to list Broadway first on their resumes. Now it's film first.
After "Proposals" opens, we'll be one of the very few plays running on Broadway this fall. When we first started, you had to wait in line to get a theater. My first play, "The Lion in Winter," in 1966 had to wait three months.
The wonderful thing about the theater is the writer. Who writes a movie? Who wrote "Gone With the Wind"? The theater is the writer's place.
Once or twice I traded off my brain -- my soul -- and produced shows for what I thought would be money. But it didn't work out. Ever.
When I was growing up, your father said, "Sit and read." Dickens. Thackeray. You read it. Today, the kids sit home and play with computers and watch television.

HEADLINE: Westchester Q&A: Jeffrey C. Gershen;
Working to Make Housing Affordable

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE

 BODY:
IT was a campaign issue in the race for county executive in 1976 and to some extent it has been one again this year. But the question of what to do to encourage the construction of affordable housing in Westchester comes down to some basic factors, says a man who builds such housing elsewhere: land costs must come down or allowable density must be increased.
Jeffrey C. Gershen of Katonah, president of Griffon Associates, has been in charge of various new and rehabilitated residential projects in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. What he is saying may be obvious, he admits, but achieving change is difficult. 
 Situated in Elmsford, Griffon Associates, in concert with Wilder Balter Partners, a residential real estate development company, is building a 92-unit low-income community in Goshen in Dutchess County, on the site of an old infirmary. Previously, the group built a community in Middletown on what was an abandoned brewery. Mr. Gershen has been successful in obtaining various government subsidies to help keep costs down.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Gershen:
Q. What are the obstacles and solutions for creating affordable housing in Westchester?
A. Nine times out of 10 the largest obstacle is money, and that is a function of the sources of funding for affordable housing. Affordable housing for the most part is rental housing, and conventional mortgaging of property is based on a rent stream.
To make housing affordable, the rent has to be low and the amount of mortgage has to be low. Therefore, other money has to be available to, in effect, subsidize that mortgage. The only money available currently to do that is the proceeds that come from the syndication of low-income-housing tax credits, which is a program that originates with the Federal Government and is delegated to the state in the form of tax credits.
In addition, there are what we call "soft second mortgages," which are usually either grants of some sort from a state housing agency, such as the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, or the Housing Trust Fund Corporation. That's on the rental side.
On the home ownership side, you have state organizations such as the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation, which essentially gives mortgage subsidies that can drive the cost of housing down.
Q. Are you saying private enterprise cannot do this by itself?
A. Absolutely. It needs government help and it needs government encouragement, and the way the government can help obviously is to make more money available for the programs it has.
The other way of dealing with it is at the local level. Part of the problem in Westchester County is that the value of land is so extraordinarily high, and in order to translate high land value into less expensive housing, you would have to have a situation in which -- and this may be politically charged -- special zoning was created so that you can have higher density of units for a particular parcel of land.
Q. Most of your building is not in Westchester. Have you tried to get more involved in Westchester?
A. We have built in Westchester, at least Griffon has built for a client in Westchester, Bill Balter, who is also a Westchester resident. On one project, Stone Creek in New Castle, which is town houses, the vehicle to create a more affordable complex was the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation. Also -- remember my phrase "soft second money" -- we had a grant from the Westchester Housing Implementation Fund. This is essentially a pool of noninterest-bearing funds that can be used to finance infrastructure. And so that created an environment that despite high land costs and low density, the project was made more affordable.
Q. So the Housing Implementation Fund, created in the 1980's by the Board of Legislators, has had some impact?
A. Yes, it has. We have, in fact, accessed it twice. We also accessed it for a project in Cortlandt Manor, called Cross Creek at Van Cortlandtville. There again it was used essentially to finance the infrastructure -- roads, sewers, utility lines. But there is a downside to taking this Housing Implementation Fund money. The downside is Davis Bacon -- a Federal law with wage guidelines -- and therefore essentially Davis Bacon does drive the costs up.
Q. Discuss the brewery property you developed in Middletown.
A. It was an abandoned four-story beer brewery, Orange County Beer, that ended beer production probably in the 30's. Then it had a number of uses and it was eventually abandoned as a building. I can't say what went on inside it, but I'm sure it was used by the local night life. While it was structurally a very, very sound building, it had become an eyesore and something that was detracting from the neighborhood.
My partner, Bob Wilder, came up with the scheme along with a nonprofit organization from Orange County, called Orange County Rural Development Advisory Corporation, to develop it as an affordable income rental project. We redesigned the building and in concert with O.R.D.A.C. got tax credits and Housing Trust Fund Corporation grants and eventually a conventional mortgage. We developed apartments, all of which have lofts and four-foot palladium windows, and restored the building to what it looked like in the past.
Q. What you are doing at the Hearthstone in Goshen?
A. It is an even more challenging project than the Brewery was. Hearthstone is a development that includes five buildings on the grounds of the Orange County Infirmary, just outside the town of Goshen. The first of these five buildings was built in 1830, and the last was built in 1937. The previous use had been as a poorhouse and a home for the insane; more recently, one small building was used as a day-care center while the rest of it was kind of allowed to fall into various states of decay. We had to design all the insides of these buildings to create 89 senior citizen apartments on the grounds of the infirmary. .
Q. And did you obtain government subsidies?
A. Oh, yes. You have to understand that affordable rental projects must be supported in some way by low-interest or no-interest financing. We created a package of financing that is comprised of low-income- housing tax credits, grants and a conventional mortgage.
Q. What are the implications in Westchester?
A. That's a very politically charged question. If the goal is to create affordable housing in Westchester to keep young people from moving out and to support people who have lived all their lives in Westchester -- the middle-income working class -- the first thing you have to do is not be afraid of affordable housing.
Q. Do you think people are afraid of affordable housing?
A. Yes. There is a very strong fear in this county and in almost every community that affordable housing will detract from the community.
Q. Is this racially charged?
A. I would rather not say that. But affordable housing means bringing in people who may or may not share the same social values as the existing community -- social and economic. When most people see any housing that in some way has a public funding component to it, it triggers alarm; it triggers fear. My experience over the last eight years is that the fears are totally groundless.
The question is: how does the county executive convince local authorities and municipal town boards to pass zoning laws that allow for the kind of density -- not townwide obviously -- that would bring the high land values in line with the per-unit cost necessary to develop?
Affordable housing does not necessarily mean you cannot have a bucolic existence. Every town has to look at what its needs are. They may not be losing population, but the population is getting older. And as the population gets older you're going to have more and more battles over school taxes, which are the largest part of property taxes. So in a way affordable housing is a way to regenerate your community.

How Shelton Won a Role in Fairfield's Office Market

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: SHELTON

 BODY:
IN 1975 Shelton's largest employer, the sponge-rubber plant that B.F. Goodrich had leased out a year earlier, was firebombed and destroyed in an insurance-fraud scheme, marking the end of the city's smokestack economy and its dependence on a single industry. The fire put 4,500 people out of work.
Today, R. D. Scinto, developer of 2 million square feet of offices in Shelton, Trumbull, Fairfield, Bridgeport and Wilton -- half of it in Shelton -- worth a total of some $200 million is Shelton's largest taxpayer and the foremost example of its transformation into a competitor in the Fairfield County office market. 
 Through the 80's Shelton worked hard to woo and win several corporations that wanted to move to Fairfield County but were disenchanted with the high costs on its Gold Coast. Among them were Tetley Tea, ITT, Chesebrough-Pond and Sikorsky Aircraft, which found Shelton's lower costs a fair trade-off for its relatively remote location.
Robert D. Scinto, president of the R.D. Scinto real estate firm, began constructing small office buildings in 1978, and between 1982 and 1989 his company erected 27 significant commercial buildings, including the Enterprise Park in Shelton, where his headquarters is situated.
His choice of eastern Connecticut as his market was based on three considerations: vacant inexpensive land, housing that employees could afford and zoning. "I never wanted to build in lower Fairfield County," said Mr. Scinto. "Too much zoning, too much risk. Shelton has a progressive zoning commission that recognizes the value of tax revenues for its citizens. They allow 10-story buildings and you get approvals right away."
This year he has more than 540,000 square feet of office projects in Shelton and Trumbull under construction or approved for construction.
After a hiatus of 9 years when he built nothing, his 28th building, of 128,032 square feet, was completed on his 70-acre Enterprise Park tract last month, fully leased to Cartier, Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chemicals, TranSwitch Corporation, Country Home Bakers and RMS, a computer company.
In Trumbull, a 42,000-square-foot Scinto office building is going up on Quarry Road, and there are 11 acres of Scinto-owned Trumbull land capable of accommodating 300,000 square feet of construction. Two 112,000-square-foot buildings earmarked for his corporate park in Shelton are on his drawing board, literally.
"I design the buildings myself," he said, "but I use an architect to draw up and file the plans." He will not build without substantial tenant commitments. Based on pending contracts he expects to start construction on the Shelton projects in 1998 and '99.
"What's so unusual about him," said Richard F. Gretsch, Jr., a Stamford realtor who handles all Scinto leases, "is that he does it all himself. Most developers have multiple partners."
"I wish he would not go ahead with all this construction," he added. "I've told him that he can raise rents and make more money on his existing buildings than he will with new buildings. But if he doesn't build he's not happy." Rents range from $16 to $22 a square foot including heat and cleaning, but excluding the tenant's own electric bill.
In 1984, the Route 8 Expressway, the first major north-south artery in the state, opened to connect Bridgeport to the Massachusetts border. It runs through Shelton and opened the city to the Merritt and Wilbur Cross Parkways, and Interstates 95 and 84, creating an additional inducement for commercial development.
The expressway's free-flowing traffic is still an attraction for companies wanting the cachet of a Fairfield County address without the daily gridlock on the Merritt and I-95 from Westport to Greenwich.
OTHER developers headed for the Shelton region include the Davis Companies of Boston, which has filed for site plan approval for a 385,000-square-foot complex of two to three office buildings on 12 acres in Shelton. It has also acquired a five-acre site for office development in Wilton.
"We intend to start construction in Shelton next spring with or without a tenant," said Paul Marcus, president of the company. "Boston is probably nine months ahead of Fairfield in building where people live, where costs are lower and space is flexible. Nothing is under construction in downtown Boston. Fidelity Investments and other companies got out of the city into suburbs like Marlborough, very similar to Shelton. We're seeing the same thing happening in Dallas and Los Angeles."
"In Stamford," he continued, "it might take two to three years to build. In Shelton it will be less than 10 months because there's no interference from traffic and encroaching buildings."
A Trumbull partnership called ElDorado Holdings LLC, headed by Camilo Soto, has opened a 17-acre parcel called Cyber Park on Route 111 in Trumbull. Divided into four lots it can accommodate a total of 200,000 square feet in four to five buildings. The first building, a 34,000-square-foot structure, has been completed and occupied by its first tenants: PCNet, resellers of personal computer hardware and software; and ViewTek, a company focused on electronic commerce and data interchange.
Incentives offered by the town are getting the attention of builders like ElDorado. "We will give tax abatements of 100 percent for the first two years to businesses with over $5 million of new construction," said First Selectman David Wilson, "and a one-year abatement for $500,000 worth of additions or reconstruction of existing buildings. We abated personal property taxes for the past three years by knocking off 30, 20 and 10 percent over the first three years. Even with the abatements we're drawing three-quarters of a million dollars in additional revenues."
So far, real estate professionals in the area agree, Mr. Scinto has no peer among developers in Eastern Connecticut -- from his engagingly personal style evident in the "hi, Bob" greetings from all levels of tenants and employees, to the smorgasbord of tenant perquisites he provides, to his ability to ride out rough times.
Most prized by such tenants as American Scandia Insurance, Massachusetts Mutual, General Electric, and Prudential Relocation, is the day-care center for 110 children at the Corporate Towers. A partial list of amenities includes full-service dining room, deli, dry-cleaning service, shoeshine parlor, bank ATM, carwash, limousine, helicopter, travel and car rental services, teleconferencing, fitness center, jogging path, hair salon, volleyball and basketball courts, and an annual Labor Day picnic for 4,500 tenants, families and friends. To insure his tenants and employees immediate access to health and legal services he recruited a dentist, a medical service, and a lawyer as tenants.
Perched incongruously on a white Ionic pedestal in his office is a battered old hulk of a machine. It is in stark contrast to the fine art and furnishings, marble floors and Oriental rugs elsewhere in the office.
The machine is a plumber's buffer, which was used to polish and fit galvanized-iron pipes. "It reminds me of where I came from," said Mr. Scinto. "I started life as a plumber with my father. When I was a kid he used to give me a penny a fitting."

HEADLINE: Facing Intense Pressures, Hospitals Step Up Mergers

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
THE merger of two premier teaching hospitals and the reorganization of four Roman Catholic hospitals is changing health care on Long Island and reflecting rapid shifts across the industry.
The merger, the largest for hospitals on Long Island, is uniting two competitors, North Shore Health System, whose flagship is North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, and the Long Island Jewish Medical Center of New Hyde Park and Queens. 
 Barring a last-minute legal problem, they are forming a 4,708-bed multihospital system that will be the largest of its category on the Eastern Seaboard.
The way was cleared when Judge Arthur D. Spatt of Federal District Court in Uniondale ruled against a Justice Department move to block the merger as anticompetitive and a violation of antitrust laws.
The reorganization of the Catholic hospitals, which Bishop John R. McGann of the Rockville Centre Diocese ordered last month, reinforces a church mission to care for the poor who are sick, regardless of ability to pay. The move was also a response to economic pressures, including falling Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements and lower rates negotiated between hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
Those pressures also prompted the merger of Long Island Jewish and North Shore, which are facing a combined estimated loss in Medicaid and Medicare payments of $175 million over the next five years.
The pressures are also leading to affiliations among other hospitals, as stand-alone institutions are rapidly facing what may be untenable economics and, even, obsolescence, experts said. Nassau has 14 acute-care hospitals and Suffolk has 13.
The state deregulatedhospital rates on Jan. 1, opening the way for major changes, sharply increasing the influence of H.M.O.'s and emptying hospital beds in a state previously known for regulations that had encouraged hospital stays. Regional hospitals are reporting record numbers of empty beds, and some hospitals are advertising to fill them.
Bishop McGann said 85 percent of Catholic hospitals nationally had joined health-care systems, adding, "We are restructuring as a means to embrace these changes while preserving the soul of Catholic health care."
The hospitals here are Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Islip, Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Centre, St. Charles Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Port Jefferson and St. Francis Hospital -- the Heart Center, in Roslyn. They have a total of nearly 1,300 beds and nearly 8,000 employees.
The reorganization dissolves the boards at the four hospitals, a step that shocked some members. None of the hospitals were apparently in financial difficulty, and although they were affiliated they operated independently.
The job of one top administrator, Dr. Robert F. Vizza, president of the St. Francis-Mercy Corporation, which helped manage those two hospitals, will be eliminated. A spokeswoman for St. Francis, Lucille P. Kissane, said the hospital would have no statement on the reorganization.
Bishop McGann complimented the boards and managers for placing the diocese "in a strategic position to create a unified Catholic Health Services system." But he said in a statement, "The larger issues evolving in health care and the mission of the church go far beyond the efforts of these individual boards."
The hospitals will be under a single board headed by Bishop McGann for a 30-day transition period.
The bishop's secretary for health affairs, Msgr. Alan J. Placa, said the church was concerned about "entrepreneurial economic pressures' causing hospitals around the country to make drastic decisions" that might harm the poor. The reorganization, Monsignor Placa added, "will strengthen our care for those who are disadvantaged."
Long Island Jewish and North Shore, where treatment is also given regardless of ability to pay, said charitable care would continue after the merger.
That merger is creating a new system that will have 6,500 affiliated physicians and 18,000 employees, will offer care ranging from primary to tertiary and will position the institutions to compete vigorously with hospitals in Manhattan and elsewhere.
More than 50,000 patients in Nassau, Suffolk and Queens traveled to Manhattan last year for tertiary treatment, one expert estimated. The new system will try to compete against what officials call the colonization of Long Island by city hospitals through advertising campaigns, the purchasing of medical groups and affiliations with local hospitals.
Tertiary care involves highly skilled medical treatment for heart disease, cancer and other serious illnesses.
Hospital officials said the merger, which will take months or even years to complete, would lower rates through efficiencies and cost cutting while improving care. "The patients are going to be the winners in this," the co-president of the new organization, John S. T. Gallagher of North Shore, said. "We will raise quality standards and spread them across the system."
"With what is happening with health care, for hospitals to be at the top of their game you are going to have to meld the best talents available," said Dr. David R. Dantzker of Long Island Jewish, the other co-president of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. "Now we are going to be able to become, as a system, among the best in the world."
The Justice Department filed its antitrust action in June, saying that the merger could create a monopoly, raise rates and lower the quality of care.
But Judge Spatt ruled that the Government had failed to prove that the merger would constrain competition. He said Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, the Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow and hospitals in New York City were competitors for tertiary care and that more basic services would continue to be widely available from those and other hospitals and treatment centers.
He also ruled that there was "no credible evidence" that the merged hospitals would "not attempt to reduce costs."
"On the contrary," he wrote, "the court finds that the principal reasons for this merger are to continue and advance the high quality of treatment of the hospitals' patients, to seek advancement of medical technology, to foster the education and training of its physicians, to further pursue medical research at both hospitals and to avoid duplication, thereby reducing costs."
The judge also disagreed with testimony by a Government witness that the merger would result in a 20 percent price increase for primary and secondary services, raising costs for managed-care organizations $55 million or more a year. The hospitals have agreed to cap rates for two years and have said rates may fall.
The new organizations forecasts more than $2 billion a year in revenues.

Reviving a Parsippany Town-House Project

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
FOR nearly eight years legal problems caused by the real estate recession have thwarted plans to transform into housing 48 acres at the intersection of Route 46 and North Beverwyck Road in Parsippany-Troy Hills. But now the site is being prepared for a $32 million town-house condominium community.
Roseland Property Company of Roseland took over the project last June, after resolving title and tax issues and modifying it with fewer, but larger, units to make the community more salable in today's market. 
 The project, called the Townhomes at Hunting Ridge and comprising 208 town-house units of 1,800 to 2,300 square feet, will be completed in three years in this eastern Morris County township. The original project, conceived by developers who defaulted on their loan, consisted of 274 units that were about half the size of the new ones.
To move its project along, Roseland agreed to the township's request to restore a more-than-century-old historic farmhouse on the site and retain it for use for both residents and the public. It also agreed to add extensive landscaping throughout the development, including a linear greenway along the site's southern border to mask it from the highway.
"The site, which over the last decade had become an eyesore, forms the crossroads into our community," said Parsippany's Mayor, Mimi Lettes. "So, visually we wanted it to make a positive impact and the changes made to the project were absolutely necessary to accomplish that."
The revamped project, she said, "will be an asset to the township," adding that though Parsippany "is not chasing ratables it will also generate new tax revenue."
Roseland is using its own equity and a $22.5 million construction loan from First Union Bank in Newark to develop Hunting Ridge, an attached-housing community. It is one of the few new sizable condominium projects begun in recent years in Parsippany. In the mid-80's construction boom the county witnessed substantial retail and office growth within its 25 square miles.
As in other communities in the developed eastern portion of the county, there is a limited amount of attached housing in Parsippany because of a scarcity of properly zoned land for it. Though a handful of such projects are planned, most of the town houses now under construction constitute the final phases of existing projects begun or restarted several years ago, real estate brokers said.
A case in point is Longview, a 576-unit project in Montville that was stalled by the recession after 103 units were built. Pinnacle Communities and Garden Homes, both of Short Hills, took over the project three years ago and built and sold all but 46 of the 2- and 3-bedroom homes.
"There just are not a lot of town-house projects coming in right now," said Raymond K. Chang, principal planner for the Morris County Planning Department. "I would dare to say it is a countywide trend."
OF the 1,001 housing permits issued so far this year in Morris County the majority were for one-family detached homes, Mr. Chang said. He added that home building was moving westward in the county, where large tracts of land are available and costs are lower.
The focus on attached housing, he said, is assisted-living or continuing-care retirement communities that offer housing, services and health care for the elderly. As an example he pointed to the 1,400-unit continuing-care complex that Senior Campus Living, of Baltimore, plans to build in Pequannock.
The limited supply of new town houses, brokers said, has kept the selling pace steady. That, coupled with an improving housing market in Morris County, as in the rest of suburban New Jersey, has nudged up prices. Michael H. Campbell, president of the North Central Jersey Association of Realtors, said that sale prices for all types of houses throughout the county have risen over the last year by 5 to 6 percent.
Factors in the improving market are increased demand, increased consumer confidence in the economy and the winding down of corporate consolidations and mergers, said Marvin J. Crane, who is a broker at the Mountain Lakes office of Coldwell Banker and the sales manager for Hunting Ridge.
Another stimulant for new housing production is the fact that Morris County, which has about 6.8 percent of New Jersey's 3.5 million jobs, is considered among the state's fastest growing counties. Its population is expected to rise to 465,500 in 2005 from 438,471 in 1994 and its job base to expand to 274,200 from 240,800, according to state figures.
Those market conditions were part of Roseland's decision to move ahead with Hunting Ridge, said Carl J. Goldberg, a Roseland partner, adding "the demand outstrips the supply." Other factors, he continued, were existing approvals for the site, its gently sloping terrain and location.
The site is near shopping, a park-and-ride lot with bus service to Manhattan and one mile west of the intersection of Route 46 and Interstates 80 and 287. In addition, the state is completing the widening of the intersection of Route 46 and North Beverwyck Road in front of the site, which was a community concern in the first project.
Roseland, which specializes in taking over distressed properties, acquired the site for what Mr. Goldberg called "a reasonable price" from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The F.D.I. C inherited the site three years earlier when its seized the assets of the Howard Savings Bank, whose development arm had been a joint venture partner in the original project with the first developer.
The partners had secured approvals to build 274 town houses on the site just as the recession hit. That in turn pushed the partners to default on their $16 million loan and after the bank failed, the project was thrown into a legal limbo.
Roseland spent the last seven months working through the legal impediments attached to the site, which ranged from clearing up tax liens and title issues to paying the township some $700,000 in unpaid real estate property taxes, said Mr. Goldberg. The company did so, he explained, because buying such properties, the supply of which is fast dwindling, "is real fertile ground for well-capitalized developers."
Mr. Goldberg said the new community, which will have a pool and other recreational amenities, will consist of 30 two-story residential buildings, each with three to nine units. The buildings, designed in traditional style by the Martin Organization of Philadelphia, will be laid out to follow the natural contours of the site and clustered in groups to resemble large single-family homes.
The 2- to 3-bedroom units, each with a one-car garage, are expected to range from $195,000 to $250,000, with monthly maintenance charges of about $150. New town-house units within a 10-mile radius of the site are selling for $175,000 to $395,000, said Mr. Crane, the broker. The average price for a new one-family detached home in the county is about $350,000.
Mr. Crane said, and Mr. Goldberg agreed, that the project is expected to attract first-time buyers and empty-nesters because of its pricing and its easy access to major highways and mass transportation.
Mr. Goldberg said work was under way to restore the 19th-century farmhouse on the property, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was once owned by the Condit family, one of the county's prominent landowners. Stephen Condit, the last family member, died in 1984, freeing the site for development and leaving the fate of the house uncertain.
Roseland is investing $500,000 to preserve the Victorian-style structure, where the two ground-level rooms will house documents pertaining to Parsippany's history for view by the public. The upper floor will be for use of the Hunting Ridge Homeowners Association, which will own the building.

HEADLINE: Hanging On to Hartford's Past

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
WITH the Old State House, the State Capitol and the former homes of Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe, among other, Hartford has more than its share of historical structures. But it also has close to 1,000 vacant and abandoned buildings that are a blight on many of the city's neighborhoods.
Starting this week, Hartford will begin to demolish about 85 of those buildings, some of which were put up in the latter part of the 19th century. But unlike the case in Stamford, where room was made over the last two decades for corporate office complexes that radically altered the city's downtown and even some residential areas, Hartford seems determined to preserve structures with historical significance and architectural merit. 
 Aware that the city was on the verge of tearing down scores of vacant buildings, most of them apartment houses, a group of about 25 people formed the Hartford Preservation Alliance. "There's a critical need for an organization like ours to be able to examine any list of buildings scheduled for demolition to see whether they have any historical or architectural significance and, if they do, whether they can be rehabilitated and re-used," said Lee Kuckro, a lawyer from Wethersfield who works in Hartford. "We don't want to end up with a plastic city that has been denatured and leaves us with no sense of place."
Mr. Kuckro, who is general counsel for Advest Group Inc., was a founder of the preservation alliance as was Gregory Secord of Marlborough, an executive with a real estate company in Wethersfield. Both men belonged to the now-defunct Greater Hartford Architecture Conservancy, a nonprofit group formed after urban renewal and a highway construction project near the Connecticut River resulted in the demolition of hundreds of buildings.
"The Conservancy was formed in the early 1970's in reaction to the demolition of some old and historic buildings along Front Street so that Interstate 91 and Constitution Plaza could be built," Mr. Kuckro said.
John W. Shannahan, the director of the State Historical Commission, added, "Front Street was a vibrant Italian American neighborhood. But at the time, the demolition of those buildings was viewed as progress."
Mr. Kuckro conceded that it was necessary to demolish many of the vacant and abandoned buildings with the decline in the city's population -- from a high of 177,397 in 1950 to 124,096 in 1994, the last year a census estimate was made. But he said it was imperative that an outside organization, like the Hartford Preservation Alliance, work with city and state officials to insure that not all of Hartford's historic physical presence be lost.
"We have to determine whether, in many cases, there are alternatives to demolition," he said. "Look at what's happening in Providence and what they've done with some old neighborhoods. Maybe Hartford can do something, too." Mr. Kuckro was referring to an acclaimed restoration effort in Providence that has resulted in the rehabilitation of hundreds of old buildings and the ensuing rejuvenation of some of the city's neighborhoods.
Linda Bayer, the assistant city manager in Hartford, said the impending demolition project was in response to the wishes of neighborhood residents. "We went into the communities and asked the people what their priorities were," Ms. Bayer said, "and the first priority was demolition of the vacant buildings."
She added that, "People in the communities told us that the physical appearance of the buildings was blighting, and that the buildings were dangerous and that there was drug trafficking in some of them. They also feel that tearing down the vacant buildings will reduce density and create more open space for children to play in and where 'pocket' parks can be built."
The demolition will be financed by a $7 million grant from the state, which is to cover mothballing chosen buildings for possible reuse. Mr. Shannahan said some Federal tax credits were available to restore old buildings, provided they are listed in the Historic Register. For example, Federal investment tax credits of up to 20 percent are allowed for the rehabilitation of income-producing buildings. And the state legislature is expected, during its next session, to consider a bill that would provide income tax credits to property owners who rehabilitate owner-occupied residences.
"We need more carrots like this if we're going to save some of these old buildings," he said. "I think we've learned some hard lessons in the past. But the idea of just saving buildings because they have historic significance or archictural merit alone is not going to fly these days. If you're not going to tear it down, you have to be able to put the buildings to a productive use."

HEADLINE: Store Owner Faults Music for Decline

BYLINE: By THOMAS STAUDTER

DATELINE: OSSINING

 BODY:
ANOTHER Saturday afternoon and Herb Smith, the proprietor of Arcadian Music and Books, was waiting for his next customer. Occasionally, he looked up from a magazine as cars and other vehicles positioned in and out of the parking spaces across from his small storefront here in the Arcadian Shopping Center on Route 9, though everyone seemed to be heading toward the neighboring supermarket and home-decorating store.
After a while, a young man walked in and politely asked for a book of matches and Mr. Smith, his reverie broken, found one in a box behind the counter. 
 "Business was steady this morning, but after lunch it died," he said after the man had left the store. "Now, I'm already thinking about my first martini."
Despite surviving a decade of broad competition from chain stores and giant retailers, it has been the prolonged slump in the music industry that has most hurt Mr. Smith's business and other small music retailers. It is hard times for the local record shop, just as it has been for many businesses that have resided on Main Street in America.
"Around three years ago my sales dropped off and things got dire," Mr. Smith said. "I thought it was related to the economy and that a lot of people were cutting back on music purchases so they could afford the necessities. "But the other half of the story is that there haven't been too many big hits or new trends for customers to get excited about either."
When his store is not doing well, it is frightening, the 60-year-old lifelong resident of Ossining said. "Each month it's a challenge just to pay the overhead and stay afloat. There's not much for Herbie after everyone gets theirs."
Last April, two officials from the State Department of Taxation and Finance, accompanied by a locksmith and a police officer, closed down Arcadian Music and Books because Mr. Smith's sales-tax payments were in arrears. Before being closed, he had negotiated a schedule of repayments to the state, but feeble earnings forced him to disregard them.
Closed for three weeks, the store reopened when one of Mr. Smith's friends lent him enough money to clear his tax bill. Several family members also helped support the store to keep it open.
"The state even billed me for having the locks changed," he said in exasperation.
Robert Caruso, owner of Tunemaster Records and Tapes in Valhalla, which he started in 1978, said, "It's a marginal business at best right now and certainly no way to get rich." Recently, he suggested that the introduction of the compact disk in the 1980's may have actually slowed the momentum of rising sales in the music industry.
"Music lovers, especially younger folks, are discouraged from increasing their collections because of the price of compact disks, which are significantly higher than records and tapes," he said, observing that CD's, even on sale, cost $12 to $15.
Independent music retailers typically combat their bigger competitors by specializing in hard-to-find products like vintage records or confining their stock to certain musical genres. The Alternative, a tiny record store in Ossining, for instance, caters solely to aficionados of heavy metal and punk music.
Also, the owners of smaller music stores are increasingly looking at every new wrinkle in retailing to help sales. Mr. Caruso, whose store contains several thousand records from the 1960's and 70's, now markets his rare treasures through a Web site. And many stores now feature listening stations -- stereo equipment set up with headphones -- so customers can preview music before buying it.
For the most part, though, it is the personal attention afforded individual customers who reciprocate with loyalty that keeps smaller music stores open. "I'd say that 80 percent of the people who walk through here I know by name," said Jeff Loh, referring to his Port Chester store, Vinyl Solution, now in its 10th year.
At Arcadian Music and Books, Mr. Smith helped a customer find a recording of Sammy Davis Jr.'s "Candy Man" in a catalogue and wrote out the order for a cassette. "The guy who'll search far and wide for something special -- that's me," he said.
Although many patrons can recall the heyday of Mr. Smith's store in the 70's and 80's, when people stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the rows of record bins, very few could know that he first began selling records in Ossining while a senior in high school in 1953.
"I first worked at Abelon's, a stationery store in town that also sold records," Mr. Smith said. "The owner, Morris Hirsch, hired me and even kept the job for me when I entered the Army after high school. When I was home on leave he'd advertise in the paper that Herbie was back in town selling records."
He worked at Abelon's for 13 years, until it closed. In 1970, after several years at another music store in Briarcliff, Mr. Smith was asked to manage the Music Plus One store in the newly opened Arcadian Shopping Center. A new owner rechristened the store Book & Record four years later, and Mr. Smith remained and has been there ever since, orchestrating the proceedings, as always from his stool behind the counter. In 1984 he bought the store and renamed it.
The narrow, 900-square-foot establishment seems almost frozen in time. Even though Mr. Smith carries a fair selection of new CD's, a majority of the store's stock dates from past decades. The books on the shelves -- always a sideline -- will either defy recognition or evoke nostalgia. To keep the place lively and interesting, Mr. Smith has taken on consignment clothing, jewelry and various fashion-related accessories.
Just before he closed on a recent Saturday, an old customer showed up to say hello. Lisa Galli-Lise, who grew up in Ossining and now lives in New Jersey, was in town to organize her 20th high school reunion and was happy to find Herbie still in business. She gave him a big hug and said, smiling, "I still have every record I bought here."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Lodging in New York City;
Hotel Occupancy and Room Rates Are Up

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
BERNARD GOLDBERG stood in the lobby of the Roger Williams Hotel at Madison Avenue and 31st Street, waved his arms expansively and explained to a visitor, "You 're standing where the noodle shop used to be."
The noodle shop is long gone, as is the barber shop, the tavern and other commercial operations on the ground floor of the building. Also gone are some guest rooms on the second floor. They have been replaced by a 20-foot-high atrium with floor-to-ceiling glass facing both Madison Avenue and 31st Street. 
 Inside the lobby are touches typical of Mr. Goldberg's Gotham Hospitality Group: a restored 6-foot, 4-inch-long Steinway grand piano; original sculptures, plenty of seating space and structural columns clad with fluted zinc to minimize their intrusiveness.
"People say you can't afford to give up commercial space, but you can't have a 4-foot-by-9-foot lobby for a 209-room hotel," Mr. Goldberg said. The design, by the architect Rafael Vinoly, did away with all the stores and four guest rooms to produce the spacious lobby, with the registration desk at the far end.
Mr. Goldberg said his formula, which has been applied to five midsize hotels in Manhattan, was to take rundown properties and add equipment and services that attract a more affluent clientele. "You are giving up commercial revenue," he said, "but by adding amenities, you can attract the type of customer that allows you to raise the room rate."
Indeed, before the restoration, the 1928-vintage Roger Williams was able to command only about $40 a night and several floors had been used by the Red Cross to house homeless families. Now, with the restoration complete, the room rate is over $170 a night.
Mr. Goldberg hopes to keep attracting guests with amenities such as a CD player in every room and a library of CD's for guests to play. He is counting on live music as well, with chamber music groups centered on the Steinway in the lobby.
At his other hotels, the Wales, the Franklin, the Shoreham and the Mansfield,, concerts are formal, sit-down affairs held on specific days of the week. "At the Roger Williams we will be more casual," he said. "We will have music, say, from 8 to 9:30 in the morning, 2 to 4 in the afternoon and maybe later in the evening."
For now, though, Mr. Goldberg reports that the Roger Williams has been virtually full in recent weeks.
So has just about every other hotel in New York. With a robust overall economy and the city's newfound attractiveness, both business and recreational visitors have been pouring in, driving occupancy rates and room charges to record levels.
"We are projecting that the citywide occupancy rate for this year will be 83 percent," compared to 81.3 percent last year, said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting, which specializes in hotels. "We expect that level to be flat in 1998, because the industry is essentially at capacity -- you can't fit any more people in." The only way hotel operators could find to rent more rooms, Mr. Fox said, would be to persuade people to visit the city in January and February, which are traditionally the months of lowest demand.
Meanwhile, the unrelenting demand has allowed hotel managers to increase their room rates to levels never before seen. Mr. Fox said his firm estimates that the overall average room rate in the city for 1997 will be $188. And the expectation is that it will rise over $200 in 1998. "That will be the first time the average rate has gone that high in America," he said.
With this kind of demand, the expectation would be that developers would be putting spades in the ground to bring more rooms to market. Indeed, there has been a lot talk -- but little action.
Renovations, such as Mr. Goldberg's, do not add rooms to the inventory; they just shift the market segment from the lowest to something attractive to a middle-class businessman or tourist. Only two new hotels are being built now, a 384-room Marriott Hotel that will be part of a 1.4 million-square-footoffice-conference-hotel complex in Brooklyn known as Renaissance Plaza, and a 240-room Marriott Courtyard on 40th Street between Avenue of the Americas and Broadway. A construction shed is in place at 866 Third Avenue, where part of the building is to be converted into a 308-unit Marriott Courtyard.
HOTEL industry analysts and real estate executives say many lenders were badly burned by the hotel building boom of the 1980's, which led many hotel owners to default during the slump of the early 1990's and left the lenders reluctant to get involved in the industry again.
"Hotels are not like office buildings, where you sign a lease and go home," said Vijay Dandapani, chief operating officer of Apple Core Hotels, which has restored five hotels in the city since 1992. "You have to re-rent them every night; management has to be able to do that."
C. Scott Robertson, a senior vice president at Sonnenblick-Goldman Company, said that many hotels and hotel chains have traded hands this year. Indeed, a mergers and acquisitions survey by Coopers & Lybrand shows that hotel deals totaling over $32 billion have closed or been announced so far this year.
Mr. Robertson said this activity showed that money was available for the right kind of deals. "If something is up and built, you can find financing for it," he said, "Financing speculative construction is a lot more difficult unless it's a corporation with good credit and there is lots of equity."
Nevertheless, some analysts say that hotel economics are favorable enough in New York now to attract lenders. "Until recently, room rates did not justify new construction, but now I think we are there," said Arthur Adler, a partner on Coopers & Lybrand's lodging and gaming group.
Mr. Adler said projects like the Embassy Suites hotel in Battery Park City, the Tishman E-Walk hotel at Eighth Avenue and 43d Street and the Sofitel on 45th Street near Times Square all appear to be close to getting under way. "I expect to see things coming out of the ground in the next 18 months," he said.
Another optimist is Paul Stern, managing director of Sonnenblick-Goldman, who was involved in the sale of the 1,705-room Hotel Pennsylvania to a group including Vornado Realty Trust, Planet Hollywood International and a Singapore-based company headed by Ong Beng Sang. The hotel, across Seventh Avenue from Madison Square Garden, is to be converted to a sports-theme hotel and entertainment complex called the Official All Star Hotel.
"New York is in the midst of a great economic resurgence," he said. "Five years ago people were saying New York would go the way of Newark and Detroit. I think it is only halfway through a recovery that will last into the next century. At the turn of the century, New York will be the best place on Earth to be."
This sort of talk makes some veteran hotel owners nervous. "I saw the same kind of euphoria in 1988," said Richard Born, whose BD Hotels company owns and operates 14 hotels in the city, including the Stanhope, Holiday Inn, Hotel Elysee and Metro Hotel.
"Room rates of $200 a night and occupancy rates of 90 percent are not sustainable," Mr. Born said. Looking back, he noted that the hotel business slumped in 1974 and 1975 and dived again from 1991 to 1993. "Sometime in the next decade we are going to have two bad years back to back and we are going to see the same problems as before," he said. He said that he bought hotels in the early 1990's because there were bargains to be had, but that he is less likely to invest now that the industry has heated up. "I look at properties every day," he said, "but when I see projected numbers, I try to use a little caution." He and some other hotel investors said any deal predicated on steadily rising room rates was likely to come apart in a downturn, just as happened with office buildings in midtown in the early 90's.
One of those investors is Mr. Goldberg. On one hand, he is thinking big, saying he would like to buy the Chrysler Building and turn it into a massive 1,700-room hotel. On the other, he keeps an eye on the pitfalls.
"The up side takes care of itself," he said. "You have to live with the down side." He said the Roger Williams deal was structured so he could survive at a much lower room rate than the over $170 charged now.
"I can afford to charge $90 a night at 70 percent occupancy and still serve breakfast," he said.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Genius Nerds, New Machines And the Culture They Made

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
"THE SOUL OF A NEW MACHINE," Tracy Kidder's classic 1981 narrative about the creation of a computer, has been reissued by the Modern Library ($16.50), and it feels as up to date as ever.
The new machine of the title, a 32-bit supermini built during an arduous three years at the Data General Corporation, no longer generates excitement, of course. But its story, adjusted, you might say, for technological inflation, is amazingly current. 
 Here, in Pulitzer Prize-winning prose, are the ingredients of computer tales to come: the code names, genius nerds, brash marketing ploys, project rivalries, 20-hour workdays and passionate commitment twinned with a penchant for secrecy. (Visitors to Data General's Massachusetts compound were monitored by rooftop cameras.)
"By giving this book its odd title," Mr. Kidder writes in the introduction to the new edition, "I meant to imply something about the collective character and effort of a group of people who worked only partly for their pay, most of them reveling in the difficulty of their circumstances."
This "something" has evolved into an industry culture, and it is gracefully decoded again in a new book, Tim Jackson's "Inside Intel: Andy Grove and the Rise of the World's Most Powerful Chip Company" (Dutton, $24.95).
Intel, founded in 1968 in Mountain View, Calif., about the same time as Data General, gave the world the microprocessor that allowed powerful computers to fit on desktops. In this compelling account of the company's rise, Mr. Jackson, who writes a weekly Internet column for The Financial Times, shows, in effect, how Intel became the Brain of Your New Machine. (Intel chips are famously "inside" about 80 percent of personal computers.)
Intel's chairman, Andrew C. Grove, who wrote his own corporate account last year in "Only the Paranoid Survive," didn't cooperate with the author. And Mr. Jackson writes that the company tried to thwart his reporting from time to time.
Still, the results are anything but patchy, and as the book chronicles Intel's advances in microprocessors, memory chips and marketing, it hands out praise with its criticisms.
Started by Robert N. Noyce and Gordon E. Moore, who defected from Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel made the usual transition from a freewheeling outfit, at which engineers could order $100,000 worth of gear without authorization. Mr. Grove, hired early on as operations director, has shaped the company's current culture, the author says, a culture of strict performance reviews, secrecy, wariness and a sharp-elbowed competitive style involving lots of litigation.
The author concludes, however, that this strong home-grown management has been good for the company, although its accompanying failure to hire outsiders to high posts is a weakness, he says.
Intel, after all, is prospering, and it has helped others in the industry prosper, too. Its chips "began the familiar path of rising costs, rising performance and diminishing size," the author notes. Intel's Mr. Moore is the source of Moore's Law, the rule of thumb that computer chips get twice as fast and twice as cheap every 18 months. (A few weeks ago, Intel and Hewlett-Packard announced a new chip architecture that may make things go faster even faster.)
"Inside Intel" does a lively job of explaining the technological struggles in all this, though some passages will be a hard go for lay people (like me). But the sections likely to get the most attention concern the company's culture, management and mistakes.
There's a nice description of the day in July 1969 when company engineers were allowed to take radios into the lab so they could hear Neil Armstrong's message from the moon. And there are fascinating narratives about Intel's outwardly cool but inwardly panicked response to the threat of unionization, its digital-watch debacle and its crisis in 1994, when news of its flawed Pentium chip raged across the Internet.
And at a time when Intel and other computer industry giants are being scrutinized by Federal regulators, the author also says there are company practices that reveal the price of success.
Midlevel managers, he says, are warned never to say the company "dominates" the microprocessor business, but only that it "leads." And from time to time, he says, Intel stages mock raids, invading an executive's office unannounced and taking files away to search them for careless phrases that might jeopardize the company in a lawsuit.
 
A DIGITAL GUIDEBOOK "Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital Age," by Esther Dyson (Broadway Books, $25), is a treatise on the age of technology by someone at the center of the action.
Ms. Dyson is the high profile president of Edventure Holdings, which publishes Release 1.0, an influential industry newsletter. The company also organizes PC Forum, an annual computer industry event at which the elite meet (and occasionally serve one another's companies with subpoenas).
Unfortunately, Ms. Dyson, like cyber-gurus who have gone before, offers disappointingly bland prophecies and prescriptions when tackling the Big Thoughts: the impact of computers on education, work, politics and culture.
But if her picture for 2004 seems flat rather than futuristic, her dazzling familiarity with current technology, especially the Internet, finally gives the book a futuristic feeling. As the author mounts her arguments about privacy, security and self-governance on the Internet, she adopts the matter-of-fact tone of a science-fiction writer, giving readers an illuminating behind-the-scenes tour of her strange universe.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
These Good Times Will End With a Whimper

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The bull market lives on, thanks to millions of Americans who did exactly what they had told pollsters they would do: They stayed calm when Wall Street panicked. Some even bought stocks.
"All the new investors since 1987 learned that you should buy the dips," said Donald B. Marron, the chairman of Paine Webber. "And that may be close to a majority of all investors." 
 The panic on Monday set off the New York Stock Exchange's circuit breakers and forced all American markets to close early. It terrified people around the world, but not in Peoria, Ill. or Boise, Idaho. And that illustrated just how much Americans now believe in stocks as the one and only superior long-term investment.
This panic was largely a matter of professional investors getting worried about the risks of collapsing prices, profits and banks in Asia. It will be interesting to see if it has a long-term effect on attitudes toward investing in emerging markets. But it is not likely to damage confidence in American stocks.
Bears on the American stock market need to remember that stocks do not go up or down because of earnings, or interest rates, or because they are trading at ridiculous multiples of profits or sales. They go down when there are not enough buyers at a certain price. If something does not influence investors, it won't affect prices.
That is why the stock market's high valuation is not very important right now. Investors will move from less attractive stocks to more attractive ones, but they will not get out of the market.
Alan Greenspan, in his Congressional testimony last week, tried to gently criticize that attitude, saying that stock price gains since 1995 appear to be based on the assumption that profits would keep rising indefinitely from already high levels. He knows that is unlikely to happen and seems to regret his own public flirtation with the so-called new paradigm, which holds that this time is different. But his ability to influence the market is limited, assuming he is unwilling to raise interest rates enough to bring on a recession.
Someday, of course, there will be a bear market. But it is unlikely to begin with a crash. As last week showed, even a very bad day will not shake a public that deeply believes in the long-term case for stocks.
The more likely picture is a choppy market, followed by a slow decline, like the one in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Faith in stocks as sure things was strong then, as it is now. The Dow Jones industrial average peaked at 1,051.69 on Jan. 11, 1973, not far above where it had been a few years before.
The 1973-74 bear market began slowly. Not until November, after the Dow was down 11.3 percent from the peak, did the market have a day in which prices fell by 2 percent. By then, there was obvious economic news to explain a weak stock market: an Arab oil embargo that was leading to the first oil price shock and a deep recession. The worst day of that bear market saw a 3.5 percent fall, less than half the decline that was seen last Monday. But by the time prices bottomed in late 1974, the Dow was off 45 percent from the peak. The worst days came near the end, not at the beginning, of the decline.
It took months, and even years, of performance that fell below expectations before most investors got out.
It will probably take a real recession to kill this bull, and then it will die slowly. But once it is dead, it may be a long time before a new bull is born. The 1973 high stood as a record until 1982.

HEADLINE: THE MANIC MARKET: AN INVESTOR'S GUIDE;
No Shore Is Safe for Emerging-Market Funds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
INVESTORS who have embraced the gospel of global diversification preached so fervently by investment advisers in recent years have no doubt found themselves filled with growing frustrations and skepticism the last two weeks.
For while most of the world has been focused on the turmoil in Asia and the dyspeptic reaction of the American markets, mutual funds that invest in European, Latin American and other emerging markets have also been coming unraveled. 
International investment experts say fund shareholders should not, however, give up on the idea that spreading their assets across a broad array of markets is the best way to invest for the long term.
"The linkage between all these markets is more psychological than economic," said Lawrence Kantor, a managing director at the Lexington Management Corporation in Saddle Brook, N.J., which oversees both a Russian and an Asian specialty mutual fund. So while there will be short periods when all markets seem to move together, over longer periods each market's growth will depend on factors peculiar to its region.
"Hong Kong was the best-performing market over the last 25 years because the economy there has boomed," he said. "Eastern Europe has had a poorly performing economy for five of the last six years. But it is just starting to turn around." Therefore, he said, the long-term growth of the two markets is unlikely to remain closely linked.
Nevertheless, Lexington's Troika Dialog Russia fund was hit particularly hard over the last week. The fund, which invests most of its assets directly in Russian equities, was the best performer of all mutual funds in the first three quarters of the year, gaining 115 percent. In the five trading sessions ended Thursday, however, the fund slumped more than 14 percent, cutting its 1997 gain to 88.5 percent.
The Vontobel Eastern European fund, which invests in Russia, Poland, Hungary and Croatia, also fell last week. In the first three quarters of the year, the fund gained 30 percent, far behind the Troika fund but still in the top one-tenth of the funds in the emerging-market sector tracked by Lipper Analytical Services.
The last week has been a disaster, however, as worries grew that some Eastern European countries, including the Czech Republic, might be vulnerable to the same type of currency crisis that has afflicted so many Asian nations. Even funds that have little or no holdings in the Czech Republic found themselves hurt by those worries: The Vontobel fund fell more than 17 percent in the week ended Thursday, cutting its gains for the year to 8.8 percent.
Those funds and others that invest in Eastern Europe might find themselves under pressure in coming weeks from growing illiquidity as the markets there retreat from their quick ascents of earlier this year. Whether the region's liquidity problems will ease anytime soon is an open question; banks like Chase Manhattan that were big lenders to Russian companies were reported last week to have suffered big losses on Russian debt securities.
Equity funds that invest in the region take some steps to limit their holdings of illiquid securities, which have restrictions on their sale or the use of any proceeds or both. But when an index of the country's largest stocks falls 18 percent, as Russia's did in the week ended Thursday, the definition of what is an easily tradable security is certainly open to some interpretation.
The Troika Dialog fund, for example, says in its prospectus that it limits its holdings of illiquid stocks to 15 percent of its net assets at the time of purchase of such a security. At June 30, when assets in the fund totaled $84 million, 13 percent of its assets were in securities deemed illiquid. Included in that portion were 4 percent of the fund's assets invested in shares of Sibneft, an oil and gas company. (By the end of the third quarter, the fund's assets had grown to $186 million as the fund's stellar performance attracted new investors.)
Mr. Kantor said that the fund had built up a 15 percent cash position in anticipation of a market correction but that redemptions were relatively small through last week.
SOME of the weakness in Eastern European markets spilled over into the more established countries to the west, and mutual funds that invest broadly in European markets also fell. Among the largest European funds, the Dean Witter European Growth fell 2.7 percent in the week ended Thursday, Merrill Lynch Eurofund dipped 1.6 percent, as did the T. Rowe Price International European fund, while the Vanguard International Index Europe fund fell 2.1 percent.
Latin American funds, which in the first nine months of the year were the best performing of all categories tracked by Lipper, also fell prey last week to concerns about currency problems. Most Latin American funds have their biggest holdings in Brazil, which is the region's largest and most liquid stock market. Brazil is also the country that many international investment experts expect will be the next target of currency speculators.
Not surprisingly, many Latin American funds finished the week ended Thursday worth much less. Among the largest funds, Fidelity Latin America lost 18 percent of its value, T. Rowe Price International Latin America fell nearly 20 percent, and the Scudder Latin America fund skidded 17 percent.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: ROOSEVELT ISLAND;
After 26 Years, Turbulence for an Urban Experiment

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Envisioned as an ambitious urban experiment in the 1970's, Roosevelt Island has always been an odd duck in New York City -- a neighborhood of 8,000 in the middle of the East River that is run, in effect, by the state government.
Now, 26 years after groundbreaking on an island that once housed a prison and a mental hospital, the community is going through its most turbulent times ever. The state, seeking to end what it considers decades of waste and mismanagement, has eliminated state aid and now is planning to sell the largest tract of open space there, 10 acres known as Southpoint. 
 For the residents, the proposed sale of Southpoint is the latest in a long list of grievances. They say that land, which includes the ruins of the historic Smallpox Hospital, which is visible from Manhattan, was promised to them as a park when Roosevelt Island was created. But the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, a state agency, wants to develop the property for commercial, residential or mixed use.
Residents complain that they were not consulted, and City Councilman Gifford Miller, who represents Roosevelt Island, is on their side. Mr. Miller said developing Southpoint would require changing the 1969 agreement by which New York City leased the island to New York State to create the community there. That would require Council approval, he said.
Michael Greason, a spokesman for the Roosevelt Island agency, said that the project would likely include a park and that a public meeting would be held on the plan, probably in January. He said he would have to check with agency lawyers on whether the project is subject to Council approval.
That a New York City neighborhood is run by Albany is something of an accident. The legislators who created the community, which is linked to Manhattan by the Roosevelt Island tram, envisioned a small town, free of cars and racially and economically diverse. Planners believed that a population of 20,000 was needed to generate enough revenue through rents and other fees to sustain the community without state subsidies. But the island never developed enough to house that many people.
For years, the state subsidized the island's operating budget, which totaled $8.8 million for the year ended March 31. But last year, at the urging of Gov. George Pataki, the Legislature cut the subsidy to $600,000 from $1 million. Financing for capital projects, which had been $5.2 million the year before, was eliminated.
Mr. Greason said that $600,000 was not even needed because the island had a surplus for the 1996-97 year, and was expected to finish this fiscal year with a surplus, too. The Legislature refused to approve either operating or capital money for this year.
Michael F. McKeon, a spokesman for the Governor, said the budget cuts were made to curb waste and mismanagement. "Roosevelt Island has become more self-sufficient with a much-improved management team," he said.
Patrick Stewart, president of the Roosevelt Island Residents Association, said that except for fire and police protection, the island received few city services.
"It's not like we want anything extra," he said. "We just want what everyone else has."
Relations between residents and the president of the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, Jerome H. Blue, have become increasingly tense. Residents claim he evades questions about how the island will cope without state money, which he denies.
In June, the residents association called for Mr. Blue's ouster, prompting some to say the criticism of Mr. Blue, who is African-American, was racially motivated. Mr. Stewart says that is untrue.
The racial tension especially worries longtime residents. "We used to call this Paradise Island," said Frances Salten, 84, a retired lawyer. "Not anymore." ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: THE MANIC MARKET: AN INVESTOR'S GUIDE;
Bonds Are Back, but Be Wary When Buying

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
IN the wake of the stock market's canyon-sized dip on Monday, many investors moved money into Treasury securities, which sent their prices surging.
These investors thus joined a herd of others who have been turning to bonds lately, attracted by the rising prices inherent in a low-interest rate environment. But, like most markets that suddenly get hot, the bond market can burn investors who have scant knowledge of the rules. 
 To be sure, bond analysts expect prices to keep rising. One reason is that they consider it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates anytime soon. Another is that the supply of both Treasuries and tax-free municipal bonds is shrinking as the Federal budget deficit is pared and as public-sector privatization grows. And with demand high and supply tight, bond prices tend to rise.
Kevin McClintock, the head of taxable fixed income at the Dreyfus Corporation, says this environment provides a "very favorable backdrop" for bond buyers.
Still, with prices high, it is not easy to spot value.
Experts advise caution not only for novices but also for more seasoned investors who are perhaps considering re-entering the bond market after a prolonged honeymoon with stocks.
It is true, they note, that bond prices lately have been gyrating far less than stocks. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond, for example, after surging on Monday by 126/32 , or $18.125 for each $1,000 in face value, to 1036/32 , ended the week at 1032/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, moved from 6.14 percent on Monday to 6.15 percent.
STILL, bonds have occasionally reacted strongly to factors like the possibility of higher oil prices or even the slightest whiff of a possible rise in inflation.
Traditionally, investors have needed to keep three kinds of risk in mind when buying bonds: the risk that inflation will push interest rates higher, the risk that the credit-worthiness of the bond will drop and, in the case of international bonds, the risk of big swings in currency values.
In addition, bonds -- like stocks -- have recently taken a hit from a string of economic problems abroad. Last year, according to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds, emerging-market bond funds were one of the few stars in the bond fund market, scoring a heady 41 percent return. But in the wake of the market's recent drop, Mr. McClintock estimates that emerging-market bonds have dropped in price, on average, 35 percent.
Indeed, for most investors, the bond market is a vastly different animal from what it was just a year ago. One example, when it comes to bond mutual funds, is the growing amount of junk, as well as emerging-market debt, that is popping up in even the highest-quality funds as their managers seek to bolster yield.
"It's becoming a poorer and poorer way to manage, but a lot of fund managers have been chasing yield through lower-credit issues," said John Poole, the head of fixed income at Mellon Private Asset Management.
He added: "One concern that we have is that if interest rates do go lower, then people will increasingly go to things that foolishly jeopardize their principal in order to get more return. Investors also need to remember that as rates go lower, price volatility rises."
At the Bond Investors Association, a nonprofit research and information company in Miami Lakes, Fla., Richard Lehmann, the company's president, is concerned about the growth of what he calls "cocktail-party bonds," which some bond experts say have quadrupled in assets over the last decade.
These bonds, he said, were initially intended to appeal to institutional investors who were looking for glitzier offerings within the relatively unglamorous bond world. But Mr. Lehmann senses that the bonds' issuers are now focusing on individual investors.
ONE recent example of cocktail-party bonds, he said, was the more than $50 million offering of "David Bowie bonds" that institutional investors bought earlier this year. Those bonds were backed by estimated future royalties for the rock star.
"Imagine talking about Texaco's efforts in the Indian Ocean when you could be talking about a rock singer's royalties," he said. "Cocktail-party bonds are now a multibillion-dollar market.
"We've seen bonds that are backed by credit card receivables on used-car loans; some municipalities are even backing them with delinquent parking tickets," he added. "In harder times, such strange stuff wouldn't have gotten noticed, but with the baby boomers there is so much liquidity now that it's fueling anything that moves."
Mr. Poole agreed. "There's more money out there than there are bonds, so it's been hard to be choosy," he said. "But there are a lot of gimmicks out there."
MR. POOLE cautioned bond buyers to be wary of unregistered bonds, too. While the Securities and Exchange Commission restricts the sale of such bonds to well-off investors, the bonds have become increasingly common over the last two years, tripling in volume this year alone. He noted that companies have taken advantage of a Federal law that allows them to sell bonds before registering them with the S.E.C. as long as they are registered within 270 days. That means investors are purchasing debt issues without having read the prospectuses.
According to Mr. Poole, unregistered bonds generally have yields that are a quarter or a half of a percentage point higher than similar, registered issues. Investors are so confident, given the low rate of business defaults nationwide, he said, that they tend to forget that they will not have as complete a contract to fall back on for making claims if their particular bond issuer does default.
"If a company has a credit rating and you know what you're getting into, then these issues are fine," said Patrick Smith, an editor at the Income Securities Advisor, a newsletter published by the Bond Investors Association. "But what worries me is the nonrated issue that offers a 12 percent yield and that gets hyped by an unscrupulous boiler-room operation, even though it has only a single-B or single-C credit status," he said. "Investors may not realize that this is a company that makes wagon wheels for stagecoaches."
Another source of worry to bond experts is that investors are still pouring money into high-yield junk bonds, which are often aggressively priced. Junk bond funds have lately been yielding 8 percent to 14 percent a year. But experts advise investors to look beyond yield and focus on total return, the sum of yield and the change in the portfolio's value.
At first glance, junk bonds, issued by companies whose credit ratings are not of investment grade, seem to hold plenty of appeal because, with the economy strong, the chances of a company's defaulting on its debt are lower than they were a few years ago.
But bond experts like Mr. Poole urge investors to think again before buying junk. The yield spreads, or difference in yields, between junk bonds and investment-grade bonds -- as well as those between intermediate-term bonds and longer-term issues -- have narrowed so much lately that investors are no longer being adequately compensated for the additional risk, he said.
"A lot of the game is over," Mr. Poole said. "In this market, if you have a lot of extra yield, you need to be very, very suspicious because almost all credit issues have pretty much the same yield today."
He added that investors might be better off "buying higher-quality, intermediate issues," those that mature in 5 to 10 years.
Mr. Lehmann also urged investors to focus on bond quality, adding that if investors were still determined to go for higher yields, they ought to stick to bonds with at least a double-B credit rating. Also, he said, be sure to buy recent issues; their credit rating is generally more trustworthy.
"The high-yield bonds that we're currently recommending yield anywhere between 8 and 11 percent, while investment-grade corporate bonds are yielding between 7 and 9 percent," he said.

Among all the types of bond funds, the ones with the least credit risk -- funds that invest primarily in long-term government bonds -- have fared the best since the market began declining after the Dow Jones industrial average hit its peak of 8,259.31 on Aug. 6. Convertible bonds, which roll with the stock market, fared the worst in that time -- but they are the stars for the year. (Source: Morningstar Inc.)

HEADLINE: THE MANIC MARKET: AN INVESTOR'S GUIDE;
Waiting for Those Dreams to Get Cheap Enough to Buy

BYLINE: By ANNE TERGESEN 

 BODY:
IT has been a tough year for value investors -- the bargain hunters whose search for cheap stocks has been frustrated by the climb of the Dow Jones industrial average. As the bull market reached new heights, thrift-minded fund managers carried more cash than they wanted and even adjusted their definitions of a good buy.
"Everybody had to stretch their valuation parameters upward," said Shelby Davis, chief investment officer of Davis Selected Advisors. "Where we used to think we could find stocks at 10 to 12 times earnings, we've been in the 13 to 15 range." 
 But with the stock market's dizzying selloff and semi-rebound last week, and a close on Friday that left it more than 800 points below its August peak, value investors can now dare to dream. What if the market continues to slide? Will the overpriced stocks of otherwise great companies come within reach?
Three mutual fund managers -- one specializing in large companies, one in medium companies and one in small ones -- were asked what stocks they most wanted to see tumble. Besides identifying some promising prospects, their answers show how these investors skirt what many call this bull market's fatal flaw: overvaluation.
In a pullback, Mr. Davis said, he would buy several stocks for his large-company funds, Selected American and Davis New York Venture. One wish-list company is Applied Materials, which makes equipment for semiconductor manufacturers. The company should benefit greatly from expected annual growth of 15 to 20 percent in demand for its industry's machines, Mr. Davis said. And with silicon chips -- its customers' end product -- finding their way into everything from computers to cars, the large equipment maker can only become more attractive, he said.
Applied Materials stands out even within its booming field. It is the largest player in a consolidating industry and its annual earnings growth rate, 20 to 25 percent, well exceeds the industry average.
But in order for the Davis funds to bite, the stock of Applied Materials must fall. One of Mr. Davis's rules of thumb: the ratio of a stock price to the estimated earnings per share next year must be equal to or less than the company's expected percentage growth in earnings in 1998. Under this principle, the stock of Applied Materials will have to fall to $25 from its current $33.375 to interest Mr. Davis.
Similarly, Mr. Davis likes Warner Lambert, the drug company. A big reason is the company's two new blockbuster drugs -- Lipitor, a cholesterol reducer, and Rezulin, a diabetes medicine. Both will have patent protection for many years, and Mr. Davis thinks that Warner Lambert will also continue to benefit from large trends, like the aging of the world's population.
But Warner Lambert stock must tumble to $120, from its current $143.375 for Mr. Davis to buy it. At $120, the company's price-earnings ratio would match the 29 percent expected earnings increase in 1998.
Thinking about such drops may seem like daydreaming. But after Monday it may seem less so. Warner Lambert fell from $151 to $140.50 on that day -- about half the drop that Mr. Davis wants before snapping it up.
In a down market, Richard Weiss, the manager of the midcap Strong Opportunity fund, would take a look at Sigma-Aldrich, which makes specialty chemicals. About 80 percent of its sales are to university, government, hospital and other laboratories. Sigma has a solid 10 percent of the lab market, and is also attractive for its operating margins of 21 percent, annual sales growth of 10 to 15 percent and a virtually debt-free balance sheet, Mr. Weiss said.
But Sigma's stock price of $35.125 -- or 22 times earnings -- is too expensive for Mr. Weiss. He would buy it at $30.
CNF Transportation, a trucking and air freight company, is on Mr. Weiss's watch list, too. In August, CNF's Emery Worldwide subsidiary snared a $1.7 billion contract to deliver priority mail on the East Coast for the Postal Service. CNF also should benefit from a recent restructuring. Recent shipping delays in the railroad industry may mean more profits for CNF, too.
But "a lot of expectations are built into its stock," which has risen this year from about $20 to $44.625 at Friday's close, Mr. Weiss said. CNF stock could disappoint, particularly if an economic slowdown curtails shipping. However, if the stock's price were to fall to $32, Mr. Weiss said he would jump in.
Mr. Weiss looks for a stock trading at a 40 percent discount to the company's estimated acquisition value, or what a rival or other company would pay for the enterprise. To arrive at acquisition estimates, he uses a variety of yardsticks, like price-to-sales ratios or the value of an oil company's oil reserves. With CNF, as with Sigma, the gauge was a ratio of earnings (adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to the company's value, or its market capitalization plus debt minus cash.
In a decline, Steven Reid, manager of the Oakmark Small Cap fund, dreams of buying something tasty -- Tootsie Roll Industries.
"If this stock got hit, I would love to buy it," he said. The company has no debt and the fame of its brands, which include Tootsie Rolls and Charms, means it can avoid huge marketing expenditures. The company also has operating margins of more than 20 percent, sales generally undisturbed by economic downturns and a hefty cash balance. With its chairman and controlling shareholder, Melvin Gordon, 77, well within sight of retirement, it may be a takeover candidate, too, Mr. Reid said.
Using a complicated ratio to gauge priciness -- operating cash flow compared with the company's market capitalization plus debt and minus cash -- Mr. Reid has set $37 as the target buy price.
That is a far cry from the current $56.75, and Tootsie Roll is a steady performer unlikely to be too severely battered in a down market. Then again, the company was trading at Mr. Reid's target price of $37 as recently as early February, although earnings growth and the market's rise have bolstered the price since then.
THE largest holding in Mr. Reid's fund is Peoples Bank of Bridgeport. From a closing of $36.083 a week ago Friday, the Connecticut bank's stock ended on Monday at $31.
Given its profitable credit card operations, expanding supermarket presence, and strong reputation siphoning depositors from out-of-state banks, Peoples is a bargain below $30 a share, Mr. Reid said. He tried to get yet more shares for his fund on Monday, but liquidity problems prevented him from doing so.
But he is watching for the next drop.

After a Rocky Ride, It's Time to Recall the A B C's

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
O.K, O.K., admit it. For weeks and months you have been muttering things like "trees don't grow to the sky" and "all good things have to end." But in your heart of hearts you didn't really believe that stock prices would have the audacity to crack.
Then, last week, it happened, and it's made you a little bit nervous. So maybe now is a good time to revisit all those fundamental investment realities that pushed you into the pond to begin with. 
 The first thing to remember is that it's a risky world out there.
Things have been so good for so long that it seems the only thing people have been worried about is whether Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will raise interest rates by 25 basis points.
It may be hard to believe, but it has been nearly four years since concerns over inflation turned 1994 into a pretty bad year for most investors. Not to mention Mexico and Orange County. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is even more removed. The energy crisis, double-digit interest rates, stagflation, recession? Another era.
Perhaps. But maybe Mr. Santayana was right. Maybe those who do forget their history are doomed to repeat it.
Economic fundamentals in this country still look good, but over the last week or so people have been fretting a lot about how much Asia's currency crisis will damage the bottom line of companies that do a lot of business there. Don't listen as analysts snip their earnings estimates. Worry instead that competitive devaluations create the potential for trade wars. You probably don't remember Mr. Smoot or Mr. Hawley. But you may have heard about the 1930's.
Don't lose too much sleep in the process, though, because the good news is that risk breeds opportunity. And historically the stock market has been the best way for the common man to seize that opportunity.
That said, it is worth remembering that over the last 70 years or so the market has generated an average return of about 11 percent, more than five percentage points better than bonds. But those averages include some years when stock prices fell.
It also bears repeating that as an individual investor you are in this for the long haul: most professionals talk about investment time horizons of decades. If you need the money in six months, don't put it in stocks.
"Unless you are 90 and your prognosis isn't good, you should be a long-term investor," Frederick B. Taylor, chief investment officer and vice chairman of the U.S. Trust Company, said recently.
It may be stupid to mention, but now is not a bad time to remember what you are investing for. A comfortable retirement seems a worthy goal. But so, too, is a good education for the children, or a new house.
Trouble is, it's much easier to keep those long-term goals in focus -- and be relaxed about it -- when prices are rising. It gets a bit dicier when the size of the goal pie shrinks for a year or two. But remember those long-term return averages. That will help you stick with the program because, unless you want to keep working forever or raise undereducated, uncompetitive children, the goals aren't going to go away.
Then comes the allocation issue: stocks, bonds, other assets and the mattress (a.k.a. cash).
If you own a home, you probably have enough real estate, even though some gurus like real estate investment trusts (Wall Street's fancy name for stocks made up of various forms of properties) for added exposure.
People in the investment business, particularly at mutual funds, are of the view that age and aversion to risk are two important considerations when considering how much money should be in stocks and bonds.
But virtually everybody agrees that if you really are a long-term investor, the bulk of the money, probably 80 percent or more, should be in the stock market.
"Asset allocation plays a role when you need cash," says Tom Martin, president of Circle Advisors, a New York financial consultancy. "And ideally we would like people to have one or two years of net expenses in cash or cash equivalents. But other than that, we want to be fully invested."
Where you invest that money is your choice, but it seems prudent to suggest that it should be spread around in a variety of different sectors. High-technology companies are sexy and fast-growing, but we live in an awfully diverse world.
FOR the last few years anyway, the decision to buy stocks instead of anything else has been easy because nothing -- not bonds, not real estate and certainly not gold -- has held the potential to appreciate in value as much as stocks.
But that is the point of citing the long-term potential of stocks: even if you had loaded up on Treasury bonds with coupons of 10 percent or more in the 1980's, you would be far better off had you invested in a Microsoft, a Coca-Cola or a Gillette.
Which raises another issue: Where to invest?
If the 401(k) plan where you work is your primary investment vehicle, the answer is probably already in: you are in a group of mutual funds chosen by your employer. Needless to say, remember to invest to the max, if possible, and to keep an eye on how the funds are doing.
Not too close an eye, though. At best, in times of market volatility -- like now -- monitoring your portfolio on a daily or weekly basis can give you agita. At worst, it gives you the chance to make silly mistakes.
If you are saving for a long-term goal, Vanguard, the big mutual fund company, says you should pick a date to check things out. Like your birthday or tax time. But you're forgiven if you peek once a month.
Although they may not have your 401(k) account, big brokerage houses are more than willing to help you manage any discretionary money at your disposal. A few of the biggest, including Merrill Lynch and Prudential Securities, were running ads last week reminding investors that they stand ready to help during these stressful times.
Do you need a broker?
Mr. Taylor at U.S. Trust says maybe. But Mr. Martin, the financial planner, likes mutual funds with good managers, not brokers. And Dave Gardner, co-founder of the Motley Fool, the on-line financial service, isn't a big fan of brokers, either.
In his view, investors now have access to more than enough information to function on their own. "At a minimum, you have to know how much money you have, and what your time horizon and risk profile are," he said. "In investing, common sense is about our best guide. And it is amazing how few people feel that common sense even applies to investing."
Which brings up a last point.
If you really are a long-term investor, getting into the market to buy stocks in good companies -- even those with prices outlandishly higher than the money they are making -- is easy. And what looks expensive today may well look like a bargain 10 years from now. Just ask the little old ladies in Atlanta who have been buying Coca-Cola shares for 30 or 40 years.
Still, even though "buy and hold" is a sound strategy, particularly for stocks that are winners, selling is still a part of the game. The question is when to do it.
Obviously, if you need the money, you need to sell. But if you are merely looking to lock in profits or minimize losses, some advisers advocate selecting price targets on the high and low end and sticking to them.
But others, including Mr. Taylor, are not fans of that sort of strategy, particularly in highly volatile markets.
"Price targets can get kicked off by a set of random actions in the market," he said. "The last thing you would want is to have that happen on a day like last Monday."

HEADLINE: THE MANIC MARKET: AN INVESTOR'S GUIDE;
A Sudden Breakout Of Mad-Bull Disease

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
SENSING that the stock market was displaying classic signs of manic-depression, Alfred Goldman, the director of market analysis for A. G. Edwards & Sons, counseled investors on Monday to remain bullish.
The "hysterical dumping of stocks" that caused the Dow Jones industrial average to plummet 554 points that day was fostered by fear, he believed, not by fundamentals like rising interest rates or a coming recession. "We just developed real depression among supposedly professional money managers who panicked," he said. 
 That diagnosis was quickly confirmed. On Tuesday, small investors seemed to respond in an almost Pavlovian way, buying and buying and buying some more. Professional investors followed suit, and in the largest single-point gain in its history, the Dow shot up 337 points on record New York Stock Exchange volume of 1.2 billion shares.
"The marketplace is made of human beings," Mr. Goldman said. "We tend to do things to extreme."
Whether the market will be euphoric, succumb to despair or simply stay put in coming weeks and months is anybody's guess. While tumult in Asia prompted the recent downturn, the speed and size of the decline -- as well as the rapidity of the rebound -- were clearly exaggerated.
"We repeatedly see big movements in price not motivated by big movements in fundamentals," said Richard H. Thaler, a professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago.
Indeed, though the market settled down later in the week, it appears particularly vulnerable right now to those time-honored investor emotions: greed and fear. With the Dow having nearly quadrupled over the last decade, and gaining 23 percent over the last year alone, many stocks are trading at lofty valuations, and the bull market seems somewhat long in the horn.
The 500 stocks that make up the Standard & Poor's index, for example, have a price-to-earnings ratio of about 23, compared with 16 two years ago. Stocks seem expensive, meaning that investors may be putting too much faith in the shares' future prospects. And many market watchers have been holding their breath in anticipation of a downturn.
"We are probably much more in a psychological phase in this market than we have been in years," said David Dreman, who chairs Dreman Value Management in Red Bank, N.J., and considers the market ripe for another scare.
But as the events of last week demonstrate, not all investors react in the same fashion. The so-called professional investors, those who manage billions of dollars for a living, are the ones that seem to spook the most easily. The small investor, on the other hand, may not be fearful enough. And both groups are more likely to make mistakes based on how they feel than on their analysis of the current economic environment.
At an extreme, markets suffer from what is known as tulip mania. Investors' unbounded enthusiasm drives prices to extraordinary levels -- just as it did in Holland in the 1600's, when tulip bulbs became all the rage. That market collapsed, tulips being tulips. The quick downfall of stocks in Hong Kong is just the latest example of this phenomenon.
While few market observers believe that the United States market resembles anything like Holland's of the 1600's, or even Hong Kong's today, emotion has played a large role in recent days. When big investors started bailing out of stocks on Monday, many were not worrying about whether the turmoil in Asia would damage the American economy or whether stocks were too pricey. They were worrying about being left behind.
The waves of selling that day seemed to occur because institutional investors were "trying to lock in performance numbers," said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. By selling before the market had a chance to drop further, they could protect the gains they had achieved earlier in the year and make sure they didn't place at the bottom of the pack when year-end comparisons were made with their peers.
Despite the conventional wisdom that small investors are like lemmings, they are, in fact, freer than the professionals to pursue independent strategies, however wise or ill considered. Their track record is not made public, after all, and they do not have to explain their actions to anyone -- except, perhaps, to an angry spouse or partner.
Professional investors "are more likely to behave like the herd," said Robert J. Shiller, an economics professor at Yale University. "It's damaging to their careers," he said, "if they do something different and they are wrong."
Many managers, seeing a market that had been drifting down since August suddenly go into free fall, may have also had the very human reaction of wanting to flee a stressful situation, according to Andrew W. Lo, a professor of finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And so they sold.
The so-called circuit breakers that twice halted New York Stock Exchange trading on Monday afternoon might have made the psychological situation worse, by allowing tension to build. Professor Lo likened the trading breaks to yelling "fire" in a crowded theater and then telling the crowd to sit there, think about the situation rationally and then file out neatly.
"It doesn't happen that way," he said.
What's more, professionals with sophisticated analytical tools and economic forecasts at their disposal probably make little use of them in crisis situations. "A day like Monday is so fundamentally inexplicable that there is no way a professional can do anything more than guess," Professor Shiller said.
BUT individual investors should be careful not to feel too smug. Just as professionals might have been guilty of some mindless selling on Monday, small investors might have been just as mindless in their eagerness to buy on Tuesday. In recent years, individuals have demonstrated what seems to be an unshakeable conviction that any market downturn is a buying opportunity, not the start of a possible crash or bear market.
"People have been in a bull market so long that they don't scare easily," said Eric T. Miller, chief investment officer for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Buying in any downturn, however, is not the lesson investors should learn from Tuesday's quick rebound, according to Professor Thaler and others. Diving into the market after a downturn will not always be richly rewarded. Investors "have always been right up until this point," Mr. Dreman warned. "Something will change." Bullish investors were in for a long and painful downward journey in 1929, for example.
The truth is that even the most seasoned professionals can never be sure what will happen next in the market. And bets are especially risky when panic is in the air.
"You never know," said Richard Strong, who heads his own multibillion-dollar mutual fund group in Milwaukee. As long as the domestic economy remains healthy, his strategy is to keep buying "until it is proven that it is a bear market."
As for individual investors, it's difficult to know what it would take to finally cause them to turn tail and join the scramble out the door. "We need a lot more than we had,' said John Reckenthaler, vice president of investment strategies for the John Nuveen Company, a money management firm in Chicago. "It took a long time to build this psychology. It's got to take a while to break down."
But bullish psychology does break down, and there are examples in recent years.
When the bond market began its horrible slide in late 1993, professional investors were the first to rush for the exits, Mr. Reckenthaler noted. But when small investors in bond funds got the bad news on their account statements, they joined the crowd. Their redemptions helped fuel the further beating that the fixed-income market took later in 1994 -- and many probably ended up selling just when interest rates had peaked and bonds had bottomed.
It's easy to say what investors should do in times like these. The wisest course of action is to ignore the hue and cry and concentrate on making sound investment decisions. Anticipating others' behavior and guessing when the market will reverse course, although a favorite pastime of market timers and momentum investors, is extraordinarily difficult.
"NO one ever gets the timing right," said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. By contrast, he said, people who buy stocks over the long haul are compensated for short-term volatility through their higher returns.
The trouble is, during a true panic, almost no one is immune to the fear. Even Mr. Goldman concedes that there could be times when he sounds the alert. "If there's panic all around you," he said, "I guess it's best to panic."
Those are the times when investors who are brave enough, or patient enough, to stay put should really celebrate -- right alongside those smart enough not to pile on their losses by buying on the way down.
But then, no one will feel like gloating.

HEADLINE: The World;
Prosperity's Traffic Jams Eastern Europe's Roads

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
THE Poles are having, but not really enjoying, a love affair with the car. It's not quite the same romance that Americans had when they cruised Main Street in the 50's in their new Chevys and Pontiacs.
All over Eastern Europe, but especially here in wealthier Poland, people are buying cars in an explosion of ownership that has come with better economic conditions and the growing acceptance of credit. But paying for the car is the easy part. 
 Unlighted, narrow rutted roads that served in Communist times as national thoroughfares are jammed with new cars (from deluxe BMW's to modest Fiats), old cars (from boxy Skodas to poky Ladas), transport trailers and, wandering along the side, horsecarts and pedestrians. These cavalcades of madness are made worse by drivers who fail to understand the link between accidents and driving while drunk. Every country in Eastern Europe is seeing a dramatic increase in the number of accidents and deaths.
From the curving mountain roads of Romania to the straight but narrow roads across the Hungarian plains, drivers speed and use poor judgment. As if trying to make up for the time lost under the Communists, when owning a car was a hard-to-come-by luxury, drivers view aggression behind the wheel as healthy.
Poles joke about how their affinity for riding fast horses three centuries ago has been transferred to speeding at the wheel of a new car. Police escort cars for Hungarian politicians were involved in so many high-speed accidents last year that there were calls for driver-education courses for what was supposed to be the country's elite driving squad.
In Poland, the number and severity of accidents have become a national concern, although the authorities acknowledge that little is being done about it.
Poland's national traffic office estimates that for every 100 accidents last year, 11 people were killed, compared with 1.5 deaths for every 100 accidents in Britain. Of the Eastern European nations, the Czech Republic was best with 5.5 deaths for every 100 accidents, just ahead of France.
The numbers also show the fatal connection between drinking and driving in Poland, where vodka is still common at business lunches and where a shot of plum brandy is easily had at a rural gas station before jumping into the car. Despite strict drunken-driving laws, in 1995 Poland, with a population only two-thirds as large as Britain's, had five times more accidents caused by drunken driving.
 
But They're Great at Parking
Despite the steady increase in traffic, the number of police officers patrolling the roads remains the same. In schools, driver education is almost nonexistent. Instead, primary-school students are taught basic road etiquette and how to ride a bicycle safely. Poland does require 20 hours of driving lessons at a commercial school to get a license, but the driving age was recently lowered to 17 from 18, and students at Warsaw's elite high schools nag parents to give them informal lessons sooner.
The driving examiners appear to have high standards -- but standards that seem to have no correlation with the erratic style of Polish driving. A monthly magazine, Warsaw Insider, recently warned foreigners taking the test for a Polish license not to be surprised if they failed, even if they had driven for many years in their own country. "Examiners have been known to measure parking skills with a ruler and fail applicants who can't reverse straight into a parking spot without braking," it said.
But it is not always drivers who cause the accidents. In the Romanian capital, Bucharest, one legacy of the Ceausescu regime is a lack of street lighting, and the city's pedestrians, long accustomed to streets without cars, often have no idea that they can't be seen. It can be so dark at night, said one Bucharest driver, Mihaela Paraschivescu, that she hunches forward over her steering wheel to peer through her windshield to insure she does not run over someone.
"Sometimes you just see legs crossing the street," she said. "Most of the time, you're just guessing that someone isn't moving out there."
A Polish truck driver, Krzysztof Lozinski, said peasants riding in horsecarts on the side of a road -- with no reflectors -- have so little idea of cars and distance that they often flick on a cigarette lighter, believing that is enough to warn drivers.
 
New Superhighways
A veteran driver who travels both main roads and back lanes, Mr. Lozinski tells hair-raising tales. "I've been witness to so many accidents it doesn't do anything to me," he said. Referring to body bags at accidents, he added, "I see black foil many dozens of times a year."
"There was a time when an accident would make an impression on you," Mr. Lozinski continued. "That was the time when you used your long lights and never turned them down. I still often pass bike riders without reflectors and people dressed in black with no torch."
In some places, there are the beginnings of road improvements. In Hungary, a highway now runs all the way from the Austrian border to the capital, Budapest. But many Hungarian drivers avoid the last stretch of the highway, which opened last year, because they say the tolls are too high. In the Czech Republic, a four-lane highway runs from Prague to the Slovak border.
Poland, the biggest country, boasts only one major highway, running 60 miles from Cracow to Katowice. It was built as a piece of good old-fashioned pork, ordered by the Communist leader of the country in the 70's, Edward Gierek, who came from the region.
In Poland, the police say the accident rate will increase until 2002. By then, some of an $8 billion superhighway system that is planned will be in place. And by then, there may be more traffic officers and, who knows, more practical driver education.

HEADLINE: Democracies That Take Liberties

BYLINE: By Fareed Zakaria; Fareed Zakaria is managing editor of Foreign Affairs. This is adapted from an article in its November-December issue.

 BODY:
The American diplomat Richard Holbrooke pondered a problem on the eve of the September 1996 elections in Bosnia, which were meant to restore civic life to the region. "Suppose the election was declared free and fair," he said, and those elected are "racists, fascists, separatists, who are publicly opposed to peace and reintegration . That is the dilemma."
Indeed it is, not just in the former Yugoslavia, but increasingly around the world. Democratically elected regimes, often ones that have been re-elected or reaffirmed through referendums, are routinely ignoring constitutional limits on their power and depriving their citizens of basic rights and freedoms. From Peru to the Palestinian Authority, from Slovakia to Sri Lanka, from Pakistan to the Philippines, we see the rise of a disturbing phenomenon in international life -- illiberal democracy. 
 It has been difficult to recognize this problem because for almost a century in the West, democracy has meant liberal democracy -- a political system marked not only by free and fair elections, but also by the rule of law, a separation of powers, and the protection of basic liberties of speech, assembly, religion and property. In fact, this latter bundle of freedoms -- what might be termed constitutional liberalism -- is theoretically different and historically distinct from democracy. Today the two strands of liberal democracy, interwoven in the Western political fabric, are coming apart in the rest of the world. Democracy is flourishing; constitutional liberalism is not.
Westerners are growing uneasy at the rapid spread of multiparty elections across south-central Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, perhaps because of what happens after the elections. Popular leaders like Russia's Boris Yeltsin and Peru's Alberto Fujimori bypass their parliaments and rule by presidential decree, eroding basic constitutional practices. Ethiopia's elected Government turns its security forces on journalists and political opponents, doing permanent damage to human rights (as well as human beings).
Naturally there is a spectrum of illiberal democracy, from modest offenders like Argentina to near tyrannies like Kazakstan and Belarus, with countries like Romania and Bangladesh in between. Along much of the spectrum, elections are rarely as fair as in the West today, but they do reflect the reality of popular participation in politics and support for those elected.
Freedom House's 1996-97 survey, "Freedom in the World," has separate rankings for political liberties and civil liberties, which correspond roughly with democracy and constitutional liberalism, respectively. Of the countries that lie between confirmed dictatorship and consolidated democracy, 50 percent do better on political liberties than on civil ones. In other words, half of the "democratizing" countries in the world today are illiberal democracies.
Until the 20th century, most countries in Western Europe were not democracies but rather liberal autocracies. The franchise was tightly restricted, and elected legislatures had little power. In 1830 Great Britain, in some ways the most democratic European nation, allowed barely 2 percent of its population to vote for one house of Parliament; that figure rose to 7 percent after 1867 and reached around 40 percent in the 1880's. Only in the late 1940's did most Western countries become full-fledged democracies, with universal adult suffrage.
But 100 years earlier, by the late 1840's, most of them had adopted important aspects of constitutional liberalism -- the rule of law, property rights and, increasingly, separated powers and free speech and assembly. For much of modern history, the "Western model" was best symbolized not by the mass plebiscite but the impartial judge.
Constitutional liberalism has led to democracy, but democracy does not seem to bring constitutional liberalism. In contrast to the Western path, during the last two decades in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia, dictatorships have given way to democracy with no intervening liberalization. The results are not encouraging. In the Western Hemisphere, with elections having been held in every country except Cuba, a 1993 study by the scholar Larry Diamond determined that 10 of the 22 principal Latin countries "have levels of human rights abuse that are incompatible with the consolidation of liberal democracy." In Argentina, President Carlos Saul Menem rules using presidential decrees and has proclaimed almost 300, more than all previous Argentine presidents put together, going back to 1853!
Elections have been held in most of the 45 sub-Saharan states of Africa since 1991 (18 in 1996 alone), and there have been many setbacks for freedom. The scholar Michael Chege surveyed the recent wave of democratization and wrote that the continent had "overemphasized multiparty elections" and "correspondingly neglected the basic tenets of liberal governance." In Central Asia, elections, even when reasonably free, as in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakstan, have resulted in strong executives, weak legislatures and judiciaries, and little freedom.
In the Islamic world, democratization has led to an increasing role for theocratic politics, eroding longstanding traditions of secularism and tolerance. In many parts of that world, like Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt and some of the Persian Gulf states, were elections to be held tomorrow, the resulting regimes would almost certainly be more illiberal than the ones now in place.
A proper appreciation of constitutional liberalism has a variety of implications for American foreign policy. First, it suggests a certain humility. While it is easy to impose elections on a country, it is more difficult to push constitutional liberalism on a society. The process of genuine liberalization and democratization is gradual and long-term; it is a process in which an election is only one step.
Hence, the absence of free and fair elections should be viewed as one flaw, not the definition of tyranny. Elections are an important virtue of governance, but they are not the only virtue. Economic, civil and religious liberties are at the core of human autonomy and dignity. If a government with limited democracy steadily expands these freedoms, it should not be branded a dictatorship.
Despite the limited political choice they offer, countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand provide a better environment for the life, liberty and happiness of their citizens than do illiberal democracies like Slovakia and Ghana. And the pressures of global capitalism can push the process of liberalization forward. Markets and morals can work together. Even China, which remains deeply repressive, has given its citizens more autonomy and economic liberty than they have had in generations.
 Today, in the face of a spreading virus of illiberalism, the most useful role that the international community and the United States can play is -- instead of searching for new lands to democratize -- to consolidate democracy where it has taken root and to encourage the gradual development of constitutional liberalism across the globe.
Democracy without constitutional liberalism is not simply inadequate, but dangerous, bringing with it the erosion of liberty, the abuse of power, ethnic divisions and even war. Eighty years ago, Woodrow Wilson took the United States into the 20th century with a challenge, to make the world safe for democracy. As we approach the next century, our task is to make democracy safe for the world.

HEADLINE: Dizzy Spell;
Confusion as an Economic Indicator

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
MONDAY was an awful day on Wall Street. Stock prices went straight down. Tuesday was wonderful. Prices went straight up. Wednesday, they went both ways and ended in the middle. If Wall Street were a person we'd think he was mentally ill.
The experts, as always, had easy explanations for the market's bizarre behavior and in hindsight the explanations seemed sensible. Stock prices, having gone too high, were overdue for a correction. A Southeast Asian currency crisis became the trigger for the 554-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average. Big traders rushed to sell and lock in profits. The little guy stayed put, and as soon as the market turned up on Tuesday -- thanks again to the big professional traders -- the little guy bought, too, showing his faith in stocks and helping the Dow average rise 337 points, more than ever in a single day. 
 But however reasonable the experts make it sound, what happened last week was wacky, wild, contradictory, confusing. The market is supposed to reflect, at least roughly, the well-being of the nation's economy. There can't be bad times and good times all at once.
Or can there?
In an uncanny way, the stock market's wild behavior seems to reflect the national state of mind. People are confused. Just as stock prices went two ways at once, millions of Americans find themselves holding in their heads, stressfully, two contradictory visions of the economy around them and of their own circumstances.
"One thing we have lost, that we had in the past, is a sense of progress, that things are getting better," said Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist at Princeton University who researches social and labor issues. "There is a sense of volatility, but not of progress. When people talk of the economy being strong, they don't seem to feel that they too are better off."
They see, for example, that the strong economy is creating more high-paying jobs, but they also believe low-paying jobs are proliferating even faster, said Guy Molyneux, a pollster at Peter Hart Research Associates. They see that the service sector is strong, but they think that for the United States and themselves to prosper, the nation must make things, must manufacture more.
"They don't trust selling services to one another," Mr. Molyneux said. "And they have some vague sense, even if they are earning well, that the rise in income inequality somehow hurts them."
The double vision of life in America touches down elsewhere. People are not as worried about downsizing as they were a year or two ago, some surveys show. They see that jobs are available. But they are also convinced that if they do lose their jobs, they probably won't find other work that pays as well, or even enough -- a perception that causes job insecurity even among people who have good earnings and tell pollsters they do not expect to be laid off themselves. Labor Department data confirm that this sense of things is accurate; only one-third of those who lose jobs end up making as much as or more than they did in their previous jobs.
Household income is rising, after six years of economic expansion, the Census Bureau reports. Family members are obviously earning more. That boosts spirits. But then comes the contrary reality: Most of the new income is not coming from raises but from longer hours on the job or more weeks at work.
"People are very aware that they are working harder and spending less time with the family," said Richard Sennett, a sociologist at New York University. "But the idea of having to lower their standards economically is very hard for most Americans to even contemplate."
On the positive side, home ownership is higher than ever, 66 percent of all households. But among people under 40, home ownership is declining because for them, houses are too expensive. Similarly, consumer spending has been robust, reflecting the strong American economy. People are busy buying out the stores. That is partly because something called personal disposable income -- the money people have left over after they pay their taxes -- has risen. That's positive.
But the wealthiest Americans, 20 or 30 percent of the population, have played a big role in bringing up the average. The rest, many of them, have done their shopping on credit, and consumer debt is at very high levels. The number of personal bankruptcies set a record in the year that ended June 30.
Nearly seven years of economic growth -- unusually strong in recent months, according to Government data released on Friday -- has wiped away the negative image of the United States as a second-string competitor, behind Germany and Japan. Americans seem once again on top, in autos, computers, machinery and other products, and much publicity on this point, particularly from corporate America, has fixed this competitive achievement in the public mind as a positive image.
But the running debate over how the nation got there nags at this image. Is the country more competitive because business has achieved a higher level of efficiency and productivity, one not yet evident in Government statistics? Or is it all a temporary achievement, likely to disappear when the United States enters its next recession, and the European and Japanese economies come out of their current doldrums?
"There is a double view out there," said Madeline Hochstein, president of DYG Inc., a public opinion polling firm. "People know and feel that all the economic indicators are good, but they also think they could turn bad at any moment."
Uncertain and confused, Americans are increasingly trying to be self-reliant, sociologists and pollsters report. They are trying to secure enough wealth to achieve economic independence, particularly for retirement or to pay for a child's college education or, through company stock purchase plans, to supplement their wages. And the rising stock market has become an important vehicle for reaching this goal, drawing in a growing percentage of American households.
"If you don't have that much confidence in your job, your salary or your benefits," Ms. Hochstein said, "you are relying on the stock market to guarantee your future. If it goes down, as it did Monday, you are going to make it go back up. People even come to think they have some control over the market, and after each decline in the past decade, it has gone back up and kept rising."
Eventually, stock prices are likely to go down -- much further than they did last Monday -- and stay down for a while, as they did in the mid-1970's. Not so many people owned stocks then, and a prolonged downturn was not so alien an experience just a generation after the Depression. People did not count so heavily on stocks to pay their way. And in the 70's no one would have thought of the recent cartoon that showed someone jumping out a window because he had failed to invest in stocks, missing the bull market.
"I am guessing, I don't have the data," said Humphrey Taylor, chairman of Louis Harris & Associates, a polling firm, "but when the stock market does finally go down substantially, the national mood will turn very gloomy. People will really be angry at Wall Street."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Holding the Chips, Tribes Naturally Play Politics

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
FROM the beginning of European settlement through the days of Custer to the militant American Indian Movement, Indian tribes have always been held out by mainstream American society as different: Sometimes better, more spiritual, more ecology minded and noble, and sometimes worse, more dissolute or lazy or dishonest. They have been symbols and backdrops on which America projected its values and prejudices.
But now, for the first time, Indians have become real players. Casino gambling -- conducted by about a third of the 557 tribes recognized by the Federal Government -- has finally given Indians the not-so-magical password that gets their concerns heard in the places where decisions are made: money. 

 
Campaign Financers
Last year the Democratic National Committee received $438,000, and its Republican counterpart $110,000, from just three tribes, the Oneidas of Wisconsin, the Sault Ste. Marie Chippewas of Michigan and the Mashantucket Pequots of Connecticut. Within some state legislatures, tribes wield huge power as distributors of campaign funds. Last year in Michigan, the Sault Ste. Maries spent $3.5 million on a campaign to expand gambling in Detroit.
Now in Washington, a Justice Department inquiry into whether the Interior Secretary, Bruce Babbitt, denied a gambling permit to one Wisconsin Indian tribe because of donations to the Democrats from rival tribes seeking to block it is cutting to the heart of these new Indian power relationships, while also resurrecting many of the old images, generalizations and prejudices.
What the lobbying by the Wisconsin tribes shows is that Indian tribes, when empowered to create their own images and push their own interests, can be just as mainstream and crass as any corporation. You spend money to protect your franchise and your interests. You elbow out anybody who might be looking too closely at your piece of the pie, Indian or not. You do what needs to be done and spare the pity. It's as gloriously American as watching Microsoft crush the life out of yet another upstart competitor.
 
Moral Ambiguities
On another level, of course, it is not the same at all. American Indians have emerged on the national political stage on the basis of a single economic engine, the only one that has ever really worked for large numbers of reservations. That can seem to narrow their political aims, or others' perception of those aims, to a single laser-beam issue: gambling. And gambling, however much Americans love to do it, is something about which they remain deeply ambivalent because of its long associations with organized crime and moral ruin.
The grand tribal entrance onto the political stage has been further complicated by the fact that more than a few of the Indian efforts have been directed by non-Indian gambling companies and foreign investors. The companies have used the tribes as vehicles to enter American markets that would otherwise be barred to them, while the tribes have used the companies to help finance efforts to gain Federal recognition, which opens many other doors besides gaming, or to build their casinos.
The relationships have nonetheless made the tribes easy targets for critics who argue that poor defenseless Indians are being used one more time by forces beyond their control, or that foreign influences are infiltrating the nation's political system.
Some critics of Indian gaming, like the Atlantic City casino owner Donald J. Trump, argue that tribes get special treatment in the industry because of the nation's guilt about past treatment of Indians. But many other people -- including legislators in Washington state who tried, unsuccessfully, to ban Indian political contributions by law this year -- suggest that Indians should be held to a higher standard.
Even supporters of broader political involvement by Indians say that when devastating Indian poverty still exists in places like Pine Ridge, S.D., the sight of wealthy tribes stifling their competitors can look a bit unseemly.
 
Brotherhood Is Just One More Myth
"American Indians now have the means to participate in the American political process, and that's positive," said Bill Thompson, a professor of public administration of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, who has written extensively about the gambling industry and is working on a book about American Indian political participation. "But it's got this blatant sense that says, 'We're ready to buy stuff, and we're going to defend our turf.' When you have Indians opposing Indians, it makes them look very selfish."
Indian leaders say that tribes competing with other tribes is a story far older than capitalism, or the appearance of the first European settlers on North American shores, and that attributing a spirit of national unity and brotherhood among sovereign tribal nations is just one more misperception among many.
But it does raise ticklish issues for groups like the National Indian Gaming Association, based in Washington D.C., which represents Indian gaming interests. In such cases, said the group's executive director, Timothy Wapato, it can't win -- and neither perhaps can non-Indian politicians. "In all cases, we try and stay out of any battle between sovereigns -- we don't belong in it," Mr. Wapato said. The Wisconsin case in particular, he added, is one in which the participants need to find their own way to a resolution or compromise.
"We should not get in there and say they should do this or that," Mr. Wapato continued. "And we don't believe that the Secretary of the Interior should take sides on that type of battle either."

How to Fix A Crowded World: Add People

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
IN the 200 years since Thomas Malthus published his "Essay on the Principle of Population" and threw a scare into the human race about the limits of the earth's resources, people everywhere have been asking: Are there too many of us?
This week, leading demographers from around the world will meet here to fret over a revolutionary new fear: Will there soon be too few of us? 
 The world's population, now at about 5.7 billion, is still growing. By the middle of the next century, it is likely to stand at about 9.4 billion. And although Malthus was way off the mark in predicting an early demographic disaster, there are still enough warning signs to keep neo-Malthusians busy. Last week, for example, a World Bank body joined the hardy band of worrywarts who foresee a world unable to feed all its people as crop lands and sea stocks diminish, harvest yields level off and water supplies dry up.
But for demographers, the problem lately is not absolute numbers of people and their pressures on the environment and natural resources. Now the experts are worried about what happens when population growth slows in a lot of places, or even stops entirely or declines in some. Fertility rates in many places are dropping rapidly, especially in the richest countries, where, to put it simply, any two people are not producing two more people.
If this trend continues it could have far-reaching consequences, demographers say. When more and more of the world's most highly industrialized and economically productive nations do not replenish their numbers, their role as engines of global growth -- both as producers and consumers of goods -- is thrown into doubt.
"These developed countries have a particularly important role because they provide a great deal of the economic leadership and social leadership," said Joseph Chamie, director of the United Nations population division, which organized the conference this week.
"They are, basically, the producer nations, the consumer nations and the donor nations," he said. "China today is exporting to whom? Basically to the United States and Europe, and that's helping the Chinese economy. Europe alone consumes a great deal and produces a great deal. If they start shrinking there will be a readjustment, and it will be global in its impact. It will affect the entire world economy."
Unlike dips in population growth throughout history, this slide -- which began in the 1960's -- was not caused by a natural or economic disaster, a war or plague. There is no Black Death to blame, no World War I, no Great Depression. This decline is widespread. It is steady. And while no demographer would say that predictions are infallible -- prognosticators have sure been wrong in the past, and humanity is of course adaptable -- the current decline shows no signs of reversing as earlier ones have.
Demographers believe that fundamental social changes explain the fact that people in more and more places are having fewer kids. The changes include urbanization -- there's less incentive to have a big family in the city -- and global migrations, in which men are typically separated from wives, and migrants are exposed to modernizing influences. And, of course, women have greater power over their own lives.
The declines are uneven, with the fertility rates of poorer nations slower to drop to the level that demographers say is needed simply to maintain a given nation's current population total -- 2.1 children per woman on average -- a level below which much of the industrialized world has already fallen.
The third world's higher fertility rates help explain why some developing countries with surplus labor have begun to campaign for the right of workers to migrate freely in search of jobs. As labor forces shrink in richer nations, it will be hard to keep them out, as Europe has tried to do with limited success. Meanwhile, waves of migrations from Europe -- the sort that largely shaped the modern world -- have ceased.
In the United States, where migration from the third world is high, the new arrivals have already changed American society, with fewer Europeans and more people from other regions crossing oceans and land borders in search of better times. The United States hovers just above the replacement fertility rate, but its population is growing more rapidly than those of other industrial nations because of immigration.
Europe was the first region to slide below the 2.1-children-per-woman replacement level -- that is, two new people to take the places of the mother and father, plus a little slack to account for childhood deaths. Italy has the world's lowest fertility rate, 1.2, followed by Spain and Germany at 1.3. Even Ireland, a country with a fertility rate of 3.55 in 1975, has seen its rate drop markedly, to 1.87 by 1995.
"Socially and economically, Ireland has changed substantially in recent decades," say James McCarthy and Jo Murphy-Lawless, who prepared a study for the conference here. They cite higher Irish education levels, a new, less isolationist world view fostered by membership in the European Union, economic growth and the eroding influence of the Roman Catholic Church.
In Italy, government officials foresee empty classrooms and thousands of unemployed teachers, with shortages of service industry workers and health-care personnel to care for older people. Politicians in a number of countries will have to factor in the numerical power and thus ballot-box clout of older citizens, who are often a conservative force. In the United States, older people heavily influence debates over the future of Social Security, Medicaid and the setting of other priorities in national budgets.
Several European and Asian governments are taking steps to fight the low-fertility trend. Italy has parliamentary committees looking into ways to make it easier for women to have careers and children simultaneously. France, while no longer awarding medals for motherhood, does pay child allowances and provides a range of help for families willing to grow. Sweden, South Korea and Malaysia have created incentives also, and Singapore set up a bureaucracy to figure out ways to bring singles together.
Ryuichi Kaneko of Japan's National Institute of Population and Social Security Research says Japan's economy will have to adapt to a smaller labor force. Japan faces not only a change in population structure but also its size. By the time its fertility rate levels off in 2007, Japanese society will be older on average than most European populations, and the nation's population will see a steady decline in numbers for the first time in its history.
Worldwide, the number of countries with below-replacement fertility in 1970 was 19, almost all in Europe or North America. By 1995, there were 51 countries on the below-replacement chart, with new arrivals including nations of east and southeast Asia, the Caribbean and Eastern Europe. By 2015, demographers estimate, 88 of the world's more than 180 countries and territories will have replacement levels at or below 2.1 children per woman.
 
Exceptions
Exceptions to the trend are found in Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, some areas of the Middle East, South Asia and West Asia. Pakistan, for example, is likely to be the world's third most populous country by 2050 unless it can trim its high growth rate. By then neighboring India, with its laissez-faire family planning policy, will likely outstrip China in population to rank first, while the United States will be fourth. But some demographers think it is only a matter of time before the forces of change are felt even in the poorest countries.
"As in other spheres of global international life, there seem to be powerful globalizing forces at work pushing towards fertility reduction," says Jean-Claude Chesnais of the National Institute of Demographic Studies in Paris. He thinks historical patterns may offer little as a guide. "The future is not a simple replication of the past," he wrote in a paper for the conference this week. "Present societies are much more complex than ancient ones."
Mr. Chamie thinks something more fundamental may be in the air. In preoccupations with subjects as diverse as threats to the global environment or the reproductive rights of women, he said, "we have talked fertility down."

HEADLINE: A Modest Proposal: Give Me a (Tax) Break

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI 

 BODY:
MAYOR GIULIANI, you're brilliant. Like a late-night infomercial host, you have shown me the path to financial freedom. And that path leads to New Jersey.
On Friday, you announced that Reuters, the British media company, would receive a $26 million tax break over 23 years to keep its United States headquarters, and its 1,800 employees, in New York, with the promise the company would add 2,348 more jobs in the future. Why? Because it threatened to move to New Jersey. Reuters isn't the only one. Standard & Poor's, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and NBC have all received city tax breaks after pining for the Garden State. 
 Sounds like easy money. It makes you wonder if such a threat could work on a personal level. I am an editor for The New York Times (which got tax incentives for relocating a printing plant within the city), but I live in Connecticut. If I threaten to move to New Jersey, will my state reduce my taxes to get me to stay? I bet not. This is the state whose idea of a tax break was shaving 3 cents off its gasoline tax, the highest in the nation. That should save me $11.70 this year, barely enough for gas to go house-hunting in New Jersey.
But after talking it over with an accountant, I think this strategy is worth a try. It turns out that I, too, am a potent economic force. So I'm putting myself out to bid. Either Connecticut cuts me a tax deal or I'm outta here, off to New Jersey, New York or wherever they understand that people are as valuable as corporations.
This is not an empty threat. My household controls not one, but two jobs. My wife and I pay state income taxes; last year the bill was $10,000. We are homeowners and pay $6,000 in property taxes. Last year we spent tens of thousands of dollars on items subject to Connecticut's 6 percent sales tax. That's another $3,000 in taxes, and who knows how many jobs our spending sprees helped support? We paid $300 in gas taxes. We also pay government fees for our driver's licenses and an annual fee to use the beach. Even the dog has a license.
Just as companies are considered good corporate citizens if they donate time and money to their communities, we also contribute. We help serve at the local soup kitchen, give money to our church and buy all the silly things our children sell for their school.
There are also the intangibles. I cut my grass, bring doughnuts for the kids' soccer teams and use my turn signals when I drive. My well-behaved children lend an aura of good manners to the state. We are fine ambassadors when we travel. "Such nice people from New Jersey," the French, whom we plan to visit, could say. "We had no idea." How do you put a value on that?
Let me try. Like a corporation, I have a future value as a breadwinner for my government. I am 45 and plan to work for the next 20 years. As my income rises, so will my taxes. As my house increases in value, so will its tax assessment. As my four children grow, so will my expenses, and thus the sales taxes I pay. And my children will become consumers, take jobs and, God forbid, own a car someday. And the jackpot will come when it's time for college and we cash in our stocks and 401(k) plans to pay the bills. That will result in such a huge capital gains tax that it will make me weep.
 
A 20-Year Revenue Stream
Nancy Masten, a state and local tax expert with the accounting firm Ernst & Young, said Connecticut would be foolish to let me go.
Ms. Masten estimates that over the next 20 years, my wife and I will bring almost half a million dollars in revenue to the state we call home. That includes $235,000 in income taxes and $72,000 in sales taxes. Even if the assessments for my house never increase, I will pay $120,000 in property taxes. And, like a corporation that promises future growth, I can promise a revenue stream from my four children, which Ms. Masten said is good for another $90,000. When inflation is factored in, the total value of my family is $1.18 million over the next 20 years.
Ms. Masten says that to stay put, I should ask for a tax break of $500,000, paid out over the first five years of a 20-year contract. Or to keep things simple, I could just ask for $25,000 a year for 20 years.
I can't see how Connecticut can say no. It just recently agreed to give the Zurich Centre Group, an insurance and financial services company that had been in New York, $190 million in tax credits to move its 400 employees to Stamford. That's $475,000 for each worker. I'll give it six workers for $500,000.
We'll see how it goes. I've alerted my family to keep the phone clear so we can field the offers. Already, my 10-year-old is doing the calculations. "Daddy," Marian asked, "will my allowance go further in New Jersey?"
We may soon find out.

THE BUDGET
That Dissolving Deficit
From time immemorial, it seems, the Federal deficit has been growing and worsening, like some malicious creature from a horror movie. Politicians have railed against it. Upstanding Americans, Puritan in economic theory if not in practice, have been distressed -- even if Keynesians said not to worry. Now, suddenly, the deficit is almost gone. It fell to $22.6 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the lowest since $6.1 billion in 1974, as the strong economy brought a surge in tax revenue, Administration officials said. That is a stunning figure, considering that the Administration began the year expecting a deficit of $128 billion. As a percentage of output, less than three-tenths of a percent, it is well below that of any other industrialized nation. Washington's next row presumably will be over what to do with the surpluses expected at the end of the current fiscal year. 

THE ECONOMY
Shhh! Inflation's Still Asleep
The latest economic figures reinforced the picture of an economy with gathering strength, untroubled by inflation. Gross domestic product grew at an unexpectedly high 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Sales of new single-family homes were strong, although down two-tenths of a percent, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000 in September. New weekly claims for unemployment insurance fell by 16,000, to a seasonally adjusted 297,000, the lowest since late July. And the Federal Reserve found steady prices and little wage pressure in a nationwide survey. However, new orders for durable goods fell six-tenths of a percent in September.
 
INTERNATIONAL
The China Trade
President Clinton and Jiang Zemin, China's President, held unexpectedly contentious talks that nevertheless produced significant commercial agreements. China agreed to buy $3 billion worth of civilian aircraft from Boeing and to make concessions, clearing the way for American companies to bid on commercial nuclear power contracts in China potentially worth $60 billion. . . . In London, Tony Blair's Labor Government ruled out joining the first wave of nations to sign up for a single European currency in January 1999 but said participating in the monetary union was a long-range ambition. Very long range -- it will not be acted upon until after the next election. . . . The United States committed $3 billion to aid Indonesia, the first direct American contribution to restore financial stability in Southeast Asia. The I.M.F. is committing $15 billion.
 
PEOPLE
Wow! News Gets New Top Ed
The Daily News, the press's quintessential New York street tough, named its fourth editor in chief in less than five years. She is Debby Krenek, below, a 41-year-old Texan who came to the tabloid a decade ago and has risen steadily through the ranks. She is the first woman in the paper's 77-year history to win the top newsroom job. . . . Silicon Graphics, which lost money in seven of its last eight quarters, said Edward R. McCracken, its chairman and chief executive, would step down as chief as soon as a successor could be found. The maker of computer work stations and servers also said it would cut 700 to 1,000 jobs worldwide. . . . Ronald T. LeMay quit as chairman and chief executive of Waste Management Inc. on Wednesday, the second chief to leave the troubled trash hauler in nine months. Its stock tumbled 20 percent on Thursday. He returned to Sprint, as president.
 
DEALS
Power to the Doctors
Phycor Inc., a physician management company, said it would acquire Medpartners Inc., a much larger rival, for $6.8 billion in stock. The deal would create the largest company in the field and give doctors more power as they negotiate with H.M.O.'s. . . . National Australia Bank Ltd. agreed to buy Homeside Inc., one of the largest home mortgage companies in the United States, for $1.23 billion in cash. . . . Rolls-Royce Motor Cars P.L.C., a symbol of British elegance, was put up for sale by its owner, Vickers P.L.C., and will almost certainly fall into foreign hands -- perhaps BMW, Ford, Fiat or Daimler-Benz. . . . Intel and Digital Equipment settled their bitter suits against each other. Intel will buy Digital's chip-making operations for $700 million and pay the computer maker royalties. . . . Proffitt's Inc., a regional retailer, agreed to buy Carson Pirie Scott & Company for $790 million in stock.
 
DOWNSIZING
Your Civic, Mr. Chairman
Is it just the usual cost-cutting, or has corporate America realized that conspicuous consumption is tres gauche? The 1,500-member National Limousine Association reports that the stretch limousine, a favored symbol of executive success in the 1980's, has yielded to a commodious sedan equipped with a phone and a reading light. Boston Coach, for example, operator of one of the nation's largest limousine fleets, is replacing its Chryslers with up to 6,000 Volvos. But could this be just an interim move? Honda Civics are masterpieces of engineering.
 
RETAIL
Less Cheer This Christmas
Time was that Christmas made up for a year of retailing mistakes. No more. After holiday sales declined in the last two years, and some $9.5 billion shifted away from the season or evaporated altogether between 1988 and 1996, the nation's merchants are lowering their expectations this year. Of course, sellers of luxury goods, like Neiman-Marcus or Tiffany, may still dream of a green Christmas. Affluent Americans are eagerly buying new sport utility vehicles and are spending more on dining out and entertainment -- pick-me-ups after long hours at work. But fewer dollars are going into gifts of home furnishings and clothing. So sleigh bells may ring, but the echo at the cash register is subdued.
 
INVESTMENTS
H.M.O., Heal Thyself
Oxford Health Plans, which analysts had praised as an industry model for holding down costs while satisfying patients, said it was losing money. It fell behind in billing customers and underestimated what it owed doctors and hospitals. With the stock market on the skids, Oxford's shares led the way, losing 62.4 percent of their value on Monday and ending the week at $25.8125 on Nasdaq. . . . A much stronger investment, it seems, might have been a Beanie Baby, the tiny sought-after stuffed animals that children, and some adults, love to collect. Peanut the Elephant, introduced in 1995 at $4.95 and retired within months by its maker Ty Toys, has sold for a record $2,200.
 
COLA WARS
A Punch From Pepsi
Coca-Cola's new chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, below, who succeeded the late Roberto Goizueta, sounded a conciliatory note toward Coke's industry rivals. Addressing the National Soft Drink Association, he announced no changes in company strategy and sought to reassure investors of the company's soundness. But the next day, his counterpart at Pepsico, Craig E. Weatherup, was feistier, promising new ad spending and a renewed competitiveness. Referring pointedly to a 1994 speech in which Mr. Ivester called Coke's executives wolves, he vowed to build Pepsi's house "brick by methodical brick" and recalled that the piglet who did that in "The Three Little Pigs" ate the wolf.

HEADLINE: Big, if Not Quick, Rewards From College Internships

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Glamorous Internships With a Catch: There's No Pay" (Earning It, Oct. 19): 
 There is no catch to engaging in a new and interesting learning experience without being paid. Call it delayed compensation if you must, but the payback from a well-chosen and properly managed internship is both immediate and long-term, a permanent enhancement of each student's life experience.
In our society, most students pay for the privilege of learning -- in college, for example, or for music, dancing, tennis, judo or computer lessons. Internships provide similar learning opportunities free. How much the students benefit from such situations is largely up to them.
Historically, young boys and girls competed for apprentice positions with skilled craftsmen who imparted their talents to the next generation and often provided the apprentices with a lifelong sinecure in a prominent guild of goldsmiths, shipbuilders, cabinetmakers or clock workers. Beyond acquiring a financially rewarding or secure skill, the apprentice acquired a sponsor (in today's language, a contact), a reputation (a network) and an opportunity to find personal expression through the individual creative process (gratification). All of these are important components of an appropriate internship today.
Does exploitation exist? Probably, in a few instances, but the student always has the option of demanding more meaningful work or walking away from the job. Does the student receive more than he or she gives? From whose perspective? As the article notes, many companies might not hire these students after graduation if not for their internship experience. For students, almost any effort is worth the practical experience and a solid entry for a resume.
Thousands of New York University students take advantage of internship opportunities in this city. Perhaps that explains why more than 98 percent of them get good jobs within their first year out of college.

HEADLINE: Indonesia Closes Troubled Banks as Part of Economic Bailout

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Indonesia closed 16 shaky banks today, one day after the International Monetary Fund offered a multibillion-dollar program to stabilize the nation's economy.
Finance Minister Marie Muhammad said the Government would reimburse up to $5,555 in each account, an amount that would fully repay 94 percent of depositors. 
 Reform of the financial and banking sector was one of the key areas in the package announced on Friday by the Government and the I.M.F.
Mr. Marie said at a news conference today, "These banks are insolvent to the point of endangering business continuity, disturbing the overall banking system and harming the interests of society."
There was no indication of the number of deposits involved or the size of debt of the 16 banks, which were closed with immediate effect.
 Political analysts said the authorities were concerned about the possibility of social unrest as austerity is coupled with rising prices and unemployment, especially in urban areas on the island of Java, home to 60 percent of the country's 200 million people.
In his statement, Mr. Marie appealed to "all members of society to remain calm" during reform of the banking system.
State Secretary Moerdiono, who like many Indonesians uses one name, said that the Government would announce further deregulation moves on Monday. Banking officials said these would focus on trade and production sectors, and include tariff cuts to stimulate exports.
On Friday, the managing director of the fund, Michel Camdessus, announced $10 billion in assistance to Indonesia, along with $4.5 billion from the World Bank and $3.5 billion from the Asian Development Bank.
"These measures should restore confidence in the Indonesian economy and contribute to the stabilization of regional financial markets, and I hope beyond," he said.
Indonesia said it expected a fall in economic performance over the coming two years but hoped to return to 7 percent annual growth by 2000.
Singapore and Japan each pledged $5 billion today to supplement the fund's assistance, and the United States has agreed to $3 billion as a backup, while Malaysia and Australia have offered $1 billion each.
The total amount available far exceeds the $17.2 billion made available to restore Thailand's economy earlier this year. Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a political analyst, said President Suharto's acceptance of the package indicated pragmatism on his part, and confidence that his legacy of economic expansion would be preserved. "His reputation was on the line," she said. "He wants to go down as the President who pushed Indonesia out of poverty."
The Central Bank president, Sudradjad Djiwandono, said on Friday that the Government would liquidate banks that were beyond rescue. "Unhealthy banks will follow a process of acquisition or merger," he said. "But banks that cannot be rescued will be liquidated."
In a study in June, the World Bank identified the banking industry as the weakest part of the Indonesian economy and said that restoring it was the key to a healthy economy.
"At that time the World Bank's leverage was very little," a financial analyst said. "But now, after the package, it can insure that these reforms are pushed through."
Indonesia sought assistance from the monetary fund and other agencies early in October after months of turmoil in its financial markets.
Its currency has depreciated some 30 percent against the dollar since regional currency became more volatile in July. The stock market index has shed some 32 percent over the same period.

HEADLINE: In Colombia, Support Grows for a Candidate With a Hard Line

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Last year, after the Colombian Congress cleared President Ernesto Samper of charges that drug smugglers had financed his presidential campaign, a group of rural leaders who were convinced that no legal way remained to end the turbulence gripping Colombia turned to Gen. Harold Bedoya, commander of the armed forces.
Would he consider taking power in a coup? 
 General Bedoya said he was reluctant, and turned down the proposal.
Now, General Bedoya, whose candidate's resume calls him "Our Commander," is campaigning to become President through, he said, "a coup at the ballot box" in next June's presidential election. And with the disarray in the country visibly spreading, most recently when leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary groups made a battleground of regional elections, General Bedoya's popularity ratings have surged.
In the two months since he declared his candidacy after he was forced out of the military, General Bedoya's support has grown from 12 to 20 percent, according to polls.
A survey that his own campaign financed places him just behind President Samper's most loyal ally -- Horacio Serpa, the fiery, anti-American former Interior Minister, who was favored by 25 percent of the electorate.
The General is bucking the traditional party structure, which is critical in financing publicity, political back-scratching and getting out the vote. But the traditional Liberal and Conservative parties have lost favor with voters.
If ever there was an election in which outsiders could take the presidency without the party machinery, this is it.
While other candidates are tripping over each other to offer proposals for peace with the leftist guerrillas who are active in about 40 percent of Colombia's 1,071 municipalities, General Bedoya takes another view. He says the only peace to be had is through defeating the guerrillas outright and bringing law and order to Colombia, a country where more than 99 percent of reported crimes do not end in convictions.
The general calls Colombia "a criminal state," saying that its laws promote crimes by making numerous allowances for culprits.
At the same time, General Bedoya denies the reports of torture, murder and forced disappearances by the military and paramilitary units, who back the Government.
Colombian and foreign human rights organizations say that these units were protected by the military under General Bedoya's leadership.
He says the groups, like Human Rights Watch-Americas and Amnesty International "are allies of the guerrillas" and called their accusations "lies." He also criticized the United States State Department, which also reports on torture and assassinations by the military and paramilitaries.
"The Department of State also is politicized," General Bedoya said. "I say to them: 'Who was raped? Who was tortured?' They say, 'The nongovernmental organizations told us.' So they recycle lies, and they send that to the Department of State."
In fact, the annual State Department report examines cases in the offices of the Colombia attorney general along with those raised by human rights groups.
General Bedoya said that if elected, he would appeal to the United States "for understanding" on trade, because United States and European pressure to open Colombian markets to agricultural imports is destroying the rural economy here, he said.

HEADLINE: Rising Fires Renew Threat to Amazon

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 28

 BODY:
In Porto Velho in western Brazil, thick clouds of black smoke have forced airports and schools to shut down. In southern Para state near the Amazon frontier, people gasping for air have collapsed and ended up in hospitals. In the city of Manaus, the sun has disappeared for days at a time.
Twenty years after the goal of rescuing the Amazon rain forest first captured world attention, becoming the pet cause of celebrities and a regular topic in children's schoolbooks, deforestation and the burning of vast areas are again climbing. 
 Data in recent weeks suggest that the burning going on in Brazil this year is greater than what has occurred in Indonesia, where major cities have been smothered under blankets of smoke that spread to other countries.
Despite the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to save the rain forest, burnings in the Amazon region are up 28 percent over last year, according to satellite data, and 1994 deforestation figures, the most recent available, show a 34 percent increase since 1991.
"Deforestation has done nothing but go up," said Stephen Schwartzman of the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit group based in Washington. "Where the most money has gone is where the fires have increased the most." The group noted that half the fires recorded this year were in Mato Grosso, where the World Bank lent $205 million to save the rain forest in a natural resource management program.
Roughly a fifth of the fires that rage annually between June and October cause new deforestation, and another tenth is burning of ground cover in virgin forests.
Scientists now say that the Amazon rain forest may be reaching a critical level of dryness, in which standing forest could catch fire and burn out of control. A report by the Environmental Defense Fund warned the Amazon "may be edging closer to catastrophic fire events," and predicted "potentially enormous global consequences."
The World Wildlife Fund found that 93 percent of the original Atlantic rain forest in the northeast had disappeared over the centuries, and some 12 to 15 percent of the Amazon rain forest.
The report said that Brazil was losing more rain forest each year than any other country on the planet. In addition to the 5,800 square miles a year that satellite images show are deforested each year, the Woods Hole Research Institute estimates that another 4,200 are thinned through logging beneath the forest canopy.
Eduardo Martins, the president of the Brazilian federal environmental agency, said in an interview that the increase in fires, while worrisome, did not result in an increase in deforestation, although the two problems have risen in tandem. He contended that most fires were set by small farmers who would starve if they could not clear land for planting, and that the environmental damage paled next to fossil fuel emissions in the United States.
Beneath the noxious haze covering much of Brazil every burning season is an opaque, often contradictory, Government policy toward the environment. "Properly speaking, we still don't have a policy, but we have a start," Mr. Martins told a Brazilian news magazine earlier this year.
Lacking enforcement muscle, the Government environmental agency ultimately collects only 6.5 percent of the fines it imposes. The rest are thrown out in court.
In a recent interview, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso acknowledged that the agency needed more money and muscle. A bill to strengthen it, stalled in Congress since 1991, passed the Senate this year. It is now idling in the House, where the Federation of Industries is lobbying against it on the ground that threats of cash fines and prison will open the way for corruption.
For now, not surprisingly, the agency is usually ignored by the people it is supposed to monitor. While permits are required for burning, the agency has reportedly issued licenses to clear a total of only about 24,700 acres this year -- an area seemingly far smaller than what would produce the dense clouds of smoke that have appeared over several states. Mr. Martins disputed that permits were issued for only such an area, but his office declined to provide other figures.
While even poorly enforced measures and licensing procedures are intended to deter deforestation, until recently other Government statutes deemed cleared forest to be "an improvement on the land," which meant it was less likely to be considered unproductive and seized for agrarian reform. If the owner sold it for Government redistribution to peasants, burning and planting paid off in higher compensation. Mr. Martins said that is changing now.
But the pace of destruction appears to be dictated more by the marketplace than by any Government measure. The demand in Europe and the United States for hardwoods like mahogany, used for furniture, has ushered in large illegal logging operations throughout the Amazon.
A report by the Federal Secretary of Strategic Affairs, recently disclosed in the Brazilian press, said that 80 percent of all logging in the Amazon is illegal.
The Government appears caught between largely international pressure to reduce the amount of burning and deforestation, and powerful domestic lobbies from the logging industry, farmers and large landholders. It is building several major roads that will cut into the Amazon, and a $1.2 billion state-of-the-art surveillance project will soon locate minerals, ores, and other natural resources hidden beneath the forest canopy.
The Amazon surveillance project could also provide current information on deforestation, but ecologists are wary, for the Brazilian Government has been in no hurry to analyze the data it has already. After years of saying that deforestation was on the decline, last year the Government released deforestation figures for the first time in four years -- showing the 34 percent increase.
The Government tried to diminish criticism by announcing measures to reverse the trend. It increased the share that each landowner in the rain forest was barred from burning from 50 to 80 percent, and announced a moratorium on new licenses for logging mahogany and another hardwood, virola.
But field reviews by the environmental monitoring agency show that the conditions of its permits are routinely ignored. And once again, the figures of deforestation since 1994 are late. "The scene in general is one of rampant illegal logging," said Robert J. Buschbacher, conservation director of the World Wildlife Fund-Brazil.
The Government has also fought successfully to keep mahogany off a list that would have subjected the licenses for logging it to outside monitoring and established targets to reduce exports. It argued that globally mahogany is not an endangered species, even though domestically it is considered one.
Mr. Martins said his Government opposed the move because it was sponsored by the United States, which he considered "hypocritical," since America provides much of the market for hardwood furniture. He said that Brazil had seized hundreds of thousands of illegally cut logs, which he said the Government plans to use for low-income housing and public buildings.
A recent study by the Amazon Environmental Research Institute estimated that for every acre that shows up as cleared and burned in satellite images, another partly burned or logged acre goes undetected beneath the forest canopy.
Daniel C. Nepstad, president of the Amazon institute and a scientist at the Woods Hole Research Institute, said such burning and logging make the forest more vulnerable to fire and means a 50 percent greater likelihood of deforestation.
For the first time in 14 years, as part of his research, he was able to set fire to virgin rain forest, he said. Though he quickly put it out, the lesson was important: Until now, a moist root system and dense vegetation had made it virtually impossible to set fire to a primary forest.
"With logging it becomes more flammable," said Philip M. Fearnside, an ecology professor at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon. "So the fires can escape and go into the forest."

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: FLORENCE, Colo.

 BODY:
A few miles from the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," the maximum security Federal prison where Timothy J. McVeigh spends 23 hours a day in an isolation cell, a cheery billboard beckons tourists: "Stop and do time with us. Colorado Territorial Prison Museum and Park. Historical, Educational, Exciting."
Eight miles down U.S. 50, at Canon City, a gray souvenir T-shirt proudly proclaims in red lettering: "Corrections Capital of the World -- Fremont County." 
 While local boosterism can lead to exaggeration, 18 percent of Fremont County's 40,000 residents are involuntary guests of the "Graybar Hotel": 7,150 inmates in 13 prisons, 4 of them Federal and 9 state.
As prisons emerged as a growth industry in the 1990's, this county, nationally known as the home of the magnificent Royal Gorge, illustrates a modern trend -- using prisons as a tool for rural development.
Nationwide, the number of beds in state and Federal penitentiaries increased 43 percent, to 976,000, in the first half of the 1990's, according to a Justice Department survey released in August. And prison employment jumped 31 percent, to 347,320.
A variety of economically pressed small communities, disregarding the stigma traditionally attached to the label "prison town," have opened their doors to prison construction in recent years, ranging from Hobbs, N.M., to Tupper Lake, N.Y., to South Bay, Fla., to Beeville, Tex.
In a measure of prison pride, museums have sprouted up. Every year, about 15,000 tourists troop through Canon City's museum, located below the looming gray walls of Colorado's oldest prison, the Territorial Correctional Facility, built in 1871 and still operating. Just inside the gate, visitors encounter a deactivated, lime-green gas chamber.
Likewise, Leavenworth, Kan., beckons tourists with a billboard: "How about doin' some TIME in Leavenworth?" The local convention and visitors bureau uses a new slogan: "You don't have to be indicted to be invited."
Ruth M. Carter, an 81-year-old who serves as Mayor of Canon City, said, "We have a nice, nonpolluting, recession-proof industry here." With local coal mines closing and ranches limping, the prisons of Fremont County filled the vacuum, employing 3,100 men and women. Here, prisons are simply called "the industry."
For this industry, Canon City has always been a company town. In the 19th century, when Colorado's territorial legislators decided to give the capital to Denver and the university to Boulder, they gave the prison to Canon City. The trend has continued.
The four Federal prisons that opened since 1994 just south of Florence have brought a flood of jobs and new residents. The four adjoining institutions employ slightly more than 1,000 workers, with an average salary of about $30,000. At the maximum-security prison where Mr. McVeigh is incarcerated, there is almost one employee for every inmate.
"We as a community are doing better and better," Mrs. Carter said of the influx of workers, adding, "They are buying and renovating houses that I would have bulldozed."
A former juvenile probation officer, Mrs. Carter recently traveled to Odessa, Tex., to preach the benefits of prisons for ailing rural towns.
"I told them that you are worrying that your grandmothers, your mothers, your daughters are going to be raped and sodomized," said Mrs. Carter, who lives in a cottage, surrounded by her cats, cactus plants and collection of cut crystal. " 'No sirree,' I told them. 'When those people get out of prison, they are getting out of town as fast as they can.' "
Jail breaks have been infrequent in the 125 years that Fremont County has been Colorado's corrections capital. Two convicted killers cut through two fences at a medium-security prison outside Canon City on Wednesday night. One was recaptured on Thursday afternoon, but another remained at large Friday night.
Lulled by a sense of security, the beauty of the region's mountains and canyons, and the Arkansas River Valley's mild winters, Fremont County is attracting retirees.
Here in Florence, where there is now one prisoner for every free citizen, an upscale housing development centered on a golf course is being built just over a knoll from the prison where Mr. McVeigh awaits his appeal of a death sentence for the Oklahoma City bombing.
For esthetics, a forest-green, Colorado lodge-style roof tops off the beige walls of Mr. McVeigh's prison, officially the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility, also known as ADX. The highest security prison in the United States, it has replaced a penitentiary in Marion, Ill., which itself replaced Alcatraz decades ago.
For Mr. McVeigh's protection, he lives in a 7-by-12-foot cell, isolated from the 407 other prisoners, who include some of the nation's most violent convicts. Almost two-thirds of the inmates are here because they attacked or tried to attack guards or other prisoners elsewhere.
For security reasons, there is no group dining, exercise, work or religious services. Each inmate has an in-cell shower stall with flood-proof plumbing controlled by guards. The bed, desk, stool and bookcase are made of reinforced concrete, anchored in place. Meals are served through a slot in the cell door.
While some communities might see such a prison as the societal equivalent of a nuclear waste dump, Fremont County fought hard for the $60 million penitentiary complex that holds Mr. McVeigh.
"When I first came here, in 1984, the city was in a depression," said John Lemons, a reporter for the Canon City Daily Record. "There were empty stores on Main Street; unemployment was 11 percent. The R.O.T.C. commander said he had great luck recruiting here."
Residents were so eager to lure a Federal prison that they massed on Canon City's Main Street for the TV cameras of "Good Morning America" and held up a banner reading: "We want a Federal prison! Fremont County, Colo."
To further impress Federal officials, county residents raised $125,000, bought 600 acres in Florence and donated the site to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
"The Bureau of Prisons was accustomed to having to muscle into a county," said George R. Turner, director of Canon City's Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Turner, who lobbied for even more prison construction here, added: "Here, they found a community that said, 'We want you and we will give you the land.' "
Today, Main Street is bustling and unemployment is 4 percent.
The Federal money has allowed Fremont County to look the other way as state legislators, seeing prisons as a tool for economic development, turn their attention to the state's eastern plains.
As late as 1985, there were no major state prisons outside Fremont County. But in the last decade, Colorado, which jails its citizens at well below the national rate, has seen its prison population triple, to about 13,000 inmates today. By the year 2000, there will be 8,240 prison beds on the eastern plains, more than in all of Fremont County. These new prisons will allow Colorado to bring home the 1,500 inmates it houses out of state.
A mix of state and privately run facilities, the new prisons are giving new life to a far-flung archipelago of aging farming towns: Brush, Burlington, Las Animas, Olney Springs, Ordway, Ramah, Sterling and Walsenburg.
In coming years, Eastern tourists heading to Colorado's booming mountain resort towns will fly over a growing network of what one Denver wag calls "Big Houses on the Prairie."

HEADLINE: Amtrak Is Fighting Off a Walkout

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Almost every afternoon for the last week, a group of union leaders, Transportation Department officials, Amtrak managers and members of Amtrak's Board of Directors have gathered in the office of the Transportation Secretary for discussions that lasted into the early morning hours, with occasional breaks for take-out Chinese food.
On the surface, the issue is a contract dispute with 2,300 members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, who have been without a contract for three years and have been threatening to strike, their newest deadline being 12:01 A.M. next Thursday. That strike would close down the Northeast Corridor from Boston to Washington and hundreds of long-distance trains east of the Mississippi, and could interfere with commuter service in Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and Washington. 
 But Amtrak is facing four other impasses. One concerns $3.2 billion in capital funds set aside by Congress but not yet released, and the others are operating funds, layoff protections and rules on liability. Amtrak needs to solve this entire set of problems if it is to keep operating over the next few weeks, and get off its current path, which is a financial decline that seems certain to bankrupt it within a year or two.
But some of those disputes go unresolved not because of problems with the beleaguered railroad itself, but because of political debates unrelated to Amtrak.
The House, for example, could not pass an Amtrak bill this week because the railroad was caught in the middle of an argument between conservative Western Republicans and more moderate members from the East on a grazing bill that would make it easier for landowners to sue the Federal Government over changes in land-use regulations. The Westerners, angered at their Eastern colleagues' votes on those bills, opposed the Amtrak legislation.
The situation will take on an added urgency because Congress, which has the power to solve the entire set of problems, plans to adjourn for a holiday recess in a few days, and would not return until the end of January. And late Friday, four influential Senators, including the majority leader, Trent Lott, sent a letter to Amtrak saying that they should expect no increase in financial help.
For a time one week ago it appeared Congress could end the dispute at once, if the union struck and all the issues could be wrapped up in a single emergency bill that would end the walkout. But then the union and the company extended the cooling-off period.
Amtrak's problem, as one union official said, is not just that Amtrak has trouble getting resolution of the group of issues, but that it is "getting them out of sync."
The Senate may try again on Monday to put those issues back in sync, when a new compromise bill may be introduced, and that could create the momentum to get it through the House, too. If the $3.2 billion in capital is released, Amtrak might get permission to raid some of that for day-to-day expenses.
A "blue ribbon" panel of experts named by the House Transportation Committee earlier this year said the railroad was just months from bankruptcy. When the last fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, Amtrak said it had lost $83 million and would probably lose $100 million more this year, borrowing money to meet day-to-day expenses. That is above the subsidies already planned.
And the $100 million assumes no contract increases; if the union gets what was recommended by a Presidential emergency board, and if the other unions settle on the same pattern, as is usually done, it would cost about $136 million.
Amtrak has only about $150 million in credit remaining, and in early December it will meet with its short-term lenders about extending that credit. If the impasse continues on Capitol Hill, the railroad may find itself without credit. Even now, Amtrak executives say, some of the companies with which it does business are growing reluctant to sign long-term contracts.
Amtrak's survival is not at the top of labor's agenda. More important to the unions is what precedent is set in negotiations with the passenger railroad, because they would carry over into the far larger freight segment of the business. In addition, Congress and the White House agree that they want to phase out operating subsidies by the year 2002.
Negotiations with the union have been complicated by a partial change-in-command at the railroad. At the beginning of this past week, four of the nine members of Amtrak's board of directors took over discussions with the union, largely sidelining Amtrak's management; Amtrak officials have been referring all requests for comment to the Transportation Department, where Rodney E. Slater, the Transportation Secretary, who is one of the nine, has been the host of the talks.
On Friday, the directors voted to impose a gag order on themselves, but some people connected to the negotiations have continued to talk, and the outlines of the railroad's problems are clear.
Amtrak, like the White House and the Congress, wants a railroad weaned from operating subsidies. "It's not our choice to be beholden to Congress every year," said one Amtrak official involved in negotiations. The railroad thought it had found a way: a $3.2 billion injection of capital money, set aside by the House and Senate in a tax bill earlier this summer. Amtrak executives believe they can use the money to upgrade service on the Northeast Corridor and elsewhere and take in $150 million extra a year, which they can use around the system.
The money was set aside, but never released by Congress; the House of Representatives, in fact, tried several times last week, but failed to achieve consensus. The reason is that Republicans in Congress say that to prosper, Amtrak must be freed of provisions in Federal law that forbid contracting out if that will cause layoffs, and provide up to six years of severance pay for workers it lays off. In addition, they say, caps should be put on the amount of punitive damages that people injured in train accidents can collect.
The Democrats say the damage caps are unfair and the labor provisions are more important to ideology than economics, because Amtrak rarely lays off employees. A bigger complication, though, is whether the labor provisions would apply to other railroads; that question helped sidetrack the House last week.
The directors, according to people involved in the negotiations, proposed giving the union an increase, contingent on getting more money from Congress. On Friday evening, the four Senators responded with a letter that said, "Amtrak's posture is not only inappropriate, but it is ill-advised and unrealistic."
Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, said, "I cannot for the life of me understand what the Amtrak board members are thinking."

HEADLINE: Nazi Gold Was Recast And Issued In the U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Of the many bizarre tales seeping from archives around the world in the Nazi gold investigations, few are as strange as this one: In 1950, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York melted down hundreds of gold bars bearing the swastika imprint and recast them with the pristine stamp bearing the words "United States Assay Office."
At the time, according to memorandums released by the Federal Reserve, the United States Treasury knew that much of the gold -- worth about $23 million at the time -- had been looted from the Netherlands and Belgium when those nations were invaded by Germany. 
 These, bars, like most of the gold stolen by Germany during World War II, had been discreetly sold on world markets before May 1945 by the Swiss National Bank, with the proceeds helping to finance Hitler's faltering war effort.
But by 1950, America's main concern was rebuilding Europe, not asking too many questions about the origin of gold that moved from Swiss hands to other nations, and eventually crossed the Atlantic into the Federal Reserve's vaults deep below the streets of lower Manhattan.
Thus, at the request of National City Bank, which later became Citibank, the Treasury Department authorized the "reissue" of the gold -- a polite phrase for purifying it and wiping out the German markings -- so the gold could be used as collateral for a transaction between Spain and the I.T.T. Corporation, the documents show.
"The facts seem pretty plain," said Jack Morris, the spokesman for Citicorp, the parent company of Citibank, after reviewing documents that the Federal Reserve provided to researchers for Swiss television. "This all happened in an era when there wasn't as much introspection about this kind of transaction."
The documents not only provide a stark view of the trafficking of Nazi gold -- first through Swiss banks, then through the central banks of Europe, and finally to the Federal Reserve -- they also raise some haunting questions.
A report issued by the Clinton Administration this year concludes that the Germans' mint often took the gold that German troops stole from the central banks of Europe and melted it together with gold of a more gruesome variety: the tooth-fillings, wedding rings and other jewelry of death- camp victims. Germany's goal was to turn the gold lifted from the mouths and fingers of the victims into a form that that could be traded on world markets, usually courtesy of the Swiss National Bank.
No one knows how widespread the practice was; the fillings and rings were certainly not part of every bar, and may have been part of only a small fraction of the mint's wartime output. But the re-smelting conducted by the United States Assay Office -- an institution that no longer exists -- likely wiped out all traces of what historians delicately call "non-monetary gold" in the bars. In fact, the purpose of the re-smelting was to assure that any gold in the Federal Reserve Bank's vaults met the American Government's standard, a gold "purity" of 99.5% or better.
There is no evidence in the documents indicating that the Federal Reserve or the Treasury suspected in 1950 that any portion of the gold in their possession had come from Holocaust victims. But the issue is important to modern-day diplomacy.
For the last several months, the Clinton Administration has been trying to convince nations around the world to contribute a relatively small amount of gold still under the control of the Tripartite Gold Commission -- set up after the war for returning gold to nations around the world -- to the survivors and heirs of Holocaust victims. The Administration's effort has been led by Stuart Eizenstat, Undersecretary of State for economic and business affairs.
The fact that some unknown portion of the Nazi gold came from Holocaust victims provides the rationale for the contribution. Most other nations with a potential claim on the gold, including many central European countries, have agreed to the donation, though a final accord has not yet been announced.
The Federal Reserve's dealings with the Nazi gold began when Spain needed to put up collateral to buy a telephone system from I.T.T. in the late 1940's, as Europe was being rebuilt under the American assistance program known as the Marshall Plan.
It shipped $31 million in gold bullion to the New York Federal Reserve, gold that is worth about 10 times as much today.
Interoffice correspondence from the Federal Reserve says "some of the gold in the shipment was identified as having been part of the gold looted by the German authorities during the last war and melted and reissued as 1937 Prussian Mint bars."

HEADLINE: THE JIANG VISIT: THE MAIN ISSUE;
U.S. Refrain on Human Rights Strikes No Chords With Jiang

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 1

 BODY:
At every stop on his tour of the United States this past week, President Jiang Zemin has been urged by American officials and protesters to improve human rights in China.
Almost every time, Mr. Jiang has answered patiently, as if to slow-witted students who do not understand the complexities of his country. The terms he used seemed to reveal an enormous gulf between two different perceptions of human rights, perhaps even wider than previously thought. 
 At a luncheon with prominent Americans in Washington, for instance, Mr. Jiang told his audience that democracy was really a notion that Chinese scholars came up with 2,000 years ago.
Employing a historical analogy he thought his listeners could understand, he added that when Chinese troops took control of Tibet in 1959, it was actually a liberation for Tibetans, akin to the freeing of the slaves during the American Civil War.
Human rights stood out this week as the most insoluble issue in United States-China relations, and as the issue on which Americans most want to see progress. And yet, however the Americans pressed for change, the Chinese resisted. As student-led demonstrators at Tiananmen Square learned when the military crushed their democracy movement in 1989, the rights issue is not one on which China's leaders are willing to yield.
"Jiang Zemin doesn't show any sign of changing," said Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China, a New York-based group. "This political system is built on suppressing people's rights."
As someone who monitors and opposes rights violations, Mr. Xiao insists that international pressure can make a difference in the lives of individual political prisoners, because it undeniably has in the past. Yet, he says, he also recognizes that outside pressure is only one of many factors that can bring about change, and that there is no easy way to bridge the divide between the American and Chinese positions.
In seeking the right approach, Mr. Clinton has been criticized by business people for talking about rights too much and by protesters for talking about them too little.
But Mr. Jiang's intransigence this week suggests that any approach by an American President will run into a Chinese wall. Forcing China to change on human rights, as Mr. Jiang's unflappable demeanor seemed to indicate, may be beyond the reach of even the world's most powerful nation.
The reason for Beijing's reluctance to negotiate, China scholars say, is that in a political system relying on the appearance of infallibility and unanimity of a single ruling party, the authorities generally fear that any concession could be interpreted as a sign of weakness by domestic adversaries.
China's leaders today can hardly fail to remember how intense a torrent of criticism they faced in 1989, when the door to protest was opened a crack, and ensuing demonstrations at their peak brought more than a million protesters to Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
Negotiating on other contentious issues, like trade and nuclear proliferation, seems easier for Chinese officials, because the political legitimacy of their regime is not involved.
"Progress in political reform is only made when there is an elite that is at least willing to consider political change," said Harry Harding, a China scholar at George Washington University. "And when there is a pressure for change from key sectors of society, and when the general socioeconomic context is favorable enough that the tensions produced by this process of political ferment don't bring the system down. So it is a very, very tough process."
Because Chinese authorities have in the past been known to release political prisoners at diplomatically opportune times, many activists here hoped that Mr. Jiang would let a prominent dissident out of prison before his visit.
Yet there is always a danger that releasing a political prisoner will draw attention to that person, and highlight the system that incarcerated him or her in the first place.
Human rights dominated the news conference held by Mr. Clinton with Mr. Jiang on Wednesday in Washington, providing a dramatic and unscripted debate at an event that had been expected to stress similarities.
After Mr. Jiang defended the suppression of the Tiananmen protesters as a "necessary" measure in an atmosphere that jeopardized security, Mr. Clinton said that strong nations do best by learning from their differences, not crushing them.
Mr. Jiang answered by arguing that human rights is a relative term: "Concepts on democracy, on human rights and on freedom are relative and specific, and they are to be determined by the specific national situation of different countries."
Mr. Clinton then argued that all the negative news about him and his family had actually made the United States a stronger nation. This conveyed disapproval of China's unwillingness to allow even the slightest criticism of its leaders in its media, which are state-controlled.
Mr. Jiang is adept at talking about his country's best-case scenario and ignoring the rest. Only occasionally does he veer off into the fully improbable, as when he asserted that Chinese philosophers supplanted the Greeks as the original democrats.
In Washington, and in discussions in Philadelphia and New York, Mr. Jiang maintained that human rights conditions in China were improving steadily because average living standards were rising each year.
It is true that personal freedom has expanded greatly in recent years as a result of an economic growth that offers choices. There has also been a gradual easing of party authority over everyday life, which has allowed people to choose their own homes, jobs and marriage partners.
Yet leaders choose not to talk about the way that tolerance of open opposition to the Government has remained virtually unchanged in the 20 years that economic revolution has been under way.

HEADLINE: THE JIANG VISIT: ON THE STREET;
Dueling Demonstrations Greet Jiang in Rowdiest Showing Yet

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 1

 BODY:
Encountering the biggest, rowdiest street action of his visit to the United States, President Jiang Zemin of China was met by dueling masses of several thousand demonstrators here today, one side shouting their welcome and the other their demands.
As Mr. Jiang's motorcade arrived at Harvard University, where he delivered a speech, hundreds of Chinese and Chinese-American supporters on the north side of Cambridge Street waved red Chinese flags and the American Stars and Stripes, shouting, "No separation! One China!" Overhead, a corporate plane flew a banner of warm greeting. 
 On the south side of the street, and at the nearby Swedenborg Chapel, hundreds of Asian and non-Asian protesters raised signs accusing China of human rights abuses, beat drums and chanted: "Free China! Free Tibet! Free Taiwan!"
Taken together, the two sides appeared to constitute the largest street gathering at Harvard since the Vietnam War era, the Cambridge police said. They estimated the crowd at near 5,000, and said no arrests had been made.
The anti-Jiang protests, put together by a constellation of more than 25 Harvard and Boston human rights, Tibetan and Taiwanese groups, were meant to serve as the culmination of protest during his eight-day visit to the United States.
What had been less advertised was the large turnout by Chinese and Chinese-Americans in support of Mr. Jiang. The Jiang supporters, organized by the Greater Boston Area Chinese Welcome Committee -- a coalition of four dozen groups, many of them Chinese student associations -- appeared to rival the numbers of their opponents. Many carried identical sets of Chinese and American flags, and their red banners, too, had a uniform, manufactured look that contrasted with the handmade signs of the other side.
"People have to look at how good Chinese-American relations will help the whole world," said Joe Chou, an investment professional from China. "You have to look at the dynamic, not the static situation. How much change has there been in China in the last 10 years?"
"You cannot say," put in Jim Xue, an environmental health researcher also from China, "that overnight we will become a democracy."
Standing near a giant red banner reading "M.I.T. welcomes President Jiang -- Chief Engineer of China," Yaping Liu, president of the North American-Chinese Association for Science and Technology, struck an even warmer note.
"We support collaboration and friendship," he said. "I believe the two countries having a good relationship is very important to the peace of the world and the next century."
Such arguments, however, failed to move the protesters calling for the release of China's political prisoners, for the closing down of its labor camps and for independence for Tibet and Taiwan.
"Jiang Zemin, go home!" they chanted. Some of the Americans chanted "Shame on Harvard!" for playing host to Mr. Jiang.
"I have one thing to say to the people welcoming Jiang Zemin here," said Wang Xizhe, a prominent dissident who served 14 years in jail in China. "Don't follow fascists! Don't follow dictators!"
A Tibetan protester, speaking to the crowd, said: "Do not wave the flag that enslaves you! It's not enough to have a TV set. It's not enough to fill your rice bowl. We must have freedom."
Raymond L. Flynn, the former Boston Mayor who recently ended a four-year stint as the American Ambassador to the Vatican during which he worked extensively on human rights issues, observed the dueling sides of Cambridge Street with a twinge of misgiving.
"The real issue is making sure human rights is a center of our foreign policy and not just an afterthought," he said. "We should all be together sending the same message to Jiang Zemin -- human rights and economic opportunities on the same side of the street."

HEADLINE: Mayors in Largest Cities Coasting to Re-election

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
Buoyed by economic prosperity and declining crime rates, mayors in many of the nation's largest cities appear to be gliding toward easy re-election on Tuesday, a striking turnabout, given that only a decade or so ago some of those cities were considered all but ungovernable.
The most obvious example is New York, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is widely favored after one of the quietest contests in a generation. But an examination of the 223 mayoral races around the country, based on interviews and polls, indicates that mayors in cities like Detroit, Cleveland, St. Paul, Buffalo, New Haven and Charlotte, N.C., do not appear threatened by their competition. In Boston, despite the city's storied history of contentious local politics, Mayor Thomas M. Menino is the first incumbent in recorded history to have no opponent at all. 
 The only big cities where incumbents find themselves in hard-fought races are Atlanta, Miami and Minneapolis, but they are still by far the favorites. The two most competitive contests are where the mayor's seat is vacant: Houston and Seattle.
"It's never peaches and cream," said Mr. Menino, a Democrat. "But we're doing much better. People are more optimistic about Boston."
The lack of competition in cities that were battlegrounds as recently as four years ago is the latest demonstration that the relative contentment of voters has penetrated urban areas that in recent decades were bastions of electoral ferment, often over joblessness and racial conflict.
The improved mood among voters transcends party and geography, and may offer a hint of what to expect in 1998, when far more offices will be up for grabs. In the early maneuvering for next year's gubernatorial races, for example, formidable opposition has yet to surface against at least a dozen incumbents.
Another result -- or perhaps cause -- of the absence of roiling campaigns is a lack of voter interest. Democrats and Republicans alike said they expected turnout to be especially low on Tuesday.
The calmness of the campaigns also demonstrates the emergence of an era of nonpartisanship, as Republicans and Democrats are having trouble settling on themes to differentiate themselves. Borrowing a mantra from President Clinton's campaign last year, many mayors are proclaiming, simply, that their cities are on "the right track."
The absence of deep ideological rifts has also been apparent in the two gubernatorial races on Tuesday -- in New Jersey and Virginia -- where candidates often appear alike even as they try to stake out stands on social and economic issues.
"Mayors often did not have control of the situation, but got swept out anyway with frustration over the way the country was going and frustration over the way individual cities were going," said Mayor Paul Helmke of Fort Wayne, Ind., a Republican who is president of the United States Conference of Mayors. "But across the country, mayors have a take-charge attitude and are pretty much ignoring party lines to get things done."
Prof. Alan Altshuler, a specialist in urban affairs at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, said people were still not thrilled with the conditions of cities but had learned to expect less. "There was a sense for a long time that things were spiraling out of control and cities were becoming jungles where it was dangerous to do business -- let alone think about living," Professor Altshuler said. "Now, if the economy doesn't seem too far out of whack, people are pretty grateful."
For years, political machines held sway in many large cities. Then in the late 1980's, the trend was for black Democrats to extend their hold on many City Halls. Now, the most noticeable shift is that more pragmatic politicians of all backgrounds are presiding over cities.
Michael N. Danielson, a professor of politics at Princeton University, said declining crime rates had helped incumbents tremendously because voters do not think mayors have much control over the economy yet "perceive that mayors should be able to do something about crime."
Whatever the reason, in city after city the campaign season has been remarkably tame. In Cleveland, which went through a financial default in 1978, Mayor Michael R. White, a Democrat, is expected to have an easy re-election. The central issue posed by his challenger, Helen K. Smith, is not the city's condition but Mr. White's abrasive manner.
Arnold Pinkney, Mr. White's campaign manager, has sought to keep the focus on the condition of the city. "Clevelanders no longer feel bad about themselves," Mr. Pinkney said, adding that property values have risen 43 percent since 1989.
One of the most surprising turns is in Boston, where crime is down, the economy has recovered and the Mayor has no opponent.
"The Mayor is focused on bread-and-butter issues," said Thomas O'Connor, a historian who has chronicled the history of the mayor's office in Boston. "He's filled the potholes. He's cleaned the streets. He's responded a great deal to the neighborhoods rather than the downtown financiers. At least that's the perception."
One of the few lively races is in Minneapolis, where Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton is favored to win a second term. Ms. Sayles Belton is fighting a challenge from Barbara Carlson, a flamboyant independent.
Ms. Carlson, a former City Council member, has been a radio talk show host who is known for frequently broadcasting from her hot tub and inviting guests to join her in the froth. Last year, she wrote "This Broad's Life," a book about her sex life, her bouts with depression and her failed marriage to the state's Governor, Arne Carlson.
Ms. Carlson accused Ms. Sayles Belton, a member of the Democrat-Farmer-Labor Party, of not being aggressive in battling crime and improving education.
At the close of a debate last week, Ms. Sayles Belton shot back, ridiculing the notion that cities like New York had rebounded while Minneapolis had not. "Don't let Barbara Carlson suggest that New York City is better than Minneapolis," the Mayor said. "We know that is not true. Don't let her suggest we are miserable here. It's not true."
Across the river in St. Paul, Mayor Norm Coleman, a Republican, has a huge lead in the polls over his challenger, State Senator Sandy Pappas. Ms. Pappas has accused Mr. Coleman of neglecting neighborhoods in favor of downtown, a serious charge in a city that prides itself on its pleasant residential areas.
But Mr. Coleman has plastered the city with billboards that proclaim, "Optimism is contagious."
In Detroit, Mayor Dennis Archer is also being accused by his opponent, Ed Vaughn, of neglecting the city's neighborhoods. But Mr. Vaughn, a State Representative, does not appear to be making headway.
In Syracuse, Mayor Roy Bernardi, a Republican, is favored to win a second term. Crime is down, the city's finances have improved, and Mr. Bernardi has a large war chest.
"I'm not sure that it's a case that everyone is happy," said Jeffrey Stonecash, a political science professor at Syracuse University. "There is a sense that the economy is doing better, and that makes it harder for the challenger."
Another reason incumbent mayors may be having an easier time is that the rigors of running for office -- and then running a city -- may discourage challengers.
"Who would want to be mayor?" asked Joseph F. Crangle, an ex-Democratic Party chairman in Buffalo, where Mayor Anthony Masiello is considered a shoo-in for a new term. "In Buffalo, it's a dead end. You have to go back to Grover Cleveland to find someone moving beyond it."

HEADLINE: Couple Accused of Beating Daughters Tell of Adoption Ordeal

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
In Moscow one night in May, Richard and Karen Thorne watched one of their newly adopted daughters tuck her doll under the covers, whack it on the head with a shoe, then calmly straighten the covers. It seemed just part of her routine, like a good-night kiss. Only it was a good-night smack.
The Thornes were alarmed. They worried aloud, they recalled, that the girl had learned such behavior by being abused herself. Her birth mother, they had just discovered, had been an alcoholic who left the girl in an orphanage when she was 18 months old. The mother later hanged herself. 
 But of the two 4-year-olds they were adopting, the Thornes say they worried more about the other, the blonde. She had done nothing but scream from the moment she met them in the same orphanage, where she had lived since she was found as a baby on the street.
Still, it hardly mattered. The Thornes, who had gone through years of unsuccessful fertility treatments, were determined to adopt the girls and complete their family.
"It doesn't matter what people tell you or how much you think you know," Mrs. Thorne said. "You expect that Christmas-card photo. You have stars in your eyes."
The Thornes provided such snapshots of their adoption odyssey in their first in-depth interview since they were arrested May 28 and accused of beating and verbally assaulting the girls on a plane ride from Moscow to New York. They have been separated ever since from the girls, who are now in their fifth foster home.
While other adoptive parents tell hair-raising stories of struggling with out-of-control children on the way home, adoption experts know of no other case in which the parents' behavior led to their arrest. And while the Thornes have minimized their actions as a single slap, a Queens judge said last month that they were lying and found them guilty of neglect.
Still, whatever the truth about their behavior on the plane, the Thornes' account offers a vivid picture of their adoption experience and may provide a cautionary tale of a path to parenthood that more and more Americans are choosing.
Russia, which offers white children in a relatively short period of time, has become an increasingly popular source of adoptions for Americans. In 1992, the first year that Russia legalized out-of-country adoptions, Americans adopted 324 Russian children, according to the United States State Department. In the 1997 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, Russia provided Americans with 3,800 children, making it the leading source of international adopted children and surpassing China, which provided 3,500 children last year. Children adopted in Russia tend to be older and to have spent some time in institutions.
But the Thornes' story is not just an adoption story. At a time of heightened sensitivity about child abuse, it underscores the ambiguities and uncertainties involved in drawing the line between discipline and abuse in an emotionally freighted situation.
 
A Childless Couple Look to Russia
 Richard Thorne, 49, and Karen Thorne, 43, who were married in 1985, own and operate a distribution warehouse on the cactus-studded outskirts of Phoenix. They drive to work in a white van that they outfitted for their daughters with a television and videocassette recorder. Their van is as immaculate and orderly as their computerized offices, and as pristine as their home, with its white rugs, showcase of ceramic figures and sparkling pool.
The Thornes said that when they gave up on having biological children, they briefly considered adopting in America but turned to international adoption because they worried that an American birth mother could reclaim the child. They sought a child under 3 years old.
Their adoption agency, Hand in Hand of Mesa, Ariz., told them in January of two unrelated 4-year-old girls who needed a home, and the Thornes said they quickly accepted the idea. Mr. Thorne, who has two grown children from a previous marriage, said they also started seeing the advantages of older children. "No diapers," he said.
In addition, they had known several people who had adopted one child from Russia, then gone back for a second. Mr. Thorne said they decided that getting two at once would "be more economical." And they liked that the two girls would have a shared experience.
Soon, pictures of the girls arrived, as did sketchy medical forms. (The New York judge has ordered that the girls' names not be disclosed.) The forms said the girls had brain damage. But like many other adoptive parents, the Thornes dismissed this as a necessary maneuver by the Russian authorities to help get the girls out of the country. A study of Russian medical forms for adoptees, published in September in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that such forms frequently say neurological problems exist when they do not.
"We were told that if they put on the form that these were healthy, wonderful children, they wouldn't let them go for foreign adoption," Mr. Thorne said.
The Thornes also received a videotape of the girls. "It just showed us that they could run and play like normal kids," Mr. Thorne said.
The day before the Thornes left for Moscow in mid-May, they received a fax from their agency's Moscow coordinator saying one of the girls was fine, but the other "will be reserved and will be harder to adjust and she was not real happy about the adoption." The Thornes thought that meant the girl would be shy.
"We knew there was a possibility there would be problems," Mrs. Thorne said. "But my attitude was, when you give birth to your own children, you don't know what conditions they'll have. We figured that whatever happened, we'd deal with it. We didn't really think there was anything that wouldn't be fixable or treatable."
In mid-May they arrived in Moscow -- like other adoptive parents, with thousands of dollars in crisp bills strapped to their bodies. They were met by an interpreter, who joined them for the 12-hour train trip to the orphanage, in the rural village of Voronezh, about 290 miles southeast of Moscow. Apart from their own luggage and clothes for the girls (they had to guess at their sizes), they lugged a suitcase and cardboard box stuffed with "gifts" that Russian intermediaries instruct prospective parents to bring for the bureaucrats and facilitators who arrange their adoptions.
 
At the Orphanage, Signs of Trouble
As they approached the orphanage, a house in the woods, they heard screaming. Once inside, a little girl with dark hair greeted them chirpily and boasted that she was going to America with them. The screams they heard came from another room and grew louder when the door opened and an orphanage worker emerged with the blonde, who would not let go of the worker.
The Thornes, who went through 35 hours of child-rearing classes in preparation for the adoption, in addition to detailed criminal and financial investigations, are reluctant to criticize those involved in the adoption, as they are still trying to gain custody, but Mrs. Thorne did say: "We should have known that the child wasn't reserved but that she was hysterical."
The Thornes said they were confused and hurt by the girl's rejection. But the orphanage workers told them that if they did not take the girls, they would be sent to another orphanage, where they would get less attention. The workers said the girls would be fine once they got over the shock of leaving the only caregivers they had known.
The parents proceeded with the adoption, completing it in court, processing a score of documents and taking the train back to Moscow with their new family.
But there, the dark-haired girl became aggressive, kicking strangers in an open-air market. The blonde continued to scream. During a routine medical check, which typically focuses more on infectious diseases than a child's psychological state, a Russian doctor in Moscow told them: "It's not too late not to take them."
Mr. Thorne said that things can seem so bad, running away "is a thought that crosses your mind" but that he was repulsed by it. "That's almost like aborting a child," he said.
In the end, the Thornes said, they decided to press on.
"We decided, we had come this far, we're not going to give up on her," Mr. Thorne said.
 "She had absolutely no future in that country," Mrs. Thorne said.
 
By Everyone's Account, A Bad Flight Home
By now they were dreading the flight to New York. The Thornes said they asked Moscow doctors for sedatives for the girls but were refused. They said that they also asked their agency's coordinator for a Russian-speaking escort from Moscow to Arizona, but that they were turned down.
Margot Matthews, the administrative director and social services director of the adoption agency that arranged the Thornes' adoptions, said that the Thornes had indeed been offered an escort, but rejected one.
In any case, the Thornes said, the plane ride was a nightmare. In the Queens courtroom, two flight attendants and three passengers later testified that the couple had abused the girls. The Thornes testified in court that they had each hit the girls once, but not on the face, and that although they were angry, embarrassed and exhausted, they had not crossed the line to abuse. But both said that their discipline had quieted the girls, at least for a while.
Ms. Matthews said that her adoption agency, which has completed more than 2,600 adoptions in 23 years, counsels strongly against corporal punishment. Since the Thorne case, she said, the agency has added to its pre-adoption training a session called "Airplane 101," and also hands out a list of "Suggestions for what to do when your child is going berserk!!" They include using coloring books, headsets and music and feeding the children snacks.
The Thornes said that they had tried most of these techniques. But the best respite came in an unexpected way -- when the blonde poked her hand through the seats and reached for the woman in front of her. The woman took the girl's hand, and the girl stopped crying. They held hands for nearly an hour, never speaking or looking at each other.
"I didn't do anything to pull her away," Mrs. Thorne recalled, embarrassed at relying on a stranger but grateful for the relief.
"I never saw the woman's face," Mrs. Thorne said. "I don't know if she was an old woman, a young woman, Russian, American, French."
Whoever she was, the anonymous woman provided the girl with comfort that the new parents could not. And she illustrated a characteristic often found among children who have been institutionalized for long periods -- an inability to "attach" to their parents and an indiscriminate ease with strangers.
That, said Ms. Matthews, who observed the girls recently, is what she noticed most about them. "They're not attached," she said. "They didn't seek affection from anyone."
And she worried that, even more than most children, these girls would repeatedly test the Thornes' limits. "They are constantly going to be saying, 'How far can I push you before you get rid of me, because everybody else has?' "
 
Five Months Later, An Empty Bedroom
The Thornes are still trying to gain custody of the girls and are due back in Family Court in Queens on Nov. 7. The girls, still under the authority of New York City's Administration for Children's Services, are now here in the foster care of Mrs. Thorne's brother. The Thornes say that physically the girls seem fine, but they are pondering how to develop their relationship with them beyond playmates and gift-bearers to something less artificial.
In their house, the door to the girls' room is kept closed. Inside, the beds are crisply made, the animals precisely arranged, a doll -- one blond, one dark-haired -- on each pillow.
The girls have never spent a night with their new parents since arriving on American soil more than five months ago. But their lives have moved relentlessly forward as they learn English, celebrate birthdays and grow, still orphans.

HEADLINE: Market's Nod To a Rebirth;
In South Bronx Enclave, Rising Property Values And Suburban Living

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
Sunday afternoon. A middle-aged couple slowly cruise up and down rows of nearly identical ranch houses on streets lined with trees. The wife looks intently at the homes on the right; the husband, at the wheel, scans the left.
Friends had told him about a house for sale on Louis Nine Boulevard. Just what they wanted: three bedrooms on a quarter-acre lot in the right neighborhood. But when he got there, the owner said it had already been sold, for $185,000. 
 "This is where we want to retire," the man said glumly. "Not many of these go up for sale."
The setting could be any modest, well-kept suburb, where a nice little house on a good street would not last long at $185,000.
But this is the South Bronx. Not too many years ago, only the rats and stray dogs were fighting for homes in this neighborhood.
In the 1970's, as most of America and much of the rest of the world came to learn, the South Bronx had become the definition of urban blight, nearly destroyed by poverty, crime and arson. But that picture began to change late in the 1980's. Community advocates and elected officials, pointing to thousands of new homes and intensely loyal and determined residents, declared that the South Bronx had been reborn.
Now the real estate market, a notoriously unsentimental observer, is offering its own verdict on the transformation, or at least one piece of it. And $185,000 for a ranch house in the neighborhood known as Charlotte Gardens qualifies as a ringing endorsement.
Built almost entirely with money from the city between 1983 and 1986, the 89 single-family, suburban-style houses in Charlotte Gardens originally sold for $49,500 to $60,000, depending on the extras. Now the owners -- truck drivers, police dispatchers, secretaries and other people of modest means -- could sell for three to four times what they paid.
"I put the sign up Saturday morning," said Joseph Martinez, the broker for the recently sold house on Louis Nine Boulevard. "I got to my office and I must have had 10 calls on the machine. I've never seen anything like it."
Despite the intense interest, only eight houses have been put up for sale. That is partly by design: to insure community stability, the first owners agreed not to sell their homes for 10 years, and faced heavy penalties if they did.
But even as the time limits expire, residents expect very little turnover. Despite the high demand, few owners appear to be interested in selling.
Rafael Ceballos, who paid $52,600 for his house in 1985, was not fazed when he learned that an identical house across the street had just gone on the market for $200,000, and said he had no desire to sell.
"I live like a king," he said, his eyes trailing over his quarter-acre lot.
Mr. Ceballos's domain was built on a sea of rubble. Today, not only have property values in Charlotte Gardens quintupled, but politicians and urban planners say the very audacity -- and the success -- of the development helped change the attitude of government officials and the public about what was possible in the South Bronx. That, in turn, led to broader renewal efforts and more new homes, raising values all over the South Bronx.
Those rising property values reflect trends in other parts of the city once considered hopeless ghettos. These days, it is hard to find a single-family home in any neighborhood for under $100,000, as changing lending practices help invigorate once depressed housing markets. And in other cities, like Chicago, Cleveland and Houston, new housing is being built to accommodate a demand from people who want to move back downtown from suburbs.
In New York City, more than $2 billion in state and Federal money has been spent since 1986 to build or renovate 30,000 units of housing in the South Bronx, according to the borough president's office. Within a three-mile radius of Charlotte Gardens, there are about 500 new row houses and town houses and at least 800 units in renovated apartment buildings.
"Absent Charlotte Gardens, it's hard to imagine the extensive revitalization happening," said Paul Grogan, president of Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a nonprofit housing investment organization that was the first contributor to the construction of Charlotte Gardens. "Its very strangeness gave a symbolic wallop, a way to reverse the hopelessness, the implicit triage policy of the city."
Today, the neighborhood's appeal to home buyers is clear in some ways but less obvious in others. Despite the years of progress, Charlotte Gardens is still in the poorest Congressional district in the nation. In the South Bronx as a whole, unemployment is still at more than 45 percent, crime and drugs are still constant sources of fear and the public schools are among the city's worst. Most Charlotte Gardens parents pay tuition for parochial school, and residents drive elsewhere -- even as far as New Jersey -- to shop; there are no supermarkets nearby.
Other Bronx neighborhoods, like Pelham Bay and Throgs Neck -- where a house comparable to the one on Louis Nine Boulevard would go for $185,000 or less -- have higher income levels, safer streets, more successful schools and vastly better shopping. For generations, South Bronx residents have moved to those neighborhoods, and then to Westchester County or New Jersey as their incomes rose. But in Charlotte Gardens, the pattern has changed.
"I tried to talk people into buying into homes in another neighborhood," said Mr. Martinez, the real estate agent. "They say no. They want to live there. Don't ask me why. There's no shopping near. You can get mugged going to the subway. It doesn't make sense to pay that kind of money there."
But those comparisons are lost on many residents of Charlotte Gardens, and on others who would like to live there. Many grew up in the South Bronx; in Charlotte Gardens, they can stay close to family and old friends while enjoying the space, the mowed lawns and the relative safety of suburbia. Most important, they say, it is a tightly knit neighborhood with a sense of community.
Adela Villamil, 24, who bid unsuccessfully for the Louis Nine house, said the neighborhood reminded her of the South Bronx the way it was when she was growing up.
"It was beautiful," she said. "The doors were left open. Everybody knew everybody's kids. Neighbors would pick up kids when their mother couldn't, and drive them home and feed them. When somebody was cut, everybody hurt."
Although separate statistics are not available, the residents of Charlotte Gardens say crime is relatively low. Neighborhood watch groups help deter burglaries and street crime, and the 41st Precinct has obliged the homeowners' association with more patrol officers, said Henry Hilton, the group's president.
This tiny island of blue-collar suburbia began in 1983, when the first two model homes were built on a heap of rubble that Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan both used as an example of poverty and blight. People came from all over the South Bronx to stare at the ordinary single-family houses on display, and 500 signed up to buy one.
Construction of the development, overseen by the South Bronx Development Organization, faltered many times. When it looked as if the city money would dry up after 10 houses were built, the director of the group, Ed Logue, ordered the remaining foundations to be poured -- 79 at once. "To remove any doubt," he said recently.
For all this effort and anticipation, the ranch houses were unremarkable. They had been manufactured and trucked over in halves. They had the basics -- a kitchen with a dishwasher, a basement, the three bedrooms, a living room and front hallway. Most lots were a quarter of an acre.
Nearly everybody immediately took down the white picket fences Mr. Logue had insisted upon. The fences they eventually put up -- for safety and privacy -- are imaginative and varied: there is ornamental wrought iron, arched brick topped with thick evergreens and high chain-link.
Inside, residents live like suburbanites. On weekends, they care for their lawns. They have tools that people don't use in apartments: power mowers, edge trimmers, fertilizer spreaders, hedge clippers, rakes, shovels and more.
But their neighborhood is subject to intrusion. News reporters and urban planners -- from as near as Manhattan and as far as Sweden, Poland and Japan -- have been coming and asking questions since Charlotte Gardens opened. "Very annoying," said Freemon Rose, a Charlotte Street resident.
Mr. Rose, like others in Charlotte Gardens, has become familiar with famous people. A few years ago, he was irritated, not impressed, by an urgent phone call. President Clinton was nearby, said an aide. He wanted to go into a Charlotte Gardens neighborhood and be photographed with the homeowners.
"I was eating dinner!" Mr. Rose said. "The man should have some consideration!" But he let the aide talk him into meeting the President on the front lawn and shaking hands with him for the photographer.
The winning bidders for the house on Louis Nine Boulevard were Diana and Steven Gonzalez, who paid $185,000 to have everything they have been deprived of in their South Bronx apartments: their own roomy home on a safe, quiet street. Living in Charlotte Gardens, they said, they can raise their three daughters comfortably and be close to relatives.
"It's a whole new community," Diana Gonzalez said. "It's family oriented. Everybody looks out for each other's kids. All the kids go to Catholic schools. I looked in other areas -- they didn't feel like home.
"I won't be worried about my girls. They'll be protected there, definitely. They're not going to be South Bronx kids -- they're going to be Charlotte Gardens kids."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Money Sends Messages That Messinger Couldn't

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
The advertisement opens with a scene of Ruth W. Messinger at a mayoral debate, proclaiming that the election is "not about the past." An announcer then challenges that assertion, sifting through Ms. Messinger's past to evoke images of one incident when she marched on behalf of a Washington Heights drug dealer who was killed by a police officer, and another in which she allegedly gave a party for a killer of an Attica prison guard.
The unusually pointed advertisement was produced for the campaign of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani but never appeared on television. It was shelved by Mr. Giuliani's campaign aides, who felt that such a fierce attack on the Democratic mayoral contender would, as one Giuliani associate said, seem superfluous, and perhaps produce a backlash. 
 There are another dozen or so advertisements sitting around Ms. Messinger's headquarters. These nearly finished 30-second spots deal with education, the city's economy and homelessness, contrasting Ms. Messinger's views with what she has repeatedly called the Republican Mayor's weaknesses in those areas.
These advertisements will not be seen by the public either, but for a different reason: the Messinger campaign never had the money to put them on television.
These two contrasting scenes illustrate a great disparity that has emerged between Ms. Messinger and Mr. Giuliani in these final days of the campaign: their television advertising efforts. In an era when commercials can turn an election, Mr. Giuliani's television campaign has dwarfed Ms. Messinger's on every level: the number of advertisements produced, the television time bought and, in the view of political consultants not involved with either campaign, the quality of the effort.
There is no other area of the campaign in which Mr. Giuliani's fund-raising efforts have produced such a clear advantage. He bought a total of $4.6 million in television time, more than twice what Ms. Messinger was able to buy. In the last week alone, Mr. Giuliani bought about $900,000 in time, or three times as much as Ms. Messinger. It was an extraordinary one-week purchase, a point that was made by Ms. Messinger's aides in explaining what they themselves called their own relatively feeble advertising effort.
"It's really easy to look good when you're outspending your opponent two and a half, three and a half to one," said Jim Andrews, Ms. Messinger's senior campaign consultant.
Mr. Giuliani's television consultant, Adam Goodman, released nearly 40 television advertisements. There were ads in English and in Spanish. "Necesito tu ayuda y tu voto," Mr. Giuliani says in one. "Gracias." ("I need your help and your vote. Thank you.")
There were ads that extolled Mr. Giuliani and attacked Ms. Messinger. There were ads showing Mr. Giuliani as funny, ads that compared Mr. Giuliani to Fiorello H. La Guardia and ads that showed Mr. Giuliani being in control. There were ads tailored to each of the five boroughs, including one, broadcast only on Staten Island, in which Borough President Guy V. Molinari warned that Ms. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, would bring a Manhattan bias to City Hall if she won.
In an indication of the confidence among Mr. Giuliani's advisers, not one citywide ad attacking Ms. Messinger by name has run in nearly a month, by their count. "The competitive nature of the campaign changed from competing against Ruth Messinger to campaigning for a vote of confidence for the future," Mr. Goodman said.
By contrast, Ms. Messinger had released a total of seven ads by yesterday. Most of them focused on her central campaign theme, which is that Mr. Giuliani has neglected the public schools. Mr. Andrews argued that those ads helped to account for rising public concern about how Mr. Giuliani had handled the schools.
Ms. Messinger used the final weekend to lay out a new theme -- voters were urged to send Mr. Giuliani a "messenger" -- and to present a humorous attack on Mr. Giuliani's personality and political ambitions.
"Is power going to Rudy Giuliani's head?" a narrator inquires, as a photograph of the Mayor's head inflates until it flies off over New York City. "It's time to bring Rudy Giuliani back to earth."
Mr. Andrews, Ms. Messinger's senior campaign consultant, in linking the advertising difficulties to a lack of money, denounced Mr. Giuliani for what he called illegal fund-raising efforts. Mr. Andrews was referring to contributions that Mr. Giuliani was forced to return by the Campaign Finance Board, which ruled them illegal, as well as to city advertisements that extolled the strengths of New York and that Ms. Messinger said were intended to lift Mr. Giuliani's electoral prospects.
"They had a great early jump-start funded illegally by the taxpayers and by illegal contributions," Mr. Andrews said. "Within all this, we've tried to make the best argument that we could. She had a lot of great ads about homelessness and unemployment and other things that we could never afford to run."
But political consultants not associated with Ms. Messinger's campaign said that even given the restraints, Ms. Messinger had waged an undistinguished campaign. By contrast, they described Mr. Goodman's effort for Mr. Giuliani as highly effective, if at times somewhat overly aggressive. (The campaign kept broadcasting advertisements quoting Ms. Messinger as saying pornography stores added character to neighborhoods, even though she denied saying it and they couldn't prove she did.)
"Ruth has not connected," said Henry A. Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant. "The spots do not have an emotional context to them. The Giuliani spots have an emotional core to them that talks directly to New Yorkers."
Ms. Messinger's media consultant, Mandy Grunwald, declined to discuss any aspect of her advertising campaign. "I don't care to talk about it," Ms. Grunwald said.
Ms. Messinger's advisers made a few important tactical calls that outside political analysts described as questionable. First, her advertisements did not begin until late August, whereas Mr. Giuliani's began in June. Mr. Andrews attributed the late start to money, but Mr. Goodman said that even a modest early campaign might have drawn attention, and thus contributions, to Ms. Messinger's effort.
The second was that Ms. Messinger decided to use one of her few commercials to respond directly to Mr. Giuliani's pornography ad. One result, several Democrats noted, was that rather than trying to force Mr. Giuliani to discuss her own criticisms of his tenure, she ended up giving even further circulation to the original charges about pornography.
Mr. Goodman's advertising campaign for Mr. Giuliani had three major goals: to pre-empt criticism of Mr. Giuliani's handling of the public schools before Ms. Messinger could begin attacking him on it, to try to present Mr. Giuliani as a more likable figure and to undercut Ms. Messinger by attacking her record before she had a chance to present her own image to the public.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CANDIDATES;
RAIN AND APATHY DOG MAYORAL RACE AS IT WINDS DOWN

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Confronting pelting rain, bursts of wind and often small crowds, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Ruth W. Messinger headed into the final weekend of their campaign yesterday, as Mr. Giuliani again played what he considers his political trump card -- the latest decrease in crime -- while Ms. Messinger warned that things were not as good as they seemed.
From shopping malls to radio shows, from barber shops to diners, Ms. Messinger and Mr. Giuliani -- adjusting their schedules to accommodate the inclement weather along the way -- began a vigorous final 72 hours of campaigning, with both candidates asking voters to ignore polls that showed Mr. Giuliani heading for a strong victory and to turn out to vote on Tuesday, Election Day. 
 Mr. Giuliani's comfortable position is echoed in many large cities around the nation, where economic prosperity and declining crime rates have given incumbents a strong edge in Tuesday's elections. Page 24.
The Republican Mayor mixed government and politics throughout the day, turning from a news conference one moment, in which he and his Police Commissioner announced the latest monthly crime statistics (homicides: down), to a ribbon-cutting for the wet, white, refurbished school bus he will use for these final days of the race.
Standing across the street from Grand Central Terminal, first for the news conference and then, a camera flash later, for the ribbon-cutting, the Mayor proclaimed that his 48-hour bus tour would "try and create a new spirit for, hopefully, a new administration -- a spirit of outreach to everybody in the city.
"There are still people that feel left out," Mr. Giuliani said. "There are still people that feel that they are not included. And I want to say to them that I am going to dedicate the next four years -- if you give me another four years -- to try to make everyone feel that they are part of the success, and possibilities of success, in the city."
Ms. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, went to Brooklyn, where rain forced her to cancel both a motorcade through Bedford-Stuyvesant and a walking tour of Sunset Park. Stymied by the weather, the Democratic candidate went indoors in search of a crowd, stopping first at Junior's Restaurant on Flatbush Avenue, where she ordered a bacon and Swiss cheese omelet with peppermint tea, then proceeding to a Pathmark supermarket.
Feisty and undeterred, she presented herself as a "tough mother," and said that the crime reductions being trumpeted by her opponent across town were not enough to justify re-electing him.
"I think this city has to worry about things besides crime and I'm telling New Yorkers, I've told them what I will do -- to improve the schools, to open up after-school programs, to grow the economy and create jobs," Ms. Messinger said.
"I believe that the greatest days of this city are still ahead of us," Ms. Messinger told 200 women at a labor breakfast in Manhattan. "I think we need a mayor who will say, 'Education, jobs, police brutality, access to health care, the rights of workers, the need of working people to have a decent income and be able to meet their families' needs -- those are the issues that this city has to address in the 21st century.' I'm ready to address them."
Despite efforts by both candidates to drum up enthusiasm, there often was not much of it evident on the wet streets of New York yesterday or even, for that matter, in the warm and dry headquarters of the nominees. A series of public and private polls have suggested that Mr. Giuliani is heading for re-election by a wide margin, which would make him the first Republican Mayor to win a second term since Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1937.
It was a projection that neither camp was challenging during the final hours of this campaign. There was, accordingly, a sense of going through the motions yesterday, of a campaign rolling toward an inevitable conclusion in one of the least suspenseful mayoral races in a generation.
With the end almost at hand, both candidates found themselves returning to what had been the overriding themes of their campaigns.
For the Mayor it was crime, as he produced statistics for both October and the relatively crime-free night of Halloween. He was again reminding voters of the issue that has most accounted for the political success of Mr. Giuliani, the city's first Republican Mayor since John V. Lindsay. "I think, without question, October of 1997 was the safest October in 32 years," the Mayor proclaimed to rolling television cameras and scribbling reporters.
Ms. Messinger countered by saying that despite the good news on crime, there were other problems that Mr. Giuliani had neglected.
"I think it's wonderful that the city is safer," she said. "Every single person in the city wants to see the crime rate continue to go down, and I can promise every New Yorker that as their mayor, I will continue all the good work that's been done to keep the crime rate down.
"I think as we go into the 21st century, we have to pay attention to the problems we haven't solved yet," she said, ticking off reports of increased violence at homes and in schools.
Both candidates did what they could, in the face of challenges both political and meteorological, to inject some energy into what has largely been a desultory campaign. Mr. Giuliani warned against complacency that might lead his supporters not to bother to turn out on Tuesday.
"Make sure that you vote -- O.K.!" Mr. Giuliani bellowed over a public-address system at a Waldbaum's supermarket in Lindenwood, Queens. "We need your help! We need your support! Have a wonderful day!"
For some of the day, Mr. Giuliani, wearing a dark-blue, pin-striped Yankees rain slicker, campaigned from the open back of his bus -- in effect, a street-bound version of a whistle-stop train -- shouting in the rain to motorists and passers-by.
As the bus lurched through the city, Mr. Giuliani waved with one hand and in the other held a cell phone, which he used to conduct an interview. A cabdriver in Manhattan honked hello, and Mr. Giuliani leaned over the railing of his bus. "So you'll vote for me?" the Mayor inquired.
"Yes, definitely."
Mr. Giuliani did not begin explicitly to campaign for re-election until two weeks ago. But he was relaxed and animated inside his campaign bus, which was stocked with a gourmet food basket from the Vinegar Factory and a jack-o'-lantern brimming with candy corn. He bounced around the bus, at one point humming the theme from "Rocky."
Ms. Messinger was forced to do some fast rescheduling because of the rain, searching for venues from which to make her pitch to voters. At the Pathmark in Bedford-Stuyvesant, in a part of the city that is as solidly Democratic as any place, she encountered a mostly, though not uniformly, enthusiastic reception. At the checkout line, Mina Opont, 47, a Democrat, told Ms. Messinger that she found the choice in the election a "tough thing."
"When I put my key in the door, I don't have to look around me," Ms. Opont said. "I used to have to look around me."
Ms. Messinger, who by now is familiar with such encounters, responded: "I know how to be tough on crime. I also know how to be tough on police brutality. I also know kids need a place to go after school."
She received a hearty welcome when, with Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer at her side, she spoke for 10 minutes in unbroken if slow Spanish at a rally in the Bronx. And Ms. Messinger found some respite from the rain as she attended the gala opening of a barbershop owned by the salsa star Tito Nieves.
She climbed into a barber chair and let one of the stylists, Mike Perez, blow-dry and comb her hair, as newspaper photographers snapped to attention.

HEADLINE: President Spends a Weekend With Big Donors

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: AMELIA ISLAND, Fla., Nov. 1

 BODY:
Bill Clinton may think he is underappreciated. But he is not undervalued.
More than 50 people shelled out $50,000 each to spend the weekend schmoozing with him and with Vice President Al Gore here at one of the nation's premiere oceanfront resorts. The money, more than $2.5 million, is to help bail the Democratic National Committee out of debt. 
 The party is reeling from that debt, although the $3 million it has on hand from Mr. Clinton's prolific fund-raising reduces it to about $15 million.
The amount is an intolerable burden for the Democrats, who are trying to recapture the House in 1998. And Mr. Clinton does not want to pass the debt on to the man he sees as his heir, Mr. Gore.
The weekend event here was believed to be the first of its kind, in which a sitting President and Vice President lent themselves out not just for a half-hour over coffee or an hour at lunch but for a full weekend, including two nights in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, where the Presidential suite goes for $1,500 a night.
The weekend was also noteworthy for the price of admission, a sum that the public-interest group Common Cause skewered as being larger than the annual income of most Americans.
"The event represents the buying and selling of access to the highest officials of the land and is an affront to average Americans," said Ann McBride, president of Common Cause, which is based in Washington.
But the President was blunt on Friday night about why cash is important. "Usually at the end of these campaigns," he told contributors in Boca Raton, where he raised $600,000 at dinner, "the party with the most money wins."
Today the President joined in three panel discussions with about two dozen donors each. He then took to the emerald fairways on the island's white-sand beaches, famous for the challenge presented by the breeze off the ocean.
Mr. Gore was due for a dinner and a songfest by Art Garfunkel. The Vice President is to join discussions on Sunday while Mr. Clinton campaigns in New York and New Jersey for Democratic candidates.
What donors did not count on was that the President would be unable to speak, having lost his voice to allergies and excessive use. But the point of this retreat for high-rollers was not so much to hear the President as for the President to hear them.
"Your command of the details is remarkable," George Munoz, president and chief executive officer of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, told the President after a discussion on the economy.
Bob Lynch, president and chief executive officer of Americans for the Arts, told Mr. Clinton at the end of a workshop that his policy analysis had been useful. And at a workshop on the arts with Mr. Clinton, Skeets Friedkin, wife of Monte Friedkin, a Florida industrialist and major Democratic contributor (he recently pledged $250,000), said: "I like to use a different part of my brain, instead of just my pocketbook."
Party officials assured the donors all weekend that it was their brains the party was after.
"People, donors and citizens alike, like to be respected for what they have to offer intellectually," Steven Grossman, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in an interview.
The Democrats know that events like this expose them to charges of brazenness and hypocrisy. But the debt is so steep, money-givers said, that the President must risk the criticism and intense scrutiny that he and his party have received in the Congress and the press for their fund-raising practices.
"It's total desperation," said one top Democratic fund-raiser who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The donors are so traumatized that no one wants to give to the party, and the party has high expenses. If this were a commercial enterprise, they would have been bankrupt a long time ago."
The party line here is that the Republicans undertook a deliberate strategy to bankrupt the Democrats and succeeded by unfairly tying them up in knots over their 1996 fund-raising practices.
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said that half of the party's debt resulted from defending itself in Congressional investigations and that Democrats were not going to take it anymore.
In a thundering speech at lunch today, he accused Republicans of reveling in an "orgasm of righteousness" over their portrayal of Democrats as sleazy. "We're going to resist any strategy that takes the resources of this party and diverts them to that kind of a false charge," Mr. Romer said.
Mr. Romer aggressively asserted that there was nothing unseemly about the weekend's $50,000 price and said that by allowing reporters into the events, this was "the most open political fund-raiser America's ever had." (Mr. Clinton still had a chance to talk privately with donors, in casual conversations after the panels and out on the golf course.)
Many of the big donors, like Bill Titelman, a lawyer from Harrisburg, Pa., said they expected nothing in exchange for their money. "I came to express by my physical presence my support for them," Mr. Titelman said of the President and Vice President. "I didn't need this," he said, gesturing to a plate of grilled chicken, "to give." Mr. Clinton appears ever bolder in his fund-raising, spending more time with wealthy donors and seeking their money while calling for an end to a system he exploits. He seems eager to erase not only the debt but any suggestion that it is his legacy.
Speaking on Friday to 20 people who paid about $10,000 each to have lunch with him in West Palm Beach, he suggested that the party should appreciate him for improving its image.
"In the '98 elections going forward," he said, "people will not be able to paint this sort of gnarled, twisted picture of Democrats anymore. You can't say we're weak on foreign policy and national defense. You can't say we can't be trusted to manage the economy. You can't say we're spending the country blind."
He bristled at the notion that he had merely co-opted Republican policies and passed them off as his own. He told the contributors that on Thursday night he happened to be re-reading an article he wrote in 1988 and it "basically sounds like the speeches I'm giving today."
But he also admitted today that he had "completely failed" to sell Americans on one important part of his economic program, a trade bill that Congress is voting on next week.
"When my voice is working, sometimes I get credit for being a reasonably effective communicator," the President said to 27 executives gathered in a small meeting room.
"According to every public opinion survey, I have completely failed to convince a substantial majority of American people of the importance of trade to our economic development," he said.
Tonight, Mr. Clinton told the contributors that the political debate in America had become stale and meaningless, but he claimed credit for changing its nature. "I very much hope that the simplistic anti-government reactionary approach had its last gasp in the Republican Congressional victory of 1994," he said.

Over the past decade, that revered American institution, the small farm, has gradually taken on some of the characteristics of that all-American obsession: the theme park. Agritainment, also known as agritourism, is the latest gambit in small-farm survival tactics. 1
 
A Growth Industry in Prisons
Increasingly, economically pressed communities are opening their doors to prison construction, none more so than Fremont County, Colo., where 18 percent of the population resides in one of 13 prisons. 20
 
Easy Path for Many Mayors
Buoyed by economic prosperity and declining crime rates, mayors in many of the nation's largest cities appear to be gliding toward easy re-election on Tuesday, a striking turnabout given that only a decade or so ago, some of those cities were considered all but ungovernable. The improved mood among voters may offer a hint of what to expect in the 1998 elections. 24
 
Can Au Pairs Be Nannies?
In the wake of a Massachusetts trial that helped spark a national debate on child care, debate has swirled on this question: Are au pairs too young and inexperienced to care for young children? 20

An Adoption Odyssey
Richard and Karen Thorne, the couple from the Phoenix area who were arrested May 28 and accused of beating and verbally assaulting their adopted girls on a plane ride, spoke of the adoption odyssey that changed their lives, in their first in-depth interview since the arrest. 37
 
From Blight to Rebirth
In the 1970's, the South Bronx had become the definition of urban blight, nearly destroyed by poverty, crime and arson. But that picture began to change late in the 1980's with the construction of thousands of new homes. With the price of those homes, which had originally sold for $49,500 to $60,000, now valued in the $200,000 range, the transformation appears complete. 37
 
A Quiet Fright Night
Despite the specter of gang-related mayhem that kept thousands of children away from classes on Friday, city officials said that there had been no incidents of gang violence in any of the five boroughs on Halloween. There were only two homicides on Friday, neither of them related to the holiday or to gang activity, the police said. And the rash of gang-related slashings that officials warned might descend on the city never materialized. 39

HEADLINE: China's New Generation Wants to Join the World;
Lost American Jobs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An Oct. 29 Business Day article suggests that American businesses can "shrug off" the tumult in Asian currencies and stocks. However, American labor may not be so lucky, as it faces the potential loss of even more low-skilled manufacturing jobs as a result. 
 For a decade, Asia's tigers have been governed by the dictum of former Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore: Asians need discipline, not democracy. American businesses happily took advantage of this ethos -- low wages with militaries used to break strikes in places like Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
The Clinton Administration's strategy of "commercial diplomacy" was supposed to bring on stream tens of thousands of good jobs for Americans, resulting from huge infrastructure projects in the region. These projects are now on hold indefinitely. Can't policy makers resist the importunings of corporations and their antidemocratic allies?

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Helping a Few Taxpayers At the Expense of Many?

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
REPUBLICAN Congressional leaders say their bill to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service, which President Clinton now supports, will protect people from abuse by the tax agency. But as tax practitioners take a close look at the bill, they see changes very different from what the politicians see.
The Taxpayer Bill of Rights 3, as House Republicans call the measure, also seeks to overhaul the governance of the I.R.S. Politicians of both parties are vying to show their commitment to helping individual taxpayers in disputes over taxes. 
 Tax experts across the country say the practical benefits of the bill will be minor, with a big chunk of the expected $2.6 billion in reduced taxes over five years going to businesses. Indeed, only a tiny number of people, perhaps just a few hundred, will benefit -- and then at the expense of added burdens for perhaps a million taxpayers a year.
"Most of the bill's provisions are very limited and will not have a significant impact on most taxpayers," said Stuart E. Seigel, a tax partner at Arnold & Porter and former chief counsel of the I.R.S.
The centerpiece of the bill is a shift in the legal burden of proof in tax disputes, so that taxpayers are presumed to be in the right and the I.R.S. must show otherwise. But tax litigators say that change will directly benefit no more than 28,000 taxpayers annually, and perhaps only a few hundred, out of the 115 million people who file individual income tax returns.
The burden will shift only in civil tax disputes, and only in disputes about facts and not those about the law. And the shift would occur only after the disputes get into court and only if the taxpayer has fully cooperated with the I.R.S. It applies to individuals, partnerships worth less than $4 million and corporations worth less than $7 million.
Tax litigators and former I.R.S. lawyers say about one million taxpayers a year will face added burdens because the I.R.S. will demand more documents during audits. That way, it will be ready to bear the burden of proof in cases that end up in court.
"What we are engaged in here is symbolism, not substance," said Edward Zelinsky, a visiting professor of law at Columbia University who has written influential commentaries on tax policy. "I would be impressed that something substantial was being done if the bill was accompanied by investments in training and technology that will make the I.R.S. operate in a modern way."
Mr. Siegel, the former I.R.S. chief counsel, said "the well-intentioned provision to shift the burden of proof" would expand litigation, with judges conducting "mini-trials over whether you cooperated fully."
Elliott H. Kajan, a tax litigator in Beverly Hills, Calif., said the shift would affect only a few Tax Court cases, such as when the only evidence of a deduction is the taxpayer's word. An example would be when a fire destroys a receipt for cash given to a charity whose records are also lost.
Under current law, taxpayers lose such cases, he said, but "the taxpayer will have a better shot in court -- if they are a credible witness."
Kenneth Kies, chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, said the provision's real significance would be in helping taxpayers negotiate better terms with the I.R.S. before going to court, a change he estimated would result in $795 million less tax revenue over the next five years.
Enrolled agents -- tax preparers who are authorized to represent taxpayers before the I.R.S. -- say they do not believe that most I.R.S. audits will become more onerous because of the shift in burden.
"Shifting the burden of proof is a very good development at least in having taxpayers feel that the system is not rigged against them," said Joseph Lane of Menlo Park, Calif., the head of the government affairs committee of the National Association of Enrolled Agents.
The most significant feature of the bill, tax experts agreed, helps divorced spouses -- mainly women -- who get a tax bill for income their spouse hid during their marriage or from deductions their spouse knew to be illegal. "Innocent spouses," as they are known, could get off the hook for most taxes owed on joint returns.
Another significant provision extends the lawyer-client privilege to accountants and enrolled agents. Supporters say the provision grants moderate- and low-income people the same advantages as those who can afford tax lawyers.
A NUMBER of experts said they were concerned about a provision restricting the use of so-called economic reality audits to instances where the I.R.S. has "a reasonable indication" to suspect unreported income.
In an economic reality audit, I.R.S. agents try to show that an individual cannot support his way of life with the income shown on his tax return -- for example, a taxpayer with a mansion and yacht whose tax return lists a modest income.
Donald C. Alexander, who headed the I.R.S. during the Nixon Administration, said he was troubled that the provision might inhibit aggressive enforcement against tax evaders, who, he said, drive up the burden on honest taxpayers.
"This should be called the mobsters and drug dealers tax relief act of 1997," agreed Lee A. Sheppard, a tax lawyer who critiques tax law and court decisions for Tax Notes, the policy magazine.
Some experts also expressed concern about a provision allowing taxpayers to collect up to $100,000 in damages when they win a tax dispute and prove negligence by the I.R.S.
Jeff Trinca, who was chief of staff for the National Commission on Restructuring the I.R.S., said that he favors damage awards, but that " 'negligence' is an incredibly low standard."
"I think the right answer is to require proof of outrageous or purposeful acts," he said.
Others pointed with concern to a provision inserted at the behest of restaurant owners. The bill prohibits the I.R.S. from threatening an audit of a restaurant or its owners for their refusal to sign an agreement requiring food servers to report all of their income from tips. The I.R.S. says its studies show that under-reporting of income is a big problem in all cash businesses -- and is rampant among waiters and bartenders.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 9, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about legislation to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service misstated the proposal's scope. Tax experts expect that only a few hundred taxpayers a year will benefit from provisions shifting the burden of proof in Tax Court cases to the Government, but larger numbers stand to benefit from other aspects of the proposal. A letter from Bill Archer, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, appears today on page 44.

HEADLINE: Looking Back At Forward Thinkers

BYLINE: BY WILLIAM H. HONAN; William H. Honan writes about higher education for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Education is at the top of almost everyone's agenda these days.
President Clinton, who rarely misses an opportunity to talk about what he calls "my No. 1 priority for the next four years," has promoted a series of initiatives, from national educational standards to the Hope Scholarship tax credit for college students. 
 Meanwhile, House Speaker Newt Gingrich is campaigning for programs like school tuition vouchers to give children from low-income families public funds to attend private schools.
Other Federal and local leaders are talking about issues from charter schools and better teacher training in the lower grades to reducing or eliminating faculty tenure in higher education.
As we consider the merits of these proposals, it may be instructive to look back at some of the century's innovative thinkers and doers who forged the path that brought us here. The following list was suggested by interviews with leading educators, historians and other scholars. It includes a philanthropist (Andrew Carnegie) and a crusading union leader (Albert Shanker), who elevated the social and economic status of teachers. Although the progress was welcome, some critics are questioning whether faculties have become too powerful.
Also included are a Harvard professor (Charles William Eliot), a Columbia philosopher (John Dewey) and an early childhood educator (Maria Montessori), who revolutionized the what and the how of education, and set the stage for current battles over curriculum. Joining them are a lawyer (Thurgood Marshall), a state legislator (Annette Polly Williams) and a college president (Benjamin E. Mays), who fought for opportunities in education for minorities, a struggle that remains bitter.
And the list also features a university president (Clark Kerr) who established the modern state-supported "multiversity" system that budget-conscious legislators are wrestling with today.
These are by no means the only movers and shakers of the century, but some of the more provocative leaders on whose shoulders the future is being built.
 
Charles William Eliot
Choose Your Own Classes
It would not be wrong to name almost any of this century's presidents of Harvard University as an Olympian in higher education. But the tallest of these giants was Charles William Eliot (1834-1926).
A Boston-bred Unitarian, Eliot was the president of Harvard University for 40 years, beginning in 1879. His greatest achievement was the establishment and defense of the "free elective system," which let college students choose their own courses. The only graduation requirements were a foreign language and freshman English.
Before Eliot's revolution, students had to memorize their lessons and recite them mechanically when called on. Course offerings, heavy on Latin and Greek, theology and the kings of England, were cut and dried.
In time, Eliot's free-elective system was reined in, as students at Harvard and elsewhere were increasingly required to major in one area, in addition to taking a variety of courses. But shopping for courses remains an essential feature of undergraduate education at Harvard and many other colleges and universities.
W. B. Carnochan, a historian of higher education at Stanford University, likens Eliot's academic revolution to the French Revolution of 1789. Eliot's program "was so far-reaching and his tenure so long," Carnochan has written, "that American higher education has never been the same after him."
 
Andrew Carnegie
Making Teaching More Attractive
He is well known for his lavish gifts to colleges and universities and for founding no fewer than 2,800 libraries across the country. But one of Andrew Carnegie's least remembered philanthropies may be his most telling: He started a retirement program for college teachers that helped to attract many first-rate intellects to the profession.
A Scotsman who immigrated to the United States when he was 12, Carnegie (1835-1919) made a fortune in iron and steel manufacturing before he turned 40. He once recalled his shock at discovering that college teachers were paid "only about as much as office clerks," making it virtually impossible for them to save for retirement. When Carnegie heard about retired professors or their widows in desperate circumstances, he frequently helped support them.
In 1905, he established a $10 million free pension fund for professors, which, he said, should improve the lives of those in "the least rewarded of all the professions."
In 1918, he went a step further by helping to establish the first nationwide self-supporting and portable financial system in which college professors could invest for their retirement. The organization, today called the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association -- College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF), is now the biggest pension system in the nation, with assets of $200 billion and over two million participants.
 
John Dewey
Keeping Education Practical
The followers of John Dewey said he was the equal of Socrates. That may smack of hyperbole, but it reflects the passions Dewey aroused a generation ago.
With 40 books, more than 700 articles and countless lectures, Dewey (1859-1952) conceived, and became the leading publicist of, a new approach to education. His revolution went by many names, from instrumentalism and pragmatism to progressive education, but it centered on the notion that a broad public education is an essential component of democracy. He condemned elitism and abstract metaphysics, favoring creativity, free-spiritedness and practicality in teaching.
Alan Ryan, a Dewey scholar at Oxford University, has written that Dewey, a teacher from Burlington, Vt., was no dry or reserved clinician but was "driven by a passion for the spiritual wholeness and psychological integration that the Romantic poets had celebrated."
After testing his ideas in the Laboratory School at the University of Chicago, Dewey moved to Columbia University in 1904, where he taught philosophy until his retirement in 1930.
Some of Dewey's radicalism can best be understood through his long-running quarrel with John M. Hutchins, the president of the University of Chicago. Since the turn of the century, Dewey had been stressing the need for uniting vocational and academic instruction. In 1936, Hutchins challenged Dewey in his book "The Higher Learning in America," arguing that the college curriculum should be focused on broad, abstract principles, like those found in the works of Aristotle, Aquinas and other great scholars. Such a "great books" curriculum would leave no room for practical or vocational subjects.
Dewey struck back. Hutchins's approach, he declared, would lead to "the greatest possible aloofness of higher education from contemporary social life." Furthermore, Dewey said, the approach was elitist and fundamentally undemocratic. If higher education was to be relevant, it must concern itself with current social problems and help to solve them.
Often, Dewey's language was so fuzzy that it was incomprehensible, but he could also be pungent, provocative and even inflammatory, with statements like these:
"Education becomes the art of taking advantage of the helplessness of the young." And, "The inert, stupid quality of current customs perverts learning into willingness to follow where others point the way, into conformity, constriction, surrender of skepticism and experiment."
Dewey could bring conservatives to a boil when he praised the educational accomplishments of the Russian revolutionaries Lenin and Trotsky. On the other hand, he was little comfort to liberals when he remarked, "The slogans of the liberalism of one period often become the bulwarks of reaction in a subsequent era."
Some of these battles, like the importance of relevance, still kindle debate today. But if many of Dewey's ideas seem old hat, that is largely because they have become widely accepted.
 
Maria Montessori
Stimulating Children's Senses
In a typical preschool classroom, you see brightly colored blocks, objects covered with sandpaper to stimulate touch and rows of beads that faintly suggest arithmetical concepts.
The teacher is not so much instructing as allowing children to pursue their own interests: deftly encouraging one, questioning another and laughing with a third.
Such an environment, commonplace today, reflects the influence of Maria Montessori (1870-1952), a physician and educator who gave her name (and philosophy) to thousands of schools for young children around the world.
The concepts guiding Montessori schools are that children must not be spoonfed knowledge but should discover it for themselves; that the senses must be developed by working with the hands; that grades, rewards and punishments must be eliminated, and that children should learn to discipline themselves.
After becoming the first woman to graduate from an Italian medical school, Montessori began teaching retarded children in the slums of Rome. There, she made a surprising discovery: by stimulating the tactile sense of the children, encouraging them to express themselves and never hurrying, rewarding or punishing them, she could teach many to read and write. Later, she used these methods to educate other poor children.
After publishing a book in 1909 about her technique and its results, which was hailed by educators around the world, Montessori devoted herself to writing, traveling and organizing a worldwide network of schools.
Montessori's critics argued then, and have continued to maintain, that her method emphasizes working with the hands at the expense of intellectual development and creativity. Nonetheless, the "Montessori miracle" continues to have a wide following.
 
Franklin D. Roosevelt
Opening University Doors
The contributions to education by the 32d President of the United States are not nearly as well known as his efforts to end the Depression, sponsor the Social Security program and lead the Allies to victory in World War II. Yet Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945) played a crucial role in two profound developments in higher education.
First, he conceived, and urged Congress to adopt, the G.I. Bill of Rights, which opened the doors of higher education to the middle class. Second, he commissioned a wartime report that led the Federal Government to support the nation's great research universities.
In November 1942, while the United States was still reeling from the Pearl Harbor attack, President Roosevelt invited a panel of leading educators to develop a program to benefit returning servicemen and women after the end of the war.
Roosevelt's panel came up with a number of recommendations designed to help approximately 10 million veterans adapt to peacetime. There were low-cost home mortgages, unemployment insurance, job placement services and, critically, educational grants.
The following summer, Roosevelt asked Congress to establish the program. After a hard-fought battle, he prevailed, and the Serviceman's Readjustment Act, commonly known as the G.I. Bill of Rights, became law in 1944.
Turning his attention to the research universities later that year, Roosevelt asked Vannevar Bush, his wartime director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, to propose ways in which "the vision, boldness and drive" of scientific research that was helping to win the war could be harnessed to provide "a fuller and more fruitful life" in time of peace.
Bush's report, "Science: The Endless Frontier," argued that the nation's health, economy and military security must be constantly nourished by new scientific knowledge, and that it was the responsibility of the Federal Government to provide the necessary financial support.
Bush's vision, although hotly debated in Congress, soon became the blueprint for the establishment of the National Science Foundation, the Federal agency that would award grants, contracts and fellowships, mainly to research universities.
Since its founding in 1950, some $37 billion have been poured into the agency, and it has produced not only nuclear warheads, rockets and missiles but also polio vaccines, pacemakers, computers, semiconductors and lasers.
Roosevelt died before he received Bush's report, but there can be little doubt that in commissioning it, he had seen the future.
 
Thurgood Marshall
Reading, Writing and Race
He has many claims to fame, including being the first black Justice of the United States Supreme Court. But in the field of education, Thurgood Marshall is remembered for his achievement as a lawyer.
It was while serving as counsel to the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund that Marshall became the architect of the legal strategy that in 1954 led to the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, which outlawed segregation in American public schools.
Although considerable gains in desegregation resulted, much have since been eroded. (A Harvard University study released last April indicated that the rate of resegregation is rapid.) Nevertheless, Marshall boldly raised the consciousness of the nation.
His argument before the Supreme Court concerned the constitutionality of the so-called "separate but equal" system of racial segregation then practiced in the public schools of 21 states.
Marshall presented the case in his plain-spoken manner. At one point during the argument, Justice Felix Frankfurter asked Marshall what he meant by "equal."
In a memorable response, Marshall replied, "Equal means getting the same thing, at the same time, and in the same place."
In later years, Marshall was annoyed by the glorification of past accomplishments in race relations. "Take it from me," he said. "We haven't won yet."
 
Benjamin E. Mays
Fighting Religiously For Equal Rights
Benjamin E. Mays, the president of Morehouse College in Atlanta, inspired a host of civil rights advocates, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.; Julian Bond, the former Georgia State Senator; Louis W. Sullivan, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services; Maynard H. Jackson, the first black mayor of Atlanta, and Walter Massey, former director of the National Science Foundation and current president of Morehouse.
"He was at the center of the movement and inspired a generation," said John Hope Franklin, the historian.
The son of former slaves, Mays (1894-1984) was ordained a Baptist minister and served as dean of the Howard University Divinity School, where he gained an international reputation as an educator and lecturer. But his importance lies not so much in his scholarship as in the force of his personality and ideas.
Between 1940 and 1967, while he presided over Morehouse, a historically black college for men, he preached the gospel of racial equality and social justice. Mays got to know his students (and they him) at Tuesday morning lectures in which he stressed intellectual excellence, religious piety and a commitment to racial advancement. A firm believer in integration, he freely criticized American religious institutions for not speaking out against segregation.
"A religion which ignores social problems will in time be doomed," he said.
Mays and the young Martin Luther King Jr. became close through their frequent, lively discussions. One subject of common interest was the philosophy of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who liberated his country from the grip of British colonialism. Mays had recently visited India to study Gandhi's tactics, and young King was fascinated by what Mays reported. King immediately saw that Gandhi's strategy of Satyagraha -- leading an unarmed multitude in nonviolent protest -- could work for black Americans.
In later years, Mays said his greatest honor was having taught and inspired King. King was quoted as having replied that Mays was "my spiritual mentor and my intellectual father."
 
Clark Kerr
Master Planner for Higher Education
He once wisecracked that a university is "a series of individual entrepreneurs held together by a common grievance over parking."
Clark Kerr, 86, could get away with poking fun at the "multiversities," as he called them, because he was so firmly on their side.
In 1960, while president of the University of California at Berkeley, he conceived a sweeping new plan for state-supported higher education in California. Soon it became a model for the nation.
Under Mr. Kerr's master plan of a defined and disciplined system, the government would for the first time guarantee any high school graduate access to higher education. Two-year community colleges would focus on career preparation; four-year state colleges would provide scholastic training to more able students, and elite, four-year research universities would receive those with the highest academic credentials. The elite universities would pursue the academic "crown jewels": doctorate programs and basic research. A key part of the plan was creating a commission to coordinate the administration of all three types of institutions.
Previously, higher education in the state was divided and scattered. The state community colleges considered themselves an extension of K-12 schools, state colleges were limited to teacher training, and the public research universities were disconnected from the rest.
In recent years, cost-conscious state legislatures have been whittling the size of these institutions in California and elsewhere. Even so, 80 percent of the country's 15 million college students are attending publicly supported colleges and universities patterned after the California master plan.
 
Albert Shanker
Raising the Voice of Teachers
Albert Shanker (1928-1997) transformed the teaching profession as the longtime president of New York City's United Federation of Teachers and its parent organization, the American Federation of Teachers.
Before Shanker, public schoolteachers were largely dutiful employees who took orders and had little say about the institutions in which they taught. Since Shanker, they have become a professional, if still highly criticized, class with clout.
It took eloquence, organizational skill, political deftness -- and, many would say, obstinacy -- for Shanker, a former substitute teacher, to accomplish this change. In 1960, he guided a merged body of teachers' unions, the United Federation, to win the right to bargain for all teachers. He steadily gained pay raises for schoolteachers and helped build professional self-esteem in the rank and file.
Although in recent years, he was known as a respected commentator on educational issues, Shanker earned his reputation for tough-guy stubbornness during the turmoil that surrounded New York City's decentralization crisis in 1968. The controversy, which stirred deep racial and religious antagonism, led to the closing of most of the city's schools for 55 days during the fall term.
For years afterward, Mr. Shanker was often criticized for having tarnished his union's reputation for fairness and racial harmony and for leaving a legacy of tensions between blacks and Jews.
At the time of his death last February, the American Federation of Teachers had 900,000 members, mostly concentrated in the big cities across the nation. Membership in the U.T.F. is about 85,000.
 
Joan Ganz Cooney
How Big Bird Came to Count
As the originator of the preschool educational series "Sesame Street," in which puppets teach children to talk, read and count, Ms. Cooney, 68, not only created a new art form, she also shaped the teaching of young schoolchildren. Today, "Sesame Street" reaches an estimated 235 million viewers each week in more than 85 countries. In the United States, the series is broadcast by some 300 stations of the Public Broadcasting Service.
In 1966, Ms. Cooney, then a young television producer, was asked by the Carnegie Corporation to prepare a report on the possible use of television to educate young children. Her report became the blueprint for "Sesame Street," which made its debut in November 1969.
The cast, including Jim Henson's Muppets -- Big Bird, Kermit the Frog and other whimsical characters -- quickly won the hearts of adults as well as children.
What was unique about "Sesame Street" was the way it weaved puppets, animation and live actors into an interracial tapestry that delivered educational messages.
"When I began to study the potential uses of television for preschool children," she said in a recent interview, "I was aware of the fact that children all across the United States were singing advertising jingles. I wanted 'Sesame Street' to do the same thing for reading, writing and arithmetic."
In 1995, Ms. Cooney was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
 
Allan Bloom
The Fight Over Multiculturalism
In 1987, Allan Bloom, then a shy, retiring translator of Plato and Rousseau at the University of Chicago, shook academe to its foundations when he argued in his book "The Closing of the American Mind" (Simon & Schuster) that the capitulation of college and university administrations to the demands of the student, feminist and black power movements in the 1960's and 70's had fatally compromised higher education.
Writing with glee and deliberate hyperbole, Bloom (1930-1992) compared radical feminism to the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution, dismissed the anthropologist Margaret Mead as a "sexual adventurer," compared Woodstock nation to Hitler's Nuremberg rallies and denounced "cultural relativism," which sees all cultures as equal, as an intellectual heresy.
At first, "The Closing of the American Mind" earned praise from critics of almost all persuasions. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The New York Times declared that the book hit the reader with the force of "electric-shock therapy." Joseph Coates, writing in The Chicago Tribune, went even further, saying the book "may be the most important work of its kind by an American since World War II."
As some came to call his book a new conservative bible, "The Closing of the American Mind" was also scorned for its polemical approach and conservative bias by the likes of Derek Bok, the Harvard University president; the educational philosopher Mortimer Adler, and Kenneth Tollett, a professor of higher education at Howard University.
All this suggests that Bloom's greatest accomplishment may have been an irrefutable demonstration that the American university, above all else, is keeping the world safe for controversy.
 
Paulo Freire
The Politics Of Reading
The radical Brazilian educator Paulo Freire (1922-1997), considered by many scholars to be among the most influential theorists of his time, deplored what he famously called "the banking conception" of teaching. This conventional approach, he said mockingly, is based on the idea that the brain of the student is a piggy bank and that the job of the teacher is "an act of depositing knowledge."
The banking conception, Freire argued in his best-selling book, "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" (Continuum, 1970), is "a characteristic of the ideology of oppression," which "negates education and knowledge as a process of inquiry."
Working for years with Brazilian laborers and peasants in literacy campaigns in the country's impoverished northeast, Freire developed what he considered an enlightened approach. Like Socrates, he engaged in a dialogue with his students, using everyday words, tacitly acknowledging that he could learn from his students as well.
In teaching, Freire seized upon loaded terms like rich, poor and landlord. By the late 1980's, many black, Hispanic and feminist organizations in the United States had embraced his methods in literacy campaigns.
As one American educator put it in 1994, Freire espoused a "pedagogy of liberation."
But effective as his teaching techniques proved to be, many of his countrymen feared Freire as a subversive. He was jailed in 1964 and then exiled for the next 15 years. Living in Chile and Nicaragua and in nations of Portuguese-speaking Africa, he published and lectured widely. In 1980, he returned to Brazil under a political amnesty.
John Devine, a professor of education at New York University who teaches a course in Freire's life and work, considers him "the dominant figure in education in the last half of the 20th century."
Freire was scheduled to teach at Harvard this fall, but died of a heart attack in May.
 
Annette Polly Williams
Vouchers in Our Future?
The concept of vouchers, if not the word, has been around for decades. The G.I. Bill of 1944 was an early voucher program in that it authorized the Government to give checks to individual students, who were then free to spend them at public or private colleges of their choice.
In recent years, the use of taxpayer money to provide private education for poor public school students has become a major political issue. Some politicians, including national Republican leaders, and many parent advocates argue that the competition for students will stimulate and improve failing urban school systems. Others, including President Clinton and other groups of parent advocates, argue that vouchers will drain vital funds from hard-pressed public schools, and that private schools will not be accountable to the public.
One of the most successful champions of school vouchers is Annette Polly Williams, 60, the Democratic state legislator from Milwaukee who wrote the Wisconsin school voucher program that became law in 1990.
"People with money have always been able to choose schools for their children," said Ms. Williams, who represents a largely black constituency in Milwaukee. "They can afford to send their children to private schools, or they can buy expensive houses in communities that have good schools. What this law does is put power in the hands of poor people. Now they can choose."
The Milwaukee program, like a newer, larger program in Cleveland, has been challenged in the courts. But the sheer longevity of the program, which now provides vouchers to some 2,000 students, assures it a place in education history. (The fate of either or both programs may be determined by the United States Supreme Court).
The Wisconsin law provides vouchers, worth $4,300 each year, in private, nonsectarian schools. But Ms. Williams and others are seeking to expand the legislation to include sectarian schools, as the Cleveland program does.
Similar voucher programs are under consideration by more than a dozen state legislatures; the latest plan is the Republican-sponsored measure to establish such a program in the District of Columbia.
"I got the idea of choice for low-income families back in the 1970's, when I sent my four kids to the Urban Day School, a private school," Ms. Williams recalled. "It had high expectations for the students, and that made all the difference."

PUERTO RICO
 The Trials of the Oldest Colony
 in the World.
 By Jose Trias Monge.
 Illustrated. 228 pp. New Haven:
 Yale University Press. $35. 
 Americans are not famous for their knowledge of other lands. Brazilians visiting the United States are often dismayed to be asked where in Africa their country lies. Austrian tourists regularly report having to insist to curious American hosts that there are no kangaroos in their native land. Puerto Ricans suffer greatly in this regard. Although Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States almost a hundred years ago, most Americans know little about the island beyond a vague sense that it is "ours," but not exactly part of "us."
"Puerto Rico: The Trials of the Oldest Colony in the World," by Jose Trias Monge, is a useful antidote to this ignorance. Monge presents a pithy account of Puerto Rico's troubled 500-year history while also setting out a carefully reasoned case for a new approach to the perennially unresolved issue of Puerto Rico's status vis-a-vis the United States. A former Chief Justice of Puerto Rico, Monge distills a lifetime of work in Puerto Rico's legal and political affairs into this slim, incisive volume.
"Puerto Rico" wakes up the reader early on with some stark facts. Despite Federal aid expenditures on Puerto Rico of approximately $9 billion per year (close to the total amount of United States aid to the rest of the world combined), 60 percent of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty line, crime is far worse than in the United States, drug transshipment through Puerto Rico to the United States is rampant and Puerto Rican political life is increasingly polarized and angry.
Monge proceeds with dispatch through the historical chapters to his central argument: United States-Puerto Rican relations are in a debilitating rut. The endless debates on the island over the three main options -- statehood, independence or heightened commonwealth status -- are going nowhere. Plebiscites in Puerto Rico, though appealing in principle, have done little to settle the issue.
The root problem, Monge asserts, is that owing to the many limitations on its sovereignty, Puerto Rico remains effectively a colony of the United States. He uses the emotive term "colony" with caution, expressly not in "the usual, vituperative sense" that implies economic exploitation but as a way of highlighting Washington's "unnecessary retention of excessive power over Puerto Rico." The longstanding United States avowal that it merely wants to respect the wishes of Puerto Ricans has become, in his view, a policy of avoidance. "One cannot indulge in heady talk about self-determination . . . unless one defines the range of possibilities and is ready to listen to the choice of the people."
Washington, Monge argues, must establish Puerto Rico's sovereignty and decouple that step from decisions about the island's ultimate status. He sets out a number of concrete approaches for "decolonization" and then offers a careful analysis of both the various options for Puerto Rico's ultimate status and the exact nature of the United States interests at stake.
Judicial at every turn, Monge is sure-footed in treacherously politicized terrain. He credits the United States with generosity and criticizes Puerto Rico's political elites for short-sightedness. Yet he is adamant on a basic point: "The issue should not be whether further powers of self-government should graciously be extended to the colonies, but rather, what powers do the dependencies want to entrust to the former empire. . . . Nobody has the right to govern another: it is as simple as that."
Monge strengthens his arguments by highlighting the ways many other Caribbean islands have achieved both greater wealth than Puerto Rico and either full independence from their former colonial masters or full integration with them. He also describes how other United States territories with smaller populations, like Guam, have enjoyed greater autonomy than Puerto Rico.
Monge's reasoning is relentless. Yet one leaves this thoughtful book with the unpleasant suspicion that logic alone, no matter how compelling, will not be enough to rouse the United States Government to unstick this policy problem. Far too many times in the past Washington has persisted in ignoring growing troubles in other lands until they deteriorate into crises. It seems unlikely that Puerto Rico will escape this deeper form of American ignorance about the world.

 BODY:

A FEELING FOR BOOKS
The Book-of-the-Month Club, Literary Taste and Middle-Class Desire
By Janice A. Radway
Illustrated. 424 pages. The University of North Carolina Press. $29.95.
 In "A Feeling for Books," Janice A. Radway, a professor of literature at Duke University, acutely describes a dilemma that must surely be familiar to anyone who has ever been in love with reading. On the one hand, she was aware of the almost physical pleasure of being transported by a book. For her, this awareness went back to a time in her youth when she was recovering from surgery. She would escape her sense of confinement by reading a collection of books from her local library that happened to comprise many Book-of-the-Month Club selections. 
 On the other hand, after her passion for reading had led her into the academy and taught her to deal with what she calls "the esthetic complexities of true literature," she found herself ashamed of her enjoyment of popular reading, which she kept up with by finally joining the Book-of-the-Month Club and secretly reading its selections at night.
How to resolve this dilemma? Ms. Radway decided she would follow up a book she had written on why women read romances ("Reading the Romance") by exploring the subjects summed up in the subtitle of her new book, "The Book-of-the-Month Club, Literary Taste and Middle-Class Desire." She would combine autobiography, ethnography, sociology, economic history and literary criticism, and hope thereby to fuse her tastes into a whole.
She would begin by visiting the Book-of-the-Month Club offices, where she found a congenial world that mirrored her academic one in its love of books, except that here books were looked upon as tools to serve readers instead of hierarchical esthetic objects to be studied for themselves. Yet this world was threatened, she found. Time Inc. had recently acquired the club and was trying to stanch an increasing loss of members by introducing more aggressive marketing techniques. Ms. Radway would see in this threat a conflict that went deep into the American past, which she explores in the main part of the book.
This investigation is too complex to do more than touch upon it here. The animating force of the conflict she sees was the accelerating means of production and distribution that dominated the American economy in the era following the Civil War. By the early 20th century, this advancing capitalism had divided the book world into two opposing camps. On one side were mass-market works of instruction and entertainment created by anonymous hack writers under the direction of enterprising editors. On the other side were unique works of high literature that were created by distinguished authors, judged by independent-minded critics and interpreted by discriminating scholars.
The genius of the Book-of-the-Month Club, Ms. Radway writes, was to reintegrate the book world by disentangling "the notion of the new from the concept of the uniquely occurring," that is, by showing that "the new could be understood as amenable to infinite variation and repetition."
By first persuading readers to buy a stream of books and then using its committee of judges to individualize them, the club became "a system in perpetual motion" that "was nothing more or less than the application of the modern logic of integration to the realm of book production and distribution." By seizing the space between high literature and the low, the club had invented middlebrow reading.
Understandably, the new system posed a threat, Ms. Radway concedes, which was why the club aroused such extreme hostility. Critics might have complained that in choosing the best books by committee, the club was turning culture into a commodity. What was really going on, Ms. Radway insists, was an expression of fear by a combination of the dying pre-Civil War elite and a rising professional-managerial class that their turf was being invaded. After all, the seemingly independent critics who attacked the club also "dispensed advice and opinions about cultural goods available on the market." It was a case of the upper part of the face calling the forehead middlebrow.
Ms. Radway never does resolve the division in her view. As she writes in her introduction: "My ambivalence is persistent and real. The effect of the resulting dual perspective is more like that produced by newly acquired bifocals that render the world in fractured form across a disjunctive, arbitrary line."
Through one set of lenses she writes with graceful eloquence of her love of warmblooded books; through the other she peppers her astringent analysis with words like valorize, foregrounded, concretize, habitus, metonymic, auratic and fungibility.
If she calls the book club's critics hypocritical, she accuses the club itself of dressing up its middlebrow product in the trappings of high art. And when, in the last section, she rereads and analyzes at length some of the favorite books of her childhood, "Marjorie Morningstar" by Herman Wouk, "Gods, Graves and Scholars: The Story of Archeology" by C. W. Ceram and "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee, she is struck, as of course she hadn't been the first time she read them, by how much each celebrated men over women and white people over everyone else.
Still, she finally accepts her bifocal vision, which is probably how most of us take in the world of art and entertainment these days. What she sees most clearly is how those middlebrow books she read in her childhood gave her the appetite to keep on reading, until her mind grew powerful enough to produce this deeply penetrating book, which not only lays bare the forces that produced middlebrow reading but also explains a good deal of what is going on in the world of books today.

HEADLINE: Increasingly, Electronic Cooks Are Being Used to Keep the Soup From Spoiling

BYLINE: BY KATE MURPHY 

 BODY:
Care for a digitally developed doughnut? How about an electronically evolved animal cracker? Go ahead and enjoy your favorite packaged snacks, safe in the knowledge that before processed foods and drinks tantalize your taste buds, they have been sampled by electronic chefs to insure that you will go back to the store for more.
Of course, it should be no surprise that automation is now standard in food processing. The wonder is that it took until the 1990's to become so. Until this decade, computers and electronics -- integral to the production of manufactured goods from televisions to airplanes -- were conspicuous by their absence from food processing. 
 But now, computers are taking hold in the food processing industry. The Nabisco unit of RJR Nabisco, along with Philip Morris's Kraft Foods, Nestle, Pepsico's Frito-Lay, Morgan Foods, Kellogg, Quaker Oats and General Mills are among the large food producers that have recently installed sensors to help make their products, according to equipment vendors, automation consultants and the companies.
And while Frito-lay, Nestle and Kraft declined to disclose which of their products were manufactured with the help of electronic sensors, vendors of automated equipment said that everything from packaged puddings to cream-filled cookies to potato chips were now prepared with electronic assistance.
In part, technological improvements have driven the shift. The nettlesome defects that made electronic sensors and other devices unreliable sous-chefs a decade or more ago have largely been corrected.
Economics was the impetus for change. Early in the 1990's, the makers and sellers of automation systems were eager to find a replacement for cyclical markets like the petroleum industry or shrinking markets like shipbuilding. The food industry's relative stability was attractive, so makers of automation equipment have put more effort into meeting the needs of food producers.
"After the recession in the oil industry, we started looking at the food business as a market because it's less volatile: No matter what happens, people have got to eat," said Robert E. Tarrant, assistant director of sales and marketing at the privately held Nametre Company of Metuchen, N.J., which is majority owned by Tytronics Inc., a manufacturer of automation equipment in Bedford, Mass.
Nametre makes a viscosity sensor that was originally used to test the consistency of refined oil products but was modified in 1990 to monitor the thickness of frosting, pudding, salad dressing, whipped topping and the like.
Nametre is one of hundreds of companies that have worked in the last decade to develop more accurate, easily integrated and durable electronic sensing devices that detect everything from the creaminess of sandwich cookie filling to the piquancy of pasta sauce. In Nametre's case, sales have risen to $2.5 million from $752,000 in the last eight years.
Not that human taste tests are a thing of the past. It is just that much of the food being tried out on focus groups has been tried out on electronic sensors first.
In part, the trend toward automation was slowed by the conviction that creating things culinary is a craft. Master bakers are still a fixture on some bread production lines, stretching hunks of dough between clenched fists to insure proper elasticity. But their time may be passing.
"To some extent, processors have become more open to technology lately because those kinds of craftsmen are starting to fade away," said Ted Labuza, professor of food engineering at the University of Minnesota. "No one apprentices anymore to learn that kind of thing."
This realization, coupled with a highly competitive marketplace in which profit margins are typically a slim 5 percent to 6 percent, has enouraged "a movement in the industry away from the art and toward the science of making food," said Mike Werlein, director of electrical systems at Kraft.
Steve Smith, manager of the Computer-Integrated Food Manufacturing Laboratory at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind, said, "Food manufacturers are finally beginning to look to computerized process control instead of human inspection to enhance the quality and safety of their products."
The total market for food processing control instrumentation has doubled in the last 10 years to $2.2 billion worldwide, according to McMahon Technology Associates, a consulting firm in Leonia, N.J. Among the companies providing such equipment are Rockwell International's Rockwell Automation, Honeywell Industrial Automation and Control of Phoenix and Emerson Electric's Fisher-Rosemont Inc. of St. Louis.
The biggest technological advances have come in sensing devices that can help determine and control everything from optimum cooking temperature to product uniformity. And a new generation of sensors can measure more taste-specific variables. For example, Maselli Measurements Inc. of Stockton, Calif., a distributor for Maselli Misure S.P.A. of Italy, sells refractometers, which use light refraction to measure the sweetness of fruit juice, jellies and tomato products like pasta sauce.
The original market for these sensors -- which detect sugar levels by the degree to which light passing through food bends -- was the pharmaceutical industry, which used them to measure soluble solids.
In the past, few if any of the sensors used in the pharmaceutical industry were durable enough to withstand the harsh environment of the food processing plant, where cleaning of food preparation equipment requires powerful pressure washes containing caustic chemicals.
"Now, thanks to better design and materials, sensors can survive that kind of rough treatment," said Douglas Burns, business development manager in the food and beverage division of Rockwell Automation.
Sensors are also far more sensitive and accurate. "The early versions that came out in the '70's and '80's weren't always reliable," said Mr. Smith of Purdue. Temperature variations and flow interruptions would go undetected, sometimes leading to burned or soggy products. However, today's electronic sensing mechanisms set off alarms if the temperature of ovens or ingredients are off by the slightest amount.
And sensors are now equipped with "intelligence" so they can, for example, report when they need to be serviced or make calculations based on values detected.
Developed for the food processing industry, innovative moisture and color sensors made by private companies like the Dantec Systems Corporation of Waterloo, Ontario, and Key Technology Inc. of Walla Walla, Wash., are finding their way onto production lines.
For example, in 1995, Austin Quality Foods, a division of the German cookie maker Bablsen, installed a sensor to monitor the moisture of the 130 million pounds of sandwich crackers and cookies made each year by its bakery in Cary, N.C.
Shi Tien Ting, the engineering manager at Austin Quality Foods, said that before installing the sensor, plant operators ran moisture analyses on just-baked crackers every 15 minutes to make sure they were adequately cooked. The laboratory test takes about 30 minutes to perform, so if the crackers were not right, that meant 30 extra minutes of substandard production before an adjustment could be made.
By contrast, the sensor makes readings continuously and communicates information to a central process logic controller, which regulates oven temperature. According to Mr. Ting, the system -- which cost $100,000 -- has already paid for itself in the "reduction of scrap."
But humans retain a role. The most advanced sensor has the ability to detect only one or two food attributes; a person's taste buds can pick up the thousands of properties responsible for a single food's flavor and texture. "No one's come up with a replacement for the human tongue," Mr. Werlein said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Putting an End to the Taste Test"
Food processing companies have adopted a number of technologies to make the business more efficient.
 
SWEETNESS
Sensors detect the sweetness of juice, for example, using refracted light.
 
OLD TEST
Taste it or submit it to time-consuming laboratory tests.
 
NEW TEST
A sensor measures sugar levels by degree to which light bends passing though juice. Deficiencies as well as excesses are automatically corrected by the addition of more sweetener or water.
 
VISCOSITY
Viscosity sensors determine the consistency of products like pudding using an electric circuit.
 
OLD TEST
Stick a spoon or spatula into a pudding sample.
 
NEW TEST
A sensor maintains a constant vibration that is altered by the thickness of the pudding flowing by. Deviations in the vibration measure the creaminess.
 
PORTIONS
Sensors insure exact measure-ments of ingredients in products like margarine.
 
OLD TEST
A worker holds down a knob for a specified period of time to introduce ingredients. Air pockets and lumps made this method imprecise.
 
NEW TEST
Flow sensors measure the mass of each ingredient, so that every batch is made the same.
 
MOISTURE
Moisture sensors measure how wet foods like cookies are.
 
OLD TEST
Taste it, or submit it to time-consuming laboratory tests.
 
NEW TEST
A moisture sensor bounces radio waves off passing cookies. Moist cookies absorb more waves than crispy ones do, so the sensor is able to identify undercooked batches.

HEADLINE: As Union Pacific Traffic Snarls, So Do Customers

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

 BODY:
For the Huntsman Polymers Corporation on the windswept West Texas prairie in Odessa, the Western rail logjam has been one unending, agonizing squeeze.
Service disruptions in the 36,000-mile network of the Union Pacific Railroad, the country's largest, have created huge backlogs in deliveries of coal, grain, plastics, chemicals, automobiles and other products in much of the nation. They have pushed up natural gas prices by 50 percent in some areas, and created a drag on economic growth. 
 Moreover, the system, which has been hampered by congestion, shortages of equipment and crews and multiple wrecks, could become further strained in the next few weeks as bumper crops of soybeans and corn are harvested.
In response, the Federal Surface Transportation Board in Washington declared a transportation emergency on Friday in the West and ordered Union Pacific to open a section of track to a Texas competitor, the Texas Mexican Railway, to ease the gridlock.
For Huntsman, though, it is not the broad repercussions that are so painful. It is the wrenching frustration of watching its business shrink day by day as its chemical shipments are stalled, lost or stranded.
In the 1950's, it seemed like a good idea to build a sprawling polymer and petrochemical plant in Odesssa where land was cheap and access to rail transportation was easy. But now, being more than 300 miles from the nearest big city creates a monumental challenge.
While some customers agree with Union Pacific that service has been improving lately, Huntsman executives said that if anything, it was getting worse. Because of its site and because it keeps some of its chemicals off the highways for safety reasons, Huntsman has become dependent on Union Pacific rail cars that either show up in large numbers or not at all. Texas companies closer to the Gulf of Mexico can ship by water, while those more centrally situated find it cheaper to use trucks.
Huntsman estimates the problems have cost it more than $7.5 million in lost business and increased shipping costs since the rail glitches began in June. And that is in addition to the headaches of trying to track down errant rail cars and deal with desperate customers who depend on Huntsman's chemicals to make and ship their own products on time. In October, Union Pacific had to negotiate with Mexico to retrieve a Huntsman car filled with polyethylene, which is used to make plastics, that was headed for a small Texas town but somehow wound up in Mexico.
A far more serious blunder took place in the summer when two tank cars loaded with liquid styrene monomer, which is also used to make plastics, spent more than 40 days on the rails -- one in Cora, Ill., and the other in Midland, Mich. -- before the loads became unstable and released vapor in late August. About 4,000 Michigan residents were ordered to stay in their homes while crews stabilized the cargo.
David Parkin, the Huntsman executive in charge of tracking rail cars, showed a letter from one customer notifying Huntsman that it would start buying from another supplier because of delivery delays. That customer has since taken its $400,000-a-month business to a company on the East Coast, he said.
Huntsman shipped some chemicals by truck, Mr. Parkin said, but that increases costs three to four times.
Johnny W. Lasiter, the plant manager in Odessa, now begins his workday by checking to see whether any rail cars have arrived. When cars come late, crews have to work into the night to fill them. "Half the time the last couple months, we've had to load on Sundays," he added.
Mr. Lasiter, who has worked at the plant for 20 years, said he had never seen a rail disruption like this.
While Union Pacific said that it was getting its problems under control, the Chemical Manufacturers Association said that almost 200 major chemical plants had complained about poor service and that 29 had disclosed total losses of $60 million.
A report for the Railroad Commission of Texas written by two economists at the University of North Texas put the loss in Texas at $300 million to $400 million. "The national economic loss may easily have topped $1 billion," the report said. As the problems continue, price increases will start affecting consumers, said Bernard L. Weinstein, the co-author of the report.
Dr. Weinstein also said he thought the situation was getting worse in Texas. "If it is easing, it's because the Union Pacific is refusing to take orders from shippers" as a way of easing traffic, he said.
Dr. Weinstein attributed part of this crisis to diminishing competition as the industry consolidates and suggested that smaller rail customers might be squeezed out as a result. After Union Pacific merged with the Southern Pacific Rail Corporation in September 1996, it reported difficulties in linking the companies' computer systems. Moreover, union crews from one company are still not allowed to run trains on some lines belonging to the other.
Dr. Weinstein added that thousands of workers were dismissed to pay merger costs. Not true, a Union Pacific spokesman said. Employment now totals 54,000, up from the two companies' combined work force of 53,000 in 1995, he said, and it is expected to grow this year.
Dick Davidson, chairman of the Union Pacific Corporation, the railroad's parent company, called the merger the ultimate solution to service backups, rather than their cause. Without it, Southern Pacific would have continued to falter, he said. This year's troubles, he added, resulted from an unusual convergence of events, including heavy rains that washed out tracks near Houston and the Mexican railroad privatization, which has backed up rail traffic across the border.
So far, Union Pacific has been sued and threatened with suits by shippers and is discussing possible safety violation citations and fines with the Federal Railroad Administration.
For all the company's woes, though, Mr. Davidson was upbeat. "Once we get the merger in place down there, we will have a wonderful system," he said. "Our customers will get better service."

HEADLINE: Havana Journal;
No Joy in Cuba, as Its Baseball Team Strikes Out

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
Through years of hardship and regimentation, Cubans have always had one consistent consolation: the invincibility of their national baseball team, which has won countless international competitions, including the Olympics, and is often said to be the best squad not playing in the major leagues.
But no longer. With the regular season set to start on Nov. 15, the team's failure to win recent tournaments in Japan and Spain, where it lost games by humiliating scores like 11-2 and 16-6, has plunged Cuban baseball into what fans and the sports press here describe as a crisis so profound that it has set off a purge of Government officials who have run the sport for decades. 
 In a society as tightly controlled as this one, any serious criticism of the Communist Party and its leaders remains risky. But President Fidel Castro is himself a fan, a former pitcher and an occasional commentator on baseball. So venting grievances about the national sport is an approved activity, almost a patriotic duty, and the official press and the man in the street are taking advantage of the opportunity.
"The situation is desperate and discouraging," Prensa Latina, the state news agency, lamented in a recent dispatch.
"I must confess that I do not know how to write about defeats," a reporter for Granma, the newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, moaned after one particularly galling loss.
The defection of young prospects like pitcher Livan Hernandez, now with the Florida Marlins, and shortstop Rey Ordonez of the New York Mets, has been widely publicized and is acknowledged to be part of the problem. But the main cause of the sudden nose dive, fans, reporters and others say, lies in the Cuban Government's failure to adequately reward loyal team members who have chosen to stay home.
"This is not merely a slump," said Milton Jamail, a professor of Latin American politics at the University of Texas who is writing a book about baseball in Cuba. "This is something structural, entirely linked to things that are happening in every other aspect of Cuban society, especially the dollarization of the economy, and the Government cannot respond to it."
During the last year, more than 50 players, most still in their prime, have retired from the Cuban league, which provides the pool from which the national team is selected. They have left to take advantage of a new, Government-authorized plan that allows them to earn hard currency by playing abroad in "amateur" leagues. Many of them, fans complain, have been replaced by players more renowned for "revolutionary spirit" than baseball prowess.
Among those who have retired are Victor Meza, who was closing in on the Cuban career records for hits and runs scored, and Jorge Luis Valdes, the pitcher with the most victories in the history of the Cuban league.
"With so many of the best players gone, not only have our chances of winning abroad diminished, but there's less of a reason for fans to go out to the ball park," said Pedro Perez Palma, a physical education instructor.
All of the "retired" players are now playing in semiprofessional leagues in Japan, Italy, Colombia, Ecuador and Nicaragua, where they are paid in dollars. The salaries are a pittance by the standards of Major League Baseball, and the players must turn over as much as 80 percent of what they earn to the Government, but the money is still better than the $20 or so that a star player would earn monthly playing in the Cuban league.
"The bottom line is that the position of baseball players in Cuban society has gone from privileged to underprivileged" since Cuba legalized possession of dollars in 1993, Dr. Jamail said. "Musicians and artists are allowed to come and go, and if I'm a professor or a dentist, I can become a waiter or a vendor and make some dollars. But if I'm a baseball player, I can't do any of that. I have to be a saint."
Whether out of fear that other players may also defect or for other reasons, management has also made some recent roster choices that baffle fans. As Jorge Luis Tapia, a 36-year-old teacher, put it, "Some players who ought to be on the national team aren't, and other players who are on the team shouldn't be."
Outfielder Javier Mendez, for example, had a Cuban league record .462 batting average last season, but was left off the national squad, along with Luis Rodriguez, who hit .338, and Ariel Benavides, a .335 hitter. But infielders Luis Ulacia, who hit .242, and Miguel Caldes, a .274 batter last year, somehow made the team.
"It really leaves you wondering what criteria they are using to pick the players," said Rene Mena, manager of a sandlot softball team that was playing a Sunday game in the suburb of Cojimar. "To be on the national team, it's not enough to be a good guy and a good comrade. You've got to perform, too."
Those management decisions, combined with the suspension of several players who were thought to be likely candidates to defect, forced Manager Jorge Fuentes to make some strange moves. The roster at one tournament that Cuba lost included five third basemen, which compelled Cuba to play Omar Linares, considered by many major league scouts to be the best third baseman in the world, at shortstop.
As in the major leagues, the easiest solution to any problem is always to fire the manager, and Mr. Fuentes has now been dismissed. So have Miguel Valdes, the national team's general manager, farm chief and scouting director for the last 29 years, and Domingo Zabala, the longtime head of the Cuban Baseball Commission, whose replacements did not respond to repeated requests for an interview to discuss the tailspin and its causes.
 On Oct. 31, Cuban state television announced the dismissal of Reynaldo Gonzalez Lopez, director of the National Sports Institute and president of the Cuban Amateur Baseball Federation. Humberto Rodriguez, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, was designated his replacement.
On radio programs and in street-corner discussions, fans are arguing that sports officials should not be allowed to choose a successor to Mr. Fuentes behind closed doors, but should simply appoint the manager of whichever team wins the 92-game regular season.
"That is not only the most democratic manner to do it, but the most intelligent," said Rafael Lopez, a 27-year-old solderer. "Let the best man emerge through competition."
At recent commission meetings called to discuss the crisis, sports officials have also gingerly discussed the granting of "material incentives" to players, according to people who attended. These would, if approved, include both cash bonuses and prizes, to stem both defections and retirements.
But fans, dismayed at seeing their best players depart for greener pastures abroad, are demanding more basic changes in the state sport apparatus, which is also bedeviled by a corruption scandal. That is the only way, they argue, that Cuba can recoup its dominance and hope to win a third consecutive gold medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
"The talent is still out there, just waiting to be developed, and it will always be there, because we are Cubans and baseball is in our blood," said Diosvel Rojas, a 28-year-old surveyor. "What needs to change is the entire system. But that is a much more difficult task."

HEADLINE: THE JIANG VISIT: THE EXILES;
Sudden Visibility for Dissidents Who Hope to Influence China From the U.S.

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
In seizing on President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States to call attention to human rights violations in their homeland, many of the Chinese in exile in this country have been exercising the right of free expression that was taken away from them eight years ago when Mr. Jiang's Government violently suppressed the huge student-led demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
But their week of activities, including news conferences, demonstrations and even trailing Mr. Jiang with vans symbolically holding Chinese political prisoners, represents something of a high point in visibility for the Chinese democracy movement since it moved to the United States after the 1989 Tiananmen protests. 
 The Chinese political exiles are an amorphous and disparate group, consisting of former students, former academic figures, former political prisoners and a few former senior Government advisers and even Communist Party ideologists who, taken together, represent a remarkable assortment of some of China's best and brightest.
Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China, a monitoring group based in New York, says the exile community numbers 5,000 to 10,000, ranging from a few well-known individuals to at least three organizations with branches across the country and abroad.
"These are the people that the Chinese President doesn't want to meet," said William F. Schultz, executive director of the American branch of the human rights organization Amnesty International, gesturing at 17 dissident figures who were introduced at a Washington news conference last week. "These are the people whom the United States should champion."
Does the exile community have any influence in China itself? That is not easy to determine.
Among Chinese outside the exile community and non-Chinese analysts of China, there is a good deal of skepticism about the possibility that the exiles can have much impact in China itself. Their belief is that most people in China are too swept up in the race for economic gain to be paying much attention to a small and faraway group in this country.
In this sense, the Chinese exiles may resemble the various Russian exiles who at one time or another fled or were expelled from the Soviet Union but, separated from their country and their people, were never again able to play a role in their native country.
Many of the Chinese exiles, by contrast, argue that by using their personal connections at home and by exploiting technology that did not exist before, they are able to make their presence felt in China.
Some of the exiles are regularly interviewed on the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which are presumed to have audiences of many millions in China.
"With satellite television, overseas Chinese newspapers, the Internet, E-mail, the Voice of America, the BBC and other radio broadcasts, there are a lot of opportunities for the exile community to have an impact back home," said Mr. Xiao, one of the organizers of the anti-Jiang protests.
Mr. Xiao, who came to the United States to study astrophysics but became executive director of Human Rights in China after the Tiananmen incident, spoke of an Internet news group called China News Digest, which he estimates to have a quarter of a million readers across the globe, including in China.
"It was one of the first Web sites that was blocked by the Chinese Government," he said.
Wang Juntao, a former magazine editor who achieved prominence as the director of a research institute in Beijing that urged political reform, said, "What we can do is provide a vision."
Mr. Wang was accused by the Chinese Government of being one of "the black hands behind the black hands" masterminding the 1989 demonstrations.
"We try to give alternatives for China, a democratic idea about policy that is different from the Government's," he said. Since he has been in this country, he said, he has organized research groups that have published four books outlining a program for China's future. The books, he said, have made their way into a China whose borders are far less controlled than before.
"Democracy is an ideal, but if it is not connected to Chinese interests, they won't follow it," he said. "We are trying to offer a democratic vision for China that will help solve Chinese problems."
Mr. Wang spent four years in prison before being released for medical reasons. He is now a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Columbia University.
"I think they do have influence," said Andrew Nathan, a professor of political science at Columbia who maintains close contacts with many exiles. "People I meet from the mainland seem to have a polite curiosity about them. There's a sort of sympathetic celebrity interest in them, especially for the senior people."
Mr. Nathan identified the group Human Rights in China as especially important in this respect. Headed by Mr. Xiao and by Liu Qing, a former democracy advocate who spent nearly 11 years in prison in China, the small group has become the main source of information for the condition of dissidents inside China.
"Human Rights in China is in a class by itself for impact both here and in China," Mr. Nathan said. "It has become the main channel for the way people in China get news out about themselves, about the fate of dissidents, worker protests and prison conditions."
That information helps shape opinion about China in the United States, Mr. Nathan said, and then gets fed back into China through means like the Voice of America broadcasts.
The Chinese exile population can probably be broken down into three categories. Perhaps the best known are the small number of students who escaped from China after the military suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations.
Since then, many of the most famous dissidents have been absorbed into American life, playing less visible roles than they did before.
Wuer Kaixi, for example, one of the most charismatic of the student leaders, who is on China's most-wanted list, came to the United States and later married and quietly moved to Taiwan, where he was for a time the host of a radio talk show. Li Lu, another of the students on the most-wanted list, earned undergraduate and law degrees at Columbia and went to work for the investment company Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
There are also several dozen senior figures, including scholars, journalists and even some former high-ranking Government officials, mostly scattered in various American university towns, especially New York, Boston and Princeton, N.J.
Among these exiles, for example, is Chen Yizi, once an adviser to Zhao Ziyang, the purged General Secretary of the Communist Party; Liu Binyan, who was once far and away the most famous journalist in China, and Fang Lizhi, the astrophysicist, now at the University of Arizona, who came to the United States after spending a year as a refugee in the American Embassy in Beijing.
Su Shaozhi, who was once the head of Beijing's Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, is now, along with Mr. Liu, among the leading figures at the Princeton China Initiative, which studies China's economic and political conditions and publishes a journal called China Focus. Illustrating the way that the exiles in this country maintain a voice inside China, Mr. Liu does a twice-weekly commentary in Chinese on Radio Free Asia.
Probably the least-known exiles are those who run the larger democracy organizations like the Chinese Alliance for Democracy and the Federation for Democratic China, which publish newsletters and journals as part of their effort to build a base of support for political reform in China.
"Their primary purpose is to know each other, to set up a structure," said Li Lu, the former student leader. "They have a political approach as well as a human rights approach. The want eventually to be an opposition party inside China."
But whether any of the current exiles will ever be able to return to China, much less play a political role there, remains doubtful, especially given the apparent stability of the current Chinese Government and the success of its economic reforms.
Asked whether he felt any of the democracy organizations might become politically active inside China, Mr. Li replied, "They have a chance, but not now."

Silence from Pathfinder
Scientists have all but given up on restoring radio communication with the Pathfinder space probe that landed on Mars on July 4. Pathfinder fell silent on Sept. 27, after nearly three months of sending back information. On Tuesday, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., will stop daily efforts to re-establish contact and will instead try only once a week, or perhaps just once a month. The scientists speculate that communications were severed by a burned-out battery, by cold affecting the spacecraft's communications equipment or by a computer problem. (Agence France-Presse)
 
A Transit Plan for Denver
Environmentalists and business leaders in Denver are urging voters to approve on Tuesday a $16 billion plan to graft a hub-and-spoke light rail system onto the city's booming metropolitan area to ease increasing traffic congestion and air pollution, known locally as the "Brown Cloud." One of the most ambitious such plans in the nation, Denver's proposal reflects the West's sharpening love-hate relationship with mass transit. A poll showed narrow support for the plan. A18

Controversy Over Aid
The women's part of the marathon may be remembered not for the upset victory of a 31-year-old Swiss lawyer/restaurateur or the disappointing seventh-place finish of the crowd favorite. Instead, it may be recalled as the marathon in which many of the leaders received help, planned or otherwise, from friends or strangers who provided them with drinks during the race.

Rail Problems in the West
Service disruptions in the 36,000-mile network of the Union Pacific Railroad, the country's largest, have created huge backlogs in deliveries of coal, grain, plastics, chemicals, automobiles and other products in much of the nation. They have pushed up natural gas prices by 50 percent in some areas and created a drag on economic growth. The system, which has been hampered by congestion, shortages of equipment and crews and by multiple wrecks, could become further strained in the next few weeks as bumper crops of soybeans and corn are harvested. In response, the Federal Surface Transportation Board in Washington declared a transportation emergency on Friday in the West and ordered Union Pacific to open a section of track to a Texas competitor, the Texas Mexican Railway, to ease the gridlock.

HEADLINE: Mood Is Grim as Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations Resume

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been spelling out sharply contradictory goals for a new round of peace talks that is scheduled to begin in Washington on Monday, which does not bode well for the American diplomatic effort.
The United States is to act as mediator in the talks, which the Clinton Administration hopes might put the two parties back on track toward carrying out their old agreements and hashing out new ones. After months of paralysis in the peace effort, one American goal is to demonstrate enough progress to persuade angry Arab states to join Israel at an economic conference in Qatar later this month. 
 But the gulf between Israel and the Palestinians remains so wide that Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, has already dismissed the talks as "just a waste of time."
Israel has proposed a postponement of the troop withdrawals it is obligated, under the earlier peace accords, to carry out this month from rural areas of the West Bank. Israel wants the redeployment set aside in favor of accelerated talks on the final status of a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In the meantime, Israeli officials have said, this week's talks should aim to work out differences over carrying out a 1995 accord that called for creating a safe-passage between Palestinian-governed territory in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip as well as for building an airport and a seaport in Gaza.
Mr. Arafat and his aides have insisted that the troop withdrawals go forward before any kind of final-status talks begin. They have also called on Israel to demonstrate good will by declaring a halt on settlement activity in the West Bank, which the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has firmly resisted.
In an interview published today in the Israeli newspaper Maariv, Mr. Arafat said he had agreed to send a negotiator to the Washington talks only because Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright had officially invited him to do so.
"We will take part in the talks despite the fact that they have no chance of success," Mr. Arafat was quoted as saying.
By contrast, the Israeli negotiator, Foreign Minister David Levy, said in a separate interview published today in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot that he is "confident it will be possible this time to make progress with the active cooperation of the Palestinians."
"Our negotiating partners will find that we are ready to compromise if they show the required flexibility," he said.
Israel has dispatched nearly a dozen officials in a delegation headed by Mr. Levy. But Palestinian officials said today that the Palestinian side would include only Mahmoud Abbas, a deputy of Mr. Arafat, and two other negotiators.
Since midsummer, when the first of two suicide bombings in Israel sent the quest for a broader peace into a state of crisis, the United States has worked intensively to try to put relations between Israel and the Palestinians on a more solid footing. But its efforts now are clearly being formulated with an eye to the regional conference in Qatar, which is being threatened by the prospect of an Arab boycott.
Along with representatives from Israel and Jordan, Ms. Albright has already announced that she will attend the gathering, whose main purpose is to promote economic ties between Arabs and Israelis.
But as a gesture of protest against what is seen as Israel's intransigence in dealing with the Palestinians, a number of Arab states have said they intend to stay away. The level of Arab participation appears certain to be lower than in any such gathering since the first in Casablanca, Morocco, in 1993. Among past participants who have said they plan to stay away are Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Even Egypt, the host of last year's conference, has said that it has not yet decided whether to attend.
Martin Indyk, the former Ambassador to Israel who was recently sworn in as Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern and Near Eastern Affairs, has been using a get-acquainted tour of Arab capitals to try to rally support for the gathering. But there has been no sign that the overture has yielded positive results.

HEADLINE: THE JIANG VISIT: IN CALIFORNIA;
Jiang Does Business On Last Stop Of U.S. Visit

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2

 BODY:
From a high-tech satellite factory to a power lunch in Beverly Hills, President Jiang Zemin of China cheerfully promoted trans-Pacific commerce in California today, despite some noisy protests and a pointed warning from his host, Gov. Pete Wilson, that "the great elixir of individual freedom" is the best recipe for economic growth.
As Mr. Jiang wound up his weeklong visit to the United States with a stop in a state that accounts for more than a quarter of all American exports to China, he sat in the passenger seat of a Buick Regal -- the type that is to be built in China starting next year -- and then met privately with the Governor before gently pleading with business and political leaders for patience in resolving differences and improving ties. 
 "As the old Chinese saying goes, a 10,000-mile journey begins with the first step," Mr. Jiang told an audience of some 700 people that included former Secretary of State Warren Christopher; Peter O'Malley, the owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers; Rupert Murdoch (who is in the process of buying the Dodgers) and other corporate chieftains, and Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles.
A similar number of protesters gathered outside the Beverly Hilton, burning Chinese flags and waving placards with slogans like "Communism Kills," "Give Jiang a Heart" and "China Most Favored Oppressor." The demonstrators drew honks of support from passing motorists.
Mr. Wilson, who visited China on a trade mission last winter, invoked the memory of the Chinese laborers who toiled on California's railroads to welcome Mr. Jiang to "the state built with Chinese muscle in the 19th century and with Chinese genius in the high-tech world of the 20th century." But in introducing Mr. Jiang at the lunch, the Republican governor also referred indirectly to China's human rights record as Mr. Jiang sat stone-faced on the dais.
"A free people deserves to be, and inevitably will be, more creative and productive in every way than those who labor in servitude with no hope of sharing the fruits of their labor," Mr. Wilson said. "The great elixir of individual freedom is the best prescription to accelerate and intensify your success."
Tonight, at a dinner downtown for 1,000 Chinese-Americans representing 140 local business associations, Mr. Jiang heard a musical program that featured Carpenters songs played on Chinese instruments. Later, he regaled the crowd with a few bars from classic Chinese opera sung in his own voice. It was the sole appearance of his trip aimed especially at a Chinese-American audience, and he brought down the house.
The overall theme of the day was economic cooperation -- hardly surprising since California now exports goods worth about $6 billion a year to China, mostly in computer and aerospace equipment, and China is now the state's sixth-largest trading partner, just behind Taiwan. Unlike politicians along the eastern seaboard, many of whom shunned Mr. Jiang, officials here cannot ignore the commercial impact of China on their state.
"The whole West Coast is more aware of what a huge part of the economy it is, I think," said one of Mr. Jiang's lunchtime listeners, Mayor Beverly O'Neill of nearby Long Beach, which is trying to expand the presence of Chinese shipping in its port. "He's getting a reception that shows that we would like to talk."
Mr. O'Malley, who built a baseball field for a school in Tianjin, near Beijing, a decade ago, has sponsored coaching and sports medicine exchanges between Chinese baseball clubs and their counterparts on the Dodgers. He ultimately hopes to build a baseball academy in China, where baseball is just beginning to become popular.
"Sports can do so much," Mr. O'Malley said. "Baseball can bring people together. My dream is to someday see a Dodger from the People's Republic."
For his part, Mr. Wilson said he favored a "two track" approach of registering protests and disapproval of Chinese abuses, while seeking better ties.
"I think that if you fail to meet with people, it is very hard to communicate," he said.
The Chinese are feuding with Hollywood these days over several movies -- including the Walt Disney Company's coming "Kundun," about the Dalai Lama, that portray China in a less than flattering light -- and Mr. Jiang passed up the chance for souvenir photo opportunities at Southern California meccas like Disneyland or the Mann's Chinese Theater. Instead, first thing this morning, the former electrical engineer headed for the headquarters of Hughes Electronics Corporation near Los Angeles International Airport and later to its manufacturing plant.
At Hughes, Mr. Jiang celebrated the communications satellite equipment that the company is selling to China and the automobiles that its parent company, General Motors, plans to build there. Company officials showed off a new service using satellite technology in which motorists who lock their keys in the car can telephone a central operator and have the doors unlocked.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Ask U.N. to Force Iraq to Admit Arms Monitors

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials said today that they would ask the United Nations Security Council on Monday to take swift and firm action to force President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to allow Americans into his country as members of a United Nations weapons inspection team.
Iraq blocked two Americans on the team from carrying out their work today, its second such action in less than a week. 
 "This is serious, it's unacceptable and it's outrageous behavior on the part of the Iraqis," said Bill Richardson, the United States delegate to the United Nations. "We're not seeking a military confrontation with Iraq. We want to resolve this diplomatically. But we're not ruling anything out."
The two American inspectors, who landed at Habbaniya Airport about 60 miles north of Baghdad, were asked to leave by Iraqi officials and returned to Bahrain on a United Nations plane, news services reported. A third American who arrived with them, who works for the International Atomic Energy Agency, was not prohibited from staying but chose to leave with the other Americans.
The weapons inspectors had tried unsuccessfully to continue their work in Iraq on Thursday, and their expulsion today was the latest in a series of confrontations with President Hussein over the inspections put in place after the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
Speaking on the ABC News program "This Week," Mr. Richardson said pointedly that there was no room for compromise with Mr. Hussein's demand that no Americans take part in the inspections.
"There is no negotiation," Mr. Richardson said. "He is in noncompliance, and he must comply. This is not a fight between the U.S. and Iraq. This is Iraq confronting the United Nations."
United Nations officials said tonight that Secretary General Kofi Annan planned to press home that message with Mr. Hussein by sending a three-member delegation to Baghdad this week. The officials said the delegation would consist of three experienced diplomats whose instructions would not permit them to negotiate with Mr. Hussein, only to emphasize that he may not exclude Americans or people of any other nationality from the weapons inspection teams.
The three diplomats expected to make up the delegation are Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria, a diplomatic troubleshooter for the Secretary General; Emilio Cardenas of Argentina, a banker and diplomat, and Jan Eliasson, a senior Swedish diplomat.
Mr. Richardson previously opposed sending a similar delegation, but the United States has since been assured that the team will not negotiate, only insist on compliance.
While Mr. Richardson, selected by the Administration to be its main spokesman on this issue, suggested that military action would not be the first option, members of Congress from both parties lined up eagerly today to say they would be wholly supportive if President Clinton chose to strike at Iraq.
The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" that he would "absolutely" support a decision to take military action against Mr. Hussein. That sentiment was echoed on the program by the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and the Democratic leaders in Congress, Senator Thomas A. Daschle and Representative Richard A. Gephardt.
The confrontation could heat up this week. The head of the United Nations weapons inspection team, Richard Butler, said in a telephone interview that he intended that his team would resume its work in Iraq on Monday morning as the Security Council meets in New York.
Of the 40 weapons inspectors now in Iraq, 7 are Americans, United Nations officials said. Two Americans left on Thursday as part of the normal rotation of team members, the officials said, and another left today. One Western diplomat said he believed that there were eight Americans still in Iraq; there was no explanation of the discrepancy.
Mr. Butler said he expected to resist Mr. Hussein's demands that the remaining Americans leave Iraq by Thursday.
"I expect them to go about their work in a normal way," he said. "They will assemble in the inspections center and then head out to inspect certain sites where we monitor their weapons industry and other places where we have reason to look and ask questions."
Mr. Butler, an Australian diplomat, has been resolute in not yielding to Iraq's demands and has often seemed to be leading the Security Council on the issue.
"I'm mystified as to why Iraq has done this," he said, "because it cannot and will not be allowed to stand. It's simply against all the rules. U.N. procedures cannot work if a nation can say it doesn't want Americans on a U.N. team."
Mr. Butler recently reported to the Security Council that Iraq might still be hiding biological and chemical weapons. "We've got serious questions about their biological and chemical weapons programs and whether they've been leveling with us," he said.
The inspections were ordered by the United Nations to insure that Baghdad does not rebuild the military might that it used to invade Kuwait in 1990. Baghad agreed to the inspections as a condition for eventual removal of economic sanctions.
Senior Administration officials said today that they had decided to use the Security Council to confront Iraq to avoid portraying this fight as simply between Washington and Baghdad.
Underlying the thinking, one senior official said, is an uncertainty about the cohesiveness of the anti-Iraq coalition that waged the Persian Gulf war. Evidence of the coalition's fragility was displayed two weeks ago when the Security Council declined to impose sanctions on Iraq for its earlier resistance to the inspection teams.
In recent days, though, the permanent members of the Security Council have expressed a united front in condemning Iraq, although there may well be strong disagreements over the issue of military force.
On Saturday, for example, the Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia, who was in Paris, issued a statement with the French Government criticizing the Iraqi behavior over the inspections and demanding that it end. But Russia could veto any Security Council measure endorsing a military response.
Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman traveling with President Clinton today in New Jersey and New York, said the Administration was hoping that Egypt would play a useful role in persuading Mr. Hussein to relent.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Clinton Enters Final Act of Campaigns: In New York, He Backs Bid by Messinger

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Recalling that Ruth W. Messinger had "stuck by me" through his own difficult New York political contest five years ago, President Clinton made a long-sought trip to Manhattan last night and vigorously urged voters to support her mayoral bid. He asserted that she had grasped the main issues confronting the city now that crime was in decline: failing schools and lingering unemployment.
For 16 minutes, with his fellow Democrat beaming at his side, Mr. Clinton issued what was in effect a call to Democrats to come home and support their party's candidate. He did not once mention or criticize Ms. Messinger's Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, but instead rolled out, with a national perspective and his own distinctive political edge, the case that Ms. Messinger has been making about the problems of New York City. 
 "I say to you, I believe if I were mayor of New York City," Mr. Clinton said, "I would say my three priorities are: I'm going to get the unemployment rates down to the national level, I'm going to fix our schools and I'm going to give these kids something to do after school to keep them out of trouble."
Mr. Clinton's visit on behalf of Ms. Messinger came two days before the election, on a day in which he tended to two serious tasks for his Democratic Party -- helping to elect a member of Congress from Staten Island and a governor of New Jersey. Ms. Messinger's opponent, Mr. Giuliani, yesterday kicked off a marathon bus trip through the five boroughs.
Although the polls show him far ahead of Ms. Messinger, the Mayor said he felt obliged to go out and ask his constituents for their votes. And he did all day and into the night, crisscrossing the city and waving at startled pedestrians and drivers while hanging on to the back rail of the bus. Page B4.
Although Mr. Clinton's appearance came just 35 hours before the polls open, and against the counsel of some White House advisers who, based on polls, contended that such a visit would be a politically damaging waste of time, Mr. Clinton left no doubt about his sentiment when he mounted the stage.
In a familiar setting -- a hotel ballroom at the Sheraton New York, a traditional stop on any Democratic campaign in New York -- he recalled how Ms. Messinger had endorsed his campaign when he was a little-known Governor from Arkansas, and stuck with him during some of the most difficult months.
"Through all the tough times, when I was going through my own particular New York marathon in 1992, she stuck by me," he said. "And I'm standing with her tonight."
It was, by any measure, an emotional high point for Ms. Messinger, coming after what her friends have described as six of the more difficult months of her career.
After months in which Ms. Messinger has encountered difficulty finding Democrats from New York to endorse or campaign with her, she stood by the side of a President as many of the Democrats who avoided her stood in the crowd. After weeks in which she frequently walked into embarrassingly empty campaign venues, she was in a ballroom so crowded that fire marshals stopped letting people in 20 minutes before Ms. Messinger and Mr. Clinton appeared, leaving hundreds of people outside the metal detectors.
And after weeks in which Ms. Messinger's press entourage often consisted of a solitary reporter and no television crews, she gazed out at a dozen television cameras, some of them feeding to live broadcasts.
Aside from clearly providing a lift to Ms. Messinger and her campaign staff, the effect of the President's visit on the election, coming so close to a vote and at a time when many polls show Mr. Giuliani heading for a strong victory, is an open question. At the very least, it brings her money: Ms. Messinger's aides said she raised between $150,000 and $200,000 from private receptions in which contributors paid either $1,000 to hear a speech or $5,000 for a chance to have their photo taken with Ms. Messinger and Mr. Clinton.
But if history is any guide, Mr. Clinton's appearance in New York last night -- and his repeated and obviously intentional emphasis on Democratic values -- could help Ms. Messinger among Democrats who many pollsters said were otherwise likely to stay home. Several analysts said it could also dissuade Democrats who were planning to vote for Mr. Giuliani, but with misgivings.
Given the lead that Mr. Giuliani appears to have in polls, that might do little to change the outcome of the race. But it could help to make it closer, which could be a problem for Mr. Giuliani, whose aides in recent days have been predicting that Mr. Giuliani would score a triumph of historic proportions, one that would allow him to leave the city, if he chose, and run for higher office.
In what has become fairly standard fare for Mr. Clinton's encounters in New York, his speech was interrupted -- at its height -- by a man protesting Mr. Clinton's policies on AIDS. As the crowd tried to yell down the protester with chants of "Ruth, Ruth," Mr. Clinton, as is his practice in these kind of encounters, hushed the crowd and said the man, who was not immediately identified, should be allowed to speak. "This is a serious issue," Mr. Clinton said. "But we can never get to the facts if you're just screaming. And I can't win a screaming match today."
Mr. Clinton, after recounting for his audience the political history that he shared with Ms. Messinger, cast the election along party lines, with an obvious eye to the five-to-one Democratic edge in New York. "I'm very proud to be a Democrat," the President said. "And I am proud to be part of a party that has a broad tent and that is inclusive and welcomes all kinds of people."
In his speech, Mr. Clinton offered innovative, if late, advice to Ms. Messinger on how to deal with what has been Mr. Giuliani's most overriding political strength: crime. He said Ms. Messinger should, in effect, share credit with Republicans for it, saying that the reduction in crime was good, and the result of policies adopted by both parties.
"Let me begin by saying I think it's a good thing that crime has come down in New York," Mr. Clinton said. "And I don't think that any Democrat should criticize any legitimate effort that brought it down. After all, remember, the first aggressive community policing, and the first drop in the New York City crime rate, began when David Dinkins was Mayor."
He said a decline in crime was "a good and noble thing."
"That is an American ideal," he said. "That does not belong to either party."
The audience, which included Mr. Dinkins, laughed and applauded.
The Presidential visit nearly did not happen at all. Several of Mr. Clinton's advisers had argued against investing any of Mr. Clinton's time in a race that most Democrats consider hopeless, particularly against a Republican, Mr. Giuliani, who has sided with Mr. Clinton on a number of important legislative battles and appears far more popular than Ms. Messinger. When Vice President Al Gore came to New York two weeks ago to speak at a Democratic fund-raiser, he did not criticize, much less mention, Mr. Giuliani once in his speech. Ms. Messinger and Mr. Gore sat at separate tables.
But as Mr. Clinton noted, Ms. Messinger was one of his first supporters when he ran for President in 1992. She endorsed him in February 1992 while Mr. Clinton, then the Governor of Arkansas, was buffeted by reports about difficulty in his marriage and about the lengths to which he went to avoid the draft. When Mr. Clinton came to New York for his difficult primary in the state, Ms. Messinger was often at the front of his stage, leading him through what he described again last night as one of his most difficult periods.
Ms. Messinger apparently reminded Mr. Clinton of that when he came to New York in September to address the United Nations General Assembly and to attend the opera. During that two-day visit, under strong pressure from Ms. Messinger's aides, the White House agreed to allow Mr. Clinton to pose with her for a picture at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport.
It was there, Ms. Messinger said, she asked him to do more. "I asked him if he would schedule some time to come in for some kind of fund-raising and campaign activity," she said yesterday. "He said he would find the time to do it."
It seemed, accordingly, a fairly emotional moment for Ms. Messinger. Seven hours before Mr. Clinton arrived, Ms. Messinger, who has had trouble in recent days rounding up crowds, was inviting everyone she met to come out for her rally. "A special friend is coming into town on my behalf," she said at the Union Baptist Church. "His name is William Jefferson Clinton."
There is some precedent to Mr. Clinton's visit here on behalf of a mayoral candidate. In 1993, he gave one of the most-noted speeches of his first term when he came to New York to help Mr. Dinkins. Then, he asserted that Mr. Dinkins deserved re-election because of his record, but was in trouble partly because "too many of us are still too unwilling to vote for people who are different than we are."
His remarks electrified the race, casting it in stark racial terms, and generated weeks of debate. Mr. Dinkins went on to lose to Mr. Giuliani by fewer than 50,000 votes.

HEADLINE: OPERA REVIEW;
Revitalization of a Production and a Company

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND 

 BODY:
I have no idea how the New York City Opera is doing financially this season, but onstage it is cheering us all up. A lot of the company's longtime well-wishers had more or less given up on what seemed to be a slide into artistic and economic oblivion. The procession of sloppy productions of the obvious and ill-advised adventures into the avant-garde were, at any rate, hardly promising.
Opera intendants almost always begin new jobs with seasons designed by their predecessors, so this fall reflects Paul Kellogg's first real empowerment over the city opera's repertory and its productions. Handel's "Xerxes" on Saturday night appeared as the latest constituent in a plan that actually seems to be working. 
 Mr. Kellogg begins with a happy inheritance: a handful of recent and honorable productions of the Puccini-Donizetti-Verdi literature devised to satisfy a company's need for a workable standard repertory. With the status quo more or less in hand, he has taken to flooding us with new and interesting things: recently Gluck's "Iphigenie en Tauride," next week "The Voyage of Marco Polo," by Tan Dun, and on Saturday Handel's serio-comic opera, here in a credible redesign and translation by Stephen Wadsworth.
While these productions are new to us and to the company, they are not new at all (the exception being the homegrown "Macbeth" that opened the season). "Iphigenie" comes by way of Mr. Kellogg's other opera company, Glimmerglass in Cooperstown, N.Y.; "Marco Polo" has had prior outings in Europe.
Similarly, although the Skylight Theater in Milwaukee and the Santa Fe Opera would resist the designation, the two companies have been the test kitchen for Mr. Wadsworth's "Xerxes," providing a chance for bad ideas to be discarded and the good ones to be shipped on to us in New York.
There is a time change in the setting, from Herodotus to the England of George II. Thomas Lynch's fixed set (no scene-ending curtains, just blackouts) is a wall framed by the obligatory plane tree and a two-story house. The tree is nicely gnarled; the pale brick identifies old England as clearly as if it were a written label.
Given the rhythms and colors of two very different languages, Mr. Wadsworth has had to demolish the Italian original and create something new. His English is American but not obtrusively so; it is often clever; it is also prone, especially in the last two acts, to overly cute rhyming effects.
What separated Saturday's "Xerxes" from efforts like it in the recent past was not just the finish of the production but the world-class casting. The City Opera has always been a house for American singers, but that principle has too often turned it into a postgraduate workshop for the promising and ill-prepared.
Lorraine Hunt in the title role was stunning, David Daniels's Arsamene scarcely less so. Amy Burton was a first-rate Romilda, Jan Opalach a sturdy Ariodate. As Atalanta, Susannah Waters had her hectic moments but did well. James Bobick's comic acting as Elviro never quite made up for a straying sense of pitch.
The City Opera orchestra, sounding so disconsolate in past years, seemed enthusiastic and energetic. George Manahan conducted using sensible compromises between historical fact and contemporary practice. The strings were modern, but there were John Beeson's harpsichord and Richard Kolb's lute biting at the heels of every attack.
Old and new also inhabited the vocal styles: clear rhythms, quick tempos, but big, dramatic singing too. Of special note was the use of cadenzas not for technical display but as a vehicle for emotional outburst. Mr. Wadsworth leans on the comic aspect of "Xerxes," but Ms. Hunt's splendid extroversions -- white hot but very much in control -- brought back the human unhappinesses Handel's opera projects as well. Mr. Daniels and Ms. Burton used similar opportunities.
The plot of "Xerxes," a story of mismatched lovers, requires powers of explanation that are probably not worth the effort or the space.
The final reconciliations are not convincing, but hanging vividly and disquietingly over the proceedings is a ruler's total power over the lives of those around him.
Saturday's audience was large, knowledgeable and wildly enthusiastic. This was not the City Opera's mom-and-pop "La Boheme" crowd, but one more liberally sprinkled with younger, hipper listeners, the type found more often these days across the river at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The signs are good.

HEADLINE: In Congress and White House, Debate Begins on How to Use Future Budget Surpluses

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
After decades in which huge Federal budget deficits cast a shadow over politics and the economy, Congress and the White House face the possibility that the Government will begin running surpluses in the next few years, and a heated debate is already breaking out over what to do with the money.
Many conservative Republicans want to dedicate all or most of any surpluses to paying down the mountain of debt accumulated over decades of wars, recessions and fiscal profligacy. Other Republicans are pushing for tax cuts. 
 Members of both parties are eagerly promoting more spending on roads, bridges and other politically appealing construction projects. Many Democrats lean toward additional spending on education and health programs.
Both White House officials and members of Congress are pondering how surpluses could help address the looming shortfall in financing for Social Security retirement benefits and the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly.
That the debate is taking place at all strikes some officials as premature, given that the budget deficit, while falling rapidly, has not been eliminated and may never be if the economy falters. Even if the economy remains robust, just talking seriously about surpluses could erode the political will needed to bring the budget into balance, they said.
"We need to stop hyperventilating and complete the job of balancing the budget," said Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee.
The rapidly improving fiscal situation has nonetheless opened the door to a wide-ranging consideration of policy and political priorities as the glow of prosperity is beginning to alter the way official Washington is addressing the nation's long-term problems.
The deficit for the Government fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was $22.6 billion, its lowest level since the early 1970's. If the economy remains strong, many analysts say, the budget could show a surplus within the next several years and continue to do so for years to come.
"For 15 years or more, the most important question you could ask about a public policy idea was what its effect was going to be on the budget deficit," said Franklin D. Raines, the White House budget director. "Now you have to ask what an idea's contribution to the country is going to be and how does that compare to other options."
In its broadest terms, the debate is dominated by two camps. One considers reducing the national debt to be the best use of any surplus, likening the nation's fiscal condition to that of a consumer who has learned not to use a credit card so much but still must muster the discipline to pay off the card's balance. The national debt is $5.3 trillion, and interest payments on it account for 15 percent of all Federal spending.
The other camp believes that there are other more pressing uses for the money, like tax cuts, transportation projects, higher Pentagon spending, school system improvements and access to medical care.
"Maintaining a surplus for use in reducing the national debt is good policy but bad politics," said Robert D. Reischauer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington and former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
"It would help increase the productivity of the work force and national living standards, help keep interest rates down and significantly reduce the fraction of the total budget that goes to debt service," he said. "But those types of benefits are very distant and diffuse, and politicians want concrete rewards and immediate ones. So it's natural for this debate to begin, and it's likely to intensify."
When Speaker Newt Gingrich presented his views on how to use the surplus to the House Budget Committee several weeks ago, he provided a perhaps unintentional look at how expansive a political appetite there is for new and expensive initiatives.
Mr. Gingrich started by saying that Congress should do whatever it takes, including cutting Federal spending further, to eliminate the annual deficit and push the budget into surplus. Then, he said, the country should push to run an annual surplus "large enough that a reasonable recession doesn't stop it" for use in paying off the national debt.
But Mr. Gingrich went on to lay claim to a slice of any surpluses for other uses, starting with a tax cut every year. Then he called for increased spending on science, the military and transportation. And last, he noted Congress's responsibility to shore up the Social Security and Medicare programs.
Mr. Kasich responded, somewhat wryly, by telling Mr. Gingrich that his proposals were "a tall order, you will have to admit, for a surplus that is yet to materialize" and that any surpluses that do materialize might never be big enough to pay for Mr. Gingrich's entire wish list.
"I think you are pushing the envelope with what you propose, but nevertheless, I think it is the kind of debate we need to have," Mr. Kasich told Mr. Gingrich.
There is no shortage of proposals to debate. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, both Republicans, have introduced a bill that would set aside any revenue collected by the Government beyond that projected in the balanced budget deal negotiated by Congress and President Clinton earlier this year. The money would be reserved primarily for tax cuts or to pay for the costs of a fundamental overhaul of the tax code, another Republican priority. But the legislation would bar the use of any of the money for new spending programs.
Representative Mark W. Neumann of Wisconsin, a Republican, has introduced a bill that would cap increases in Federal spending at one percentage point below the rate of increase in tax revenues and mandate that two-thirds of the resulting surplus be applied to paying off the national debt and the other third to tax cuts.
"I feel pretty strongly that we have a moral and ethical responsibility to pay off the debts we've run up in the last 15 years," Mr. Neumann said.
But Representative Bud Shuster, a Republican from Pennsylvania who is chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, is leading a push for more spending on highways and other transportation projects.
Democrats in Congress, wary of being tagged as tax-and-spend liberals, have shied away from detailed proposals for increased spending. But their leaders, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, have made clear that they see health, education and transportation as priorities.
The White House has taken a hard line against using any unexpectedly high tax revenues to finance spending programs before the budget is balanced. But Administration officials have begun meeting to discuss how to use any consistent surpluses. Officials said the options included things like tax incentives to reducing the emissions that cause global warming, more spending on education, training and health care, and getting an early start on fixing Social Security.
"Our general approach," said Gene Sperling, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, "is to take a deep breath, don't spend money you don't have and, if it does turn out that you have sustainable surpluses, to think long and hard about what would be best for the economy and average families." 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 4, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a debate over what should be done with a possible budget surplus misattributed a quotation in response to Speaker Newt Gingrich's proposals at a House Budget Committee hearing. The speaker -- who called Mr. Gingrich's proposals "a tall order, you will have to admit, for a surplus that has yet to materialize" -- was Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the committee, not Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is the committee's chairman.
"I think you are pushing the envelope with what you propose," Mr. Spratt said, "but, nevertheless, I think it is the kind of debate we need to have."

HEADLINE: Of Chinese Painting, and the Art of a Book Deal

BYLINE: By GAYLE FELDMAN 

 BODY:
When Margaret Thatcher went to Beijing to sign the 1984 accord that sealed Hong Kong's fate, one of the symbolic offerings she was given by the then-boss of the Chinese Communist Party, Hu Yaobang, was a Chinese-English dictionary.
Last week, when President Jiang Zemin of China came calling on President Clinton, one of the official presents he brought to Washington was a $75, lavishly illustrated book in English entitled "Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting." 
 As Mr. Jiang returns home, and Americans and Chinese ponder the future of their mutually puzzling relationship, bookstores in both countries will be preparing to sell that book, the first of a 75-volume joint venture project covering art, language and culture, which is being published by Yale University Press and the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing.
The project is unusual in both its scope and in the nature of its collaboration, which involved both Chinese and Western scholars. It is not a straight commercial proposition -- outside financing from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Henry Luce Foundation and various individuals in Asia and America provided about half of the $545,000 cost of the book and the project to date.
But the venture holds lessons for any American publisher interested in doing business in China, and is a sign of the new kinds of relationships being forged there.
For almost 20 years, American publishers have coveted the vast potential market in China. A few of the established international houses and textbook and reference publishers like John Wiley & Sons, Springer-Verlag of Germany and Oxford University Press have spent years cultivating relationships with the Chinese and selling them scientific and technical books or English-language teaching materials.
"In the early 1980's, John Wiley's revenues from China were as high as $1 million in one year resulting from book and journal purchases Chinese libraries made with World Bank loan money," said Deborah E. Wiley, a senior vice president of the company.
During that period, large American trade publishers like Random House, a unit of Advance Publications, Bantam and Harper & Row -- now HarperCollins, a division of the News Corporation -- along with some smaller publishers, went on forays to China, but many declined to enter the very foreign publishing market they found there. There was no copyright law, the retail price of books was very low, the state-controlled distribution network was bogged down in bureaucracy and marketing was nonexistent.
Bantam did sell some English-language paperbacks in tourist hotels and state-run foreign languages bookstores. Peter Mayer, the former chairman of Penguin, the publishing arm of Pearson P.L.C., negotiated an agreement licensing paperback reprints of such Penguin classics as "Jane Eyre," "Wuthering Heights" and "Women in Love." But, he said: "It was never meant to be lucrative. We thought by having a publishing relationship in China eventually there would be real opportunities for buying and selling books."
James Peck, the executive editor of the Yale-Foreign Languages Press project, said that part of the difficulty in doing business in China in the 1980's was that "trade publishers could not find a way to overcome the problems of China not having copyright and not being able to pay the foreign publisher and author royalties in foreign currency."
For example, he said that Bantam sold "Iacocca" to one Chinese press, but multiple pirated versions were brought out by others.
Rights sales for individual titles have been growing, however, since China passed copyright legislation and, in 1990, acceded to the Berne international convention, which requires that the Chinese publisher obtain copyright from the copyright holder and that the contract between them specify the financial responsibilities for the sale of the book.
The most desirable titles, like "The Road Ahead" by William H. Gates 3d have fetched royalty advances of $50,000 or so. Elton Welke, the publisher of Microsoft Press, said that after Berne, "the relationship with the Chinese was more comfortable, it became easier to work together."
The Chinese also pay for books associated with American films. Huang Youyi, the vice director general of the Foreign Languages Publishing Administration, who is responsible for the Yale-Foreign Languages Press series on the Chinese side, said that books based on "The English Patient" and "The Bridges of Madison County" have been hits.
The Yale project had deep roots and shows the importance of long-term personal relationships in dealing with China. Mr. Peck did graduate work in Chinese at Harvard in the 1960's and then, as an editor at Random House Inc.'s Pantheon Books, published a number of books about China and wrote two himself.
Mr. Peck recalled that in 1985, Robert Bernstein, then the chairman of Random House, "asked me to look into why Random had been unable to establish a publishing relationship with China; I recommended that we adopt a much more flexible approach about royalty payments and copyright questions and that we link up with two publishers, one of whom was the F.L.P."
But Mr. Bernstein was removed as Random House chairman in the fall of 1989 and Mr. Peck also left the company. Only a few contracts had actually been signed. The next spring, Mr. Bernstein mentioned the groundwork that he and Mr. Peck had laid to John Ryden, director of the Yale University Press. Eventually, "The Culture and Civilization of China" series was conceived and a contract signed at the end of 1991.
All publishing in China is ultimately state controlled (apart from the illegal trade in pirated or banned material), and forging personal connections within China has proved useful to some other publishers.
During the last two years, Simon & Schuster, a unit of Viacom Inc., set up an office in Beijing. Bertelsmann A.G., the German media company whose divisions include the American publishers Bantam, Doubleday and Dell, set up a joint-venture direct sales operation, a book club and other ventures in Shanghai.
Foreign publishers are learning that they need to employ Chinese and Americans who can straddle both worlds. Martin Maleska, president of Simon & Schuster International, said, "By putting people on the ground there we better understand the needs of this emerging information market."

HEADLINE: Computers Model World's Climate, but How Well?

SERIES: The Warming World -- Confronting climate change.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
TOM'S RESTAURANT at 112th Street and Broadway in Upper Manhattan is right out of "Seinfeld." But six floors above, Dr. Makiko Sato and Dr. James E. Hansen are conjuring up a bigger world from the innards of what looks like a slightly oversized personal computer. This is no ordinary computer, however. It contains the earth's atmosphere and oceans, albeit in mathematical form, interconnected to create a virtual global climate system.
About 20 of these ocean-atmosphere climate models now exist, four times as many as a decade ago. They are the principal tools available to researchers who are trying to understand how the global climate is changing. By pumping data on temperature, winds, solar radiation, ocean currents and a host of other climatic factors into a model and then setting it in motion, scientists can simulate what could happen over time if emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases increase. 
 These simulations are the basis of predictions that the average surface temperature of the earth will rise substantially and disrupt the world's climate in coming decades unless there are reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil.
The models' forecast -- a unanimous one -- has been accepted uncritically as gospel by some environmentalists and even some scientists and dismissed as all but worthless by some opponents of emissions reductions. Most experts take a middle stance, saying that while the models are getting more realistic all the time, they remain relatively crude versions of reality whose findings should be interpreted with care.
So how useful are the models as policy guides for the nations of the world as they prepare to meet in Kyoto, Japan, on Dec. 1 to negotiate cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases?
One hint materializes from the computer above Tom's, one of several like it in the offices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Dr. Sato, a physicist and climate researcher, punches keys, and world maps appear on her computer's monitor. In vivid colors ranging from yellow to orange to dark red (for degrees of warmth) through shades of blue (for degrees of cold), maps on the right of the screen show the pattern of global temperature changes the computer climate model "predicted" for the period 1979 to 1995. Maps on the left show the changes that actually took place.
The picture presented by the comparison is clear: In broadest terms, the computer got it right; the world as a whole warmed, and the Northern Hemisphere warmed most. But it also got a lot of the regional details wrong. The computer said that eastern Canada should have warmed substantially, for instance, but, instead, it cooled a lot.
Not a lot of stock should be placed in a single "run" of a single model, or even in many runs. But many runs of many models present the same picture suggested by the maps on Dr. Sato's screen: that the models show a general global fidelity to reality but also pervasive regional error. They also continue to yield the same general conclusion their much cruder predecessors first yielded nearly two decades ago: that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere would raise the earth's average surface temperature by three to eight degrees Fahrenheit. The wide range is a measure of the differences among model projections, and thus of the uncertainty inherent in climate modeling.
A doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations is expected late in the next century if the world pursues business as usual. To get an idea of the magnitude of the models' forecast, one should consider that the world is five to nine degrees warmer now than in the depths of the last ice age.
Despite the models' inability to simulate the regional details of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists advising the climate negotiations under United Nations auspices, says its confidence in the models is growing. Not only have the models become more sophisticated and detailed, the scientists say, they have also successfully passed some important reality checks by simulating actual climate changes with reasonable accuracy.
The models are exhibiting "a progressive convergence toward what has happened in nature," said Dr. W. Lawrence Gates, a climatologist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California who has long been a leader of systematic international efforts, including those of the intergovernmental panel, to evaluate the models.
For making long-term predictions of climatic change on a continental scale or greater, Dr. Gates said, "the ensemble of existing modern models is reliable" and "provides a firm scientific base for policy."
Not everyone agrees. Some skeptics, like Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have always considered the models worthless as prognosticators, and still do. "I'm not saying the model output bears no resemblance at all to nature; in the gross figures, it looks plausibly similar," Dr. Lindzen said. But that, he said, "does not give you forecast ability."
No model, by definition, will ever match the real world perfectly. "It's never going to happen," said Dr. Hansen, the director of the Goddard Institute. A decade ago, Dr. Hansen became the first scientist to go on record before Congress and say that the greenhouse effect was probably the cause of global warming.
Models will always fail to mimic nature exactly, he says, even though today's smaller but much faster computers make possible a precision unapproached by the lumbering mainframe that occupied an entire floor above Tom's some 20 years ago, when the Hansen team became one of the first to simulate global climate -- and even though still faster computers are just over the horizon.
For one thing, the atmosphere's normal internal churnings are to some extent unpredictable; some variations are never repeated exactly. As Dr. Hansen put it, "the climate in any year is like a snowflake; no two are alike." The same can be said for decades and centuries. For another thing, the atmosphere is far too complex to be completely captured in any computer program. The essence of modeling is to simplify but to retain the processes most important in driving the climate.
Nevertheless, proponents of the models say, they are the most powerful tools available for analyzing climate. While the incessant pouring of greenhouse gases into the air by industrial activity constitutes an experiment of sorts, there is no way to know how it will turn out without waiting for several decades. Why turn to computers? The atmosphere is simply too complex for any other mode of analysis, and the virtual climate made possible by computers is far closer to reality than any model that might be generated in anyone's head, the model proponents say.
Some things about climate are simple and certain enough, needing no computer analysis. Scientists know, for instance, that a doubling of carbon dioxide, by itself, would warm the earth's surface by about two degrees. They also know that atmospheric concentrations of the gas are increasing as a result of industrial activity.
But simplicity ends there. The warming touches off feedback processes, some of which increase the warming and some of which decrease it. For instance, a warmer atmosphere melts snow and sea ice, both of which cool the planet by reflecting sunlight; less ice and snow means further warming. On the other hand, warming also increases low-level clouds, which cool the planet.
Modeling is in large measure an exercise in representing enough of these competing influences faithfully enough to estimate their net effect. The most important of the feedback influences, perhaps, involves water vapor, the most powerful greenhouse gas of all. An atmosphere warmed by carbon dioxide produces more vapor, and this amplification is critical to the models' forecasts of future warming.
A climate model is a computer program containing mathematical equations that express fundamental laws of atmospheric physics. These laws govern the interlinked workings of the sun, atmosphere, oceans, land and other elements of the climate system. The various feedback influences are also expressed mathematically. The computer calculates the extent to which the basic physical laws dictate changes in things like temperature and precipitation over time and under different conditions. For instance, modelers can introduce any sort of "forcing" influence they want -- increasing greenhouse gases, for instance -- to see what would happen over decades and centuries.
One big limitation of the models in predicting the climate decades ahead is that despite the growing speed of computers, they are unable to calculate climatic changes everywhere in the atmosphere. Instead, they make the calculations only at widely separated points. The points form a three-dimensional grid typically rising 10 or 12 miles above the earth. A typical spacing between grid points is about 150 miles horizontally and less than half a mile vertically. This "resolution," as scientists call it, is about twice as fine as a decade ago. But it still misses many processes that happen between grid points -- cloud formation, for example. So modelers approximate these factors as best they can.
Coarse resolution is also the major reason why the models are not very good at simulating climate at the regional scale. They simply miss too many small-scale climatic influences, like topography, vegetation and regional atmospheric churnings. Some modelers have developed techniques for overcoming this. For instance, they might model only part of the ocean-atmosphere system, using much more closely spaced grid points, to get a better fix on regional changes. That approach has been successfully employed, for instance, in predicting the comings and goings of El Nino, the vast pool of tropical Pacific water that disrupts weather around the world.
In another technique, modelers take the general results of a global climate model and use them to construct a second model of higher resolution for a limited region. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University have so far successfully used this "nesting" technique to reproduce observed precipitation patterns in the Middle Atlantic region.
As computers become more advanced, the resolution of models continues to improve. Researchers at a number of Federal laboratories are collaborating in the development of a next-generation model using several computers operating in parallel. The ocean part of the model has a horizontal grid spacing of less than 20 miles, which researchers believe is necessary to represent fine-scale ocean eddies and currents.
It is only in the last few years that models have included deep-ocean processes, which are critical to the climate system's functioning. The ocean, for instance, absorbs both carbon dioxide and heat, transports heat from one part of the planet to the other and provides moisture to the atmosphere.
An even bigger limitation of the models than coarse resolution is the incomplete knowledge of the atmosphere's functioning, Dr. Hansen says. Dr. Gates agrees, saying, "How the natural world works -- that's always going to be our problem."
Still, the models have been steadily incorporating more and more features of the climate system. One of the most important, in terms of model realism, has been the effect of tiny solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the atmosphere. The modern economy produces a lot of these aerosols, as they are called, most notably sulfur dioxide droplets emitted by industry. Aerosols cool parts of the planet by reflecting sunlight. Before this effect was included in the models, they consistently produced more global warming than was being observed. Afterward, the model representations and the observations agreed more closely.
With the aerosol effect factored in, the intergovernmental science panel estimates that the average global temperature will rise by two to six degrees in the next century, with a best estimate of about three and a half degrees, barring cuts in greenhouse emissions. The warming will continue after that, the panel says.
The biggest gap in knowledge, many scientists believe, is that the net effect of clouds on the planet's temperature is still unknown. While low-level clouds reflect heat, high-level clouds trap it. Moreover, experts do not fully understand how water vapor behaves when the atmosphere warms. The amount by which vapor amplifies the warming therefore remains uncertain.
Dr. Lindzen has long maintained that the models simply get the physics of the water vapor feedback wrong, at least at high altitudes. The United Nations panel says the amplification clearly takes place at lower altitudes but concedes the uncertainty about higher altitudes.
Even if such uncertainties are somehow resolved, modelers will never be sure that they have included all the information necessary for realism. "With any models, what you never know is what you haven't put in," said Dr. Jeremiah P. Ostriker of Princeton University, who comes at computer modeling from a different perspective, that of an astrophysicist who uses models to study the cosmos. The best reality check, he said, "is to see how well you can match the real world."
By that standard, on the plus side, mainstream scientists say the models reproduce the main features of present-day climate, including the seasonal cycle, the comings and goings of monsoons, the seasonal shift of major rain belts and storm tracks, the average daily temperature cycle and many large-scale features of ocean circulation.
In the last two years, Dr. Gates said, models have for the first time reproduced the magnitude and frequency of the climate system's natural internal fluctuations on several time scales. "A number of them now have simulated variability that looks realistic," he said. But, he said, the unpredictability inherent in these fluctuations makes it impossible to predict their timing, and always will.
The models have also reproduced, at least in general outline, the changes in global climate observed in the last century. These include not only a general global warming of about one degree but also broad patterns of temperature change, both geographically and vertically, through the atmosphere.
When the Mount Pinatubo volcano erupted in the Philippines in 1991, sending aloft a global haze of planet-cooling aerosols, the Goddard model predicted that the cooling would be about one degree at its low point and would last about two years. That is what actually happened. To many experts, that indicates that the model faithfully reflects the climate system's sensitivity to heating and cooling influences from outside -- whether they be aerosols or greenhouse gases.
Models have also simulated the climate of the last ice age and come up with an average global temperature about seven degrees lower than today's, well within the cold period's actual temperature range.
But the models do not always match reality this well. One major shortcoming, for instance, is that the global models fail to simulate accurately the major temperature swings associated with El Nino. And there is that biggest deficiency of all: the failure to predict climatic change accurately on a regional scale.
In sum, the models are still cloudy crystal balls. But they are getting clearer, and they offer some answers.
"Despite all the uncertainties, I think you can make useful estimates" of climatic change using the models, said Dr. Andrew P. Ingersoll, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology who employs them to investigate the climates of other planets.
"You just have to be aware of the uncertainties," he said. "It's just like any other scientific process."

Chart: "A Better Crystal Ball"
Scientists can precisely measure the increase in heat-trapping greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, in Earth's atmosphere. But they cannot say precisely what climate changes, if any, the increase will produce. Conditions in the atmosphere depend on a vast array of factors -- winds, clouds, ocean currents and so on -- that are fiendishly difficult to quantify. Still, the increasing power of computers has enabled climatologists to improve their ability to make numerical models of climate change.
 
So far, climate models do far better globally than locally.
A climate model at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, left, predicted average global surface temperature changes from 1979 to 1995.
 
Over all, the predictions corresponded pretty well to temperatures measured during that time. But in particular localities, there were large differences between predicted and observed readings.
 
Effects and counter-effects
A major task of climate models is to calculate the net effect of competing processes and influences, shown below. Some enhance global warming; others retard it.
 
1. A global grid . . .
Climate model-builders start by laying a grid over the surface of the Earth. They extend the grid into three dimensions, up into the atmosphere.
 
2. . . . of layered cubes
Each box in the grid is allotted a given amount of heat, air pressure, water vapor and the like.
 
3. Then, based on the principles of physics, the computer predicts how these elements will interact over time if one variable -- emissions of greenhouse gases, for example -- is changed.
 
?. Puzzles in the clouds
The process is complicated by gaps in scientific knowledge. For example, warming on Earth would cause more water to evaporate, producing more clouds. But some clouds reflect sunlight, which might in turn cause the planet to cool. The net effect is unclear.
 
?. Only some of the carbon emitted through the burning of fossil fuels turns up in the atmosphere, and scientists would like to know where the rest of it goes. Some of it ends up in seawater and soil.

HEADLINE: Fluor Sees Plunge in Profits Of $100 Million for the Year

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 3

 BODY:
The Fluor Corporation said today that it expected profits for its new fiscal year to fall about $100 million, some 25 percent to 30 percent, below Wall Street estimates because of deteriorating business conditions, partly as a result of the financial turmoil in Asia.
The announcement stunned Wall Street, and Fluor's stock fell $3.875, or 9.4 percent, in heavy trading, closing at $37.25. 
 Shares of Fluor and other construction and engineering companies have taken a beating in recent weeks because of the economic uncertainty in Southeast Asia, which has been a major market for some of these companies, as they construct roads, railroads, power plants and factories.
But Lisa Boyette, a spokeswoman for Fluor, said the biggest reason for the earnings shortfall was that competitive pressures were cutting profit margins in many parts of the company's business. "Asia plays into it a bit, but it's a much bigger picture than that," she said.
She said the company had not had any projects canceled or postponed in Asia, which accounts for about 20 percent of its backlog. "However," she said, "what we now anticipate is that projects that haven't been awarded yet could slow down" as customers take a "wait and see" attitude in light of severe currency devaluations and slowing growth in the region.
Michael S. Dudas, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York, said the situation "is more a fundamental internal problem," unique to Fluor.
"The size of the shortfall is what's the shocking aspect to everyone here," he said. "This may cause some people to think about whether the company needs to have a major restructuring."
Fluor, based in Irvine, Calif., said it expected its operating profits for its engineering and construction subsidiary, Fluor Daniel, to range from $225 million to $250 million in the fiscal year that ends in October, 1998, about $100 million below estimates. Per share earnings for the parent company, it added, are likely to be 75 cents to $1 below current estimates of $3.30 to $3.75 a share.
This is only the latest in a string of setbacks for Fluor, whose stock was trading at twice its current level in February and for more than $53 as recently as Oct. 21.
In May, the company, whose revenues of about $11 billion make it the biggest American construction company by some rankings, announced it would take a $120 million provision for cost overruns on two big power plant projects. It also took a $20 million charge for layoffs and other moves intended to cut $100 million a year in costs.
In a statement today, Fluor's chairman and chief executive, Leslie G McCraw, said the projected earnings were "unacceptable" and that the company would move more toward high-margin markets and take various cost-cutting measures.

HEADLINE: Two Reports Show Strength in Economy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Two economic reports showed today that manufacturing unexpectedly strengthened in October and personal incomes rose in September, signs that the economy might not be slowing enough to keep the Federal Reserve from raising borrowing costs.
A third report showed that construction spending fell unexpectedly in September, posting its biggest drop in almost a year as builders spent less on hotels, office buildings, schools and hospitals. But even with the decline, most analysts expect construction will proceed at a high level for months to come. 
 Taken together, the statistics increase the possibility that the Fed could raise the overnight bank lending rate to guard against accelerating inflation, providing last week's rout in the stock market does not hurt consumer confidence or spending. The fourth quarter is "likely to see strong industrial production numbers, so any slowdown will have to come from the consumer sector," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at HSBC Securities Inc. in New York.
In financial markets, Treasury bonds fell after the reports, a sign that traders were less confident about the outlook for interest rates. The decline in bonds also reflected a broad shift of money into stocks, which helped the Dow Jones industrial average soar 232.31 points, or 3.12 percent.
The most closely scrutinized of the reports was the October manufacturing survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management, the freshest data on the economy's health.
An index derived from survey results rose to 56 last month from 54.2 in September, led by orders and production. Analysts had expected a decline to 54.1.
A reading of 50 or more in the index means manufacturing is expanding, while a reading below 50 signals a contraction. Employment and exports also strengthened.
Another index in the survey that measures prices, considered as an indicator of inflation, rose to 55.9 in October from 54.7. Industries reporting improved business conditions in October ranged from petroleum and paper to electronics, the report showed.
Personal income showed no sign of deterioration in September. Income climbed four-tenths of a percent in September after rising six-tenths of a percent in August, Commerce Department figures showed. Consumer spending also increased in September, rising two-tenths of a percent after climbing three-tenths of a percent in August.
The news on personal income and spending was less of a surprise because it was already evident in third-quarter statistics on the gross domestic product issued Friday by the Commerce Department. The economy grew at a stronger-than-expected 3.5 percent annual pace in the third quarter, helped by an annualized 5.7 percent third-quarter surge in consumer spending -- the biggest increase since the first quarter of 1982.
The Commerce Department report on construction showed spending declined 1.1 percent, to an annual pace of $595.8 billion in September, the biggest drop since outlays fell 1.2 percent last December. Analysts had expected a gain of five-tenths of a percent. But the news had little impact, partly because it was overshadowed by the strength of the purchasing survey and personal-income reports.
In addition, analysts said the outlook for higher construction spending in the coming months was good, because the vibrant economy was generating record tax revenues for public works projects and the supply of housing was falling.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Strong Stocks And Economy Hobble Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday as strong economic data raised concerns about inflation and as a strong rebound in stocks pulled money out of the bond market. The losses came despite increased confidence that the Federal Reserve would not raise short-term interest rates at next week's monetary policy meeting.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 23/32, to 102 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.21 percent, from 6.15 percent on Friday. 
 Bond investors were alarmed by a report of strong manufacturing conditions from the National Association of Purchasing Management. Its monthly index rose unexpectedly, to 56 points in October from 54.2 a month earlier.
The report showed that prices were up, too, though analysts said that broader inflation was still a long way off. Nonetheless, traders believe that investors will put off making major purchases until after next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Before the meeting, a number of reports, including employment data for October, will provide a clearer picture of the economy's direction. The jobs report is scheduled for Friday.
Yesterday's losses in Treasury securities mounted in the afternoon as stocks rose sharply, with the Dow closing at 7,674.40, up 232.31 points. All last week bonds had capitalized on the turmoil in world stock markets, as investors fled to the safety of United States Government securities. With yesterday's gains in stocks, some of that money was pulled out of bonds again.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic consulting and forecasting firm, said that despite the recent volatility in stocks, declines would not be prolonged or severe given the general soundness of the economy.
"The only reason rates have dropped this low is the uncertainty surrounding equity market prospects in the U.S. and abroad in the next few weeks," Mr. McCarthy said. "Once equity markets settle down, we expect interest rates to rise."
Amid all the coming economic reports, the Treasury will be conducting a $35 billion quarterly debt refunding, adding the additional burden of supply to the market's concerns. As a result, prices of securities are likely to remain contained, with investors demanding a risk premium before they buy, analysts said.
But Doug Burtnick, managing analyst at Technical Data of Boston, said that while prospects for the refunding auctions were uncertain, the general outlook for the market was not entirely negative.
"In general, weakness will be viewed by longer-term investors as a buying opportunity," he said. "Last week's global equity debacles still hold the potential for providing a longer-term drag on the world economies and in the long haul, should keep inflation in check."
Results at yesterday's auction of Treasury bills were better than expected, with the rate for a three-month maturity averaging about 5.12 percent, up from 4.97 percent a week ago and the six-month maturities at 5.13 percent, up from 5.08 percent.
In when-issued trading ahead of today's $14 billion sale of new three-year notes, which begins the quarterly refunding, dealers were offering them at a price to yield 5.75 percent, up from 5.66 percent on Friday. Tomorrow's $11 billion of 10-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.91 percent, and Thursday's $10 billion of 30-year bonds, 6.17 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:

HEADLINE: October Auto Sales Weak Except for Newest Designs

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 3

 BODY:
People shopping for a new car last month were ready to plunk down money for the hottest new or redesigned models, leaving auto makers with lackluster sales for all but the freshest designs.
The Chrysler Corporation said today that its sales fell 8.3 percent in October, the first month of the new model year. But its newest sport utility vehicle, the brawny Dodge Durango, sold briskly, as did its new four-door version of the Dodge Ram pickup truck. 
 Honda's redesigned 1998 Accord sold briskly during its first month on the market, helping the company's sales increase 11.2 percent in October. "Sales the first month out of the gate are fantastic," said Dick Colliver, a Honda executive vice president.
David L. Littmann, the senior economist at the Detroit-based Comerica Bank, said that Honda's brisk sales of the Accord combined with weaker sales at other auto makers showed that American consumers were attracted to extensively redesigned models, rather than vehicles that change little from year to year. "Unless you have a new vehicle, a new product, then your market share is going to erode," he said.
Chrysler is counting on the introduction of two new sedans -- the Dodge Intrepid this month and the Chrysler Concorde by December -- to lift its sales out of the doldrums.
"The overall market may still be a bit soft, but we're pleased at what we're seeing and confident about the coming months," said James P. Holden, Chrysler's executive vice president of sales and marketing. Chrysler's car sales fell 13.3 percent in October while sales of its sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks fell 6.2 percent.
The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, which are scheduled to report their October sales results Tuesday, are each expected to report declines of up to 5 percent. For the nine manufacturers reporting results today, sales dropped 2 percent.
Several reported increases in October. Nissan said its sales rose 4 percent. Subaru said its sales rose 17 percent, Volvo 9.7 percent and Kia 55.7 percent.
But others posted declines. Isuzu said its sales fell 24.8 percent, Mitsubishi 16.5 percent and Land Rover, a unit of BMW A.G., 24.6 percent.
The weakness in sales comes after months of ferocious competition in the auto market that have slowed the rise in light-truck prices and actually produced a drop in prices of new cars. On average, prices for new light trucks rose only seven-tenths of 1 percent in the 12-month period ended in September, while prices of new cars actually fell by an identical seven-tenths of 1 percent, according to Labor Department figures. By comparison, the overall Consumer Price Index rose 2.2 percent in the period.
Auto makers have tried wooing buyers with generous rebates and discounted leases along with lower prices, but sales remain soft. "The consumer is alive and kicking," said David M. Garrity, a Smith Barney auto analyst. "When consumers have more choices, things become a little more difficult" for manufacturers.
With all the rebates offered to help spur sales, car dealers are not complaining much. Stephen Peck, the sales manager at a Dodge dealership in Baltimore, said that sales were up 22 percent from October 1996, mainly because of strong sales of light trucks and deep discounts on the prices of the Neon and Stratus sedans.
The Dodge Durango full-sized sport utility vehicle was an instant success, he said, while the Dodge Ram Quad Cab full-sized pickup, which has a four-door passenger compartment, appeals to a wider audience than the farmers who used to buy pickups. "We're getting a very nice mix of consumers, including professionals as well," Mr. Peck said.
Alan Sweetow, the general manager of a multifranchise dealership in Escondido, Calif., said that the redesigned 1998 Honda Accord sedan had been very successful while the CR-V sport utility vehicle, introduced last winter, was continuing to sell well. At his dealership, sales of Hondas and Mazdas were up, while Acura sales fell, but only because of a shortage of new cars, Mr. Sweetow said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A Clinton adviser argues the economic case for self-regulation of sales pitches in cyberspace.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE Clinton Administration's point person on Internet issues is lobbying Madison Avenue to help insure that a policy providing for the self-regulation of cyberspace -- including sales pitches aimed at children -- withstands strong, sustained challenges.
"What you are doing is essential to the success of the Administration's strategy," Ira C. Magaziner, senior adviser to President Clinton for policy development, said yesterday at a conference about youngsters and on-line advertising. "The tremendous economic benefits of the Internet will not work if we don't get efficient industry self-regulation on issues like privacy and content, especially in the children's area." 
 "If you fail, we will have to go the legislative route," he added. "That gets caught up in the political process and will be less rational and efficient."
About 100 people heard Mr. Magaziner as he gave the keynote address at the conference, held at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. The conference was sponsored by the Children's Advertising Review Unit, an organization that is part of the longtime voluntary self-regulatory process of adjudicating advertising disputes.
In April, the children's unit issued voluntary guidelines on Internet marketing to junior consumers. That has become a contentious topic, with parents complaining about what they perceive as disingenuous appeals to their sons and daughters for data in exchange for trinkets or E-mail signed by cartoon characters.
The guidelines include recommendations that advertisers disclose why they are requesting information from children and what will be done with it. Three months after the guidelines were issued, President Clinton disclosed his worldwide economic commerce strategy, which was based on a position paper from a task force headed by Mr. Magaziner.
The position paper was surprising for its forthright advocacy of self-regulation instead of governmental intervention, primarily because Mr. Magaziner was the architect of the Clinton health care plan, which failed after being criticized for relying too heavily on regulatory bureaucracy.
One reason that cyberspace warrants a laissez-faire approach, Mr. Magaziner said, is that "interactivity gives you the unique ability to empower people, parents, schools and libraries to protect themselves."
Mr. Magaziner acknowledged that there had been protests about the new policy. "People say: 'You're just being a shill. You're leaving the Internet open to let industry do all this terrible marketing to children,' " he said. " 'How can you do that, particularly as Democrats?' "
"People get afraid of change," he said, "afraid of something their kids understand better than them."
But, Mr. Magaziner asserted, he is responding to a larger, more damaging fear, which has hampered the growth of "the new digital economy": the fear that "governments would step in and overregulate, overtax and overcensor the Internet and strangle development."
Electronic commerce will be "the engine of growth for the world economy and the U.S. econony in the next quarter-century," he added, saying, "If we get in and regulate it, we'll just mess it up."
Those who want to police on-line content should "look to the private sector for the means," Mr. Magaziner said, perhaps in the form of "brand-name filters," software developed by organizations like the Children's Television Workshop or the Christian Coalition.
He added that it was "essential that children's privacy be protected and children not be exploited, that information is not gained from children without parental permission."
Asked by a member of the audience if that was a "practical impossibility," he replied: "When a C.E.O. really wants to do something, then it gets done. What we are saying to C.E.O.'s is that if you think the Internet will be a business opportunity, make this a priority."
The Children's Advertising Review Unit is administered by the National Advertising Review Council, formed by the Council of Better Business Bureaus and three organizations: the American Advertising Federation, the American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers.
On-line ads for children "offer some exciting opportunities for creativity and innovation," said Walter J. O'Brien, president of the review council and vice president of the Better Business Bureaus, but the "consequences of even a small misstep can be significant."
"Are we up to the challenge Ira issued today?" he asked. "I think we are, but if we aren't, we'll get beaten down" by Government regulation.
Mr. O'Brien said he would pursue a request from Mr. Magaziner that the children's unit ask the European Union to follow the American de minimis approach to Internet regulation, rather than adopt Government strictures.
Elizabeth Lascoutx, vice president and director for the children's unit, said the voluntary guidelines had worked well since April, adding that "we're working on about 30" questions about on-line children's ads.
"The real challenge," Ms. Lascoutx said, "is that a lot of Web publishers and developers don't come out of advertising. Though they're responsive when we get to them, they don't have any background on self-regulation."
Jeffrey Perlman, senior vice president for government affairs at the American Advertising Federation, said he saw a similar problem in dealing with World Wide Web sites put up by fans or entrepreneurs who advertise, promote or sell popular toys and collectibles.
"They're people who don't intend to do anything wrong," he said, "but they don't know what to do."

HEADLINE: Long Behind, Louisville Is Experiencing a Surge

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 31

 BODY:
Almost as a symbolic affirmation of this city's resurgence, Muhammad Ali is coming home.
After 11 years in Berrien Springs, Mich., Mr. Ali and his wife, Lonnie, have announced they are moving back to Louisville, the city of their births, to supervise the development of the Muhammad Ali Center, a museum to celebrate the athletic, humanitarian and spiritual aspects of his life. 
 For Kentucky's largest city, the timing could hardly be better. After decades as the heart of a slumbering region largely known for the Kentucky Derby, bourbon and Louisville Slugger baseball bats (which until last year were made in Indiana), Louisville is awakening. With the 1990's have come new cultural attractions, new businesses and, for the first time in decades, population growth, with nearly one million people now living in a seven-county area that includes the city.
Growth has also brought the Louisville area new problems. Mayor Jerry E. Abramson said that though the overall crime rate had dropped in recent years, the number of homicides had increased as a result of a new epidemic of crack cocaine. Drug dealers who have saturated big-city markets, Mayor Abramson said, are now looking to smaller cities like his for customers.
In each of the last two years, the Louisville police have recorded about 60 murders, twice the total of any previous year, and "better than half of them," Mr. Abramson said, "are directly related to drugs."
But unlike other regions, where an economic boom and population growth have led to sprawl, driven up real estate costs, accelerated life styles -- and even attracted a criminal element -- metropolitan Louisville has largely retained its folksy appeal, leisurely pace and affordable prices. This is a town, after all, where most everybody calls Mr. Abramson Mayor Jer.
"A lot of people live here happily because we're not Atlanta or Nashville," said Paul A. Coomes, a professor of economics at the University of Louisville, making the customary comparisons used by local officials in their business recruitment campaigns.
Just as larger cities like Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Las Vegas periodically reinvent themselves to stay economically viable, smaller cities are engaged in their own competition, which in many ways is more intense. There are more of them.
Here at the crossroads of the South and Midwest, Louisville has struggled for years with regional cities like Indianapolis, Nashville and Cincinnati to attract businesses, young professionals and a highly educated work force.
By some measures, the others have always been winning, with larger and more cosmopolitan populations. Indianapolis has 752,000 people, according to the United States Census Bureau for 1994; Nashville has 505,000; Cincinnati, 358,000, and Louisville only 270,000. It is unlikely that Louisville will overtake its larger neighbors in population any time soon.
But many people here say the combination of Louisville's location, relatively low real estate costs and growing number of theaters, museums, sports arenas and other diversions, is helping the region catch up. This year alone, 204 companies have located or expanded in the metropolitan area, adding 10,532 jobs, according to the Kentucky Economic Development Office. The region has sustained that pace for more than five years and now has an unemployment rate below 4 percent.
"We had an image problem to overcome," said Michael P. Bosc, vice president of the Greater Louisville Chamber of Commerce. "We had the image of Kentucky as hillbillies, and we needed the world to know we had a lot more than bourbon, horse racing and tobacco."
Like many other regions of the country, northern Kentucky was devastated by the recession of the 1980's. As 40 percent of the regional economy, manufacturing was hit particularly hard. Plants closed, and 35,000 people lost jobs.
To stanch the losses, elected officials and leaders of the business community began pushing to diversify the economy. That included plans for a $600 million expansion of the Louisville airport to add passenger terminals and two new parallel runways. One has been completed and the other is expected to open in December.
Around the same time, the region got a huge boost from United Parcel Service, now the state's largest private employer, which had bought its first seven cargo jets in 1981, based them in Louisville and hired 250 people to run the company's new two-day air service. Today, U.P.S. flies 207 planes and employs 14,000 workers in the area.
"It's not been chopped liver," Mr. Abramson, 51, a Democrat who was elected to a record third four-year term in 1993, said in an interview. "We have had a continual evolution but in a managed growth way. We haven't created traffic difficulties and the growth has not overwhelmed our infrastructure. Things are good."
In addition, area residents have many more amenities than people living in cities of comparable size have, including an orchestra, an opera company, repertory theater, children's theater, the Kentucky Derby Museum, a baseball bat museum that opened a year ago, a new waterfront and the annual Humana Festival of New American Plays. Scheduled to open within a year are a downtown baseball stadium for Louisville's minor-league team, the Redbirds, and a football stadium on the University of Louisville campus.
One person eager to be part of the resurgence is Mr. Ali, 55, the former heavyweight boxing champion whose 88-acre estate in Michigan is for sale.
"I have family here; he has family here," Mrs. Ali said after a news conference to announce plans for the center. "Muhammad has always felt ties, links and identification with people in this city. This is home. This is our base."
Mr. Ali, who speaks barely above a whisper because of the effects of Parkinson's disease, said he hoped to find a home on 25 acres.
Why even that many, he was asked?
He flashed a devilish grin and said, "No neighbors."

In a final effort to aid the Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia, Donald S. Beyer Jr., President Clinton came to Northern Virginia today and urged voters to reject the tax cuts promised by Mr. Beyer's Republican opponent, James S. Gilmore 3d.
Mr. Clinton called the Republican's plan to phase out the annual tax that Virginians pay on cars and trucks "a brilliant ploy" for focusing on what many state residents consider a "pain in the neck." But he told a lunch-time crowd that the instant pain relief of a tax cut could harm the state in years to come. Some economists estimate that the Gilmore plan could cost the state as much as $3 billion a year. 
 "This is going to be like one of those meals you order and you're hungry 30 minutes later. Or it's going to be like something you do, and afterward you are so proud of yourself," Mr. Clinton said under a sparkling sun in Alexandria's Market Square.
This was the second straight day that Mr. Clinton had tried to shore up the chances of a Democrat running for governor. On Sunday, in Edison, N.J., he joined James E. McGreevey, who is virtually deadlocked in a race with the Republican incumbent, Christine Todd Whitman, who is seeking a second term.
But here in Virginia, the only other state with an election for governor this year, Mr. Clinton's appearance might have come too late. After running virtually even with Mr. Gilmore for months, Mr. Beyer, the Lieutenant Governor, has fallen behind in every major statewide poll in the last two weeks, by as many as 12 points.
Democrats here are also fighting to maintain control of the state House of Delegates. They hold a 53 to 46 advantage with 1 independent who often votes with Republicans. The state Senate is tied at 20, and although no Senate elections are being held this year, the lieutenant governor's vote breaks any tie. The Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, John H. Hager, is running even with the Democrat, L. F. Payne, a former Congressman.
Political analysts around the state said that much of the reason for Mr. Gilmore's lead was his success in selling his tax cut plan, which has overshadowed almost every other issue either candidate has tried to discuss.
In arguing against the plan as a sure way to drain state resources for improvements in education, the environment and transportation, Mr. Beyer has promoted a less expensive change in the car tax, a tax credit of up to $250.
At the same time, Mr. Beyer has been unable to link the Gilmore car tax and its possible consequences in unambiguous language, as Mr. Clinton did so nimbly in his 15-minute speech today.
"Think how you felt every time in your life when you did something you knew wasn't quite so, wasn't quite right, selfishly gratifying, and you felt lousy the next day," Mr. Clinton said. "And think how you felt every time in your life you were tempted to do something that was selfish, and you didn't do it, and the next day you felt wonderful."
After the President's speech, Mr. Beyer praised him for synthesizing issues, which he, as the candidate, had struggled to do.
"That's why," Mr. Beyer said, "he's the President."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CHALLENGER;
By Subway, Ferry and Bus, Seeking Votes

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Ruth W. Messinger turned to public transportation yesterday in a final 19-hour quest for votes, riding 10 subway lines and the Staten Island ferry to campaign in all boroughs. Energized by what she called "a huge emotional boost" from President Clinton's visit on Sunday, Ms. Messinger urged Democrats to "take back City Hall and move New York City into the 21st Century."
Ms. Messinger rode parts of all the three old subway systems -- the BMT, IRT and IND -- and walked from college campuses to shopping districts, from pizza parlors to housing projects. With her focus still on education and the schools, she told everyone who would listen, and even some who would not, to ignore pollsters' predictions and to vote for her today against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 She began on the E train in Jamaica, Queens, and went on to ride the 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, B, D, F, and N subway lines, the Staten Island Rapid Transit line and an S51 bus, all in an effort to meet as many voters as possible and to offer a populist contrast to Mr. Giuliani's 48-hour bus tour on a chartered motorcoach.
"It made sense to me to travel the way most New Yorkers travel and to be able to talk to people on the trains as we move from place to place," Ms. Messinger said, while riding an F train from 34th Street in Manhattan to Park Slope in Brooklyn.
Comparing her journey with Mr. Giuliani's, she added, "It means that instead of retreating to a bus, and traveling alone with staff between stops, I am constantly able to visit and talk to people."
Although most subway riders graciously accepted the handbills that Ms. Messinger and her campaign aides offered, and some said that they and their families would vote for her, not everyone was convinced.
Forrest Surl, 32, of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, questioned her about unemployment, housing and welfare for about 10 minutes, but said later that their conversation had not changed his mind. "I am decided," he said. "I am going the other way."
At each stop, Ms. Messinger was joined by prominent Democrats, beginning at 7:15 A.M. at the Archer Avenue/Parsons Boulevard subway station in Jamaica with the Rev. Al Sharpton, her opponent in the Democratic mayoral primary.
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President who has been one of Ms. Messinger's most loyal Democratic supporters since he dropped his own brief bid for the mayoral nomination, mocked some of Mr. Giuliani's campaign ads as he introduced Ms. Messinger at a rally at La Guardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens.
"There's another commercial, Rudy Giuliani works for you 20 hours a day," Mr. Ferrer said. "You know, he's there at every water main break. He fights a lonely war against terrorism. My God, he's ready to catch a falling kitten out of a tree. Tomorrow, tomorrow let's give that man a vacation."
On a sparkling day that followed 48 hours of rain, Ms. Messinger made other stops at City College in upper Manhattan, in the Hub shopping district in the South Bronx and in Park Slope and downtown Brooklyn. Emerging from the F train at Ninth Street and Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, Ms. Messinger ducked into a corner pizza shop where David N. Dinkins, the former Mayor, was munching on a slice as he waited for her.
Together with Mr. Dinkins and City Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, Ms. Messinger walked Seventh Avenue, greeting school children and their parents and signing autographs, like one for Kristen Lashley, a 13-year-old eighth grader. "To Kristen," Ms. Messinger wrote. "For a better city."
Later she campaigned at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal and, after crossing on the ferry, at a housing project in Staten Island. Throughout the day, she spoke frequently of being rejuvenated and energized by her rally with President Clinton on Sunday night.
For Ms. Messinger, whose second term as Manhattan Borough President ends this year, yesterday's subway tour was the culmination of nearly a year of scurrying across the city, mostly by car and van, in her uphill challenge against Mr. Giuliani, the Republican incumbent. She acknowledged yesterday that the task has not always been easy.
"Every time I go out, it's the same thing -- and that is, how many more voters can I reach, how many more voters' questions can I answer, how many more voters can I convince to get involved?" she said. "There are days when that goes really well and there are days when it goes less well. But that's precisely what a campaign is all about.
"I am very, very pleased with how we have done."

On WLIB-AM radio yesterday. 
 "This is about Democrats versus Republicans. It's about the party that wants to invest in schools and improve the qualities of life for families, and create jobs, and fight police brutality, against a mayor who doesn't have a plan for doing any of those things. And has in fact presided over unemployment that has gone up, reading scores that have gone down, refused to speak out or take action against police brutality. So people have a very clear choice."

HEADLINE: Wealth of Mine Barons Turns to Dust at Source

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: LEADVILLE, Colo.

 BODY:
Guggenheim Berlin, Guggenheim Bilbao, Guggenheim New York, Guggenheim Venice. Why not a Guggenheim Leadville?
Leadville, as the name implies, is not chic. Perched at 10,152 feet, it is a hard-knocks mining town, claiming a little fame as the highest incorporated city in North America. 
 More than 135 years of a "get rich and get out" mining ethic has left two legacies. The population has dwindled to a tenth of its 1880's size, and the Environmental Protection Agency has declared the entire town a Superfund site.
Some holes that environmental engineers are plugging today produced the cornerstone of the Guggenheim fortune a century ago -- silver and lead worth $268 million in 1997 dollars.
"The Guggenheim fortune was started right here in Leadville," said Carl Miller, a third-generation resident who represents the area in the State Assembly. "It sure would be nice if they looked back at this community, which is struggling through the hardest times in its history."
In 1989, Mr. Miller wangled the only Guggenheim donation seen here in modern times, $25,000 to the National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum.
For their part, officers and spokesmen for the four Guggenheim foundations, all based in New York, said few projects in Leadville would meet the criteria stipulated by the bylaws of their foundations. One promotes modern art, a second grants midcareer fellowships, another studies criminal justice and the last supports research on violence and aggression.
Another response might be that everyone else did it.
Since 1860, mines in Leadville and elsewhere in Lake County have disgorged, at present-day prices, $12.5 billion in gold, silver, lead, copper, zinc and molybdenum, according to the Colorado Geological Survey, a state agency. All of this in a county that has real estate valued at a total of $53 million.
Marshall Field used some of his Leadville mining profits to start his retail business in Chicago. Charles H. Dow turned financial lessons that he learned as a newspaper reporter and mine manager here into a Wall Street news service, Dow Jones & Company.
Charles Boettcher parlayed a hardware store here into a Denver-based industrial empire. James J. Brown, a gold mine superintendent, also moved to Denver, building a showcase city house for his unsinkable wife, Molly Brown.
"Nobody who made their money here did anything for this place," Municipal Judge Neil V. Reynolds said with a view befitting his status as a fifth-generation resident. "Mining is a community of occupation, not a community of place, like farming."
Boom and bust has marked the West's economy for generations.
"The history of the West is, to some extent, the history of exploitation," former Gov. Richard Lamm said. "First the fur trappers, then the miners. We are building the 'match belt,' economies that flame brightly, then are snuffed out, leaving us with a hole in the ground surrounded by a ghost town."
Even today, with Denver emerging as a national center for cable television and mutual funds, the gothic tales that hang over mining towns like Leadville feed a lingering Western distrust of Eastern capital.
In New York recently, an employee of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation mused vaguely in his Fifth Avenue office: "Leadville? Wasn't that copper?"
But in this alpine village, the family legacy remains as alive as the aging timber head frames above the Guggenheim silver mines that figure in a tourist guide, "The Routes of the Silver Kings." Local politics are still controlled by descendants by the Slovenian miners brought here over a century ago by Meyer Guggenheim, the family patriarch.
Leadville's last working mine and largest private employer, the Black Cloud, is run by Asarco, a company that the family founded and controlled for decades.
In the 1880's, Leadville, with 30,000 people, was the second largest city in the state after Denver. Its latest bust occurred a decade ago, when alternative processes were developed for the use of the mineral molybdenum to harden steel. In a few years, the work force at the nearby Climax Molybdenum mine, an enterprise not owned by the Guggenheims, fell from 3,000 people to 20.
The mine had paid 85 percent of Lake County taxes, and the closing devastated schools and the wider community.
"We have buckets catching drips in all the buildings," Superintendent Peg Portscheller said of leaking roofs in the Lake County schools. The wiring is so bad that overhead projectors cannot be used in some classrooms, she said, and heating is uneven.
Aging window frames have separated from walls, allowing miniature snowdrifts to form in several classrooms during snowstorms. An average of 10 feet of snow falls every winter, a period that nearly coincides with the school year.
The 1,400 students in the district reflect changing demographics, as 44 percent are from low-income families and receive free lunches, 46 percent are Hispanic and 59 percent graduate from high school.
The collapse of mining has meant an end to what people call "a family wage," $45,000 a year plus benefits for a miner who put in a 40-hour week. To match that, families have to move away or send two breadwinners northward over the Continental Divide to take low-wage jobs as dishwashers, housekeepers and janitors in the ski resorts.
But, just as babies are routinely given supplemental oxygen at birth here because of the altitude, Leadville natives seem to be suckled on a healthy dose of class resentment that extends to their view of the Guggenheim name that is paraded in more elegant corners of the world.
In fact, the museums were not all built with Guggenheim money. The Bilbao museum in Spain was financed by the regional Basque government; Deutsche Bank A.G. agreed to pay construction and operating costs for the museum in Berlin, which is in the bank's headquarters.
A working-class holdout in the Rockies, Leadville has a main street where people can buy a dishwasher, fill a doctor's prescription, pawn a hunting rifle, refill a propane canister, have an automobile repaired and buy a miner's cottage for $63,000.
By contrast, a neighbor to the west, Aspen, is a town where the average sale price of a one-family house last year was $1.4 million. To the north are Vail and Eagle County, with an assessed real estate value of $1.3 billion.
Gold-plated Vail is not always subtle in its attitude toward Leadville.
"One year, all of a sudden, our births jumped, from 85 a year to 110," Judge Reynolds recalled. "It turned out that the Vail hospital was steering the Mexican women, the Medicaid cases, over the pass to us."
A few years ago, Vail residents voted against a cemetery in town. Apparently a field of tombstones was deemed bad publicity for the ski industry. So Leadville continues to provide mortuary services for Vail.
"The Vail clinic would call up and say, 'Come after dark to the back entrance and don't use the hearse,' " recalled Judge Reynolds, who moonlighted a few years back with the local funeral home.
With that history, residents come up with cautious wish lists when they hear that a Deutsche Guggenheim is to open on Nov. 7 on the Unter den Linden in Berlin.
"The Guggenheims should remember their roots and do something for the town that gave them a launching," said Douglas Teeter, a native who recently returned to open an art gallery on the second floor of a clapboard house. "Maybe they could help the Leadville Arts Council sponsor trips for high school students to go down to Denver to visit the art museum."

HEADLINE: Casino Ship Suspends Cruises, Saying 12-Mile Rule Has Hurt Business

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
A casino ship in Brooklyn that offered short offshore gambling cruises has suspended operations, putting an abrupt halt to a venture that the Giuliani administration had feared would lead to a flotilla of such ships in the waters around New York City.
Executives of Bay Casino, which ran the ship from Sheepshead Bay, said a legal interpretation by a Federal prosecutor that ships must travel at least 12 miles off shore before gambling is allowed, instead of just 3, had made the venture unprofitable. 
 The company said in a statement that it could "no longer sustain its success operating at 12 miles," but would pursue its lawsuit to overturn that requirement. The company's boat, the Liberty I, which had been sailing 12 miles to sea since mid-October, last sailed at midnight Friday.
The 12-mile limit increases the time of the trip from 25 minutes to 90 minutes each way, the company has said, making it less attractive to customers and forcing the company to cut back from three trips a day to two.
Company officials said they could not sail during the winter months unless the 12-mile rule was revoked, but planned to resume the cruises next spring even if that limit remained. They said the ship could sail more quickly and comfortably in the spring because the seas are calmer.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has tried to limit the so-called cruises to nowhere, which he has said are unlikely to provide much economic benefit to the city and are vulnerable to the influences of organized crime.
The Mayor had urged the United States Attorney in Brooklyn, Zachary W. Carter, to enforce the 12-mile standard on gambling ships in the hope that such a rule would deter companies from offering the cruises. In response to the Mayor's request, Mr. Carter issued his interpretation of the Federal law governing offshore jurisdiction, saying that ships had to sail 12 miles offshore before gambling was legal.
Gambling-industry analysts have said that a 12-mile limit could discourage other companies from trying to set up such operations in New York. In fact, a business leader in the Rockaways said yesterday that a company hoping to sail a catamaran on gambling cruises starting next spring would drop the proposal if the 12-mile ruling stood.
The suspension of cruises by the Liberty I means that about 200 employees will be laid off.
Bay Casino asked a Federal District Court judge in Brooklyn last month to reinstate the three-mile rule. At a hearing last month, lawyers for the company said that the 12-mile requirement had forced the company to cut the number of cruises from three to two a day and had cut the company's daily revenue in half. The judge, Allyne R. Ross, is reviewing briefs from both sides and has said that she would decide as quickly as possible.
Mr. Giuliani, who was busy campaigning across the city yesterday, would not comment in detail about Bay Casino's decision.
Rudy Washington, Deputy Mayor for Community Development and Business Services, also would not respond to questions, citing the pending litigation. He issued a statement saying simply that officials were aware of Bay Casino's decision and adding, "The city would like to reiterate its support for the 12-mile limit as interpreted by U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter."
Mr. Carter's interpretation is based on legislation passed by Congress last year to extend the nation's territorial jurisdiction to 12 miles for law-enforcement purposes, as part of an anticrime and antiterrorism bill. His office had obtained an interpretation from the Department of Justice in Washington that backed his position applying the 12-mile rule to gambling cruises.
Lawyers for Bay Casino disputed the rule, noting that the 12-mile requirement had not been invoked in Florida, where similar cruises sail out of Miami. Officials from the United States Attorney's office in the Southern District of Florida said they had never been asked to look into the issue.
Wilfredo Fernandez, special counsel to United States Attorney Thomas E. Scott in Miami, said the Brooklyn rule had prompted his office to review the law but they had not yet reached a decision.
"The Justice Department has said that the legislation is valid and that the limit is 12 miles," he said. "So the question now is: How and when do we enforce that law and are we going to prosecute people who violate the 12-mile rule?"
Joseph Kelleher, executive vice president of Bay Casino, said yesterday that reservations had dropped off considerably because of the longer sailing time. He said the company was in the process of canceling about 3,500 reservations that had been made for trips into next year.
"We still believe that Sheepshead Bay is one of the most advantageous spots to operate a casino from," he said. "We're waiting for a favorable decision in court, but we plan on reinstating service in spring, at either 3 or 12 miles." He said that milder weather in the spring would allow the ship to sail to the 12-mile limit more quickly.
Councilman Anthony D. Weiner, who had opposed Bay Casino's cruises because the operation introduced traffic and parking problems into his district, said the company never had a very good relationship with the city because it chose to keep its gambling plans secret until its opening.
"I don't think anyone is ever happy to see a business fail, but some of their wounds were self-inflicted," he said. "Maybe the good that will come of this is that other businesses will learn it is better to work with the Mayor and the community than against them."
Before United States Attorney Carter issued his ruling last month, city officials said they had received more than two dozen inquiries from other companies that wanted to set up similar cruises. Officials from several of those companies did not return phone calls seeking comment yesterday.
But Louis Caucig, president of the Rockaway Chamber of Commerce, who has been negotiating with a firm in Florida that plans to sail a 230-foot catamaran off the shores of Rockaway, said that the company would sail next spring only if the legal limit for off-shore gambling reverted to three miles.
"They're watching closely to see what happens with this," Mr. Caucig said. "And if it stays 12 miles, everybody loses."
Jason N. Ader, a gaming analyst at Bear Stearns & Company, said the 12-mile limit made the trip very unappealing for passengers because of the length of time needed to get into legal gaming waters and because of the rougher waters the ships encounter when they get farther from shore. "There's no question," he said, "that this is going to be a real deterrent for anyone considering coming into the market."

G.E. Cashing In Stake In Lockheed Martin
General Electric is cashing in its 13 percent stake in Lockheed Martin for $2.8 billion, which amounts to a big profit. For reasons that are not entirely clear, however, Wall Street seems to think that is good news for Lockheed Martin.
The transaction will produce accounting profits for both companies, but will penalize reported earnings for Lockheed Martin for years to come. Nonetheless, Lockheed Martin's stock, like that of G.E., rose.

HEADLINE: At Levi Strauss, A Big Cutback, With Largess

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Levi Strauss announced a drastic cutback yesterday to eliminate a third of its American manufacturing jobs. But in an extraordinary gesture of largess, the jeans maker coupled the bad news with a generous severance package that included extended benefits and even cash rewards for employees who find other work.
The retrenchment, which will close 11 factories in four states, reflected some of the same global cost pressures that have led other domestic manufacturers making mass-market products to reduce their reliance on American workers. 
 At the same time, however, the privately owned San Francisco company seemed to go out of its way to show that it was trying to cushion the blow on the affected communities. It also injected a measure of egalitarianism into the severance plan by giving the lowliest paid worker some of the same help that other companies had historically reserved for severed executives and other high-salaried people.
Levi said it would spend $200 million on the 6,395 affected workers, or an average of $31,274 each, for employees whose salaries range from the legal minimum of $5.15 an hour to about $12 an hour, or $25,000 a year at the high end of the pay scale.
"We're doing this because we believe it is the right thing to do for our employees," said Gordan Shank, president of Levi Strauss Americas. "Our employees have served us for a long time and this decision is not because of them, but a decision we had to make because of circumstances. We wanted to make sure that we provided them with an appropriate level of support to help them transition" to new work.
The workers will be paid for the next eight months, but will not have to report for duty once goods now on the factory floors are finished, Mr. Shank said. In addition, workers will collect three weeks of pay for each year worked. They will get company-paid health benefits for 18 months, incentives to take early retirement and up to $6,000 each for education, moving or job training.
Unlike most severance packages, which require workers to stay to the last day to collect, workers are eligible even if they find a new job tomorrow, Mr. Shank said. Indeed, workers will get a $500 bonus check as soon as they find new work.
The Levi Strauss Foundation will grant $8 million over the next three years to the eight communities where the plants are situated, about one-sixth of the corporate foundation's grant-making, Mr. Shank said.
The severance packages were negotiated with the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, known as Unite, and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represent only a fraction of the workers losing their jobs. Bruce Raynor, executive vice president of Unite, called the package "by far the best severance settlement apparel workers have ever gotten."
This is not the first time Levi Strauss has cut workers to reduce costs. Last February, it eliminated 1,000 white-collar jobs, 350 through layoffs, to reduce overhead by $80 million annually.
The cuts also come against a backdrop of generally improved economic prosperity in this country and fewer of the large-scale corporate layoffs seen in recent years.
Through September of this year layoffs are down 22 percent compared with 1996, according to Challenger Gray & Christmas, a Chicago firm that helps displaced workers find jobs.
To some degree, Levi's cutbacks reflect intense competition in the jeans market, created partly by improved technology that has expanded the varieties in denim and other clothes. Levi Strauss, which had sales of more than $7.1 billion last year, has seen its share of the denim clothing market shrink. The company said the cutbacks would bring its manufacturing capacity in line with North American demand.
Part of the competition is from department stores, which have developed their own brands like J. C. Penney's Arizona jeans. Levi Strauss now has about about one-fifth of the jeans market.
Other competitors such as Guess and Gitano, which make jeans abroad, have invested in high-quality factories and highly trained crews to produce quality pants, said Isaac Lagnado, president of Tactical Retail Solutions, a marketing consulting company. "Levi has quite a bit higher cost structure," Mr. Lagnado said. He said the company's Dockers brand, owned by half of American men, was under assault from "a lot of near-Dockers that are perfectly well manufactured and sell for $15 or $20," less than Levi Strauss wants to charge.
After the layoffs, Levi Strauss will operate 26 factories in the United States and Canada employing 12,213 people. Another 12,000 people work in salaried jobs in those two countries. The company said it had about 13,500 people working overseas.
Levi Strauss will close three of its four factories in El Paso, where it is the largest private employer, and one other Texas plant. It will also shutter two factories each in Arkansas and New Mexico and three in Tennessee.

HEADLINE: Newark to Make School Into a Center of Family Services

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Nov. 3

 BODY:
In an effort to make a public school a full-service place for children and their parents, school and city officials here today unveiled the Camden Middle Community School, which would offer after-school programs for children as well as job training, family counseling and health and aerobics classes for their parents.
"Providing a safe haven up to 9 P.M. for children after school was our first goal," said Mariko Lockhart, state director of Communities in Schools of New Jersey, a nonprofit group that helped plan and coordinate the program services. "But beyond that, we saw a need for recreation and education programs for parents." 
 By most accounts the program is unique in that it goes beyond the usual after-school effort for children whose parents cannot be home when they get out of school.
The program also marked a rare moment of cooperation between the administration of Mayor Sharpe James and officials of the local school system, which was taken over by the state Department of Education two years ago. Mayor James and other city officials have criticized the state takeover for supplanting the locally elected school board with a superintendent appointed by a Republican, largely white administration in Trenton.
The city's award of $350,000 to the school over the next two years was the first expenditure from a $2.9 million Federal grant the city won in 1995. It was awarded as part of the competition for Federal funds under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's empowerment zone and enterprise community program, which channels money for economic development and a variety of social services available to poor neighborhoods.
The new program at the school on Camden Street echoed a project undertaken there more than 30 years ago. That earlier federally financed experiment was aimed at better tailoring the school's curriculum to the needs of poorer inner-city areas and building parents' involvement with the schools and with their children's education.
That project included a child-parent center in a nearby storefront that stayed open day and night even during the 1967 riots, which hit that part of the city particularly hard.
The school's new programs will start in two weeks, and registration for parents and children will begin this week, said the principal, Josephine McDowell.
The 600-student school is in the city's Central Ward, once the city's poorest, and half its fifth to eighth graders are bused in, drawn from other poor areas of the city. More than 90 percent of its pupils are from families with incomes low enough to qualify their children for free or reduced cost lunches.
Mayor James commended the school as part of a "holistic approach" to education that he said harkened back to a simpler time when schools stayed open late with the help of volunteer teachers and parents. But regulations and labor contracts made it impossible for teachers to work those hours without pay. "The programs disappeared, more kids were on the street getting in trouble and dropping out," he said.
Don Marinaro, an assistant superintendent of Newark schools who represented the state-appointed city superintendent, Dr. Beverly Hall, grudgingly acknowledged in an interview that there had been tension between the school system and City Hall, but added, "Feelings are one thing and results are another."
The Camden School project could be a model for future collaborations with the city, including other community schools, he said.
Among the planned after-school programs for children will be homework assistance, karate, double dutch rope jumping, computer classes, sports and a program that promotes learning through the planning and completion of business ideas.
Among the services available for parents are family counseling from a social worker, computer literacy programs and health screening programs to help parents better care for themselves and their children.

HEADLINE: Missing New Jersey Girl Is Found Slain; a Boarder Is Charged

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY, N.J., Nov. 3

 BODY:
The body of a 10-year-old Piscataway girl who had been missing since Saturday night was found today and a man who had been living in her family's house was charged with murder, the authorities said.
The body of the girl, Lauren Rel yea, was discovered about 9 P.M. in a van behind a strip mall, said Robert Gluck, the Middlesex County Prosecutor. 
 Mr. Gluck said the police arrested Yusaf Hagans, 24, a boarder at the Relyea home, and charged him with murder.
The girl was last seen on Saturday playing in the front yard of her house on Charlton Avenue, Middlesex County officials said. The girl's mother told the police that she thought Lauren had gone to spend the night at a friend's house. But when the fifth-grader didn't return the next day, her mother's boyfriend called the police.
Police officers, firefighters and emergency service workers had been searching for the girl today in a wooded area near her home.
The authorities said they did not know if the girl had been sexually assaulted. An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday, Mr. Gluck said.
The girl was identified through photographs, he said.
Police officials say Mr. Hagans took the girl for a walk and then killed her using a blunt object. The suspect put the girl's body in a van, then tried to dispose of her clothes, Mr. Gluck said. Police officers found shoes and other pieces of her clothing near the mall.
Mr. Hagans had been a boarder at the Relyea house for about three months, Mr. Gluck said. He was a friend of the girl's brother and knew that the family took in boarders. Mr. Hagans lived in the house with the girl's mother, the mother's boyfriend and four other children, he said.
Mr. Hagans, an unemployed Plainfield native, is expected to be arraigned on Wednesday, Mr. Gluck said.
The investigation is continuing.

It will not run commercials, but New Jersey Network, the state's public television system, is exploring ways to raise revenues in the face of cuts in state financing, network officials said yesterday. 
 In 1989, the network received $9 million of its $12.7 million budget from the state. The state now provides $3 million, even as inflation makes the network more costly to operate, said Ronni Weyl, a spokeswoman for the network. In addition to seeking help from corporations and foundations, the network recently began renting space at its Trenton studio and offering a media consulting service. The station is down to 150 staff members, from a high of 230 in 1989.

HEADLINE: Clinton Wins Support on His Trade Authority

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3

 BODY:
After weeks of lobbying, President Clinton today virtually secured Senate renewal of the trade negotiating authority that he has called a centerpiece of his economic policy.
Mr. Clinton won over the support of Thomas A. Daschle, the Senate minority leader, on the so-called fast-track trade legislation. 
 Mr. Daschle announced his backing today, the day before a key Senate vote. The Administration now hopes to use his conversion to help rally Democratic support in the House, where the President still faces an uphill fight.
Mr. Daschle made his statement surrounded by Cabinet officials. They said Mr. Clinton would take a range of actions aimed at winning over legislators from agricultural states and Democrats worried about losing out to developing countries with lower wages and less stringent environmental laws.
The announcement was part of a major lobbying drive as the President fights for the legislation, which he has called crucial to taking the lead in the global economy.
Every President since Gerald R. Ford has made good use of fast-track powers -- which give Congress the right to approve or disapprove trade agreements but not modify them. The authority has helped bolster the Presidential negotiating position with foreign governments on trade deals. Administration officials have said they view this battle to renew the power as one of the most significant legislative confrontations of President Clinton's second term.
"We are now at a crossroads with respect to the strategy of opening markets around the globe," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said today.
With Mr. Daschle's help, the Administration is counting on winning the 60 votes necessary in the Senate to defeat Democrats who are trying to block the trade measure from coming to a vote either on Tuesday or later in the week. Mr. Clinton met tonight with two separate groups of Democratic Senators to try to shore up their votes for the trade legislation.
The White House hopes to use Mr. Daschle's support to offset the opposition of two House Democratic leaders, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan. The measure is to come to a vote in the House on Friday.
Mr. Clinton let the power expire in his first term rather than seek a vote that would divide Democrats as he headed into a Presidential election.
Organized labor, a heavy contributor to Congressional Democrats, opposes the President. It argues that the Administration is unwilling to use its ultimate weapon -- the threat of trade sanctions -- to safeguard American jobs against foreign nations, which produce cheaper goods because they do not abide by labor and environmental regulations.
The White House and opponents of the trade legislation are both focusing their efforts on a small group of Democratic Senators and a larger group of Representatives who are undecided or who may be persuaded to switch sides.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. plans to run commercials on CNN this week opposing the legislation, which the union president, John J. Sweeney, said today could "lead to a race to the bottom" in worker protections.
America Leads on Trade, a business coalition, announced today that it would run newspaper advertisements on Tuesday in 43 cities identifying 67 members of Congress who are undecided or against granting the authority.
The White House has adopted a two-pronged strategy to win votes. Administration officials worked on a set of policy proposals aimed at winning over critics. And the President and Vice President courted members of Congress individually.
"We're doing wholesale and retail and direct marketing over the next week," a senior White House aide said. "We'd be on QVC if we could find a way," the aide added, referring to a cable shopping channel. "We know we've got an uphill fight here."
The measures announced today were focused on winning support from Mr. Daschle and four to six other Senators, Administration officials said.
While Mr. Daschle said of the Senate vote, "This is not a done deal," opponents and supporters of the measure said that Mr. Daschle's conversion now virtually assured victory in the Senate.
But opponents like Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Carolina, have said they will use all of the Senate's arcane parliamentary procedures to stretch out the process as long as possible.
While the Republicans will be providing Mr. Clinton with the bulk of his support in the House, the Speaker, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, has said he has about 150 supporters, meaning that the President will have to carry about 70 Democrats in the House vote Friday.
But the Administration is thought to have only about 40 Democratic House votes, and Mr. Gingrich would have trouble producing any more Republicans. Some conservatives are demanding that he win concessions from the White House.
To appease Mr. Daschle and win over others, the Administration said today that it would provide Congress with a review of labor and environmental practices and laws of trading partners when it submitted future trade agreements negotiated under fast-track authority. It also pledged that the Labor Department would make a similar review of the practices of the partners in the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement.
In addition, the Administration said it would try to push international organizations to emphasize worker rights in developing nations, paying particular attention to child labor. Officials said environmental groups might be allowed to take part in dispute settlements at the World Trade Organization.
In a separate letter to Mr. Daschle aimed at farm-state lawmakers, the Clinton Administration agreed to collect data on livestock imports from Canada and take steps to promote American products. One plan was to develop guidelines for the voluntary labeling of meat products from the United States.
Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, dismissed Mr. Clinton's latest promises, saying, "This is just one of the deals the administration will be touting this week to try and win votes. What they should do is pull their fast track proposal and go back to the drawing boards."
Later this week, the President plans to announce a separate package worth more than $500 million over five years to help displaced workers and communities hurt by global trade. But opponents dismissed that plan, too, as merely repackaging of programs that did little to lessen the effects of the North America Free Tree Agreement.

Garment-Maker Promotion

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
The thousands of small- and medium-sized clothing manufacturers in New York City are the focus of a new $1 million marketing program intended to promote the local fashion business, the program's sponsors are expected to announce today.
The financing will come from the United States Department of Commerce, the Fashion Center Business Improvement District -- a nonprofit organization that promotes the garment center in the West 30's -- and the Garment Center Industry Development Corporation, a nonprofit economic development agency. 
 The new program, New York Fashion International, will promote New York-based clothing manufacturers through an international advertising and direct-mail campaign aimed at Europe, Asia and South America. It will also encourage international clothing buyers to take advantage of the support services offered by the Fashion Center Business Improvement District.
In addition, the program will expand the presence of made-in-New-York clothing at fashion fairs in Europe by recruiting New York clothing makers to attend.
"The stuff that comes out of New York has a tremendous cachet overseas, more so than it does domestically," said Barbara Blair Randall, executive director of the Fashion Center Business Improvement District. "But a lot of the New York-based manufacturers don't export. It's kind of a new world for them."
Clothing is the city's largest manufacturing sector, employing 100,000 people and producing almost $20 billion a year in goods, the improvement district said. LISA W. FODERARO

HEADLINE: Workers Detail Slips In Energy Dept.'s Data

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Hazel R. O'Leary stood proudly in front a chart depicting the Department of Energy's success in awarding contracts to minority-owned companies.
Ms. O'Leary, then the Secretary of Energy, had reason to look ebullient as she appeared at a conference on minority business development in the spring of 1996. According to the chart, her department had increased the number of dollars invested in minority businesses by 59 percent during her tenure. 
 But there was one problem: the chart was misleading.
The huge jump in contracts for minority businesses, according to current and former Energy Department employees as well as internal agency documents, was achieved by comparing different sets of numbers: the number of all minority prime contracts, as well as subcontracts, in the 1995 fiscal year was compared with only the number of minority prime contracts in previous years. If Ms. O'Leary's chart had looked at comparable data, the increase would have been 42 percent.
The erroneous chart is one example of what the employees say was a pattern by the Energy Department under Ms. O'Leary of routinely manipulating statistics to inflate her record on contracting with small businesses and businesses owned by women or members of minorities. Current and former department employees say the deception, spearheaded by officials who are still on the job, was motivated by a desire to burnish the department's image, even if it meant providing inaccurate figures to the White House, Congress and the public. Ms. O'Leary, the first black to head the department, had made it a priority to increase the number of minority- and female-owned companies in the energy field.
The misleading statistics "gave the impression to the general public and small businesses in particular that we're balls of fire," said Roy Chavez, a procurement analyst at the department. "But it's deceptive."
Charges of misuse of figures are being investigated by the department's inspector general. A draft of the inspector general's final report was provided to The New York Times by people who oppose the Administration's plan to use a method of counting called statistical sampling in the 2000 census. These critics say that the manipulation of figures at the Energy Department means that the Administration cannot be trusted to take an accurate sampling for the decennial population count.
A review of the draft report and interviews with current and former employees disclose a pattern of inaccuracies that included:
*Using figures that reflected department goals rather than actual achievements.
*Including contracts for all small businesses -- including those owned by white men, for example -- when computing the dollar value of contracts awarded to companies owned by women and members of minorities.
*Reducing the total dollar amount of Energy Department contracts to make the part awarded to small businesses seem larger.
Paul L. Terban, the former deputy director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization at the department, said he and Mr. Chavez had often pointed out inaccuracies, only to be ignored.
"Their stock line every time I said that's wrong was, 'Don't you want us to look good?' " Mr. Terban said.
A spokeswoman for Ms. O'Leary, who left her job to return to the private sector after President Clinton's first term, said she would have no comment on the accusations. But the spokeswoman, who would not allow her name to be used, said: "We take these allegations seriously. The Department of Energy is committed to accuracy in accounting and statistical representation and fair treatment of its employees. The inspector general has been investigating this, and we want to let him complete his investigation and issue a final report in order to assess appropriate steps."
Corlis Moody, director of the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity at the department, who was -- and still is -- responsible for statistics on small businesses and businesses owned by women and members of minorities -- did not respond to requests for an interview or to written questions submitted to her.
Mr. Terban said he had first begun to suspect that department officials were misusing numbers three years ago, when reporters called him to ask about a department press release that said it had "awarded more than one-half billion dollars in contract awards to minority- and women-owned businesses during fiscal year 1994."
When Mr. Terban checked on that, he found that in calculating the figure of $500 million, department officials had double-counted companies owned by women who were also members of minorities.
 In a statement of its goals for the 1995 fiscal year, the department said it wanted to increase its small-business contracts to "more than 34 percent" of all contracts; it put that number at 25 percent for the 1994 fiscal year. But internal department documents indicate that the 25 percent figure was the department's goal for the 1994 fiscal year, not what it actually accomplished. In reality, only 18 percent of the department's contracts went to small business in that fiscal year.
Even the department's goals for the 1995 fiscal year rested on shaky statistics. In calculating the relative value of total contracts it would give to small businesses, department officials excluded salaries and expenses paid to large prime contractors.
 Without the $7.7 billion paid to these prime contractors, the $3 billion in contracts to small businesses added up to more than 34 percent of the total, as outlined in the 1995 performance statement. But with prime contractors counted, the part of small business contracts dropped to 18.4 percent, only slightly more than in fiscal 1994.
Moreover, the performance statement for the 1995 fiscal year was submitted unchanged to President Clinton and signed, even after department officials received a letter from the Small Business Administration informing them that their figures had been calculated incorrectly and asking the officials to submit revised figures.
"What it means is that they essentially lied to the President," Mr. Terban said.
The draft report indicates that Ms. Moody said the failure to correct the figures before the President signed the document had been an "oversight" and that once the document had been endorsed, she had not known how to correct it. But department officials failed to use the next year's performance agreement to rectify the false impression.
The draft inspector general's report also says Ms. O'Leary may have used misleading charts and graphs in making public presentations on the department's performance in awarding contracts. While current and former employees say the misleading charts were probably used, the inspector general's office could not say so with any certainty.
A chart prepared for presentation at a Congressional Black Caucus conference in July 1995, suggested that the department had awarded $3 billion to companies owned by women and members of minorities in the last year of the Bush Administration but that it had "delivered" about $4.5 billion to such companies during the 1994 fiscal year, in the Clinton Administration.
But the figures for the Bush Administration represent the agency's contracts with all small businesses -- not just those owned by women and members of minorities -- in the 1992 fiscal year. In contrast, the Clinton figures are the Energy Department's goals for small business in the 1994 fiscal year.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 5, 1997, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about allegations that the Energy Department manipulated figures on minority contracting referred incorrectly to a spokeswoman who responded. She was Brooke Anderson, director of the Office of Public Affairs at the department -- not the spokeswoman for Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary quoted elsewhere in the article.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "AT ISSUE: A Chart on the Wrong Course"
Charts prepared by the Department of Energy on minority contracts were often misleading. Here is a chart prepared for a July 12, 1995, meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus.
 
INCORRECT
This should read
SMALL BUSINESSES

Soup That's Like a Model T: Have Any Size You Want
 Add David Bouley to the growing list of soup purveyors. But Mr. Bouley is going his own way in offering soup to go in the retail area at Bouley Bakery, 120 West Broadway (Duane Street). 
 Unlike the rest of the soup chefs around town, he gives just two choices each day and one size (12 ounces). Soups are dispensed from a homey Creuset pot instead of a steam-table kettle, and the only accompaniment is a roll baked on the premises. Most soups, like the thick, earthy organic golden wild rice soup with morsels of duck confit, are $4.95; vegetarian selections are $4.25.
 
Three Pies (One Bites Back)
 Rethinking a classic has led Maury Rubin, above, the owner of City Bakery, 20 East 17th Street, to make a trio of pumpkin pies.
First there is his conventional take on the autumn dessert, which he makes with fresh pumpkin from the Union Square Greenmarket bolstered with some of the canned variety. It is very gently seasoned. Another pie is enriched with almond praline paste, giving it a sweetly caramel flavor and smoother texture. The eye-opening Asian variation tastes assertively of fresh ginger with a touch of coconut and other spices. Nine-inch pies are $18; individual 4-inch ones are $4.
 
A Ratte by Any Other Name
 Several years ago James Huston, the man who brought the Yukon Gold potato to the American table, successfully started cultivating the prized French ratte potato in Oregon, using the same methods and plant stock as Jean-Pierre Clot, who grows the ratte in Burgundy. The potato is the favorite of the chef Joel Robuchon. Mr. Huston gave it a prettier name, La Reine. But when he discovered that a line of citrus fruits already carried the trademark name La Reina, he changed the name to Princesse, which is how it is now being sold.
 
Where Ground Beef Is King
 Does it come as a surprise that the United States can claim the title of ground-beef capital of the world? In a study of 1,000 people age 13 to 65 in each of 35 countries in April by Roper Starch Worldwide, a market research company in New York, 34 percent of Americans said they had eaten ground beef in the previous 24 hours. Argentina came in second, at 22 percent.
The overall average is 15 percent, but in developing countries, the only residents questioned were residents of urban areas, where Roper analysts speculated that consumption of ground beef is higher than in the countryside. The margin of sampling error in the study, which was done in face-to-face interviews, was less than 1 percentage point over all, although the poll takers said it represented only about a quarter of the world's population. The study was financed by Roper, along with Coca-Cola, the Discovery Channel and Philip Morris.
Consumption of canned and frozen vegetables was also highest in the United States, 25 percent. Russia was second with 21 percent. But Americans ate less pizza (16 percent) than did Italians (18 percent) or Argentines (20 percent). Consumption of beef other than ground beef was highest in Argentina. Americans ate less fish, fresh vegetables, pork, eggs and rice than the overall average. As for pasta, they were about average, 26 percent, but far behind Italy, where 71 percent of respondents said they had eaten pasta in the previous day.
 
Oil Worth a Bumper Sticker
 When people in the organic-farm movement say "think globally, buy locally," they probably do not have Villa Pillo extra-virgin olive oil in mind. This lovely herbaceous oil, with a nice piney scent and the merest hint of a peppery bite, comes from an estate in Tuscany owned by John and Kathe Dyson, who own Millbrook Vineyards much closer to home, in Millbrook, N.Y. Mr. Dyson's bumper sticker may proclaim "I Love New York," the slogan he invented, but it is clear that he also loves Tuscany. The oil, in a 17 1/2-ounce flask, is $20 at Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (71st Street), and $16.99 at the winery in Millbrook.
Barneys New York has also introduced an extra-virgin olive oil, from the Macie estate in the Chianti region of Tuscany, and sells it under the Fred's at Barneys New York label. This oil is richer and more viscous than the Villa Pillo oil, with a warm, nutty flavor that would make it excellent to drizzle into a vegetable soup or gloss onto a slice of pecorino cheese. The oil is $21.
 
As if Sweets Weren't Serenity Enough
 
DELICACY is the abiding theme at Minamoto Kitchoan, a new Japanese shop selling wagashi -- high-quality sweets usually accompanied by tea -- on West 49th Street at Fifth Avenue. It is the first New York branch of a company that has more than 200 shops in Japan. The setting is serene, and the sweets are artistically arrayed in sweeping glass cases.
The uninitiated probably should select individual pieces, often made with bean pastes or seaweed-based jellies, rather than the beautifully packaged assortments, which can cost $95. The kimono-clad clerks offer helpful explanations about confections like oribenishiki ($2.20), a feathery rice cake with a mousselike filling, or kurihouka ($2.50), a mouthful of chunkier bean paste enclosing a candied chestnut. An oval box with four ounces of golden, sugary candied chestnuts, kuriamanattou, is $16.
Though not intended as a clever imposter, koshi-an, a bean paste, does make the smooth, mellow filling of the tender tsuya spongecake buns ($2 each) look like chocolate. But nothing in the shop is made of chocolate.
Minamoto Kitchoan will ship its confections throughout the United States ($13 for the first pound; $1 for each additional pound). Information: (212) 489-3747.

HEADLINE: First, Don't Compete

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The New York State Medical Society's opposition to independent nurse practitioners is shameful (Week in Review, Nov. 2). This opposition violates Hippocrates' admonition to "first, do no harm." Because most independent nurse practitioners provide lower-cost basic medical services than do doctors, legal prohibitions on the spread of these practitioners raise the price of medical care. Higher prices cause some people who would otherwise seek treatment for ailments to refrain from doing so. 
 Apparently the New York State Medical Society reinterprets Hippocrates' admonition to mean, "first, do no harm to physicians' incomes."

HEADLINE: South Bronx Suburbia

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Nov. 2 news article points out that the selling prices of single-family houses in Charlotte Gardens in the South Bronx have risen from $49,500 in 1985 to $185,000 in 1997. Yet you do not recognize that the 1985 selling price was far lower than the actual cost to build each house. 
 Construction alone was $81,000 per unit, excluding land and site preparation. Factored together with continuing subsidies, including losses to the city related to the lowest possible use of land that once housed thousands of families, it is hardly fair to characterize Charlotte Gardens as an economic success -- except for the 89 original families who are understandably pleased with their potential windfalls.
The long-term economic consequences of imposing suburban houses on high-density urban areas is problematic, to say the least.
The extreme de-urbanization of Charlotte Gardens was not repeated elsewhere in the city, for good reasons.

HEADLINE: Linking Sudan to Rights Abuses and Terror, U.S. Adds Penalties

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
President Clinton, seeking to pre-empt Congressional action, imposed sweeping new sanctions on the Sudan today, for alleged sponsorship of terrorism and human rights abuses.
The new penalties went far beyond previous prohibitions by blocking access to all Sudanese assets in the United States and barring a wide range of financial transactions, officials said. 
 The United States has only $70 million in annual trade with the Sudan, including $50 million in American exports, American officials said. Therefore, the move "is more a statement of principle than anything else," an official said.
"The United States has imposed sweeping new economic sanctions against the Government of Sudan because of its continued sponsorship of international terrorism, its effort to destabilize neighboring countries and its abysmal record on human rights," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said in making the announcement.
"We take these steps because the Government of Sudan has failed to respond to repeated expressions of concern or to the imposition of lesser sanctions."
The action provides exceptions for some activity considered essential to American interests, like imports of gum arabic, a key ingredient in candy and some other products, like ink. It is not expected that there will be any exception for American oil investment in the Sudan, a senior American official said.
The United States contends that Sudanese officials aided those responsible for an 1995 assassination attempt against President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. It has also accused the Sudan of providing a refuge and training for Islamic guerrillas.
Experts and some published reports have raised suspicions about whether the Sudan is trying to acquire a chemical weapons industry, but the United States has refused to comment on that question.
The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said he hoped that the President's move would make it unnecessary for Congress to legislate sanctions, which could tie the Administration's hands even more.
"We tend to not, as a matter of practice, support sanctions put in place by Capitol Hill because of the fact that they normally lack flexibility," he said.
The sanctions took effect today after Mr. Clinton signed an executive order under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act blocking Sudanese assets in the United States, believed to total millions of dollars, and banning bank loans and American exports to the Sudan. Imports from Sudan were also barred.
Ms. Albright said sanctions aimed to deprive the Sudanese Government "of the financial and material benefits of U.S. trade and investment, including" oil. But "to insure flexibility, the Administration will consider issuing licenses on a case-by-case basis for activities that are in the U.S. interest," she added.
Mr. Rubin said that for certain specific commodities, like gum Arabic, the Administration would consider issuing licenses for "some limited activities important to us," he said. A coalition of American businesses has lobbied hard against sanctions that would hit the trade in gum arabic.
A senior American official said the Administration would strictly review the requests for exemptions. American companies have 30 days to divest themselves of investments in the Sudan or apply for a special license, officials said.
The Sudan is one of seven nations that Washington accuses of sponsoring worldwide terrorism and having poor human rights records.

HEADLINE: Auto Makers Report Weak October Sales

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 4

 BODY:
The Big Three American auto makers reported weak sales in October, giving the industry a slow start in the first month of the new model year.
The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 4 percent last month compared with the corresponding period a year earlier, mostly because of weak sales of vans, small sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales dropped 2.1 percent last month, as a sharp drop in mini-van sales outweighed rising sales of large sport utility vehicles like the Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator. The Chrysler Corporation announced on Monday that its sales fell 8.3 percent in October. 
 Though a number of Japanese and European auto makers reported strong results for October, Detroit's weakness pulled down sales for the industry as a whole by 1.6 percent from a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales reached just 14.7 million, compared with 15 million in September and 15.5 million in both August and July. "The industry over all is perhaps softening up a little bit," said Donald R. DeVeaux, G.M.'s director of North American market analysis.
Robert L. Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing, sales and service, said, "The U.S. economy has been remarkably stable during the current expansion and gives every indication that it will remain so in 1998."
Wall Street analysts were less optimistic. "There is a mild slowdown taking place and it could be a harbinger of a weak fourth quarter," said David Bradley, an auto analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities Inc.
John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Schroder Wertheim & Company, said the weak sales suggested that auto makers would soon pile on more rebates and discounted lease deals to spur sales. The October results "add more evidence to the view that the best is behind us" after four years of healthy auto sales, he said.
Helped by their popular small sport utility vehicles and redesigned family cars like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Accord, Japanese auto makers reported stronger sales in October. The Toyota Motor Company said today that its sales rose 2.9 percent last month, while the Honda Motor Company said on Monday that is sales rose 11.2 percent. "The Japanese have the best of all worlds," said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst at Salomon Brothers. "They are bringing out new products in both the car and truck sectors that seem to be in sync with what American customers want -- the Big Three are in more of a defensive mode."
Other auto makers today posted mixed sales results for October. The Mazda Motor Company said its sales rose 5.7 percent; Mercedes, the unit of Daimler-Benz A.G., said sales jumped 81.8 percent; the Hyundai Motor Company said sales rose 9.9 percent, and Porsche A.G. said sales jumped 69.6 percent.
But Volkswagen A.G. sales fell five-tenths of 1 percent and the company's luxury unit Audi saw its sales fall 10 percent; sales at the Suzuki Motor Corporation plunged 29.4 percent; sales at BMW A.G. fell 3.2 percent, and sales at Jaguar, the Ford unit, dropped 6 percent.
General Motors saw its car sales slip one-tenth of 1 percent compared with weak car sales in the period last year, while its sales of pickup trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles fell 8.5 percent, which Ronald L. Zarrella, vice president of sales, service and marketing, called disappointing.
G.M.'s midsized cars mostly sold briskly, particularly newer models like the Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac Grand Prix. However, customers seemed bored by the company's small cars. Sales of the Chevrolet Metro -- formerly the Geo Metro -- plunged 49 percent, while sales for the Saturn division dropped 17.1 percent. Sales of its medium-sized sport utility vehicles were weak.
Ford's car sales dropped 2 percent, while the maker's truck sales fell 2.2 percent. The auto maker's stars were the giant sport utility vehicles -- the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. The end of October marked the first full year of Expedition sales, which reached 222,300. But mini-van sales in October were weak -- sales of the Ford Windstar dropped 24.8 percent, while sales of the Mercury Villager dropped 32.3 percent. Sales of Ford's family sedans, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, rose 15.1 percent and 30.3 percent, respectively, mostly because corporate fleets and rental car agencies waited for the new model year to buy more cars.

HEADLINE: Economic Data Point to Future Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
An index intended to forecast the economy rose again in September, pointing to further growth in the months ahead as the expansion heads toward its seventh year.
The Conference Board, a business research group, said today that its index of leading indicators rose two-tenths of 1 percent, the fifth consecutive increase, and matching analysts' estimates as well as matching the average for the four previous months. 
 Recent turmoil in the markets and economies of Asia and Latin America, however, has clouded the outlook, analysts said. They said there was a risk that lower American exports and other fallout from overseas could make an expected slowdown in the United States economy even slower.
"The safest bet is that it will be a moderate drag but not a pothole," said Robert G. Dederick, consultant to Chicago's Northern Trust Company. "But it's too soon to tell."
None of the 10 components of the predictive index yet reflected the Asian turmoil, Michael Boldin, the Conference Board's project director, said today.
Economists at Chase Manhattan were also reassessing prospects for the domestic economy next year, concluding in a special report that "expansion will slow to a below-trend pace of 1 percent to 1.5 percent," or as much as a percentage point less than it had expected before the Asian crisis.
The company also said that inflation risks would recede and that the Federal Reserve might preside over a substantial decline, perhaps a percentage point, in short-term interest rates.
"A lot of the signs point to slower growth," James Glassman, a Chase economist, said in an interview, citing among other things the likelihood of lower exports and less vigorous business investment as well as the existing shortage of qualified workers and the shrunken savings rate.
Six of the components of the leading indicators advanced at the latest tabulation, the main positive contributors being lower first-time claims for unemployment benefits and an expansion of the M-2 money supply. This monetary gauge includes savings accounts and money market mutual funds as well as currency and checking accounts.
Lesser upward impetus came from increases in permits for building, higher stock prices as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a rise in the value of new factory orders for capital goods and a negligible rise in the University of Michigan's survey of consumer expectations.
The three forces of restraint, none very strong, were lower factory orders for consumer goods; a narrowing of the interest rate spread between overnight money and 10-year Treasury bonds, and somewhat speedier deliveries of goods by corporate suppliers.
The final component, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged for the month.
During the six months through September, the Conference Board also calculated, the predictive index advanced nine-tenths of 1 percent, with seven of the components higher.
Two companion indexes, one intended to move at the same time as the economy at large and the other only with a delay, rose three-tenths of 1 percent and one-tenth of 1 percent, respectively.
The coincident index for August was revised to show a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent, one-tenth of a point less than initially reported. The lagging index maintained its August gain of three-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Auto Giants Build a Glut of Asian Plants, Just as Demand Falls

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Shoppers have deserted car dealerships across Southeast Asia since the region's currency crisis began last summer, while investors who have lost fortunes in plummeting stock markets have flooded the used-car market with late-model luxury cars.
The world's auto giants do not seem to care. Even though some industry experts insist they should pull back, General Motors and Ford Motor are busy building huge new assembly plants in Thailand and preparing to open up to five more factories in Southeast Asia and China. And Toyota and Honda are dealing with the crisis with temporary production cutbacks rather than changing their basic strategic plans. 
 Although the tiger economies of Southeast Asia have turned to alley cats this fall, the American and Japanese auto makers that have rushed to build factories say they are mostly undaunted. While auto executives weigh whether to retrench, none have yet closed a factory or canceled expansion plans. Just as amateur investors mainly stood pat as world markets gyrated last week, auto makers insist they are in the Southeast Asian markets for the long haul, and some even see silver linings in the economic storm clouds.
"When the currencies settle down, as they will, I think they may have a greater competitive advantage," said Alexander J. Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford. The United States is even sending cars, not soldiers, to Vietnam. Ford's new factory there opens on Thursday.
But some Wall Street analysts worry about this Panglossian view. "This industry is suicidal," said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz, a New York investment banking and brokerage firm.
She is concerned because the auto industry already has more worldwide capacity than it needs and more factories continue to be built. G.M.'s factory in Rayong, Thailand, is scheduled to open in early 1999 and now has steel girders in place but no roof. "They should just stop it," Ms. Keller said. "This isn't going to be a 12-month problem in Thailand."
Indeed, John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview published on Monday in Automotive News that the company was weighing whether to alter its plans for the Thai factory, perhaps by building less expensive cars.
Mr. Trotman, like other auto executives, reasons that the region's falling currencies will make wages, investments and locally bought parts less expensive in dollar terms. But at the same time, demand for new vehicles has plunged from Thailand to South Korea to Indonesia, while the remaining sales yield fewer dollars and yen in profits for auto makers because the local currencies have weakened.
Japanese auto makers also remain optimistic. "We are not changing our strategies in response to a short-term economic recession," said Takanori Sonoda, head of Honda's Detroit office.
The traditional response to a glut of locally produced cars -- to increase exports -- may not work in Southeast Asia. Neither Honda nor Toyota plans to start selling cars built in Southeast Asia in the United States, mainly because the smaller, stripped-down cars built there are more suited to developing markets. Any increased auto exports from Southeast Asian countries would most likely be sold in other emerging markets, if demand remains strong enough.
G.M., which aims to double its share of the Asia-Pacific market to 10 percent by 2005, is convinced that Southeast Asia is still worth betting on. "You have to roll the dice," said J. T. Battenberg 3d, president of G.M.'s auto parts division, which since 1992 has opened 23 factories in the region -- 15 in China, 4 in South Korea and 3 in Malaysia and 1 in Indonesia. "A country that may seem to be not a good investment today -- maybe North Korea or Vietnam -- tomorrow may be."
Not only is G.M. completing work on its factory in Thailand and preparing to build Buick Regals in Shanghai, it is negotiating for permission to add mini-van production in Shanghai and to open at least two more assembly plants in China.
One would be a joint venture in Shenyang in northeastern China with a local partner, First Auto Works, to develop a truck-based vehicle. G.M. is also lobbying the Chinese to choose it, not Honda, to build a small "people's car" in Guangzhou, said a G.M. spokesman, Michael Meyerand.
Ford is also seeking 10 percent of the Asian market within 10 years, and it already has factories in Malaysia and Taiwan. After its new Vietnam factory opens on Thursday, its van factory in China opens in December and next summer it is scheduled to turn out its first pickup trucks in Thailand. It may also add a factory in the Philippines.
Conspicuously absent from large-scale production is the Chrysler Corporation, which has four, mostly smaller factories in East Asia. Last year, Chrysler dropped plans to open a factory in Vietnam when the Government allowed a dozen other auto makers to build assembly plants, despite the country's small market for cars.
Long before the region's current problems, Chrysler decided to expand in South America instead of East Asia because South American governments imposed fewer trade restrictions and were not using heavy government assistance to local companies, as Indonesia and Malaysia have done.
In the short term, Wall Street analysts said that while the end of Southeast Asia's remarkable economic climb was bad news for the Big Three, the impact on profits would be minimal. "The earnings out of Asia might be 2 or 3 percent of total earnings," said David Bradley, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. And the stocks of the Big Three have not been hit any harder than the overall market in the last week or so.
The other danger is that the turmoil in Southeast Asia will spread to other developing markets, particularly in South America, pushing countries like Brazil and Argentina into a recession. The Big Three have bigger operations there, and thus have much more to lose.
But in Southeast Asia, Japanese auto makers are likely to take the hardest hits because they have more factories. Honda has cut production in half at its large factory in Thailand, and Toyota has gone from two shifts working seven days a week to one shift working three days at both its Thai factories and reportedly is considering shutting the factories for the rest of the year. The direct effect of the Asia crisis could trim the Japanese auto industry's operating profits by up to 5 percent, estimated Stephen Volkmann, a Tokyo-based analyst with Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter. Auto sales in Thailand plummeted 77 percent in September.
Auto makers might be forced to invest more in a poorly performing region because the factories that produce their cars tend to be joint ventures. Their smaller, local business partners may run into financial trouble and turn to deeper foreign pockets to keep factories open.
While auto makers remain optimistic, not everyone agrees they should be. Thailand is headed for a recession, and elsewhere in the region, growth is slowing, said Nariman Behravesh, chief international economist at Standard & Poor's DRI.
"You get caught up in the euphoria and your risk tolerance goes up," Mr. Behravesh said. "There is going to have to be some shake-out in the auto industry in Asia sometime in the next three to five years."

HEADLINE: AT&T Will Simplify Its Pricing Structure

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
The AT&T Corporation, the leading long-distance telephone company, said yesterday that it would sharply simplify its pricing, making it easier for millions of residential users to figure out the price of a long-distance call.
As of Saturday, AT&T said, it would reduce to three from 33 the number of different rates paid by residential customers who do not subscribe to a special calling plan. In doing so, the company leapfrogged its major rivals as they also seek to attract customers with straightforward pricing. 
 The change was the first significant move for AT&T since C. Michael Armstrong, former head of the General Motors Corporation's Hughes Electronics unit, became chairman at the start of the month.
Analysts said that changing AT&T's pricing structure could hardly begin to solve all of the company's problems, but they added that many initiatives are expected during Mr. Armstrong's tenure.
"These are some of the earlier and easier changes the company will make," said Linda B. Meltzer, an analyst for UBS Securities. "It really matches what the industry is seeing in terms of simplicity."
After the pricing changes take effect, distance will no longer factor into what AT&T's 80 million residential customers pay for a basic interstate telephone call.
AT&T, which now charges customers based on a complex formula involving three time periods and 11 "mileage bands," will move instead to a flat rate for each of the three time periods -- days, nights and weekends -- no matter how far the call travels within the United States.
Some consumer advocates said that AT&T was actually reneging on a previous promise to reduce rates. Under the new plan, the periods from 7 A.M. to 8 A.M. and from 5 P.M. to 6:59 P.M. become parts of the highest-price time period, rather than parts of lower-priced "night" and "evening" periods.
"I think this is a major scam," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group. "Now the rates are going to go up for a lot of people, and I think the F.C.C. should investigate."
The change will not affect business customers, whose basic rates already do not fluctuate with distance, or AT&T's residential customers who subscribe to an optional calling plan like One Rate, which offers a flat price around the clock. Analysts estimate that about half of AT&T's clients belong to such plans.
"The most powerful motivator we've seen in consumer markets, not just in telecommunications but really across consumer markets, has been the benefits a company reaps if they simplify things for their customers," said Jack McMaster, a vice president in AT&T's consumer long-distance division. "We took a look at the price schedule, and it was essentially more confusing than it needed to be."
But minor confusion persists in AT&T's executive suites. Mr. Armstrong's arrival apparently has not stemmed the tide of senior executives who have chosen to quit the company in favor of smaller operations.
Ron J. Ponder, AT&T's chief information officer, said yesterday that he plans to leave to become president and chief executive of Beechwood Data Systems, a small private company based in Clark, N.J., which makes software for telecommunications systems.
It is the economics of fiber optic networks that has produced the flat-rate pricing now becoming familiar to long-distance customers. Once a pulse of light is traveling along a hair-thin strand of glass, it does not cost very much to keep the pulse going.
"They've finally made a rate structure that reflects reality," said Scott Wright, an analyst for Argus Research, a high-technology consulting firm in New York. "Technology has certainly helped accentuate a truth in telecom pricing, and that is that the incremental cost of going another mile when you're talking about long-distance calls is virtually nil."
From 7 A.M. to 6:59 P.M. during the workweek, AT&T will charge a flat interstate rate of 28 cents a minute. From 7 P.M. to 6:59 A.M., the company will charge 16 cents a minute. During the weekend, the rate will be 13 cents a minute.
Under AT&T's current basic fare schedule, domestic interstate rates range from 13 cents a minute for a night or weekend call to a nearby location to as much as 29 cents a minute for a transcontinental call during a workday.
In September the MCI Communications Corporation, the No. 2 long-distance carrier, changed its basic rate structure to two mileage bands from 11. MCI also charges different rates for each of three time periods, for a total of six possible prices from 5 to 29 cents a minute.
The Sprint Corporation, the third-largest long-distance company, maintains 13 mileage zones and three time periods in its basic price system, for a total of 39 rates, ranging from 13 to 35 cents a minute.
At least half of MCI and Sprint customers subscribe to special-rate programs.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stock Indicators Up as Hong Kong Falls

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING

 BODY:
Wall Street loosened its link to international equity markets yesterday, as stocks finished modestly higher despite another selloff in Hong Kong.
Following a 4.21 percent decline in Hong Kong's main market index, the Hang Seng, the Dow Jones industrial average and other market barometers reversed early declines. Investors focused on reports that some American companies would not be as negatively affected as originally expected from Asia's downturn, analysts said. 
 "After a week of introspection, investors realized that the impact on our market should not have been as dramatic due to something that happened in Thailand or Latin America," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal Lyon & Ross. "We are the safe haven for the world's economies. In periods of uncertainty, we are the place to be."
After gaining more than 232 points Monday, the Dow closed at 7,689.13, up 14.74 points, leaving it just 26.28 points away from its close on Oct. 24, the Friday before its 554-point drop.
Other indexes saw smaller gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 1.77 points, to 940.76. And while technology stocks, which had been battered in the recent selloff, saw lots of buying interest yesterday, the Nasdaq composite index eked out just a 1.17-point gain, closing at 1,631.15.
While stocks continued to climb, Treasury prices were lower for the third consecutive session. Bond prices were weighed down by concerns over the market's ability to absorb new supply as the Treasury began its quarterly refunding with the sale of $14 billion of new three-year notes.
The 30-year bond dropped 16/36, to a price of 101 25/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.24 percent, from 6.21 percent on Monday.
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen but was lower against many European currencies. The dollar rose to 122.15 yen, from 121.32 yen on Monday, but fell to 1.7228 marks, from 1.7351 marks. The British pound rose to $1.6844 from $1.6773, its highest level since July.
In the stock market, some technology issues gained yesterday as investors searched for stocks that fell sharply in last week's market rout. Dell Computer, which fell 14 percent last week, gained 2 7/16, to close at 85 11/162.
In addition, the Philadelphia Oil Service sector index rose to a new high of 139.81, buoyed by expectations that oil prices could increase on unrest in the Middle East.
AMF Bowling closed at 21 3/4 during its first day of trading. The bowling center operator climbed 2 1/4 from its initial offering price of 19 1/2.
In the Treasury market, while there was good demand for the auction of three-year notes, today's $11 billion auction of new 10-year notes and tomorrow's $10 billion auction of new 30-year bonds are considered to be harder sells. In when-issued trading yesterday, the 10-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.96 percent, and the 30-year bond was being offered at a price to yield 6.21 percent. Following are the results of the three-year note auction:

HEADLINE: Clinton Wins Senate Test On Trade-Negotiating Bill

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
President Clinton won a round in his drive to renew expanded trade negotiating authority when the Senate voted today to shut off stalling tactics by dissident Democrats.
The Senate voted 69 to 31, nine more votes than necessary, to break a filibuster and bring the trade legislation to the floor. The margin showed that the Senate has the votes to approve the legislation later this week, and the President had been pressing for just such a decisive outcome in order to put pressure on the House of the Representatives, where he still faces an uphill struggle. 
 Democrats -- and even some Republicans -- said today that the strength of the vote in the Senate was likely to help Mr. Clinton's case in the House, where a vote on the issue is scheduled for Friday.
Appearing in the White House Rose Garden just minutes after the Senate vote, President Clinton, flanked by his entire economic team, praised what he called the "bipartisan coalition" in the Senate. "The world economy is clearly on a fast track," he said. "If we don't seize these opportunities our competitors surely will. An 'America last' strategy is unacceptable."
The Senate Majority Leader, Trent Lott, said the support for the legislation had been stronger than expected.
Almost as soon as the Senate acted, Administration officials turned their attention to the House, where senior Democratic leaders have broken with Mr. Clinton and are leading the opposition. With 26 Senate Democrats joining the 43 Republicans to bring the trade legislation to the Senate floor, Rahm Emanuel, President Clinton's senior adviser, said the vote should demonstrate to House Democrats that "you can be pro-trade, a good Democrat and the sky won't fall in."
Just as in 1993 when he pushed the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress, Mr. Clinton has been forced to rely largely on Republican votes on an issue that fractures the traditional Democratic coalition.
Organized labor, a heavy contributor to Congressional Democrats, strongly opposes the measure, and the two House Democratic leaders, Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and David Bonior of Michigan, are leading the fight against the President.
This afternoon, the two legislators, along with Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, unveiled a new objection to the bill. They argued that increased trade with Mexico was also leading to increased drug trafficking. "The bulk of drugs smuggled into the U.S. is produced in South America -- some of the same countries that are in line for trade expansion," Mr. Gephardt said. "We must be prepared for this prior to commencement of negotiations."
The administration scrambled to answer that argument.
Even with today's vote, the Senate still has to pass through numeorus procedural hurdles before it can bring the fast track legislation to a final vote later this week. Opponents plan to try to amend the legislation to add in new United States negotiating objectives such as restrictions on child labor.
Opening debate, Senator William V. Roth, Jr., a Delaware Republican, said that unless the President had the authority to negotiate a trade agreement that cannot be amended by Congress, the United States would lose its leverage. "Without the ability to take a seat at the negotiating table, we will be giving up the ability to shape our economic destiny," Mr. Roth said.
Opponents of the measure argued that the Clinton Administration's trade policy was resulting in a growing trade deficit -- particularly since Nafta was passed in 1993. Saying that every year the merchandise trade deficit is getting "worse not better," Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota asked, "is this country moving in the right direction?"

HEADLINE: Union Misgivings on Nafta Are Clinton's Latest Worry

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Four years after the Clinton Administration said it would prod Mexico to improve workers' rights through agreements made along with the North American free trade pact, many Democrats and labor unions say results have been scant, complicating the White House's efforts to win new trade-negotiating authority.
Just as it did in campaigning for the free-trade zone with Canada and Mexico in 1993, the White House is promising Democrats that it will do all it can to improve the labor and environmental standards of the nation's trading partners, even if strong opposition from Republicans prevents making these improvements a condition of access to the American market. 
 Those promises, along with other efforts to woo Democrats, helped the Administration win a critical procedural victory today in the Senate on the so-called fast-track legislation. But the fate of the legislation remains unclear in the House, where organized labor is making an all-out push to stop it.
One key reason for the reluctance of many House Democrats to back the measure is that the Administration's assurances about pushing for labor and environmental reforms in other countries ring hollow to them, given the outcome of the White House's similar efforts in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The lesson of Nafta, they say, is that labor and environmental issues must be at the heart of trade agreements, not relegated to hard-to-enforce side agreements or other pacts like the "executive initiatives" the Administration is now pledging to implement.
"The Nafta experience indicates that we need to tackle labor market and environmental issues directly, not indirectly," said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said labor and environmental issues "need to be addressed in the core text of trade agreements, not as an 'executive-initiative' afterthought."
"If they are in the core text, commitments made can be enforced," said Mr. Gephardt, who is leading the opposition to the fast-track measure. When the President has fast-track authority, Congress may only agree to approve or disapprove trade agreements but not amend them.
In particular, the skeptics point to the Nafta side agreement on labor issues.
To some degree, the limitations seen by its critics were inherent in its structure. Formally known as the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation, it was not intended to judge or punish companies for their labor practices. It did not seek to create common labor standards among Mexico, Canada and the United States. It provides for the possibility of sanctions only in extreme cases where one of the three governments signing the agreement has shown a pervasive pattern of failing to enforce its own labor laws.
In the United States, the agreement is administered by an eight-person staff in the Labor Department with an annual budget of about $800,000. Mexico and Canada each have a similar office, and the three countries together pay for a small "secretariat" in Dallas.
In nearly three years, seven complaints about Mexican labor practices have been filed with the American office, plus one filed with the Mexican labor authorities about Sprint, an American company operating in the United States. In none of the cases has the outcome gone beyond private meetings at which American officials have expressed their concerns about Mexican labor practices to their counterparts in the Mexican Government.
Since the provisions are intended only to push the Governments involved to enforce their own existing domestic labor laws, no direct action has been taken against any of the employers involved.
American officials said it was unrealistic to believe that Mexico -- or the United States or Canada, for that matter -- would have agreed to an international process that would supersede domestic labor laws and give the United States the authority to impose sanctions on companies operating in Mexico.
Given the nature of the provisions, they said, the process has had more impact in Mexico than it is given credit for. And they said the provisions should be judged not by what labor groups hoped that they could accomplish -- bringing wholesale changes to Mexico's deeply rooted economic and political systems -- but by the more modest goal of serving as a prod to Mexico to take labor issues more seriously.
"It's contributed to an unprecedented level of scrutiny of Mexican labor law and allowed for a process of review and public discussion that has contributed in some important ways to debates already occurring within Mexican society on these same matters," said Andrew Samet, deputy undersecretary for international affairs at the Labor Department.
"It's obviously not intended to create a substitute mechanism for U.S., Canadian or Mexican labor law," he said. "It's also not designed inherently to provide any additional recourse to adjudicate individual rights."
But labor rights groups take a much dimmer view of the agreement. They point to cases like the one prompted by a bitter clash between management and employees at the Sony videocassette plant just over the Texas border in Mexico during 1994. To labor activists, the dispute was a perfect example of how the Mexican Government and big companies had long discouraged the creation of independent unions. The Labor Department investigated their complaint.
The Labor Department heard reports that Sony had terminated workers who tried to organize a new, more assertive union. It listened to stories about the police beating workers who protested against the company's tactics. Despite statements from Sony that it had obeyed the law and that the labor groups were distorting what had happened, the Labor Department ultimately found, in April 1995, that there were "serious questions" about the way the workers had been treated.
And then it recommended the strongest action available to it: closed-door talks between the American and Mexican labor Secretaries, which led to public workshops in both countries on union organizing and certification.
The dismissed workers were not reinstated. The organizing effort at the plant remains stalled.
Labor groups said the initiatives pledged by the Administration to deal with labor and environmental issues in any trade deals reached under fast-track authority would be similarly toothless. They said the Administration should have taken a tougher stand with the Republican majority in Congress and insisted on making sure labor and the environment were as central to trade agreements as issues like fighting piracy of computer software and movies.
"Unless these things are enforceable within the context of the trade agreement, they are paper tigers," said David A. Smith, the policy director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

HEADLINE: Colorado Storm's Toll in Cattle Staggers Beleaguered Industry

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: HOLLY, Colo., Nov. 3

 BODY:
On a treeless plain, midway between Wild Horse Creek and Deadman Ditch, a front-end loader appeared on the horizon today, laboring slowly as it dragged two dead cows and carried a third in the front scoop.
"That cow there in the front was my nephew's bucket calf; he raised it from a bucket," Dale Seufer said sadly as he watched the loader drop on the ground the full-grown brown Hereford that had been hand-fed as a calf. Nearby, 37 other cows, calves and yearlings lay frozen in positions of rigor mortis, awaiting a truck from a rendering plant in Kansas. 
 The late October blizzard that swept across the Eastern Plains of Colorado last week killed more than people. Hitting at a time when calves are being weaned from their mothers and cows from the South are entering feedlots, the freezing rain, blinding snow and shrieking winds killed about 50,000 cows in Colorado and Kansas, the heaviest toll since a spring blizzard in 1957.
"It's so big I can't skin them all, and I have men skinning 600 a day," said James Davis, general manager of National Byproducts. Based in Garden City, Kan., this rendering company grinds cow carcasses into bone meal and sells the hides for low-quality leather.
But last week's toll in cattle, Colorado's worst cattle kill in 40 years, will barely be noticed in a market where there are 101 million cows in the nation's herds. Earlier this year, when blizzards and floods killed about 500,000 cows in Montana and in the Dakotas, consumer beef prices barely ticked up for the summer barbecue season. The nation's per capita beef consumption has dropped by one third over the last two decades, keeping beef prices low.
But for Colorado's agriculture, the frozen cows piled at ranch gates around here constituted one more body blow to a beleaguered industry.
"Colorado is losing 90,000 acres a year in agricultural land to development," said Bob McLavey, the state's Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture. "Agriculture right now is in tremendous competition with urban growth."
Over the last 40 years, the number of ranches in Colorado has dropped by half, to about 10,000.
Two milestones, one economic and one cultural, illustrate the state's gradual shift.
In the mid-1990's, the value of Colorado's manufactured exports surpassed the value of its agricultural production.
A decade earlier, in the mid-1980's, Colorado had moved from being a state with more cows than people to being a state with more people than cows. Using this yardstick of Old West status, South Dakota has a ratio of 5 cows for every 1 person, Nebraska's ratio is 4 to 1, and Montana and Wyoming have ratios of 3 to 1. Colorado has 0.8 cows for every 1 person.
"With the population increase, the California influence is having more and more play in Denver," said Kent Lebsack, executive vice president for the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, a ranchers' group.
At the National Western Stock Show, in Denver, organizers have stopped stringing up half carcasses in refrigerators, believing that the display offended visitors more than it educated them about cuts of meat. In Wheat Ridge, a Denver suburb with a pastoral name, several residents recently tried to force a neighbor to sell her 22-year-old mare, arguing that the town's odor ordinance took precedence over zoning rules that allow horses.
In a statewide referendum last year, 75 percent of voters on the Eastern Plains rejected a ban on trapping coyotes. But the ban was approved, largely on the strength of urban votes.
Out here, in a Colorado far from the mountain playgrounds of the tourist brochures, the loss of almost 10 percent of the region's cattle herd is a cataclysmic event.
"It's going to continue to force out the small producers, who, unfortunately, are often the younger ones," said Leonard Pruett, the regional livestock extension agent for Colorado State University. Estimating southeast Colorado's cattle losses at $15 million, Mr. Pruett added, "There will be more than a few ranchers who will have a day of reckoning with their bankers."
Ranching has long been central in Colorado's big-sky country.
Holly, with only 877 people, grew up around the three-story headquarters of the town's namesake, the Holly Land and Cattle Company. The county, Prowers, was named for John Wesley Prowers, a 19th-century cattle baron who once controlled 400,000 acres on both sides of the local stretch of the Arkansas River. In Lamar, the county seat, the biggest hotel is the Cow Palace, and at the county courthouse, local cattle brands are incised in wall friezes. In neighboring Wiley, the expression is: "Down Wiley way, it's kids and hay."
While Rocky Mountain Colorado is blanketed with national forests, ranching Colorado is dotted with national grasslands. In this open country, 200 miles southeast of Denver, the prairie overwhelms individual state identities.
From Holly, it is quicker to drive east to Garden City, Kan., than to go west to the Wal-Mart in La Junta, Colo. It is just as easy to drive south to Goodwell, Okla., to enroll at Panhandle State University than to drive west to Pueblo to study at the University of Southern Colorado.
With an altitude almost 2,000 feet lower than Denver's, Holly is the lowest town in Colorado, a place where winters are mild and four-wheel drive vehicles are seen as superfluous.
The recent storm and its aftermath left memories likely to last for years.
"I've never seen anything like this, and we have been ranching for years and years," said Dorothy Seufer, the family matriarch, who came with her husband to ranch here after World War II. Of the 350 cows, calves and yearlings in her family's herd, the blizzard killed 110.
The snow here was so deep that some animals suffocated. Others wandered over snow-covered barbed wire fences and then drifted until, desperate for water, they walked to irrigation canals, fell through the ice, and drowned.
"That's a $2,500 bull right there," Mrs. Seufer said, nodding to one of 13 dead animals half submerged in snowdrifts in the Amity Canal. "What a horrible death."
Although Colorado's Governor, Roy Romer, a Holly native, ordered National Guard helicopters to drop hay to cattle stranded on the Eastern Plains last week, state and Federal financial aid now seems as far away as spring calving season. Blizzard insurance was of little help to ranchers who had it. Most policies went into effect on Nov. 1 -- one week after the storm.

HEADLINE: Tough Guy at Treasury;
Rubin's Point Man on Policy Is in Tune On Economics, Off-Key on Politics

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
At times in the last few weeks, it has seemed as if the hand and mind of Lawrence H. Summers could be found lurking beneath the surface of just about every tangled problem facing the White House.
When President Clinton finally declared America's position on global warming last month, Mr. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, led the economic camp that won the day over the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, scaling back America's commitments on its emission of pollutants. He did it with detailed arguments about the potential -- and unknowable -- costs to American industry if Mr. Clinton committed to aggressive targets, with no escape clauses. 
 But a day later, it was Mr. Summers's turn to lose a major battle. The onetime economics professor, now one of the more influential voices in the Clinton Administration, and his boss, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, badly misjudged the political landscape. For months, Mr. Summers had headed the Treasury Department's effort to rescue the Internal Revenue Service from itself. He recruited a proven manager, instead of the traditional tax lawyer, as commissioner, and forced the scrapping of a huge computer project that had gone wildly awry.
He was so caught up in the internal fixes, in fact, that he underestimated the effectiveness of a carefully orchestrated Republican onslaught to loosen the Treasury's hold over the I.R.S. Facing overwhelming pressure from both parties, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers were forced to accept an oversight board to supervise the agency.
The I.R.S. battle was remarkable because in Washington these days, Mr. Summers rarely loses -- or even gives much ground. The youngest academic ever to receive tenure at Harvard, at age 28, he has turned into one of Washington's shrewdest political infighters. Rarely do economists make the transition from university life to Government as successfully as the 42-year-old Mr. Summers has. Indeed, no one else in his generation has been in Washington for as long, or in a series of such high-profile posts.
Along the way, he has bruised more than a few egos, from Republican members of Congress who complain they have been lectured on economic principles as if they were classroom dullards, to Administration colleagues who have felt some sharp bureaucratic elbows. In recent months, as Mr. Summers's authority and world view have expanded, he has clearly tried to tone down.
"I've learned that being precisely analytically accurate is neither necessary nor sufficient for being constructive in Washington's debates," he said recently over lunch a block from the White House. "After being a professor of political economy, I guess now I'd give more weight to the political than to the economic than when I first got here."
It has been an uneven transition. He was the principal architect of the successful 1995 bailout of Mexico -- but he was also a lightning rod for Congress's anger about the use of $12 billion in American funds, all of which have been repaid. "Congress did not want to approve so huge a loan and then take the blame if Mexico failed to repay, and Larry became an excuse for saying no," said a Democratic Congressional aide involved in the negotiations. "He was insensitive to the political issue at stake. He told the members they had to approve the bailout; they had no choice. Well, members of Congress always have a choice."
In the end, the President made the loan on his own authority.
In the last few weeks, he has devoted most of his time to the Administration's efforts to contain the economic crisis in Southeast Asia. Mindful of the sensitivities in Congress, though, he made sure this time that the International Monetary Fund took the lead and that America's exposure was limited to $3 billion in a "second line of defense" for Indonesia. Nonetheless, some colleagues back in academia warn that austerity measures that worked in Mexico may not fit the problems of the Southeast Asian economies.
Often he has been called in to play the heavy. When the I.M.F. was blanching in August at forcing Thailand to disclose fully its key financial transactions, Mr. Summers forcefully reminded officials at the fund that Washington could still effectively pull the plug on the aid package for Bangkok. The I.M.F. backed down.
And Mr. Summers is never far from the levers of power. When Mr. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, have their weekly breakfast, he is the only other person present -- and he often does much of the talking.
The issue now is where Mr. Summers is headed. There is no question he is eager to break out of Mr. Rubin's long shadow: he angled, unsuccessfully, for the presidency of the World Bank. (The job went to the financier James Wolfensohn.)
He also considered becoming chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers earlier this year (plenty of academic prestige, he decided, but not enough influence), and he was judged too confrontational to become the consensus-seeking head of the National Economic Council.
Many consider him a contender to become the next Treasury Secretary, should Mr. Rubin decide to return to New York before the end of the current term. Mr. Rubin himself is among Mr. Summers's boosters.
"He has an incredibly sensitive political mind, as well as being a brilliant economist," said Mr. Rubin, who first met his deputy when they worked on the failed 1988 Presidential campaign of Michael S. Dukakis. "He is extraordinarily equipped to function at the intersection of economics and political reality."
Should Mr. Rubin decide to call it quits, however, there are other contenders to become the next Treasury Secretary, including Franklin D. Raines, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. And there are still questions -- usually uttered off the record -- about whether Mr. Summers's sometimes impolitic style could prevent him from moving to the other side of the elegant, antique-filled suite he shares with Mr. Rubin. He is frequently the target of a lot of political vitriol, in part because he will say things in public that Mr. Rubin will not.
"Bob is legendary for speaking in an extraordinarily restrained way," Mr. Summers said, when asked to compare his style with Mr. Rubin's. "But if you thought about my speech pattern, you'd go through a lot of other adjectives before you got to restrained and unprovocative."
Mr. Summers, in short, is not one of those people about whom Washingtonians or economists have neutral opinions.
State Department officials fume that Mr. Summers seized the Mexican crisis, and now policy toward Southeast Asia, without adequately consulting them. In turn, Mr. Summers has offered blistering assessments of the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency's economic analysis in an age when currency devaluation can often be destabilizing.
He is also the subject of criticism in the economics profession. One longtime antagonist of Mr. Summers, Fred Bergsten, the president of the Institute for International Economics, calls him "turf conscious" and "not a strategic thinker."
Mr. Summers's style put him in conflict with another prominent Ivy League economist, Alan Blinder of Princeton, who came to Washington in 1993 as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers and then was named vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Blinder holds views on economic matters similar to Mr. Summers's. Nevertheless, Mr. Blinder turned down an invitation from President Clinton to be chairman of the council in the second term. He did so in part because he would have found himself in almost daily policy discussions -- and confrontations -- with Mr. Summers.
The council job finally went to another university economics professor, Janet Yellen, who once taught economics to Mr. Summers. She works closely with him now but stays largely out of the limelight.
"He is a brilliant economist," says Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former chairwoman of the council. "He has strongly held views. He is ambitious. He debates down to the last minute. He gets exasperated with people who he feels don't understand. But finally he is a team player."
Those arguments usually take place as the stout Mr. Summers downs Diet Cokes, apparently his main source of sustenance as he races between the White House and the Treasury. His staff is constantly feeding his voracious appetite, too, for statistics, and he is intolerant of what he calls "standard, government-issue, we-should-have-a-partnership talking points" when meeting finance ministers and other officials from around the world.
And Mr. Summers is often trotted out by the Administration to put its spin on the day's confluence of market tumult and political maneuvering. Usually those conversations begin with Mr. Summers's asking the first question, to gauge just how much he will have to reveal.
"So," he says casually, "what are you hearing?"
Often, what reporters are hearing are tales about Mr. Summers. He outraged Republicans earlier this year when he declared that their effort to wipe out the inheritance tax amounted to "utter selfishness." Mr. Rubin, who clearly agreed with him but would not put it so bluntly at a time the Administration was trying to cobble together a budget deal, stuck his head in Mr. Summers's office the next morning, unable to resist inserting the needle.
"I told him that I didn't really mind what he said," recalled Mr. Rubin, a man whose own sizable estate is nothing to sneeze at. "But I said my son was really angry."
On a long flight to Hong Kong last month, Mr. Summers's aides delighted in finding evidence of the policy wonk at work: a full page, in Mr. Summers's hand, of indecipherable equations, doodled during a meeting on computer encryption, an issue that has divided the Treasury, the intelligence agencies and the Commerce Department.
Instantly, the page was circulating from seat to seat. "I was trying to work out some of the principles of encryption," he said, smiling sheepishly. It's a wiser way to pass the time, he suggested, "than other things I could be caught doing at meetings, like rolling my eyes."
Other participants in those meetings say there is no question Mr. Summers is a powerful voice, sometimes even disagreeing with Mr. Rubin. He pressed, over Mr. Rubin's initial objection, for inflation-indexed Treasury bonds, something many economists have been urging for years. He is a free trader, skeptical of the argument that competition from low-wage countries pulls down American wages. He argued for milder application of trade sanctions against Japan in the automobile dispute in 1995. He holds that America's labor force is fully employed today, and that long-stagnant wages are beginning to rise, although the statistical evidence is in dispute.
While his political antenna can sometimes miss signals, Lawrence Henry Summers comes to economics naturally. He is the child of economists and the nephew of two Nobel laureates in economic science -- Paul Samuelson on his father's side, Kenneth Arrow on his mother's. He earned his Ph.D at Harvard in 1982, and made his name with contrarian papers demonstrating how some previously held economic thesis was off base.
But academia is receding. Mr. Summers's life is increasingly rooted here -- his wife, Victoria, is a tax expert working at the I.M.F., and his weekends are spent between tennis games ("I'm better than you'd think, looking at me," he says) and playing with his children -- 7-year-old twin daughters and a 4-year-old son.
As for Mr. Summers's future, here is a leading indicator: He just sold his house in the Boston suburbs.

Charts: "Inside Player"
Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, left, in the rotunda of the Treasury building, has taken an aggressive role behind the scenes in trying to shape United States economic policy. Here are some of the issues that he has worked on recently.
 
GLOBAL WARMING
He helped persuade President Clinton, over the objections of the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, to scale back the commitment the United States is prepared to make in the global warming treaty to lower emissions of heat-trapping gases.
 
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE
He tried to stop the creation of an independent board to oversee the tax collection agency, but misjudged the proposal's political momentum in Congress.
 
ASIAN ECONOMIC TURMOIL
As Asian markets tumbled, he played a key role in designing an American response much more limited than the bailout the Treasury put together for Mexico two years ago. (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: U.S. IS BUYING MIG'S TO STOP IRAN DEAL

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
The United States announced a novel tack today in its years of efforts to stop advanced weapons from spreading to unfriendly countries: buying them first.
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said the United States had bought 21 Soviet-era MIG-29 fighter jets from a former Soviet republic for fear that they would end up in the hands of Iran. Fourteen of them, officials said, were the most advanced model made -- MIG-29C's -- capable of carrying and launching nuclear missiles. 
 Officials refused to say how much the United States had spent. They said the deal followed months of secret, frantic negotiations that began in February after the Government of Moldova informed the United States that Iran had expressed interest in buying up its newly decommissioned air force.
In the last two weeks, the Pentagon has furtively sent teams to Moldova, a small East European republic, to disassemble the jets, pack them into huge cargo planes and then fly them to the United States. The bulk of Moldova's old air force now sits at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.
The Pentagon bought the jets under a program that has spent $1.8 billion since 1993 to help Russia and the other former Soviet republics dismantle nuclear weapons and improve nuclear safeguards so that materiel does not fall into the hands of nations the United States considers to be rogues. While the program was used in 1994 to buy up more than half a ton of bomb-grade uranium from Kazakhstan, it had previously not been used to buy weapons.
The United States has long accused Iran of seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, as well as the means to deliver them.
Mr. Cohen, speaking at a news conference at the Pentagon, said it was "a fair assumption indeed" to assume that Iran would continue its efforts to purchase planes like the MIG's, as well as other advanced weapons, from other countries.
"To have this kind of aircraft with a nuclear capability of deploying a weapon of mass destruction -- it seems to me it's in our overall interest to see to it that it doesn't fall into their hands," he said.
Iran's military is large but has fallen behind technologically. Its most advanced fighter jets are F-14's that the Shah of Iran purchased from the United States in the 1970's, an official said. The MIG-29's, considered on a par with some of the best American fighters, would have significantly enhanced its air power, the official added.
Of most concern to Washington, they would also be able to deliver the nuclear weapons that officials have long suspected Iran of trying to develop. While Iran accepts full inspection from international monitors, American officials have accused it of using civilian nuclear reactors to try to make nuclear arms.
Beyond denying Iran the jets, the deal also was something of an intelligence coup for the Pentagon. While the United States has acquired MIG's in the past, these advanced MIG-29C's are the first to fall into American hands, the officials said.
Because of the diplomatic sensitivities, Mr. Cohen said Russia had been told of the sale and, evidently, had done nothing to prevent it.
Mr. Cohen and other officials said the Pentagon would study the planes and even use them in training exercises, though not fly them in combat.
He and other Pentagon officials said they had agreed with Moldova not to disclose the price of the deal. An official said that the going rate on the world market for a MIG was as high as $30 million, but that "we paid much less than that."
The officials also said the United States did not want to set a price it was willing to pay, in the event others come on the market. "I don't see it as a precedent that we're now going to buy all the stray MIG's on the market," the senior official said.
In addition to a cash payment, the United States also agreed to give Moldova surplus military equipment, like trucks, as well as surplus food and relief supplies. As part of the deal, the United States also received more than 500 missiles for the planes and spare parts.
Moldova, nestled between Ukraine and Romania, has struggled economically ever since its independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991. After deciding to decommission its air force, the MIG-29's quickly became a lucrative export.
The officials said Moldova's military leaders had told the United States that several countries had expressed an interest in buying the planes. Iran's interest caused the most worry. Iran sent agents to a base in Marchulesti to inspect them late last year, the officials said.

HEADLINE: High Court Says Price Ceilings And Some 'Fixing' Are Allowed

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
In one of its most important antitrust decisions in years, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that a manufacturer or supplier does not necessarily violate Federal antitrust law by placing a ceiling on the retail price a dealer can charge for its products.
The ruling overturned a much-disputed 29-year-old precedent that regarded limits on retail markups as illegal price-fixing, a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. 
 No manufacturers announced any immediate plans to test the ruling, and it is unclear how soon the change might be felt by consumers because the legality of markup limits will now be determined case by case. Some consumer advocates said the Court simply shifted some power away from retailers in a decision that could result in diminished competition. But the Court's action was widely welcomed by manufacturers, who said it could eventually lead to lower consumer prices.
Under the ruling, for example, auto makers, freed to limit markups on popular models, might be able to keep dealers from selling them for more than the amount listed on the sticker. Computer manufacturers might be able to prevent retailers from charging exorbitant prices on hot-selling machines.
"We see this as pro-consumer; this will help to insure that the benefits of a manufacturer's pricing will be passed on to consumers," said Max Gates, a spokesman for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association in Washington.
Writing for the Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that there was "insufficient economic justification" for prohibiting the practice, which is known as resale price maintenance.
A manufacturer's inability to limit markups, she wrote, can actually harm consumers by leading to higher prices and to monopoly behavior by dealers who serve exclusive territories.
Justice O'Connor also noted that it remained illegal for manufacturers to impose minimum prices on dealers -- a version of price-fixing that is still automatically prohibited.
The decision grew out of a lawsuit by a gasoline dealer against his supplier, which had sought to limit prices by requiring the dealer to rebate to the supplier any excess over the allowed markup of 3.25 cents a gallon.
Reflecting the stakes involved, an unusually high number of briefs were filed on both sides of the case, State Oil Company v. Khan, No. 96-871. Organizations including the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable, representing the chief executives of 200 large corporations, all urged the Court to overturn the 1968 precedent.
The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission also urged the Court to overturn the 1968 ruling, Albrecht v. Herald Company. Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General for antitrust, told the Court that the ruling had done "considerably more harm than good." Ceilings on prices are "likely to be pro-competitive," Mr. Klein said during the argument, which took place Oct. 7.
For the Court to issue a decision of this significance less than a month after the argument indicates the Justices' confidence in repudiating a categorical approach to antitrust law, which had already been deeply eroded in other contexts. For example, in 1977 the Court overturned another important antitrust precedent and ruled that a manufacturer's use of exclusive dealer territories did not automatically violate the Sherman Act.
In contrast to the prior rule, which made all markup limits illegal, today's ruling means such limits will be evaluated by the Federal courts under what is known as the rule of reason, which requires a case-by-case examination of the economic and competitive impact.
In other words, the decision today does not automatically validate all markup limits. The permissible boundaries will be defined gradually as the Federal courts decide cases brought by disgruntled retailers.
The American Petroleum Institute, the trade group representing the oil industry, noted in welcoming the ruling that the decision did not mean markup limits were necessarily lawful. But the group said the ruling "does give the suppliers additional leeway in assuring that their products are marketed in a competitive manner."
On the retailers' side, organizations of automobile and gasoline dealers as well as the attorneys general of 33 states filed briefs urging the Court to hold the line. The Service Station Dealers of America, representing gasoline retailers in 14 states, told the Court that abandoning the absolute rule against setting maximum prices would give suppliers "coercive power over existing franchisees and dealers."
The states' coalition, led by New York and including Connecticut and New Jersey, told the Court that a retreat from its historical "condemnation of all forms of price-fixing" would "launch buyers and sellers in all markets, now governed by clear rules of conduct, upon a sea of doubt."
The Newspaper Association of America filed a brief, joined by The New York Times and other newspapers, that urged the Court to overturn the 1968 precedent. The brief said newspapers often found themselves at odds with their distributors because each was motivated by a different incentive: the distributors wanted a maximum profit per copy, even if the result was fewer sales, while the newspapers typically wanted to maintain or increase circulation, the basis for advertising rates.
The 1968 decision itself grew out of an effort by a newspaper publisher to grant exclusive territories to independent carriers who would not exceed the publisher's desired price.
The tension between newspaper publishers and distributors is mirrored in many other economic sectors where a retailer's desire for higher profits may conflict with a manufacturer's goal of greater volume. Unable to set markup limits, many manufacturers have used other tools to control their retailers' behavior, like consumer rebates and direct advertising, which makes it difficult for a retailer to exceed an advertised price.
The decision today overturned a 1996 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago. That court ruled reluctantly that a gasoline supplier's effort to set maximum allowable retail prices was an antitrust violation. The appeals court said that while the Supreme Court's 1968 precedent was "unsound when decided" and "inconsistent with later decisions," lower courts had to follow the law until the Justices themselves overruled it.
Some industry experts said the decision today would probably have little effect on products like gasoline. Most dealers set their prices based on local competitive conditions, and if they set prices too high, other stations tend to force them down.
The ruling's impact on auto prices is also unclear. Although it could give auto makers additional leverage in preventing dealers from charging more than the list price, dealers historically have found ways to maximize their profits.
Some dealers are skilled at preventing manufacturers from discovering big price markups. One method, for example, is for a dealer to sell a popular car to a friend at list price and let the friend resell it immediately at a higher price to someone waiting for the car, with the dealer and friend splitting the difference.
Even if auto makers try to make use of the Court's ruling, "the dealers will come up with a way to get around it," said George E. Hoffer, an economics professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who specializes in auto dealership issues.
Some consumer advocates were decidedly pessimistic that the Court's ruling would result in lower prices. Rather, they said, it might just diminish a merchant's ability to determine prices.
Edwin S. Rothschild, the energy policy director for Citizen Action, a Washington-based consumer group, said the Court was "reinventing the Middle Ages; that retailers are not free, that they are serfs."
"This is America," he said. "You're supposed to be able to price goods to attract people or not attract people. That's supposed to determine whether you stay in business or not. Why should we give control to the wholesalers?"

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: MAYORAL RACES;
For Incumbents in Cities, Celebrations Came Easily

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

 BODY:
A parade of incumbent mayors were swept back into city halls across the nation yesterday, capping a remarkably calm campaign season in cities that only a decade ago were bastions of political upheaval.
Mayors coasting to re-election included Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, Dennis W. Archer of Detroit, Sharon Sayles Belton of Minneapolis, Tom Murphy of Pittsburgh, Norm Coleman of St. Paul and Thomas M. Menino of Boston. 
 Both Democratic and Republican mayors were triumphant yesterday in contests that were notable for the lack of overarching issues. In many cities, the races were downright lackluster.
Contrary to past election campaigns, when candidates clashed over unemployment, racial conflict and all manner of other issues, most of the 223 mayoral races around the country this year were unusually smooth.
The lack of contention was perhaps a reflection that voters are relatively content or, at least, have turned more realistic about what mayors can accomplish. Even in some big cities that were considered all but ungovernable a decade ago, incumbent mayors did not have to campaign particularly hard.
In their campaigns, many incumbent mayors touted their cities declining crime rates and improved economies. In St. Paul, for instance, Mr. Coleman pledged city money to build a $130 million arena, and scored points for landing a professional hockey team. He also reminded voters that he lured a software company out of Minneapolis by promising to raze a city block and build the company a new headquarters through city subsidies.
"I know we are moving in the right direction for strong neighborhoods and a vital downtown."
All in all, the voting yesterday was quite a contrast to that of four years ago, when there was dramatic turnover at city halls in Boston, Detroit, Atlanta, Miami and elsewhere.
One of the few lively races was in Miami, where Mayor Joe Carollo came close but did not avoid a runoff on Nov. 13 with his opponent, former Mayor Xavier Suarez. Mr. Carollo drew 49.6 percent of the vote to 47 percent for Mr. Suarez.
Leading the pack of old faces that were returned to power was Mayor Giuliani, a Republican who never seemed threatened by his Democratic challenger, Ruth W. Messinger, and overwhelmingly won a second term.
One of the more interesting races was in Minneapolis, where Mayor Sayles Belton fought off a challenge from Barbara Carlson, an independent who was married to the state's Republican Governor, Arne Carlson. Ms. Carlson was a talk show host who had a reputation for saying or doing anything, and wrote a book called "This Broad's Life," which contained details about her sex life.
In St. Paul, across the river, Mayor Coleman, a Republican, had an easy re-election even though he switched parties only last year. His opponent in the Democrat-Farmer-Labor party was Sandy Pappas, a state senator.
Mayor Menino of Boston had an even easier campaign: He was the first incumbent mayor in the city's history to face no opposition in the general election. He, too, won a second term.
Mr. Menino, a Democrat, became Boston's first Italian-American mayor in 1993 when Raymond L. Flynn resigned to become Ambassador to the Vatican. Mr. Menino was president of the City Council when he was elevated to the mayor's office.
Any opponents he might have had this year were scared off not only by his large war chest but also by his substantial popularity: He registered a 74 percent approval rating in one recent poll.
In Detroit, Mayor Archer won a second term by a wide margin in a nonpartisan election. The one-sided race there was in marked contrast to that of four years ago, when Mr. Archer, then a Michigan Supreme Court Justice, won a scrappy election to succeed the combative Coleman A. Young, who had been Mayor for 20 years but decided to retire four years ago. (Mr. Young has a history of antipathy toward Mr. Archer but did not make an endorsement in the race this year.)
Mr. Archer, who was opposed yesterday by Ed Vaughn, a State Senator, was the beneficiary of a reviving local economy and a perception that Detroit was on its way back. He assiduously courted President Clinton, and early in his administration Detroit was one of the cities selected for a Federal empowerment zone, with tax breaks and other benefits amounting to $100 million. In his first term, unemployment fell in Detroit, and, by his estimate, $5.8 billion in new projects were begun.
Mayor Paul Helmke of Fort Wayne, Ind., president of the United States Conference of Mayors, recalled being in Charlotte, N.C., recently for a meeting with that city's Mayor, Pat McCrory, when Mr. McCrory ducked out for a candidates' debate.
"Ordinarily when you've got a debate with your opponent, you're blocking off the whole day to get rested," Mr. Helmke said, "get makeup and work the themes."
But Mr. McCrory was gone only a half-hour, Mr. Helmke said, "kind of like going out to make a phone call."
Mr. McCrory won yesterday.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE MANDATE;
Mayor Now Has a Mandate to Aim High

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

 BODY:
For much of the last four years, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has enjoyed portraying himself as the embattled quarry of New York City's Democratic establishment, scuffling for every victory and succeeding despite vast battalions of "old-fashioned politicians" arrayed against him.
As of last night, that image of siege, never entirely accurate, is obsolete. 
 With his definitive victory over the Democratic emblem, Ruth W. Messinger, the Republican outsider has absorbed and become the city's establishment, suddenly finding himself an undisputed national figure with far greater power to remake the government of New York City.
He did not win by the historic margins his aides had predicted, and he failed to do as well among African-Americans as he had hoped. Early returns showed him trailing by a substantial margin in the Bronx, and barely winning in Manhattan. It will be difficult for him to claim convincingly that his re-election has truly unified the city.
But having amassed his mandate with significant help from many of the Democrats who campaigned against him in 1989 and 1993, Mr. Giuliani now has the freedom and the political capital to broaden his reputation beyond that of a former prosecutor who made the city's streets safer.
And because he simultaneously becomes the city's first official lame-duck mayor -- the result of the 1993 term-limits amendment -- he must fulfill the high hopes expressed in yesterday's vote in only four years or less, intensifying the pressure to produce decisive, dramatic accomplishments equal to the drop in crime that dominated his first term.
"The expectations for this man are unbelievably high," said Frank Luntz, who conducted Mr. Giuliani's internal polls during the campaign, and who has worked for other Republican candidates around the country. "Our polls show that he has the highest credibility rating, to do whatever he wants to do, of any public official I've ever seen."
Just what he will choose to do, however, has become the political mystery of the moment. Mr. Giuliani, who has not even committed himself to serving out the full four years of his last term, has been loath to discuss the direction of the next term beyond saying he will build on his accomplishments and will begin a big effort to reduce drug use. Even his closest advisers seem uncertain which of two roads he will take as he approaches a decisive moment in his political career.
Will he give greater rein to his inclination to act as the city's disciplinarian, seeking more mayoral control and pursuing a conservative agenda of further cuts in city spending and new anticrime efforts? Or will he chart a broader course, seeking a legacy larger than improved public safety and focusing on issues like education, housing, and finding jobs for those on welfare?
His Republican advisers, including longtime friend Peter J. Powers, Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine, and Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President, hope he will now take some bold steps to the right to solidify his party credentials in preparation for an eventual run for United States Senate, or even higher office.
Although his purely executive temperament makes it unlikely he would enjoy being one of 100 senators, such a position may be the kind of intermediate step he needs if he has dreams of a national ticket someday. In either case, appealing to upstate New York voters or those in a Republican Presidential primary requires different political calculations from those he has made as mayor.
Now that he is unfettered by the need to appeal to the largely Democratic city electorate, Mr. Giuliani is being urged by those within his party to make large cuts in city spending, cut taxes even further, privatize city services and overhaul the City University system.
"If he's looking at moving up the ladder, he has to establish his Republican credentials more than he has," said Mr. Molinari, a co-chairman of the Mayor's campaign. "The fact that he endorsed Mario Cuomo will never be forgotten by some people in the party. So he has to take out his Republican credentials and polish them up a bit, and I think he can take more aggressive steps now."
On the other side of the spectrum, more liberal advisers, including Raymond B. Harding, leader of the Liberal Party, and Fran Reiter, the re-election campaign manager, want him to pursue a broader course. Many of the Democrats who supported him want the Mayor to build on his increasing acceptance in black and Hispanic neighborhoods to become known as someone who united the city, improved its school system, and reduced police brutality along with crime. This school of thought holds that Mr. Giuliani should try to become the true reincarnation of Fiorello H. La Guardia, reaching further into neighborhoods like those in the Bronx that rejected him yesterday.
"I believe he will broaden his focus," said Mr. Harding, the Mayor's senior political adviser, noting that he did much better among African-Americans than he did in 1993 (though he still received less than a fifth of their vote, according to exit polls). "So he's a long way there already, and this kind of mandate is the capstone of that effort."
To a lesser degree, this debate has run throughout the Mayor's first term, and it seems likely that he will now continue to chart his own instinctive course between these polar arguments. Although a team of four or five advisers is preparing a draft agenda for his second term, Mr. Giuliani has made it clear in recent weeks that he shares Mr. Harding's desire for a warmer reputation as a unifier, however contrary that may be to his widespread image as an imperious steam whistle.
Softening his image has its own political advantage, even if it may not sit well with orthodox Republicans. New Yorkers may appreciate a large helping of hot sauce with their Mayor, but other regions may have a far different reaction to Mr. Giuliani's particular style.
In the most passionately delivered passage of his acceptance speech last night, he described New York as a city with "open arms," and said the next four years would be dedicated to reaching all New Yorkers, even those who had not been touched by his successes in his first term. "No New Yorkers should be left out," he said. "No New Yorker should be left behind."
That doesn't mean, however, that there won't be some Draconian decisions in the years ahead. The Mayor's aides say privately that they expect him to mount a full-blown campaign against the current operation of CUNY's two-year colleges, which he believes have wrongly served in effect as remedial high schools. He is likely to intensify what one aide calls a "bloodbath" confrontation with the Port Authority, working to wrest the city's airports from the authority's control, and possibly to get New York State out of the agency altogether.
Near the end of his term, he has said, he may once again begin an effort to win mayoral control of the school system from Albany, once it is clear he is doing so for future mayors.
And, because he enjoys defying low expectations, he intends to pour enormous resources into his antidrug campaign, pushing the Police Department to demonstrate clear results in a fight that has bedeviled mayors and presidents. That would be the kind of achievement that could get him an appointment as Attorney General and a leg up on a national political ticket, a goal many of his supporters hope he will pursue. If he combines that with similar aggressiveness in improving education or reducing unemployment, it might also produce the kind of legacy for which mayors are long remembered.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE GOVERNOR;
GIULIANI SWEEPS TO SECOND TERM AS MAYOR; WHITMAN HOLDS ON BY A RAZOR-THIN MARGIN

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman narrowly won re-election to a second term last night, beating back a surprisingly strong challege from a Democratic opponent who tapped into voters' anger over the high cost of automobile insurance and property taxes.
"This is truly a wonderful victory because it speaks to all that we have been doing for the state of New Jersey, this Republican team, for the last three and a half years," Mrs. Whitman told a cheering crowd at the Princeton Marriott about 12:40 A.M. today. "I look forward to being Governor for the next four years to build on what we have done." 
 Minutes earlier, the Democrat, State Senator James E. McGreevey, smiling but subdued, stood before a hushed crowd at the Woodbridge Sheraton Hotel and offered a gracious concession speech.
"We put middle-class New Jersey issues at the front of the burner and, God willing, we will address these issues with this Legislature and this Governor over the next four years," he said.
With 99 percent of election districts reporting in unofficial returns, the vote was 1,108,863 for Mrs. Whitman and 1,086,679 for Mr. McGreevey. Murray J. Sabrin, the Libertarian Party candidate, had 111,924 votes. An estimated 41 percent of the residents who were eligible to vote turned out at the polls, just below the 42 percent that turned out four years ago.
Mrs. Whitman began her statewide political career as the little-known Republican who nearly toppled then-Senator Bill Bradley, a Democrat, in 1990, wounding his political standing outside New Jersey. In a striking replay of that race, Mr. McGreevey's unexpectedly fierce challenge may have damaged Mrs. Whitman's future in the Republican Party. Four years ago, she defeated Gov. Jim Florio by only one percentage point, about the same margin of victory in this contest.
Polls suggested that Mrs. Whitman won by solidifying her support among her Republican base in the final 10 days of the campaign and by making a strong showing among female voters across the state. She also captured enough votes among traditional Democratic voters in the state's cities, overcoming vigorous efforts by Democrats and organized labor leaders to get Mr. McGreevey's supporters to the polls.
Only six months ago, Mrs. Whitman was considered unbeatable in this race. The state's economy was humming. She had fulfilled her promise to cut the state's income taxes by 30 percent. And she was a prominent and influential leader in the national Republican Party.
But she found herself locked in a close contest with Mr. McGreevey, a little-known Democratic challenger who tapped into a reservoir of voter discontent over two problems that Mrs. Whitman had not addressed in her first term: rising automobile insurance and property rates.
Mr. McGreevey, a 40-year-old State Senator and former assistant prosecutor who is also Mayor of Woodbridge, won a hard-fought primary in June to win the Democratic nomination and surprised even his most ardent supporters by running a feisty and focused campaign. He kept Mrs. Whitman on the defensive for much of the race by relentlessly hammering her record on auto insurance. He rarely strayed from his message that he was the candidate who better understood the needs of "working and middle-class families."
Mr. McGreevey's campaign strategists viewed the race as Whitman versus Whitman, and did little to try to promote Mr. McGreevey himself or to tell voters much about his record as Mayor of Woodbridge, where he restored integrity to what was widely considered a corrupt and poorly managed local government.
The New Jersey governor's race drew national attention not only because Mrs. Whitman's political future was threatened but also because the state's volatile electorate has long been a fairly faithful gauge of what is on voters' minds from coast to coast. Four years ago, when taxes dominated the campaign, politicians across the country watched as New Jersey voters unseated an incumbent governor, Jim Florio, because he raised taxes, and they elected Mrs Whitman because she pledged to lower them.
The prospect of a Democrat's toppling the national Republican Party's biggest tax-cutting star spurred both national Republican and Democratic Party leaders to pour resources and to direct millions of dollars into the state.
Because Governor Whitman is among the most prominent members of the Republican Party's moderate wing, some Republican conservatives looked on with a smug sense of satisfaction at the struggle she was having for a second term. But national Republican leaders viewed her re-election as critical for the party's future. Republicans and Democrats alike followed Mrs. Whitman's lead in cutting taxes.
For Democrats, an upset in New Jersey would have given them the momentum they are looking for to make significant gains in next year's Congressional and gubernatorial contests, a point underscored by President Clinton at a McGreevey rally in Edison on Sunday when he said the New Jersey race was about "the direction that we have to take into the next century."
Mrs. Whitman's apparent victory last night may not be enough to undo damage that this fall's close race may have on her national standing. Her inability to glide easily to a second term put her future on a national ticket in doubt, some political analysts say, adding that it raised questions about whether she could continue to play an effective role in pushing the national Republican Party in a more moderate direction.
The close contest also raises questions about whether tax cuts alone and her brand of moderate Republican politics are the right mix for a party that is now deeply divided between its conservative and more moderate wings.
Mrs. Whitman found that her moderate Republican views were threatening to cost her badly needed votes from the more conservative wing of the party. She spent most of her time in the final days of the race campaigning in Republican strongholds with Republican leaders, who represent the other end of the ideological spectrum on social issues. She offended conservatives by vetoing legislation earlier this year that would have banned certain late-term abortions, pushing through a pension borrowing plan and failing to lobby hard for other items on the conservative agenda, like school vouchers.
But Patricia Harrison, co-chairwoman of the national Republican Party, dismissed speculation that Mrs. Whitman's hard-fought campaign had diminished any future political ambitions that Mrs. Whitman may have or impaired her ability to help shape the party's future.
"Winning is winning," Ms. Harrison said. "One would like huge margins, but winning is winning. New Jerseyans, like New Yorkers, are very independent. New Jersey is mostly a Democratic state. It is really a triumph for her to be re-elected. Christie Whitman is a leader in the Republican Party and it is up to her where she chooses to go with that."
Steven Grossman, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, sharply disagreed. "It is clear to me that there are several lessons here," he said. "This election is one in which Christie Whitman should have sailed to an easy victory. Yet it was a highly competitive situation because I think the Republican Party is a party at war with itself. Jim McGreevey has done what Whitman, unfortunately, did to Bill Bradley. A race that was this tight winds up wounding one of the very few reasonable voices within the Republican Party."
A turning point in the campaign for Mrs. Whitman, both sides say, is when she confronted voters in a television advertisement 10 days ago, and apologized for not doing more in her first term to lower auto insurance and property tax rates. In the 30-second spot, she told viewers that she heard their complaints in this campaign and she promised to address their concerns, if given another chance.
To the dismay of some of Mrs. Whitman's closest advisers, Mrs. Whitman never shied away from talking about the state's auto insurance problem. She said she ignored her campaign staff's advice because she believed that the electorate would become more angry with her if she did not acknowledge their concerns. She frequently cited her 1990 Senate campaign against Senator Bill Bradley, a Democrat, and his refusal in that race to discuss Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion income tax increase earlier that year. She said that is why she believed she came so close to almost toppling him.
But her insistence on repeatedly discussing the problems of auto insurance and property taxes, her two biggest vulnerabilities, played right into the strategy of her Democratic opponent.
Mr. McGreevey talked of little else in this campaign, except for education. He used Mrs. Whitman's failure to bring down auto insurance rates and property taxes as evidence that she didn't understand the struggles of working and middle-class New Jersey families. "I'm on our side," he said, at every campaign stop.
But despite Mr. McGreevey's feisty campaign, it was not enough to persuade New Jersey voters, in the end, to take a chance on someone new. While a majority of voters consistently told pollsters they were deeply dissatisfied with Mrs. Whitman for not reducing their auto insurance and property tax bills, they continued to give her overall high marks as Governor.
The voters also said they liked Mrs. Whitman personally. Their anger never rose to the level that it did in 1990 against Governor Florio after he pushed through a $2.8 billion tax increase. Much of the animosity against Mr. Florio had subsided by the time he ran for re-election, but it was still there. Mrs. Whitman won by only 26,000 votes.
In addition to Mr. McGreevey's strong showing in the polls, the Whitman campaign also faced another challenge that further complicated the Governor's re-election bid: the candidacy of Mr. Sabrin, the Libertarian gubernatorial nominee. Mr. Sabrin, a professor at Ramapo College, was the first third-party candidate in the state to qualify for taxpayer financing for his campaign. As a result, he earned a place at the three televised debates and had enough money to buy media time to reach voters.
Mr. Sabrin, who opposes abortion rights, caused Mrs. Whitman particular difficulty among some conservative members of her own party.
Mrs. Whitman spent the closing days of the campaign emphasizing her tax cuts, making direct appeals to female voters and fighting hard to regain her standing with conservatives.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: DEFEAT;
In Messinger Camp, an Air of Subdued Resignation

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
As Ruth W. Messinger entered the Sheraton New York Hotel's New York Ballroom last night to deliver what might be her last speech as a politician, there was no aura of anticipation. The returns, showing a wide margin of victory for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, offered no hope. The mood was resigned, the crowd subdued. A deejay played Elton John's "I'm Still Standing" -- the Messinger campaign's theme song -- as she climbed onto a platform with family and Democratic elected officials gathering behind her.
"First let me say how proud I am to be the first woman nominated by the Democratic Party for the office of mayor of the City of New York," she said, reading a speech she had worked on for days. Her eyes welled with tears and her lips quivered, but she did not cry. "Somewhere out there a little girl is watching this and this message is for her. I didn't become mayor tonight, young lady, but you will." The crowd cheered and chanted her name. "If just by reaching for it, just by giving it all I had I showed you that it could be done, I have succeeded," she continued. 
 For Ms. Messinger, the speech marked what could be the end of a political career that has spanned more than two decades, taking her from a community school board on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, to the City Council to the Manhattan borough president's office. Close aides said Ms. Messinger has no intention of running for public office again and that she wrote her speech with that in mind, to define her beliefs and her motivations.
"I got into this race because I love this city and I worry about its future," she said. "These issues and the real people touched by them have been important to me all my life, they are part of my personal commitment to social and economic justice."
She went on to warn that if Mr. Giuliani did not pay more attention to issues ranging from school overcrowding to unemployment, New York would "become a city of permanent winners and permanent losers with hardly anyone in between."
Even forseeing defeat, she campaigned until the last possible minute, at subway stations and stores in Brooklyn. The last planned event, a walking tour through housing projects in East New York with the Rev. Al Sharpton, was curtailed because her aides expected the race to be called early. Instead, she shook hands with voters in fast-food restaurants and left for the hotel.
In her suite, Ms. Messinger changed from the blue blazer she had worn all day to a pink one. Close supporters and elected officials milled about as she sat with her husband, her parents, Marjorie and Bill Wyler and her three children, Daniel, Miriam and Adam, and they posed for photographers. Somewhat hoarse, she drank a glass of tea.
Having lost the biggest race of the year, albeit by a smaller margin than some Giuliani aides had predicted, many Democrats talked throughout the night about the need to give their party a new direction. "I think there needs to be a major reassessment after this campaign," said Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn, who opposed Ms. Messinger in the mayoral primary. New York's Democratic Party "needs to take stock of itself," Mr. Albanese said, "and think about what it really stands for."
Former Mayor David N. Dinkins, who campaigned with Ms. Messinger in Brooklyn until just before the polls closed, praised Ms. Messinger and said the Democratic Party needs "to look at those would-be Democrats who deserted the party and Ruth."
Aides said that Ms. Messinger had not yet considered a life out of public office. "There is life after public office," said Mr. Dinkins, who has a weekly radio show and teaches at Columbia University. "She'll be damn good at whatever she does."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: LONG ISLAND;
Races Leave Republicans Still Holding Major Offices

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Nov. 4

 BODY:
Republican incumbents swept most contests on Long Island today as voters handily re-elected County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta in Nassau, District Attorney James M. Catterson Jr. in Suffolk County and Republican majorities in the Legislatures of both counties.
And in a hard-fought race that reverberated in Albany, the Republicans also retained the State Senate seat in the Seventh District, most of which is in North Hempstead. The victory of Michael Balboni, an Assemblyman from Mineola, over Doreen E. Banks, a member of the North Hempstead Town Board, brings the Republican majority in the Senate back up to 35, compared with 26 Democrats. 
 In early returns, Mr. Balboni led Ms. Banks 4,358 to 2,813.
The seat was formerly held by Michael J. Tully Jr., a Republican, who died in August. Both sides spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the race, which was the only election today for the State Legislature.
Nassau Democrats' hopes of winning additional clout in the County Legislature appeared to have failed: they gained no seats and appeared to be on the verge of losing one. Going into the election, the 19-member Legislature was held by the Republicans with a lead of 13 to 6.
With 15 percent of the returns in, County Executive Gulotta led by a 2-to-1 ratio for a record-tying third term as Nassau's chief official. His big victory, after his relatively narrow victory four years ago, may help him win a spot on a statewide ticket next year. Publicly, he has been silent on that possibility, however, and last week he even pledged to complete his third term.
Mr. Gulotta entered the campaign with the odds in his favor. Crime is at a 26-year low, the economy is improving, welfare rolls are down and county taxes have leveled off. His party has a 3-to-2 advantage among voters and a legendary county political organization. He used the powers of incumbency to make an endless string of new programs and proposals.
Mr. Gulotta raised nearly $4 million to flood the airwaves and mailboxes with campaign promotions, concluding with a handwritten letter from his wife, Betsy. Critics said most of the contributions came from county contractors and employees.
The Democrats put their hopes on Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli of Oyster Bay, a politician with a reputation as a scrappy underdog able to beat Republicans. But he feuded with the Democratic County Chairman, Stephen J. Sabbeth, calling for his removal after Mr. Sabbeth was indicted on charges related to his business affairs.
Although Mr. Yevoli made the rounds of Long Island Rail Road stops and community group meetings in his campaign, he lost the money-raising competition with Mr. Gulotta by a ratio of about 20 to 1. As a result, he failed to reach the county's 1.3 million residents through the mass media.
Some Democrats complained that Mr. Yevoli's disappointing efforts and poor showing dragged down the rest of the ticket.
Also elected on the Republican slate were District Attorney Denis Dillon, Comptroller Frederick E. Parola Jr. and County Clerk Karen V. Murphy, all incumbents, and the new chairman of the Board of Assessors, Assemblyman Charles O'Shea. He will succeed Abe Seldin, who is retiring after 24 years. In Oyster Bay, Town Attorney John Venditto, a Republican, was leading Democrat Dal LaMagna in early returns to succeed Mr. Yevoli as Supervisor.
In Suffolk, the focus was on the District Attorney's race and the pugnacious style of the Republican incumbent, Mr. Catterson. His critics accused him of abusing his powers to bully other public officials. He denied the accusation, made no apologies and argued for re-election based on his high conviction rate of 96 percent and falling crime rates.
Several top Republicans crossed party lines to endorse Mr. Catterson's Democratic challenger, Theodore Scharfenberg, a former prosecutor on Mr. Catterson's staff. But Mr. Scharfenberg and his party raised only a small amount of campaign money.
Mr. Catterson led by about 56 percent to 44 percent with about 34 percent of the votes counted.

Oregon Stays With Its Law On Suicides

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES

 BODY:
Oregon voters refused yesterday to repeal the country's only law allowing doctor-assisted suicide, first passed three years ago but never put into effect because of a series of legal and political challenges.
With more than half the state's precincts reporting, the repeal effort, one of more than 50 ballot initiatives decided across the country in the day's voting, was going down to defeat by a ratio of better than 3 to 2, according to The Associated Press. 
 Backers of the failed repeal effort, among them the Roman Cathiolic Church and a number of anti-abortion groups, indicated that they would continue the fight by filing more court challenges to the law.
In another major initiative vote, in Washington State, stricter gun controls were soundly defeated by a 2 to 1 ratio after gun advocacy groups, notably the National Rifle Association, outspent control advocates by better than 3 to 1.
The control proposals would have required gun owners -- at least one of every five Washington residents -- to pass an examination or take a safety course to get a gun license. Also proposed was a requirement that would have forced gun dealers to equip all new guns with trigger locks.
Gun advocates, who viewed yesterday's vote as a major victory in a long, hard national fight, fought the proposed legislation by warning that the real, hidden goal of control advocates was to eventually register and then confiscate all handguns.
Also in Washington yesterday, voters defeated a proposal that would have made the the state the third in a year to legalize medical use of marijuana and other drugs. The Associated Press said the measure was being defeated by a 3-to-2 ratio.
With yesterday's vote in Oregon, the state in effect reaffirmed its 1994 decision that made it the first place in North America to legalize doctor-assisted suicide. Similar proposals have been turned down in Washington and California.
But unlike various proposed measures, the Oregon law does not allow doctors to give lethal injections. They are limited to prescribing a lethal dose of drugs to a patient who has been given six months or less to live by two doctors, is of sound mind and has made a written request to die.
Once a decision has been made to end a life, there is a 15-day waiting period until the prescriptions can be written.
Yesterday's vote was somewhat surprising. In 1994, the first time Oregon voted on assisted suicide, the measure passed, barely, 51 percent to 49 percent. That law held up in a series of court challenges, including one that the United States Supreme Court refused to hear last month.
Polls before yesterday's balloting showed that voters were angry at the Oregon Legislature for throwing a voter-approved measure back at the electorate. It was the first time in Oregon history that a measure which had been voted into law by citizens was returned for reconsideration by the Legislature.
Assisted suicide had the support of Oregon's popular Governor, John Kitzhaber, a Democrat who is also a physician. It was opposed by the major medical organizations, including the powerful American Medical Association, and by the Catholic Church, which spent more than $1.5 million in the repeal effort.
In other voting on ballot initiatives yesterday, proposals to impose new laws on timber cutting and to extend voting rights to mentally ill people under guardian care were rejected in Maine, and in the Southwest, Navajo Indians rejected an effort to allow casino gambling on their reservation, the nation's largest.
The Maine voters refused to buy arguments from timber companies and some environmentalists that the proposed new cutting laws would limit destruction of the nation's largest remaining and most valuable forests.
Nor would they accept arguments that it was archaic in the 1990's for a state to be involved in deciding whether a person under a guardian's care was too mentally ill to be allowed to vote.
In voting in Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, Navajos rejected casinos despite arguments by proponents that the flow of gamblers' cash would help give the tribe a badly needed economic boost.
In Minneapolis and Pittsburgh, in another sign that citizens in some cities are growing wary of anteing up for fancy new sports facilities, voters balked at giving carte blanche approval for construction of new stadiums.
Those in the 11-county Pittsburgh area rejected by a 3 to 2 margin a sales tax increase that would have paid for new football and baseball parks. In Minneapolis, they voted 2-1 to require the city government to get their permission in order to spend more than $10 million on a new stadium.

HEADLINE: Russians Are Springing Up All Over;
Few medium and large American ballet troupes lack emigres.

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Ellen Tharp wanted to start a ballet company on Staten Island. But where to find dancers? A Russian cabdriver who had been an engineer at home gave her an idea. Why not advertise in Novoye Russkoye Slovo, the Russian-language newspaper, and on Russian cable television? The response was overwhelming.
Many of the dancers had performed with leading dance companies in Russia. "Most were living in Brighton Beach and working in nightclubs," Ms. Tharp recalled in an interview at her studio in the New Dorp Moravian Church. "I got two beautiful Moiseyev boys, a Bolshoi boy, two Kirov girls, another boy from the Bolshoi Opera and a girl from a Georgian ballet company. They spoke almost no English. We communicated in ballet language." 
 Only one of the original Russian recruits will dance when the Staten Island Ballet performs on Saturday at Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, on 68th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues in Manhattan. "Right now I'm really low on Russians," Ms. Tharp, who is not related to the choreographer Twyla Tharp, said. But they come and go and she knows they will return. "There is such a supply of them," her husband, Paul, said.
The dancers pouring by the score into the United States from Russia and the countries that once made up the Soviet Union are performing, teaching and even running companies, filling the ranks of troupes from New York to California and from Minnesota to Texas. They are not the first Russian dancers to immigrate, or even the most notable or gifted. Immersed in the traditions of czarist and Soviet classical ballet, they have much to give American ballet but also much to learn. What stands out about them is their number.
"The calls and videos are endless, endless," Martin Fredmann, director of the Colorado Ballet and a leading ballet Russophile, said with a groan that was not entirely unhappy. "And my dancers give me more videos and resumes. I have a big box marked 'Russians.' "
The current westward flow of Russian dancers began in an atmosphere of relative relaxation in 1990, a year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. "That was the first year Russian dancers could sign contracts," said Eldar Aliev, a former member of the Kirov Ballet who now directs Ballet Internationale of Indianapolis. "Before that, we belonged to the company." Now there were choices, Mr. Aliev said, though they often had to be fought for. From early in this century, Russian dancers have dropped out during American tours to settle in the United States and teach or start companies of their own. The age of the great Soviet defectors began with Rudolf Nureyev in 1961 and continued into the mid-1970's with Natalia Makarova, Mikhail Baryshnikov and other dancers from the leading Soviet companies, the Bolshoi and Kirov Ballets.
A look at the original cast of a 1971 Kirov version of "The Creation of the World," which was revived by its choreographers Natalya Kasatkina and Vladimir Vasiliyov for presentation last month by Ballet Internationale, suggests the extent of the outflow. Three of its four leads -- Mr. Baryshnikov, Valeri Panov and Irina Kolpakova -- have since established careers in the West. The fourth, Yuri Soloviyev, died a suicide in the Soviet Union in 1977.
The restaging was the idea of Eldar Aliev, who joined the Indianapolis company in 1992 and became its artistic director in 1994. Mr. Aliev insists that he has no interest in creating "a little copy of the Bolshoi or the Kirov." Eight of his 25 dancers are Russian.
A third of the 33 dancers in the Colorado Ballet are Soviet-trained, and the company has three Russian teachers, three Russian pianists and one Russian balletmaster. Eight of American Ballet Theater's 77 dancers are Russian. A small company called the Russian Ballet was founded in 1995 in Wilmington, Del., with a core of stranded Russians from the touring Donetsk Ballet of the Ukraine.
In a random sampling of 20 medium and large ballet troupes in 18 states, only 5 have no Russian dancers, teachers or ballet masters. Eleven have more than one Russian member, and the number jumps to 18 at the Colorado Ballet. Most of the dancers are male principals or soloists with some performing experience with the Bolshoi and Kirov. Many drift from company to company, perform as guest artists with more than one troupe or teach at several schools.
 
A Hunger to Learn New Kinds of Dance
Dmitri Kouznetsov, a hip 25-year-old member of the Colorado Ballet, performed with two other troupes before moving to Denver last year. He immigrated five years ago, in part because of his curiosity about the United States and to avoid military conscription. At home in Tblisi, Georgia, he danced three performances every week and had his own coach. "There is not so much time to learn stuff here and not so many performances," he said. He was encouraged to come by a Georgian friend who had danced at a Jackson, Miss., competition and stayed on to direct Ballet Mississippi for a year.
The earlier lure of artistic freedom has been replaced by a hunger for new kinds of dancing. Vladimir Malakhov is performing with Ballet Theater at City Center this week and next in works by Balanchine and Mark Morris, for example, and will dance with a former Alvin Ailey star, Desmond Richardson, in a new piece by the Spanish choreographer Nacho Duato. Mr. Malakhov will return the favor with the all-Russian "Diaghilev Celebration" on Nov. 17 at the New York State Theater, in which he will perform with Igor Zelensky, a Bolshoi dancer who danced recently with the New York City Ballet.
And the eight Russian dancers in the Wilmington troupe will perform a somewhat unorthodox new version of "The Nutcracker" by Robert LaFosse, a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, in December.
"I would like to stay here and dance," Mr. Kouznetsov said. "It has been hard sometimes. The language, the different culture. But I'd like to experience more styles here, dance Balanchine and modern and jazz."
The Russian dancers at the Colorado Ballet will soon learn Martha Graham's "Appalachian Spring." In the spring, Ballet Internationale will perform Agnes de Mille's "Rodeo" and Paul Taylor's "Company B," inspired by the wartime Andrews Sisters songs to which the dance is set.
The United States is still seen as the land of gold-paved streets. "It is hard for them to understand that money isn't there for dance as it is in Russia," Mr. Fredmann said. "They don't understand they have to be responsible for their art here, signing autographs and doing school performances. You have to be willing to go out and beg, to give your art away.
"The first thing the Russian boys do when they get here is buy the biggest, most outrageous American used cars that get eight miles to a gallon and break down all the time. They all have accidents. As the years go on, the cars get smaller and smaller and more practical."
Mr. Fredmann has become a keen observer of the Russians' integration into the United States. Speaking of the male dancers, he reflected, "They have to have things. Dancing becomes secondary, but it is the only thing they know how to do. The women we've had really work hard. They want to dance. But the men were being brought up at a time when their country was falling apart. It is a lost generation, especially the men. They seem not to care to dance, though I'm not sure that they just don't want to show their feelings."
Ms. Tharp has been told by some of her Russian dancers that they are afraid to return to their country for fear the borders will again close. They also fear black-market crime. She still shudders over an incident that revealed to her the desperate poverty and economic confusion the dancers have left behind.
A gifted Russian ballerina auditioned for the Staten Island company, bringing along her husband, who spoke what Ms. Tharp describes as "restaurant English," as her translator. When she told them what she could pay, the two went into an intense and argumentative huddle. Sadly, the director explained that the fee was all she could afford.
Another huddle, then the husband turned to her. "O.K.," he said. "But when do we have to pay you?" Ms. Tharp was stunned. "I suddenly realized that they came from a black-market system where if you couldn't find a job you paid to work."
For all the difficulties of adjustment many of the dancers face, the two dance worlds are ultimately not so different, Victoria Lebedev, a choreographer for the Staten Island Ballet, said. Konstantin Uralsky, who is teaching at Hartford Ballet after directing the Ballet Iowa, now defunct, for five years, agreed. "I am who I am," he said. "I do what I did before and what I believe I have to do. I will work any place in the world. But the United States is home now."
The opportunities for work are decent but not unlimited here. Not every director of an American ballet company is a Russophile. The Houston Ballet recently took on its first Russian company member, though the Bolshoi ballerina Nina Ananiashvili performs with the company as a guest artist.
"I never found any good ones," Ben Stevenson, the artistic director of the Houston company, said. "There are. But obviously they stayed in New York. They didn't swim as far as Houston." The dancers who did come his way wanted to be hired as principal dancers, too, whatever their background and whether or not they could dance anything but the classics.
 
Admiring the Grace Of Their Arabesques
Still, he does admire Russian dancing for its balance and its emphasis on the upper body. "They don't just dance upright. They have a wonderful line in the air, a curve to their arabesque. They also have very soft plies. Their landings from jumps are secure."
Mr. Fredmann lovingly recalls the Russians he saw dancing from the 1950's into the 70's in performances that "didn't deal in small statements." Even today, he said, the Russians dance with unusual passion. "They all seem to have a special kind of madness that is charming at its best though at worst very trying," he said.
While he admires their classical technique, he said, many Russians have little feel for the continuous lyrical flow of dancing. "And Russian men don't particularly like to partner. They don't want to stand behind the women."
One of the Russians' greatest gifts to the United States may be their teaching of traditional classical ballet technique and style. The great Kirov ballerina Alla Osipenko is a teacher and coach at Kirk Peterson's Hartford Ballet. Ms. Kolpakova teaches at Ballet Theater and Ballet Internationale. And Oleg Vinogradov, former director of the Kirov, heads the largely Russian staff of the Universal Ballet Academy in Washington. Vladilen Semyonov, who trained Mr. Aliev at the Kirov, now heads the Indianapolis company's academy and offers free seminars to teachers and dancers there and in nearby satellite schools.
Many American ballet directors feel the cachet of the Russian dancer is beginning to wane as less experienced performers flood the market. But the letters, telephone calls and videos continue to come, often prompted by word of mouth.
Mr. Stevenson said he gets tips from an unusual source. "I get letters from people saying that they were on holiday in Omsk and met the most wonderful dancers on a train. Or they met a choreographer on the plane. We're subscribers, they say. We know you'll take them in."

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Wednesday about Russian ballet dancers in the United States misstated the affiliation of two dancers appearing with the Staten Island Ballet. Gennadi Saveliev and Alexandra Koltun were guest artists, not company members. Mr. Saveliev is a member of the American Ballet Theater; Ms. Koltun performs as a guest with the Boston Ballet.
The article also misstated the affiliation of Igor Zelensky. He dances with the Kirov Ballet, not the Bolshoi.

HEADLINE: At Home With: Jane Jacobs;
Urban Hero

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
BECAUSE Jane Jacobs believes nothing should ever be thrown out, she uses a World War II experiment to hold open her front door. It is a smooth wooden block, a model for a fuel tank that would fit in the wing of a fighter plane.
Her late husband, Robert, designed the tank during the war. Now it is a doorstop that Ms. Jacobs, 81, uses whenever she burns the toast or wobbles to her front porch to sit on a white garden chair and do what she does like no one else: observe the city. 
 Hard to believe though it may be for New Yorkers who still connect her dumpling face to Greenwich Village, it's been nearly 30 years since Ms. Jacobs, in a flash of disgust, left the city she had so passionately defended and took refuge here in what she once called "the most hopeful and healthy city in North America."
Albany Avenue, the shady street lined with comfortably worn brick houses where she has lived since shortly after leaving New York, is not as eclectic or, as she puts it, "full of pizazz" as the Village streets she wrote about so vividly in her first book, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" (1961), perhaps the most important book written about cities in the 20th century.
But in the way each front porch overlooks the sidewalk and hugs its neighbors, it does have the human scale she championed in that book and those that have followed. The semi-detached houses, constantly renovated and haphazardly remodeled through most of this century, may not win any design awards but they affirm the adaptability she urged cities not to take for granted.
Perhaps most of all, her 95-year-old brick half house and the other homes on Albany Avenue show the spirit of serendipity that her arch-critic, Lewis Mumford, called "higgledy-piggledy unplanned casualness" but which she and her followers have used as a shield against the widespread destruction of American cities.
Now reliant on a $10 bentwood cane to help her creaky knees, Ms. Jacobs cuts just as unassuming a figure as she did when she fought against boondoggles like the Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have wiped out much of what is now SoHo.
"I can't flatter myself that the book made a great deal of difference, or these things would have stopped in the early 1960's; but they didn't," she said in an interview at the dining room table of her capriciously decorated home, where track lighting surrounds turn-of-the-century sconces and a porch glider has found new life as a sofa.
In her view, megaprojects and slash-and-burn urban renewal did not lose favor until the mid-1970's, when they "demonstrated by themselves that they were stupid, extravagant and unworkable."
"Insofar as the book or I have made a difference," she said, "it's by maybe helping to show why such things didn't work and that alternative things can be done."
Despite her fear of overstating the book's impact, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" has already influenced at least two generations of architects, city planners and municipal officials, and in mid-October was the popular focus of a weeklong symposium held in Toronto on her and her work.
"She's affected the way I and a lot of people like me think about cities," said Patrick McGuire, an urban economist at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, who has been bringing undergraduates to Toronto and New York on comparative field trips for 16 years. "She provides the basic tools for optimism, not pessimism, that cities can work."
But in her latest battle against what she sees as the wrongheadedness of public officials, Ms. Jacobs was unable to stop the local government's headlong rush to have Toronto follow the path New York City took a century ago. Several separate municipalities around Toronto will be combined into one megacity.
Although the beveled glass front door of her house still bears a "No Mega City" sign, the new super city -- which at 2.3 million people will be larger than any American city but New York, Chicago and Los Angeles -- will come into existence Jan. 1.
"These are worrisome times," she said about the changes she fears could rob Toronto of its great strength: diversity on a workable scale. Although her toughness and tenacity -- traits easily attested to by legions of New York City officials -- have not diminished with the years, some of her early ideas can now seem dated.
During the symposium she suggested the core city of Toronto should simply secede from the megacity, which is essentially what she concluded in an earlier book about the French-speaking province of Quebec's future in Canada. It was vintage 60's radicalism, the kind of direct confrontation that worked when urban renewal projects threatened entire neighborhoods. Although her remark made headlines locally, no one took her suggestion seriously.
Still, in her long career, Ms. Jacobs has stared down plenty of foes at least as pushy as the province of Ontario. She was arrested in New York City in 1968 in a protest against the proposed expressway across lower Manhattan. Not long after moving here, she prevented a wrecking crew from tearing down a beloved old house in an action that may have helped Toronto from repeating the mistakes of New York.
She calls herself "a very traditional person who believes in 'Home Sweet Home.' " Anyone coming across her during the Depression -- when she moved from Scranton, Pa., to New York without a college degree and became an exceedingly courteous young writer -- would have sensed her affection for home. But at times she also acts like an urban minuteman, taking on any developer or elected official she thinks is out to ruin people's homes.
The disparity between those two images throws everyone except Ms. Jacobs. "You think people who love home ought to be namby-pambies, or that I should just be some little old lady with white hair who simpers?" she snaps, revealing a bit of the attack dog who has so bedeviled officials. One of them, a former New York City housing administrator named Roger Starr, said, "What a dear, sweet character she isn't."
Reminded of that, Ms. Jacobs retorted, "I won't say what I think about Roger Starr." Then she abruptly did so.
"I think he's a foolish man," she said. The two of them often clashed because Mr. Starr, who later became an editorial writer for The New York Times, backed slum clearance to resolve problems like the need for low-income housing.
"My biggest beef with Jane was that she didn't recognize how complicated these things were," Mr. Starr said. "In her anger against all this, she felt the people who were doing these things were being destructive when they were simply trying to solve problems."
When she packed up and left her Greenwich Village brownstone in 1969, Ms. Jacobs said publicly it was to protest the war in Vietnam. But she also had grown tired of the fray in New York.
"I had work that I wanted to do," she said. She completed "The Economy of Cities" (1969) but the constant battles in New York made other writing difficult.
Ms. Jacobs's writing is marked by strikingly original observation and clear thinking about cities and, later, more broadly about economics. When she is writing here in her second-story study, pounding away on a 40-year-old Remington typewriter borrowed from her daughter-in-law, who lives down the street, Ms. Jacobs said she needs to shut out the diversions of the neighborhood.
But much of her work, as opposed to her writing, is done right on Albany Avenue, where knots of boys often rush past on their way to the private school down the block that uses the recycled foundation of an unfinished Anglican cathedral for classrooms.
"Everybody knows her," said Sid Adilman, an entertainment columnist for The Toronto Star who has lived opposite Ms. Jacobs for almost 30 years. "She talks to everybody. I don't think that the house painter who works around here knows her as the author of a famous book. He just knows her as Jane."
Last year Ms. Jacobs's beloved husband and partner, Robert, died. But she does not let the intense grief prevent her from working. She will say little about the new book she's writing other than that "it's just another book on economics."
Ms. Jacobs had to give up her American citizenship when she became a Canadian citizen in 1973. She said she now feels not like a New Yorker but a Torontonian, and when she mentions Canadians or their urban policies, she says "we."
Although she has not visited since receiving an award in 1988, she said she still is fond of New York City, to which she dedicated her first book. She described it then as the place "where I came to seek my fortune and found it."
She now gets regular reports about New York from friends. "Everything I hear says it's been improving quite a bit lately," she said, "and I'm very glad to hear that."

HEADLINE: Modern Masters of Collecting;
From One Couple's Treasures, One Important Auction

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
For the last two weekends, more than 1,000 people a day have been visiting Christie's Park Avenue salesroom. Dealers and collectors, museum experts and art lovers, they have been drawn by an extraordinary group of works by just five artists: Picasso, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella and Eva Hesse. They were collected by Victor and Sally Ganz, a quiet Manhattan couple who spent their Saturdays perusing galleries wherever they happened to be.
Their collection (were they alive, they would surely bristle at the word, calling it pretentious) is being sold at Christie's on Monday night. It is conservatively estimated to be worth $125 million, making it the most expensive single-owner sale ever. And if the enthusiasm from the art world is a measure, this may well be one of the most important auctions of 20th-century fine art in history.
 
 Mr. Ganz, who died in 1987, ran D. Lisner & Company, his family's costume-jewelry business. He was not a rich man, by the standards of today's tycoons. Nor was his wife, Sally Wile Ganz, a benefactor of educational and cultural organizations who died in January. During 50 years, they bought economically, spending under $2 million on the art that is now being sold. The Ganzes were willing to take risks that less talented collectors would not have. They had sure eyes and an uncanny talent for choosing just the right work. They became known as collectors who never made a mistake.
Rather than putting together an encyclopedic collection, as others of their generation tried to do, they spent 50 years buying the work of their five favorites. Next week's sale includes 115 paintings, drawings, sculpture and prints. "What is unusual about this collection is how rigorously formed it was," said Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in America. "They concentrated on the work of very few artists but in depth, and they were intellectually involved in everything they bought."
The Ganz sale kicks off two weeks of the biggest fall auctions in New York. Art by masters like Modigliani and Matisse, Cezanne and de Kooning, with an estimated value of about $500 million, makes it one of the most promising seasons since the boom years of the late 1980's.
Christie's is not the only auction house to offer a single-owner sale this fall. Sotheby's has two. The first is from the estate of Evelyn Sharp, the hotel owner who died in April; she amassed a collection worth about $60 million of works by Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse and Braque. It is being sold two days after the Ganz collection, on Wednesday evening. On Nov. 20, Sotheby's is selling the Keir Collection, a remarkable group of 12th- to 14th-century medieval enamels, named after a house that the seller, Edmund de Unger, once owned in Scotland.
Both Sotheby's and Christie's have more than their reputations at stake this fall. In order to secure these collections in what has become a fiercely competitive climate, both houses have had to strike expensive deals. Sotheby's has given Mary Sharp Cronson, the daughter of Evelyn Sharp, a guarantee (an undisclosed sum promised to the seller regardless of a sale's outcome). It has also guaranteed several paintings in its general Impressionist, modern and contemporary art sales.
To get the Ganz property, Christie's has invented a more complex strategy. While officials at the auction house refused to discuss the financial details, the catalogue for the auction says in small but bold letters, "Christie's has a direct financial interest in all property in this sale."
To insure these sales get attention, both auction houses expanded their marketing efforts. Sotheby's has hired the stage director Robert Wilson to design an exhibition that will include live models as part of the promotion of the Keir Collection.
Christie's has designed a special museumlike installation to show off the Ganz collection; it includes a high-tech rubber floor and computer screens, like A.T.M.'s, that spew out information on the collection at the touch of a finger. Christie's has also had the Ganz collection on view for an unprecedented period, both at its Park Avenue galleries and at its annex at 308 East 59th Street, where the paintings were on private view for a month.
While both houses have produced lavish hardbound catalogues, Christie's has gone further. Besides its 210-page, all-color $80 catalogue, it has published a $100 book, "A Life of Collecting: Victor and Sally Ganz," that includes essays by John Richardson, the author and Picasso biographer; Maya Picasso, a daughter of the artist, whose mother, Marie-Therese Walter, was the subject of many of the portraits, and Michael FitzGerald, chairman of the fine arts department at Trinity College in Hartford and a Picasso scholar.
 
'No Special Spotlights'
The story of the Ganz collection is a remarkable tale of passion and foresight. Those who knew the couple say they were a perfect team. Both read voraciously, and both loved looking at art. They lived in a duplex apartment on Gracie Square surrounded by their purchases.
"My parents were very conscious about the way each work of art played against each other," said Kate Ganz, one of their daughters. "Yet they had no special spotlights or fancy frames. They never had any curatorial help."
Mr. Ganz made his first purchase in 1941, just before he was married. For $7,000, he bought Picasso's "Dream" (1932), a portrait of Ms. Walter asleep in an armchair, considered one of the artist's most powerful portraits. Experts say the painting is worth around $30 million.
"The Dream" was the beginning of what Mr. Ganz called his "love affair with Picasso," a preoccupation that lasted 15 years, when he bought only Picassos: paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures. By the end of his life, he had put together the largest private collection of Picassos in the United States.
"Victor always said 1941 was a turning point in his life," said Mr. Richardson, who is writing a four-volume biography of Picasso and had been a friend of the Ganzes for 40 years. "He bought 'The Dream,' went into analysis and married Sally all within six months."
Another important milestone in their collecting lives came in 1948 when they decided to try to meet Picasso. While staying in Monte Carlo, the couple drove to Golfe-Juan, France, where they made friends with a bookseller who lived next door to Picasso. They learned that every morning, around 9, the artist passed the bookshop on his way to his studio. The next day, they waited at a nearby cafe, and when they saw Picasso go into the shop, they followed him. They introduced themselves, telling them how they had bought "The Dream" and enjoyed a long chat.
They did not visit Picasso again for another 22 years. Yet he often talked to mutual friends about the Ganzes, asking what they had bought. He was reportedly fascinated with their purchases because they were not interested in collecting his pretty, more commercial works. Instead, they bought challenging ones, some of which were painted during the war years.
Among the more haunting were "Cat and Bird" (1939), which depicts an angry cat holding a bird in its mouth and is thought to be worth $6 million to $7 million. Another, "Still Life with Sausages" (1941), a dark painting of the period showing what formerly would have been a typical French lunch at a time when little food was available, is estimated to bring $700,000 to $900,000. In the same palette, painted a year later, is "Reclining Nude," which shows Dora Maar, one of Picasso's mistresses, lying in the artist's studio on the Rue des Grands Augustins, where he painted the famous "Guernica" a few years earlier.
 
Picasso Series, Bought and Divided
Mr. Ganz also bought the entire series of Picasso's paintings after Delacroix's "Femmes d'Alger" done in 1954 and 1955. The series was begun just four weeks after Matisse died, and his influence on Picasso is evident. "Even if Victor had had the cash to buy the more expensive, small Blue Period or classical Picassos, he would have still bought the tough pictures," said Mr. Richardson.
After he bought the entire series of 15 works for $212,953, Mr. Ganz realized he might have gone a bit over his head. He sold all but five to dealers and museums for about $138,000. (Four of the "Alger" paintings that he kept are up for sale on Monday night.)
After that, Mr. Ganz decided that Picasso was getting too expensive. So he broadened his collection, buying the work of Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg, then in their 30's, and later Mr. Stella and Hesse. The couple still kept collecting Picassos, too, but only when the right one came up at the right price.
Among the classic images for sale at Christie's is Mr. Johns's "White Numbers" (1959), which carries a $5 million to $6 million estimate, and his "Corpse and Mirror," a 1974 diptych in his well-known crosshatch style, estimated to sell for $3.5 million to $4.5 million. The Rauschenbergs include "Red Interior" (1954), an elegant example of the artist's Combine Series. The Ganzes bought the painting straight from Mr. Rauschenberg for $11,000 in 1967. Now it is being offered with a $3 million to $4 million estimate.
At the time the Ganzes were buying paintings by Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg, other collectors were, too. But the one artist Mr. Ganz truly discovered was Hesse, the German-born American sculptor who, by the time she died of brain cancer at 34 in 1970, had left an indelible stamp on Minimalism.
On a Saturday in November 1968, the Ganzes were doing their usual tour of Manhattan galleries. Mrs. Ganz, whose feet hurt, left her husband and went home. He continued on his rounds, stopping by a Francis Bacon show at the Marlborough Gallery, which he described as "filled with wealthy collectors, chatting away like a giant cocktail party."
He left and went around the corner to the Fischbach Gallery, where Hesse was having her first show. He was immediately absorbed in the strange and unusual sculptures fashioned from materials like fiberglass, rubber tubing and metal screens, and ended up buying three. Her works are now among the most sought-after of the 1960's.
"My father was not a young man when he discovered Hesse, yet even though it was tough stuff, he didn't flinch," said Tony Ganz, his son. "Everyone thought he'd lost his mind, even curators. They didn't get it."

HEADLINE: Federal Protection for a Vanishing Turtle

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Help is on the way for a species of small, brightly marked turtles that are rapidly disappearing from the wild, partly because of their popularity as pets.
The species, bog turtles, can fetch up to $2,000 a pair on the black market overseas, prompting the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to declare them threatened, subjecting traffickers to stiffer fines and imprisonment. 
 "During the last five to 10 years, an increasing number of bog turtles have been advertised for sale, and prices have increased substantially," the agency said on Tuesday.
The turtles are popular because of their size and the distinctive orange, yellow or red blotch on each side of the animal's head. There may be only a few thousand of the turtles left in 12 states from Massachusetts to Georgia.
Although the states in which the turtles are found already make it a crime to harm the animals, scientists say Federal protection is needed against smugglers.
The Fish and Wildlife Service declared the turtles threatened, one step short of endangered, and put the designation into effect immediately instead of allowing the customary 30 days.
Anyone who captures, harms or transports a threatened species faces up to $50,000 in fines and up to one year in prison for each offense.
Conservationists say the designation should serve as a catalyst for private donations. But the designation also calls attention to the turtles' popularity as pets, which the Fish and Wildlife Service recognized in refusing to publish the specific locations of the species.
In the northern states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland -- the bog turtle population has shrunk by more than 50 percent in 20 years.
Scientists blame land development for reducing the turtles' natural habitat, a situation that is exacerbated by the illegal pet trade.
Domestically, a bog turtle can sell for $250 to $450, but there are reports of the animals fetching $2,000 a pair in Japan.
In the southern states -- Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia -- the turtles are not in immediate danger, but Federal officials are declaring them threatened there as well to halt further commercial harvesting.

HEADLINE: And Why Not a Guggenheim Leadville?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Wealth of Mine Barons Turns to Dust at Source" (front page, Nov. 4): While I have often tried to think of ways in which Leadville, Colo., might regain its luster, you gave us something to dream about. Imagine: a community saved by art! And while the idea of a Guggenheim Leadville seems farfetched, we might recall that the idea of creating a ski area in Vail was no less farfetched a mere 35 years ago, and likewise the idea of saving the mining town of Aspen with skiing 50 years ago. 
 As a native of Vail, I was disappointed by a few things your article missed. The first is your contention that Vail and Aspen have ever treated Leadville or its residents as second class. The old families of Vail and Aspen are well aware that we would not have achieved success without the help of Leadville.
Further, you gloss over Leadville's strongest asset: its sense of community. A few years ago the town had the foresight to spurn outside interests and vote down the gambling that three other former mining towns jumped on as a means to save their exhausted economies.
The result in those places is as expected: an increase in real estate values drove out the locals, and the casinos now sit empty because gambling is not nearly the draw it once was.

Head Shot

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
When you think about how the U.S. should respond to Saddam Hussein's latest attempt to evade U.N. sanctions, just keep this in mind: Saddam Hussein is the reason God created cruise missiles. Cruise missiles are simply the only way to deal with him.
Saddam is up to something serious this time. He has apparently concluded -- from the U.S. efforts to tighten the sanctions around him, from recent in-your-face denunciations of him by Madeleine Albright, and from the fact that the new chief of the U.N. weapons inspection team in Iraq is turning out to be just as tough as his predecessor -- that the U.N. sanctions on Iraq are not going to be lifted, whether Saddam is a good boy or a bad boy. Whatever he does, the U.S. intends to find a way to keep the U.N. sanctions noose around his neck until one of his generals or one of his relatives terminates him with extreme prejudice. 
 Therefore Saddam is no doubt asking himself: "If my choices are sanctions with constant U.N. weapons inspections or sanctions without the U.N. weapons inspections, let's have sanctions without them. Let's precipitate a crisis that will either undermine the U.N. inspections regime or force the U.S. into retaliating against me, so I can kick the U.N. inspectors out altogether. At least then I'll be able to hold onto the poison gas, Scuds and anthrax weapons that I've been hiding all over the country and that the U.N. is now closing in on."
But that's not the only reason Saddam precipitated a crisis now -- by blocking any further U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq unless the six U.S. members of the inspection team are removed. He also smells where the wind is blowing in the Middle East -- in America's face.
There are powerful magnetic forces that are pulling Iraq out of its isolation. Syria would like to get closer to Iraq in order to counter pressure on Damascus from Turkey and Israel. Egypt would like to see Iraq back in the Arab fold to counter Iran and put more leverage on Israel. The European oil companies, sensing that the U.S. sanctions on Iran are collapsing, want to use this moment to end the blockade of Iraq.
Moreover, precipitating a confrontation between Iraq and the U.S., just before the Middle East economic conference in Doha, Qatar, on Nov. 16, and the Islamic conference in Teheran on Dec. 9, is like a two-for-one sale for Saddam. America's Arab allies are already wary about going to the Doha meeting with Israel, and a fracas between the U.S. and Iraq in the gulf right now would make the Arabs even more wary. At the same time, any U.S. military action in the gulf would embarrass the new Iranian Government in Teheran, which has been probing, ever so delicately, for an improvement in relations with the U.S.
When you add it all up, you can only conclude that if not this week, then next week, if not next month then the month after, Saddam Hussein has powerful reasons to try to push those U.N. inspectors out. Therefore, one of three things is going to happen, and I hope it is the third. The first is that Saddam will now back down, satisfied that he has drawn the attention of the Arab world and the Europeans -- and maybe even won their sympathy -- over the fact that the U.S. intends to keep the sanctions on him whether he misbehaves or not.
The second possibility is that the U.S. will back down and remove its inspectors from the U.N. team, as Saddam is demanding. This would allow the U.N. inspections to continue, but only until the Iraqi leader precipitates another crisis.
The third option is that Washington will call his bluff. But if the U.S. does take military action against Iraq again, it cannot be just to obliterate those sites where he is still hiding weapons -- although that's important. The U.S. has to try to destroy him too. Because the worst of all worlds would be if we destroy his weapons but he survives and throws out the U.N. inspectors. He would then be able to rearm without anyone watching inside Iraq. And he will try to rearm.
Given the nature of world politics today, and given America's feckless allies, the U.S. will get only one good military shot at Saddam before everyone at the U.N. starts tut-tutting and rushing to his defense.
So if and when Saddam pushes beyond the brink, and we get that one good shot, let's make sure it's a head shot.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Some Experts Say Inflation Is Understated

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
An economic report from Washington last week could hardly have brought cheerier news to investors shaken by turmoil in Asia. In spite of brisk economic growth, the Government's most comprehensive measure of inflation rose at the slowest pace since 1964. Strikingly, though, not all the interpretations of the data are sanguine.
Some analysts suggest that the report, covering the third quarter of the year, really amounts to a last hurrah for the inflation-resistant economy that drove the stock market to record highs. "Inflation has been camouflaged by manna from heaven," argued Robert Gordon, a widely respected economist at Northwestern University whose research focuses on the links between growth and prices. 
 Depending on who's talking, everything from a strong dollar and stable health costs to changes in the way the price index is put together have conspired to keep inflation in check. And at least in the view of Mr. Gordon, "onetime factors can't protect price stability much longer."
On first impression, the latest numbers seem guaranteed to smooth the brows of anxious policy makers and investors. Solid gains in exports, business investment and personal consumption powered the American economy to a 3.5 percent annual growth rate in the third quarter, a full percentage point more than mainstream economists have contended is sustainable without creating shortages and bottlenecks in production.
Meanwhile, the price index for domestic output as a whole -- the "deflator" for the gross domestic product -- rose at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent, the lowest in 33 years. And if food and energy (traditionally volatile components of the index) are excluded, prices rose by a mere 1 percent.
This combination of strong growth and stable prices is no surprise to converts to the "new paradigm," people who believe that tightening markets for labor need not cause a wage and price spiral in an era of weak labor unions, productivity-obsessed corporate executives and fierce competition from imports. Indeed, the buzzword on Wall Street is deflation.
Many market analysts, reacting to economic stagnation in Japan, competitive currency devaluations in Southeast Asia and a worldwide glut in manufacturing capacity in autos, petrochemicals and electronics, have decided that inflation is a bugaboo of the past. "We're in a new world of flexible prices" in which markets react quickly and decisively to the gap between supply and demand, concluded Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
Or maybe not. Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, sees the decline in inflation as "transitory." Profit margins have been exceptionally high, he explains, thanks to unanticipated cost savings and unexpectedly strong sales. But corporations flush with cash have now set their sights on increasing market share, generating a hiatus from upward pressure on prices.
For this pause to endure, output per hour would have to grow at least as rapidly as wages. And while "predictions of a productivity revolution in the making have been around since the 1980's, I don't see any evidence of long-term gains," Mr. Bosworth said.
William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, buttresses this view. Medical care consumes one dollar out of eight spent in America. And after a decade of rapid increases, medical insurance premiums have recently been growing at roughly the cost of living, giving business a breather on outlays for fringe benefits.
But the era of stable medical costs "looks like it's ending," Mr. Dudley argued. Profits at health maintenance organizations have fallen through the floor: Aetna and Cigna recently reported losses, while Oxford Health Plans, which had been considered the industry model, just took hundreds of millions of dollars in write-offs. Not surprisingly, health insurers are now hinting broadly at big premium increases down the road.
By the same token, price stability has gotten help from the rising dollar, which discouraged American businesses from raising prices for fear of losing sales to imports. Now, depreciation of the Southeast Asian currencies and a glut in manufacturing capacity in the region could mean more of the same.
But Mr. Dudley suggests that the inflation-tempering impact of deflation in Southeast Asia will be offset by currency appreciation elsewhere. The weakening of the dollar against the yen, mark and pound gives American producers some room to raise prices in markets still dominated by European and Japanese corporations.
While Mr. Bosworth and Mr. Dudley discount signs that the inflation trend is improving, Mr. Gordon of Northwestern has a far grimmer story to tell. For starters, Mr. Gordon estimates that purely technical changes in the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics has assayed prices in the last few years have cut the measured rate of inflation by half a percentage point. This is a onetime change, and thus won't help to dampen measured inflation in the future.
More important, he suggests, the benefits from falling computer prices have been exaggerated. Statisticians have long wrestled with the problem of measuring deflation in this industry, where quality is improving rapidly and new products are frequently introduced. For example if today's basic desktop PC, a 200-megahertz Pentium machine with 2-gigabyte hard drive, 16 megabytes of memory and a super-speed CD-ROM, cost 20 percent less than a 120-megahertz machine with a 486 processor, a 600-megabyte hard drive and 8 megabytes of memory did in 1995, how much has the price of computers declined?
In the past Washington calculated annual price declines of about 10 percent, which many experts considered too low. The latest figures show computer prices falling at nearly 30 percent annually, and Mr. Gordon argues the pendulum has swung the other way. If he is right, a mere return to a long-term trend rate of 15 to 20 percent would show in the price index as an uptick in inflation.
The exhaustion of Mr. Gordon's "manna from heaven" could spell big trouble ahead. Economists generally hold that when unemployment falls below a certain level, competition for workers will begin to push up wages and prices. Mr. Gordon estimates that the combined impact of favorable but temporary factors lowered this level of unemployment consistent with price stability by a full percentage point. Thus, while economists have recently been inclined to believe that 5 percent unemployment is consistent with stable prices, the Gordon analysis implies that the magic number is closer to 6 percent.
There is no evidence that the Federal Reserve has reached the same conclusion. If Mr. Gordon's message does gets through, though, it could bring a pre-emptive strike in the form of an increase in interest rates this winter. And even if the Fed is reluctant to act in the midst of currency and securities market crises in far-flung corners of the world, it will have a fine excuse to tighten monetary policy on the likely news of an uptick in measured inflation in coming months. "Rising medical care costs led to Fed tightening in the late 1980's -- and to the recession of 1990," Mr. Gordon reminds.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "A Different Look at Inflation"
Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, argues that the current measures of inflation are artificially low. His analysis remvoes food and energy, which are volatile, and computers and medical care, which have fallen sharply in recnet years but may not in the future. After making these adjustments and reverting to the Labor Department's pre-1991 metholology on other prices, he finds current annual inflation to be above 3 percent and rising.

HEADLINE: Orders Rose At Factories In September

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Orders placed with manufacturers unexpectedly rose in September for the fourth consecutive month, the Government said today in a report that reflected an expansion of business investment in factories and equipment.
Demand for metals, industrial hardware and high technology led the gain of four-tenths of a percent in factory orders, while demand for aircraft and automobiles retreated from a month earlier, Commerce Department figures showed. In August, orders climbed 1.2 percent, and analysts had been expecting a decline of two-tenths of a percent in September. 
 Factory inventories, a gauge of expected demand, rose two-tenths of a percent in September after rising four-tenths of a percent in August -- the ninth consecutive monthly increase in inventories.
"Firms have accelerated capital spending plans," said Cary Leahey, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y. "Capacity growth in manufacturing is increasing."
The Government's data were the latest in a series of reports that reflected economic stamina before the plunge in the stock market Oct. 27 because of financial turmoil in Asia. Although the market has largely recovered, questions persist about whether the Asian crisis could hinder the American economy in coming months.
Some economists warned that the large-scale business investment reflected in today's report could also pose a problem for the economy -- now in the seventh year of the current expansion -- if consumer demand cools in the current fourth quarter and in early 1998.
"That's a classic case in the later stages of a business expansion," said Robert Dederick, an economic consultant at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "Business gets all fired up and adds to capacity for demand that never shows up."
Signs have already emerged that consumer spending, the economy's primary engine, is slowing in the aftermath of a surge in the quarter ended Sept. 30, said a former Federal Reserve Board governor, Lyle E. Gramley, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
Over the last two days, for instance, the Big Three auto makers reported that sales fell in October.
September's increase in new orders to a seasonally adjusted $336.475 billion followed a revised 1.2 percent gain in August to $335.040 billion. Previously, the Government estimated August orders rose 1.3 percent, to $335.457 billion.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Rise in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities snapped a three-day decline yesterday, after the second part of the Government's quarterly refunding of debt showed decent results.
The 30-year bond rose 9/32, to a price of 102 2/32. Its yield, which moves opposite to its price, was down to 6.22 percent, from 6.24 percent on Tuesday. 
 In the quarterly refunding, the Government sold an $11 billion auction of 10-year notes at an average yield of 5.955 percent, down from 6.205 percent in August and the 5.043 percent on Feb. 6, 1996.
Analysts said the demand was solid, but the market still has today's 30-year bond auction to contend with, as well as tomorrow's employment report for October.
At the auction, the bid-to-cover ratio -- the total number of bids compared with the amount of securities being sold -- was 2.24 to 1, which measures up well with the historical average of 2.22 to 1 for the 10-year note. Despite the solid demand, Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said he did not see much interest from small investors with the yield below 6 percent, "especially with bank certificates of deposit yielding about 6.25 percent."
"Basically," he added, "the Street is paralyzed by the new strain of the Asian flu, whose symptoms are apprehension, confusion and the loss of money. The remedy is a large dose of patience and most people are taking a wait and see attitude in front of the employment number."
Ahead of the auction, hedge funds and foreign investors were buying Treasuries, prompting investors who had made bets that the market would drop further to buy securities to cover their losses. The market was also helped early by comments overnight by the Bank of Japan governor, Yasuo Matsushita, who suggested that a Japanese rate increase was unlikely over the near term. Higher interest rates in Japan would make investments there more attractive.
With the bond market still focused on the recent volatility in world equity markets, economic data pointing to a vibrant United States economy, with low inflation have been largely ignored. But Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the bond market could not get away from economic fundamentals for any sustained period of time.
Yesterday, however, the market largely ignored a report that factory orders in September rose by more than expected, four-tenths of 1 percent, the fourth straight monthly increase. Mr. Fine said, "Factory orders on a trend basis continue to demonstrate buoyancy, which bodes well for fourth-quarter growth." Nonetheless, he said that because of the recent swings in stock prices, he expected the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady at the meeting of its policy-making committee next week.
Elsewhere, municipal bonds were little changed yesterday, with the $511.8 million by the Los Angeles County Public Works Financing Authority the largest deal priced yesterday. Underwriters led by Paine Webber priced the debt to yield 4.1 percent for an issue due in 2000, up to a maximum 5.39 percent for a bond due in 2019.
The following are the results of yesterday's 10-year bill auction:

HEADLINE: Charivari: Boutique Blues on West 57th Street

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
Jon Weiser, the man who has raised the fashion consciousness of New Yorkers more than a few notches over the years, is holding court in his multilevel store on West 57th Street, a minimalist monument to au courant clothing. "Isn't that Marky Mark?" he asks, peering toward the entrance from a space displaying nubby charcoal jackets for $680. Apparently, it isn't.
Except for a slight paunch, Mr. Weiser exudes the youthful positivism of the good old days. It was a time, not long ago, when Andy Warhol, Jacqueline Onassis and all manner of clotheshorses would venture into one of the Charivari stores to see the latest handiwork of avant-garde designers from Japan to Britain. 
 There's still the occasional celebrity, but these are definitely not good days for Charivari.
The company, which was started by Mr. Weiser's mother, Selma, as a dress boutique on the Upper West Side 30 years ago and grew to encompass six stores and a wholesale business, filed for bankruptcy in late September. In recent years the Charivari presence has shrunk as, one by one, the stores have closed. The flagship store on 57th Street is now the only one left.
But in the more prosperous 80's, it was Charivari's wildly original designs that would make even frumpy, fashion-illiterate New Yorkers stop in their tracks and stare up at the store's soaring glass window displays that seemed to dot the Upper West Side.
"In a quick glance you knew exactly what was happening in a season because they always had the latest of the latest merchandise," said Robert Beauchamp, the former fashion director of Esquire and GQ magazines. "Charivari certainly had an effect on the way New Yorkers dressed and their attitudes toward wearing clothes. It was the first to embrace Japanese fashion and was in the forefront of bringing it to New York City."
So what happened?
According to Mr. Weiser, whose voice becomes weary as he wonders where to begin, everything that could go wrong did go wrong.
"The big mistake is that we never sat down like normal business people and had a 5-year plan or 10-year plan," said Mr. Weiser, who runs the company with his sister, Barbara. "We dealt from our guts and our emotions. Our biggest strengths were merchandising and buying and creating the whole environment. But business is business."
The company, the siblings now realize, opened too many stores on the Upper West Side: there were five within 13 streets of one another at one point. It never opened a shop in SoHo despite the store's ultramodern, downtown sensibility. It also sank profits into expansion rather than create a financial cushion.
When the Weisers opened a store on Madison Avenue at 78th Street in 1992, they located the shop a bit north of the high-fashion hub and also lost control of the costs. As a result, there was not enough money left for promotion. And the shop still took customers away from the 57th Street Charivari.
Nor did it help matters that the store opened after the recession had cast a pall of consumer insecurity over the New York economy. "If I had a magic wand, I would make the Madison Avenue store disappear," Mr. Weiser said. "We were just very, very unlucky there," Ms. Weiser said.
Members of the fashion industry and former Charivari employees say the company was, to a certain extent, a victim of its own success. Charivari was selling clothes by Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, Yohji Yamamoto and Matsuda well before those designers had their own boutiques in Manhattan.
"Why go to a department store when you can go to Versace's own store?" asked Kurt Fulton, an artist who worked at Charivari in the early 1980's, first as a sales clerk and later as a store manager and buyer. "If you're a label-oriented person, the whole scene is the label and where you bought it."
After Selma Weiser had a stroke in 1990, the Weisers took over the company. The stroke left her unable to participate actively in the business, a blow, since she had been a buffer when her children disagreed.
Mr. Weiser, who is president, and Ms. Weiser, the executive vice president, are trying to pay off their creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Three Italian apparel manufacturers had banded together to force Charivari into an involuntary bankruptcy in late August. The company then decided to file voluntarily.
The company has $6.3 million in liabilities and $1.3 million in assets. Most of the $6.3 million is actually owed to the Weisers, who put up their own money to help bail out the business.
As word has spread this year of Charivari's financial problems, some designers have abruptly canceled deliveries. In January, Mr. Weiser spent two days in Milan negotiating a $700,000 men's wear order with Prada, the Italian fashion house. But at the end of February, Prada decided not to fill the order.
"It was the end of the buying season," Mr. Weiser said. "How was I going to replace hundreds of thousands of dollars of merchandise when the season was finished?"
But despite the drumbeat of bad news, he and his sister seem determined to survive. ("I'm convinced the world wants us to exist," Ms. Weiser says.) The first priority is to insure that the 8,000-square-foot store at 16 West 57th Street regains its previous productivity. In the last five years, sales at the store have dropped to $6 million from $8 million.
The Weisers are also talking about expanding, but this time outside New York. They are considering forming a partnership with a fashion designer and opening up one Charivari in each of several large cities in the United States and abroad.
Envisioned, too, are styles that are more accessible and affordable, private-label clothes using the Charivari name that would supplement the designer clothing. Down the road, expect Charivari-brand T-shirts.
"A Charivari T-shirt would be cut differently and have an asymmetrical neckline or whatever," Mr. Weiser said. "We stand for smart design, but I think the stereotype some people have of our clothes is that they can only be worn to a Halloween party."

HEADLINE: A Touch of College Life, But at $1,900 a Month;
34 Graduates of One Business School Wind Up Living at One Columbus Place

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Steve Audi, a 29-year-old investment banker with a 1997 M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, can pound a broom on the ceiling of his Manhattan apartment and communicate with two other 1997 Wharton graduates, who live one floor above him. And he discovered recently that he could speak into the air vent in his kitchen and talk to another classmate from Wharton, Nadine Orosa, whose kitchen is one floor below his. They could chat through the duct work, Mr. Audi suggested, and stay in touch.
Julius Sarkozy -- same Wharton class, same Manhattan apartment complex -- talks to a former Wharton classmate on the telephone in his building. If each of them stands in exactly the right place in their respective living rooms, they can see each other through their windows and wave. 
 New York is full of improbable tales, and surely this is one for the books. Partly by chance and the vicissitudes of a tight housing market, and partly because of the hiring needs of New York City's surging economy, 34 members, or about 5 percent, of last spring's graduating class at Wharton ended up living at One Columbus Place, an apartment building on the Upper West Side near Columbus Circle.
The residents of what they have come to refer to as Wharton House -- or Wharton North or the Wharton Dorm -- are the first to admit that there is something funny about dozens of them living in such close proximity. They are, in certain ways, all alike: a certain shared demeanor, an articulate, polished confidence, an inevitably bullish outlook.
"I get in the elevator in the morning and everybody looks just alike, and I look around and I think, 'That could be me,' " said one Wharton alumnus, Jonathan J. Lawrence, an associate at Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, an investment banking firm.
By day, they surge out in their conservative suits -- hunter-gatherers at the cutting edge of corporate Manhattan. At night and on weekends, they are once again simply young people, single, for the most part, and living in New York City for the first time in their lives.
"It's a nice social base," said Dominic Trader, a Minnesota native who took a job this summer at Goldman Sachs in lower Manhattan. "If you have questions about work or life in New York, it doesn't hurt to be able to walk up one floor, or talk through the vents in the bathroom."
No one planned this. Indeed, more than a few of the Wharton graduates said they recoiled in horror when they began to realize this summer what had happened -- that dozens of students' decisions, reached independently, to rent apartments here might reproduce the dormitory life they had just left. The building, comprising 729 rental units in two connected towers at Ninth Avenue and 59th Street, opened in the spring, just as final exams were ending.
"One group said it would be great to be near each other, another said it would be a bad thing -- that the last thing you need is a little Wharton in New York," Mr. Trader said.
But the timing -- so many apartments available just when they were needed -- was fortuitous, and word of mouth did the rest. Students who came from the Philadelphia campus to look for housing kept returning with the same dismal report, that apartments were scarce and expensive. Other graduates were drawn to the building by its technology -- it is one of the first new residential buildings in Manhattan to provide high-speed Internet service to every apartment. Rents were also fairly reasonable by the standards of the neighborhood, starting at about $1,900 a month for a one-bedroom apartment.
Officials at the Brodsky Organization, which built the complex, said that because of the location, near Lincoln Center, they had expected more tenants involved with the arts, or -- because of the building's technology -- with the so-called New Media industries of the Internet.
Instead, they got graduates from some of the top business schools in the nation. In addition to the Wharton contingent -- by far the largest M.B.A. group in the building -- there are about 20 M.B.A.'s from Harvard's class of 1997 and about 20 from Columbia. Because the Brodsky Organization got Federal housing money to help construct the building, 20 percent of the apartments were reserved for low-income residents.
The economy of New York also played a role. Nearly 30 percent of the 764 students in Wharton's graduating class landed jobs in New York City this year, tying 1994 as the highest percentage since 1990, according to the school. And those jobs were heavily concentrated in just two fields -- consulting and investment banking. That pushed the group together, too.
David Berdon, a strategic technology consultant who grew up Scarsdale and now lives in the complex, said he pops in to watch television with various classmate-neighbors in the building three nights a week or so -- something he couldn't imagine in any other New York apartment building. "And I have found myself more than once in my pajamas and slippers in the elevator going to watch a football game," he said.
But that easy familiarity and constant contact also breeds a kind of hot-house environment, residents say, in which "elevator sightings" -- who is with whom or who brought a new friend home the night before -- become grist for endless rounds of gossip.
"Everybody is in each other's business 24 hours a day," Mr. Berdon said. "It's sort of like freshman year in college: you know everybody's business, who's sleeping where and with whom."
In particular, said some of the dozen or so women in the Wharton group, many of the male classmates took on a kind of brotherly role that wasn't always welcome.
"They ask you where you're going, who are you going out with, when you will be back," said Margaret Pastuszko, a health care industry consultant who was raised mostly in Philadelphia. "It's both reassuring and annoying -- reassuring because there are always people around you who care, annoying because you're trying to get away from home and you can't."

HEADLINE: Courage on Trade

 BODY:
President Clinton accurately portrays tomorrow's vote in the House on "fast-track" as crucial to his ability to maintain America's leadership in world trade. A favorable vote would provide him with the authority to negotiate agreements that Congress can reject but not amend. But irresponsible political forces in both parties stand in his way.
Some House Republicans who favor free trade refuse to hand Mr. Clinton a victory without getting something in return, like an agreement to weaken his plan to develop national tests for students. Hostage-taking would be unworthy if it threatened a policy that means so much to America and the world -- not to mention an issue that is wholly consistent with Republican economic principles. 
 But it is Mr. Clinton's Democratic colleagues, led by the minority leader, Richard Gephardt, who are largely responsible for the President's troubles. Many know that fast-track is the right policy but are terrified of political retribution from organized labor. The same protectionist forces that opposed Nafta are engaged in the same fear-mongering argument that trade threatens American jobs. The claim was absurd then and remains absurd today, as is obvious to anyone who notes that the economy is operating near full employment. The purpose of trade is to put fewer workers in low-paid industries, like textiles, and more workers in high-paid ones like aircraft manufacturing. That, along with low prices that flow from foreign competition, makes almost everyone better off.
The opponents also argue that free trade will encourage developing economies to trample on workers' rights, including the right to bargain for better wages, and weaken their environmental laws in order to give their products a competitive boost. But the bill gives Mr. Clinton authority to negotiate sanctions against countries that lower their standards to attract foreign investors or affect trade.
The choice facing the House tomorrow is simple but momentous. It can succumb to needless fears and petty politics. Or, if it can summon up the courage, it can give the President the tools he needs to main American leadership in a global economy.

And Now, a Few Bracing Notes From the Land of Electoral Reality

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
The 1997 elections are over, and the American people have delivered a resounding message: Don't touch anything! You might break it! From sea to shining sea, the voters demonstrated their unshakeable determination to keep things exactly the same, right down to Christine Todd Whitman's election margin. The blessings the nation has enjoyed in the Age of Clinton -- plummeting crime, soaring stocks -- seem so inexplicable that the public apparently fears any tinkering, no matter how unrelated, might set the whole structure tumbling. If the fall of the value of the Thai baht could cause the Dow Jones industrial average to teeter precariously, who knew what might happen if Cincinnati said yes to a new elephant house, or the Navajos O.K.'d a casino? Voters looked at referendum options, progressive or reactionary, and came to the same consistent conclusion. Whatever was standing yesterday was good enough for tomorrow, be it assisted-suicide laws in Oregon or affirmative action in Houston or the right to bear arms without safety instruction in Washington. Leave it alone! Go play someplace else!
For those of us who missed voting for Dwight Eisenhower, it was a fascinating moment. So this is what the 1950's were like. No official was marginal enough to toss out and risk angering the gods of prosperity. For the first time since the Tea Party, Boston's Mayor ran unopposed. The Republican Mayor of Waterbury, Conn., got re-elected by a margin as large as Rudolph Giuliani's despite what wire reports called "claims he fathered an illegitimate child and snide suggestions about a recent meeting in a parking lot with a 25-year-old female city worker." "Smut doesn't work! The issues work!" cried the Republican town chairman after the results were in. (The issues, the Mayor said later, were a rising economy and falling crime.) 
 What worked, of course, was the nationwide impulse to let sleeping dogs lie. But inevitably, people who regard politics as something other than a spectator sport required a more expansive lesson, and most of them came up with some variation on the theme of taxpayer revolt. The best example of taxpayer rage, however, was Virginia, where a gubernatorial race centered on automobile taxes drew fewer people than the election of 1985, which was held while a good slice of the state was under water. Meanwhile, over in New Jersey, voters showed their gratitude to the Republican, tax-slashing Governor Whitman by burning her national aspirations at the stake before grudgingly permitting her to leave the office furniture where it is for another four years.
Speaking of national aspirations, Mayor Giuliani, clearly giddy over being the pundits' flavor of the month, delivered a re-election victory speech that was practically an audition for the 2000 Republican Convention. But what will his party make of his dramatic call for a society in which no one was left out or left behind? For voters in the Republican Presidential primaries, inclusion is a concern that resonates even less than automobile taxes. Except for law and order, the Mayor is a disaster on the social issues that drive the nomination process. He is in favor of gun control, gay rights, freedom of choice on abortion and welfare for immigrants. Are the party's Southern fundamentalists ready for a nominee who dressed up in drag and romped around in front of a roomful of cameras as "Rudy/Rudina" at a press club variety show? Although New York City appears very happy to leave private life private these days, Mr. Giuliani remains a politician who celebrates his re-election sans family, whose wife appears at the polls alone and cheerfully vows she will "continue to take good care of the landmark home I'm privileged to live in."
Mr. Giuliani's best chance of moving out of the local arena would seem to be through the U.S. Senate, where the Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan might prove an attractive target if he runs for re-election in the year 2000. But where would an urban Republican like Mr. Giuliani fit into the Senate, where his party is the voice of the West and the South, and its fundamental agenda is the moving of resources away from the East and the cities? Anyone who believes that the Republican Party has a real chance of taking root in urban America had only to watch the Mayor deliver his re-election speech from a crowded podium crammed with a careful mix of politicians of every party, gender and race, photo props memorable only for their uncompromising forgettability.
Meanwhile, the Democratic mayoral hopeful Alan Hevesi assured his supporters that the Republican occupation of City Hall was only "a temporary aberration from the norm." Mr. Hevesi was attempting to encourage the faithful, but for the hapless voters in one-party cities around the nation, it sounded more like a threat. He might as well have delivered a few bars of "Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide."

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Free-for-All: Behind the Hyperbole

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Here is what President Clinton and his aides say will happen if Congress fails on Friday to give him new power to negotiate trade agreements around the world:
America's leadership in the world will suffer. The growth of exports -- and the jobs they create -- will slow. Asian and European nations will speed up their invasion of Latin America, this country's economic backyard. Nations will refuse to negotiate with Washington. 
 And today, perhaps desperate to scare up votes that are still eluding him in the House of Representatives, Mr. Clinton even violated the iron-clad White House rule about never predicting Wall Street's reaction to Washington. Passage of the awkwardly named "fast track" legislation, he said, would have "a very positive impact on the stock market here and around the world," a statement that opens up the question of whether the bill's defeat could trigger another global sell-off.
Mr. Clinton's opponents, including many of the Democrats who have been closest to him over the last five years, are equally apocalyptic. Give President Clinton authority to negotiate successors to the Nafta agreement, labor leaders say, and wave goodbye to hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Wages will decline. Air and water pollution will choke the Western Hemisphere.
Could this much really be riding on one tortuously complicated piece of legislation? Especially one that only sets out guidelines for negotiating with other countries? Almost certainly not, the experts all say.
"There has been a lot of hype, as there always is when it comes to the crunch," said I. M. Destler, a professor at the University of Maryland who has chronicled Congress's efforts to set trade policy. "This time, the hype is on all sides."
At the same time, there is little doubt that the vote in the House on Friday will determine a lot about President Clinton's freedom to carry out the centerpiece of his foreign policy -- his drive to open foreign markets, on American terms, in the three years remaining in his term. And at home, it will determine whether Democrats and labor unions and environmentalists will be able to sustain a debate over what America's priorities should be when reaching trade deals abroad.
As in many debates on foreign policy in Congress, much of this is about symbolism. And the Administration is probably close to the truth when it argues that the rest of the world is looking at the fast-track vote as a sign of whether the United States will continue on its path of driving the world to liberalize markets or whether it will back away for fear of the domestic repercussions.
"The growth and stability of the global trading system are predicated on open and expanding global trade," said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, one of the global companies that have entered the debate in Congress to counter an anti-fast-track campaign led by labor unions. "And if the signal is that the process is going to stop, or be reversed, it would be a bad sign -- not only to other countries, but to every stock market around the world, at a very sensitive time."
The question Congress will be voting on is not whether Washington will stop negotiating trade accords. Mr. Clinton's "fast track authority" -- which gives the President the power to negotiate trade accords, then present them to Congress for a yes-or-no vote -- lapsed more than three years ago. Yet since that time the United States has reached more than 100 trade pacts.
But almost none of those agreements required changes in American laws, so they were never brought to Congress for approval. Most involved one-on-one confrontations with Japan or China or the European Union for market openings, the kind of negotiations that have replaced arms control talks as the theme of diplomacy in the 1990's.
The agenda for trade negotiators over the next few years, however, is more complex. There are a raft of agreements with the nations that make up the World Trade Organization -- over financial services, trade in telecommunications and computer services, and the endlessly hard-fought problems of opening agricultural markets -- that will require Congressional action. And Mr. Clinton knows that his hand is weakened if he cannot guarantee that Congress will not reopen every deal to protect a Boston software house or a huge grain conglomerate.
To his frustration, however, he has been unable to make the case that he should be trusted to strike those accords in a way that helps American workers more than it hurts.
The President's closest aides concede that Mr. Clinton's credibility was hurt by exaggerating the potential benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement when it was struggling through Congress in 1993. Academics dispute whether the pact hurt American workers, wages and the environment, or whether it actually had a negligible effect. But no one argues it was a blazing success.
So, without Nafta to brag about, the Clinton Administration's strategy has been to elevate the argument over fast track into a question of American leadership.
They have argued that America's economic success is a key element of its power abroad. "For a year now I've been hammering at the same message: trade happens," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States Trade Representative. "The only question now is who writes the rules. And I say America has never been in a better position to write rules than it is today."
Translating economic clout into diplomatic clout is a hard message to get across, however. And it has been made more difficult by the absence from the fray of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who has given two or three fairly rote speeches on the subject, but has hardly moved it to the top of her agenda.
Labor unions and others warning of fast track's dangers have an easier time making their case. Lori Wallach, who directs the Global Trade Watch operations of Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's organization, has constantly reminded Congress of "President Clinton's bait and switch on worker assistance and environmental programs" to ease any pains caused by Nafta. The Administration concedes many of those efforts were insufficient, but vows to do better this time.
"The real act of courage here," she said, "would be to admit that we need new, forward-looking ways to think about trade that puts the effects on workers ahead of the effects on, say, intellectual property rights."
But negotiations are by definition a two-way process, and success in that redefinition requires a willingness by America's trading partners to allow the United States to insist on changes in minimum wage laws and pollution standards abroad. That is not likely to happen soon and, of course, opens the way for other countries to seek the same here.

HEADLINE: Toy Market Sees Green and Purple Holidays

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
That annoying purple dinosaur has teamed up with Bill Gates, that first-time dad, to go interactive. Holiday Barbie has a dye job -- she is a brunette for the first time. And youngsters are bonding in a big way with electronic key chains that need to eat, sleep and study.
An unusually wide range of hot toys is on the market this year, including some updated classics and several newcomers. They are expected to make children's holiday wish lists longer. 
 Action figures tied to blockbuster movies like the rereleased "Star Wars" series and the "Batman and Robin" sequel are already vanishing from store shelves. Plush toys have made a comeback, helped by the popularity of Beanie Babies and last year's hit, Tickle Me Elmo.
"There are a lot of new things happening in the toy business, including the move toward interactivity, which is creating a renewed sense of interest," said Martin Romm, an analyst who follows the toy industry for Credit Suisse First Boston. "There are good basic toys and new components of the industry that capture consumer attention. The outlook is pretty favorable."
To be sure, toy manufacturers and retailers know that shoppers, who are often as fickle as their 2-year-olds, can turn a promising selling season into a loser. But this year, the industry is counting on the broad mix of popular playthings to keep merchants from pinning their hopes on a few standout toys that may be out of stock by Thanksgiving.
And with more for consumers to choose from, toy merchants hope to do better than the measly profits that have marred some previous fourth quarters, when they do more than half their business. That would also help reduce the number of costly post-holiday markdowns of duds.
Factor in the favorable economy and the stock market gains for most of the year -- recent market gyrations notwithstanding -- and toy makers and sellers are cautiously optimistic that this year's holiday sales will top last year's.
The Toy Manufacturers of America, which measures the value of toys shipped, said it expects to exceed last year's $14.5 billion by at least 5 percent. David Miller, president of the trade group, said if toy retailers' sales kept up their performance so far this year, the gain would be higher.
Michael Goldstein, the chief executive of Toys "R" Us, said, "This is the first year in several years that we have had a lot of hot items for Christmas." Parents are already lining up for Holiday Barbie, from Mattel Inc., and the newly interactive Barney, from the Microsoft Corporation.
The 16-inch stuffed Barney moves its arms and legs, croons 17 songs and plays games like peek-a-boo. But at $100, it is not cheap. For $65 more, buyers get a transmitter that allows interactive Barney to interact with Barney television episodes or videotapes. Additional software and videos can push the price higher.
"One concern is the price point," said Jim Silver, publisher of the Toy Book, an industry publication. "If you buy all of the pieces with it, you can end up spending $250, and that's not the type of item everyone can afford."
Despite the price, Mr. Goldstein said, "My prediction is it will be sold out by mid-December."
Of course, toy stores are selling as many stuffed animals that tickle, wiggle and giggle as they can, hoping to re-create last year's Elmo frenzy. One popular item featuring an Elmo pal, Sing and Snore Ernie, from Tyco Toys Inc., already has parents scouring toy stores.
"It started with many parents remembering last year's Tickle Me Elmo," said Kelly Disque, a spokeswoman for F.A.O. Schwarz, which has endured a run on the items. "Parents are trying to get in early to beat the rush."
High technology is also on the hot list. Anyone who has not heard of cyberpets must be living in a virtual world. Parents want to kill the things. Teachers have banned them from classrooms. And a company in Massachusetts is even offering free day care for them.
The cyberpets, which live in plastic eggs and cost about $15 each, are Tamagotchi, manufactured by the Bandai Company Ltd.; Giga Pets, made by Tiger Electronics, and Nano Pets, made by Playmates Toys. The creatures require almost as much care as the youngsters who cannot seem to get enough of them. Their owners must feed them, administer medicine if they are sick and clean up after them to keep them from going belly up.
The appeal of the less than warm and fuzzy devices? "There is the instinct to nurture," Mr. Miller said. "And while a round computer chip is not a nurturing device itself, it is an intellectual kind of nurturing. It's a nice marriage of technology and the 20th-century version of hugging."
The craze is such that Bandai has installed a pause feature on the pets to keep them from creating deadbeat parents out of youths whose devices die while they are in math class.
As for Holiday Barbie, which sells for about $35, consumers apparently like her new do. "The Holiday Barbie sells every year, and I think they just wanted to do something different," Mr. Silver said. "In the first weekend they sold over 100,000 pieces alone, and that was over a month ago."
Movie tie-ins continue to be big business.
"Hasbro is doing very well behind our three big movie properties of the year, 'Star Wars,' 'Jurassic Park: The Lost World' and 'Batman,' " said Tom McGrath, a spokesman for Hasbro Inc. "In particular, 'Star Wars' is red hot."
Part of the reason is the appeal to parents who watched the movies years ago and want action figures as collectibles, while their children simply want to play with them.
Not all toy categories are hot. Board games remain a tough sell. And radio-controlled cars are not big this time around. "I think some of the higher-priced vehicles are not as strong," Mr. McGrath said. "They are losing ground to the CD-ROM or hot movie property-type purchases."
Even the early favorites have a down side. Mr. Romm of First Boston pointed out that the industry could be hurt by short supplies of popular toys.
"The issue has always been for the toy companies making sure they have the good products in ample supply at the time consumers need them," he said. "That's clearly an important aspect which really puts a lot of pressure on toy manufacturers for on-time delivery, because it is a very narrow window in which they have to operate."

Sharpton And Coalitions Old and New

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
ALMOST from the beginning, Ruth W. Messinger was stuck between a rock and Al Sharpton.
To many white and particularly Jewish voters, Mr. Sharpton represents evil in a jogging suit. In their minds, he will be -- possibly forever -- the incendiary champion of Tawana Brawley and the man who labeled a Jewish store owner in Harlem a "white interloper." 
 To many black voters, on the other hand, Mr. Sharpton is a man who gives voice to the voiceless. In their eyes, he has grown and matured as a politician, and has earned the right to be taken seriously.
Obliged during the campaign to choose between spurning Mr. Sharpton, embracing him or trying to play at some coy combination of the two, Ms. Messinger opened wide her arms. By the last days of the race, she appeared all over the city in his company, frequently posed with him for the cameras and even printed palm cards featuring his endorsement.
Mr. Sharpton says he has no illusions about why she made the decision she did.
"Ruth always said she wanted my enthusiastic support," he explained in an Election Day interview in his former campaign office on Eighth Avenue. "In fact, she called me at home one night during the court battles over the runoff and said, 'You know we need to work together.' Some people on my side had mixed feelings, some people on her side had mixed feelings. People say, well, there are some Jewish voters who don't like Sharpton. But she was polling badly in the Jewish community anyway."
"It wasn't like she was here," he continued, raising his hand to the level of his forehead to represent her standing in the polls, "and if I got involved she was here," he said, dropping his hand to his waist. "She was here anyway. So the question was could I help pump her up on the other side?"
After two mayoral elections that were more or less explicitly about race -- Dinkins v. Giuliani I and Dinkins v. Giuliani II -- this year's mayoral campaign may have seemed blessedly to be about something else: crime and the quality of life, according to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, education and unemployment, according to Ms. Messinger.
But the results demonstrate that New York City politics, even when ostensibly focused on other issues, is still very much a matter of black and white. If you were white, according to exit polls, you were almost four times more likely to vote for Mr. Giuliani than for Ms. Messinger. If you were black, the figures were reversed.
Though she is a woman, Ms. Messinger got only 45 percent of women's votes, and though she is Jewish, she got only a quarter of the Jewish vote. By contrast, she received almost four-fifths of the black vote.
The results confirm on a city level what political analysts at the national level have said since the days of George S. McGovern: that the old urban alliance between white ethnic and black voters has given way to an almost reflexive antagonism.
Whether Ms. Messinger's choice to embrace Mr. Sharpton contributed to her defeat or prevented an even worse rout on Tuesday is tough to gauge. But almost certainly her choice and his conduct have raised Mr. Sharpton's standing in a party where even the short now stand tall.
GIVEN that Mr. Giuliani delivered his victory speech with several erstwhile Democratic stalwarts craning their necks to get into the picture, Mr. Sharpton can -- justifiably -- present himself as a virtual pillar of party loyalty.
"Now I am in an unusual position," he said, "of looking at some of my liberal critics and saying: 'What happened to certain union leaders and what happened to certain leading Democrats? You call me opportunistic?' I mean some guys and ladies that I absolutely thought would be out there with their unions and all I saw in photos with the Mayor. It wasn't Al Sharpton that was missing."
Mr. Sharpton said he believed those who deserted the Democratic party should be punished -- an ironic turn for someone who has rarely been accused of being a team player. And he argues that his loyalty -- and, more significantly, the loyalty of black voters -- means that he can expect to play a larger role in the party in the future, if not as a candidate, then as a broker.
"The Senate race is next year, the Governor's race is next year, and we're going to have our say," he said. "And we should. We've been the ones who have been loyal to the party. Should I now have to ask somebody who was either missing in action or on the other side, 'Can I come in the room?' I don't think so."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE TREND;
With Big Issues Absent, The Little Things Count

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
Forget the post-mortems about ideological shifts, Republican revivals or which candidate had the most money. The legacy of the off, off-year elections on Tuesday may simply be this: Think small.
The issues that ultimately drove this week's elections for governor -- automobile insurance rates in New Jersey and a state car tax in Virginia -- had never before been in the forefront of those states' politics. That they became such central concerns, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls, underscores two realities about the current state of American politics: Voters are relatively content, so elections these days are not turning on huge issues like unemployment. That has left room for issues that were seldom talked about even a few months before the election to rise to the top of the political discourse. 
 The success of narrow pocketbook issues is a nod to the strategy perfected by President Clinton in last year's election, when he seized on small but powerfully symbolic issues like school uniforms. It also reflects the waning of ideology in today's politics; it is a time when both parties are struggling to come up with defining issues.
"If the economy were in trouble, I don't think we'd see these issues nearly as dominant as they were on Tuesday," said former Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, a prominent conservative. "The population is pretty happy right now; people can afford to be concerned with secondary issues."
Advisers to James S. Gilmore 3d, the Republican who was elected Governor of Virginia, said they believe he won by an unexpectedly large margin over Lieut. Gov. Donald S. Beyer Jr. because he effectively seized on an issue that was potent with many Virginians: He vowed to eliminate the state's unpopular annual tax on cars and trucks.
In New Jersey, advisers to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said State Senator James E. McGreevey, her Democratic rival, came so close to ousting the popular incumbent because he also found an issue that incensed ordinary voters: the state's high automobile insurance rates.
Politicians and strategists around the country, Republicans and Democrats alike, said in interviews yesterday that if the economy held and there were no other burning new issues, the hunt for the small-bore issues might become a hallmark of next year's races for Congress and governor.
"You have to pick a particular burr under the saddle," said Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. "And I think Gilmore and McGreevey did it very effectively."
Mr. Dean said he would advise Democratic candidates next year to look for issues that touch voters.
"It will be different in different states," he said. "It could be hog farm regulations in Iowa, tort reform in Alabama and the Confederate flag in South Carolina."
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican who is up for re-election next year, agreed that the victory of Mr. Gilmore in particular was "a lesson for all Republicans."
"You've got to make the issues understandable," Mr. Thompson said, "so they can be internalized. A family could understand that if they voted for Gilmore they were going to get a reduction in their taxes on the car. People could internalize that."
Another attraction of these narrower issues is that they have a populist cast and can be easily understood by voters. And they meet the needs of politicians who, in these days of fiscal austerity, do not dare propose high-cost measures.
That there were hard-fought races over issues that had not been on the radar screen in Virginia and New Jersey also underscores a relative contentment among voters with the status quo. In both states, the exit polls found, voters were overwhelmingly satisfied with the state of the economy. And despite Mrs. Whitman's close call, the bottom line is that in New Jersey and Virginia and in Staten Island's special election for the House of Representatives, Republicans retained the seats.
In New Jersey, the exit polls showed, nearly nine of 10 voters said the issue of automobile insurance was important in making their choice for governor. And Mr. McGreevey won the votes of three out of four voters who said the high cost of auto insurance was the No. 1 issue. In an interview on her campaign bus the week before the election, Mrs. Whitman, said, "If there was something I could do differently, that I would go back and revisit, it was how we decided to address auto insurance at the very beginning."
In Virginia, there was no specific question about the car tax. But 83 percent of voters said taxes in general was the most important issue.
J. Brad Coker, president of Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research, which conducted polls in Virginia and New Jersey, said his research suggested that Mr. Gilmore would have had a tighter race had he not emphasized the car tax, and that Mr. McGreevey would not have been able to mount such a competitive race without the auto insurance issue.
Next year, Mr. Coker said, "you'll see a lot of digging and scratching for gimmicks that work with the average person. It should be a good year for focus group research."
John McLaughlin, a pollster for Mr. Gilmore, warned that candidates should not be too quick to seize on a taxation issue as a silver-bullet.
"They really have to be careful," Mr. McLaughlin said. "It really has to be something that benefits people. People have to feel you're sincere, and it has to touch people in their daily lives."
An example was last year's Presidential campaign, when Bob Dole's across-the-board tax cut proposal was not taken seriously by many voters because, polls showed, they feared it would be unaffordable.
The automobile insurance and car tax issues were not the only factors driving the voting in New Jersey and Virginia. In Virginia, Mr. Gilmore's election also seemed to be an endorsement of his Republican predecessor, George F. Allen, who was prohibited by law from seeking consecutive terms.
In New Jersey, another reason for Mrs. Whitman's close call was that many conservatives abandoned her for rejecting their issues. Most notably, Mrs. Whitman's veto of a ban on a type of late-term abortion helped drive up support for a third-party, anti-abortion contender.
"You don't stick a hot poker in the eye of your base," said Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign manager last year.
Given her bare victory, many Republican politicians yesterday spoke less of Mrs. Whitman as a future Presidential contender. One after another, they said they saw her instead as a future member of the Cabinet in a Republican Administration.
But former Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat who was wounded politically after he was almost upset by Mrs. Whitman in 1990, asserted in an interview before Election Day that the size of a winner's margin was not so important.
"I always believe if you win by one point, you're still the champion," said Mr. Bradley, who once played with the New York Knicks. "That's the way it was in basketball. That's the way it is in politics."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE PARTIES;
Evolving From Ideology Toward Pragmatism

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
The decisive re-election of a Republican mayor in a Democratic city on Tuesday was, for all its breadth and drama, something short of a sudden transformation of New York City's politics. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's election was more the culmination of a slow evolution that began 20 years ago: a triumph of nuts-and-bolts pragmatism over the ideology and party loyalty that once ruled elections in New York.
Mr. Giuliani was the first Republican to be re-elected Mayor since Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1937. He defeated Ruth W. Messinger, his Democratic challenger, by 16 percentage points, accruing margins that cut a swath across the city's electoral base. And he did it against a candidate whose history personified, almost to the point of caricature, the old-style liberal whom Mr. Giuliani blamed for many of New York's problems. 
 But for all that, Democratic and Republican analysts and elected officials said yesterday, it would be a mistake to view the election simply as the latest sign of the decline of the Democratic Party, or as evidence that New York is not as left-leaning as its reputation. If anything, Mr. Giuliani's election signaled something more subtle and potentially a lot more profound: that New York mayoral politics is moving away from ideology altogether.
Today, it is performance and pragmatism, more than ideas and party affiliation, that matter most in mayoral elections, analysts said. The shift became pronounced when Edward I. Koch took office almost 20 years ago. Even before that, though, other Democratic mayors were often less ideological than they pretended, notably the practical Robert F. Wagner, who ran the city from 1954 to 1965. And it was, after all, La Guardia himself, Mr. Giuliani's hero, who once declared that there is no Democratic or Republican way to pick up the garbage.
The trend has now been brought to fruition by Mr. Giuliani, who grasped and expanded on Mr. Koch's success. And based on conversations with Democratic consultants who are already preparing for the mayoral race in 2001, the next wave of candidates will likely try to position themselves more as managers than as party ideologues.
"It's the breakdown of old party lines," said Roy M. Goodman, the veteran Republican State Senator from Manhattan, reflecting a widely held view yesterday. "Performance counts. It's potentially a shift of tectonic consequences."
Mr. Giuliani, to judge him by his actions these last few years, is a Republican in party only. He is a Republican (and a former Democrat) who surrounded himself with Democrats at every opportunity during his campaign. He ran on the Liberal Party line. He endorsed a Democratic Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, three years ago and went to Washington to lobby on behalf of a crime bill pressed by a Democratic President. He attacked Republicans again on Election Night for trying to curb the rights of legal immigrants.
Further, while some political analysts have argued that the Messinger campaign represented the last gasp of liberalism in the city, that interpretation may miss the real point of the mayoral campaign. Jim Andrews, who was Ms. Messinger's senior campaign consultant, contended that Mr. Giuliani in effect co-opted liberalism, testimony to his growing political sophistication.
When Mr. Giuliani first ran for Mayor in 1989, David N. Dinkins undercut him by reminding voters that his Republican opponent had once opposed abortion rights, and by recalling his service to a Republican President, Ronald Reagan. By this election, Mr. Giuliani had established himself as firmly in favor of abortion rights, for gun control, sympathetic to immigrants and even, in the last weeks of the campaign, in favor of domestic partnership benefits for gay couples, a position that is quite far afield from conventional Republican doctrine.
As a result, Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the State Democratic Party, was hard-pressed yesterday to offer political distinctions between Mr. Giuliani and another politician who has always run extremely well in New York, President Clinton, a Democrat. "I think they're both part of a new generation of politicians who are seen as problem-solvers first and partisan operatives second," Ms. Hope said.
There is, of course, a partisan element to Mr. Giuliani's success in redefining the way elections are waged in the city. His aggressive efforts to reduce crime and welfare have already forced Democrats to alter their positions to account for the popularity of Mr. Giuliani's achievements.
Still, Mr. Giuliani made certain that the election turned on a debate over, in effect, how well he had run the store. Despite Ms. Messinger's best efforts, the discussion focused on issues that do not necessarily have liberal and conservative sides: Are the streets safer? Is the city more prosperous? Is its government more efficient?
And while some may be tempted to view Mr. Giuliani's re-election as heralding a major shift toward the political center in New York, that does not appear to be borne out by the facts.
Surveys of voters leaving the polls Tuesday and after the previous two mayoral races show no sign that New Yorkers are changing appreciably. People who called themselves Republicans made up 19 percent of the electorate on Tuesday, compared with 17 percent four years ago. Democrats made up 61 percent, up from 59 percent four years ago. Even as Mr. Giuliani won re-election, New Yorkers were solidly returning to office a Democratic comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, and a Democratic public advocate, Mark Green.
This new emphasis on performance in government -- and the push for smaller government -- has been to the disadvantage of Democrats in general, and Ms. Messinger in particular. Although Ms. Messinger tried to distance herself from her political roots during the campaign, throughout her career she was closely identified as a liberal advocate of activist government.
Manfred Ohrenstein, a Manhattan Democrat and the former minority leader of the State Senate, argued yesterday that this image was the single most profound problem facing the Democratic Party today.
"The election returns of 1993, 1996, and 1997 obviously show that the Democratic Party in this state at this point has not shown people that we can manage the government," he said. "And that's what we need to do. We have to convince the public that we are serious about managing four items: crime, quality of life, fiscal management and economic development. None of these issues are Democratic or Republican."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE MAYOR;
GIULIANI CREDITS MINORITY VOTERS FOR WIDE MARGIN

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani turned his attention yesterday to his second term, beginning the process of revamping his cabinet and claiming a broad mandate from New Yorkers, including increased support from many black and Hispanic neighborhoods that shunned him four years ago.
Mr. Giuliani, who on Tuesday became the second Republican in 60 years to win a second term as the city's mayor, made a campaign-style lap around the city during the day to thank voters in a voice still raspy from his final stumping of the race. At a news conference at a predominantly black church school in Queens, he sought to cast the election in historic terms, contending that his improved showing among minority residents was a sign of the breadth of his victory. 
 "The fact is the change in the minority vote created a difference between a narrow victory and a very large one," Mr. Giuliani said. "And I am very appreciative of that." The Mayor received 20 percent of the black vote, according to interviews with voters, compared with 5 percent in 1993.
While the Mayor eagerly offered his assessment of the election, he gave little hint of how he wanted to translate such strong backing into policies for the next four years, hewing to his strategy during the campaign of focusing more on his accomplishments than his plans.
The Mayor did say he was taking the first steps toward putting together a new administration, explaining that he was formally seeking the resignations of most of his commissioners. He exempted the five commissioners whom he said he was definitely keeping on, declaring that they had done outstanding work: Police Commissioner Howard Safir, Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, Sanitation Commissioner John J. Doherty, Correction Commissioner Michael P. Jacobson and the Commissioner of Investigation, Edward J. Kuriansky.
Mr. Giuliani said he expected that he would eventually reappoint most of his department heads after evaluating each agency's record, but his announcement added to the swirl of speculation surrounding the shape of a new Giuliani administration.
Most of the questions focused on Mr. Giuliani's four deputy mayors, whose resignation he did not request but whose performance he is reviewing.
One question is whether Fran Reiter will rejoin the administration after stepping down as Deputy Mayor for Economic Development to run Mr. Giuliani's campaign.
Her successor, Randy L. Levine, originally said he would work for the Mayor for only a year because he wanted to return to his job as chief labor negotiator for Major League Baseball, but Mr. Levine has not indicated in recent weeks whether he still intends to leave.
The Mayor's senior aides said he had not reached any decisions on his staff and probably would not do so for several weeks. And after a virtually unbroken week of barnstorming across the city and a heavy schedule throughout the campaign, some aides wondered whether their tireless boss would finally take a vacation.
When asked about that possibility at the news conference, Mr. Giuliani joked, "You want to get rid of me, huh?"
Mr. Giuliani seemed clearly pleased by the final results of Tuesday's election, which showed that the Mayor had won 57 percent of the vote, to 41 percent for the Democratic candidate, Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. The Mayor won every borough but the Bronx.
Turnout, though, was among the lowest for any mayoral election in recent decades, with 38 percent of the registered voters casting ballots.
Besides taking 20 percent of the black vote, Mr. Giuliani received 43 percent of the Hispanic vote, up from 37 percent in 1993, according to exit polls. His share of the white vote was 76 percent, compared with 77 percent in 1993, the polls said.
While Mr. Giuliani hailed his improved showing in black and Hispanic neighborhoods, an analysis of the voting shows that his base of support was similar to what it was in 1993. He received a greater percentage of the black and Hispanic vote, but the increase in the actual black vote was less marked because black turnout dropped significantly from 1993.
He attributed his failure to win a majority of black and Hispanic votes, as well as Ms. Messinger's success in the Bronx, to "traditional voting patterns," saying that people in an overwhelmingly Democratic city were accustomed to voting for Democratic candidates.
"This city has a very, very strong historical pattern of voting," he said. "And we haven't changed that, but we have made it much more competitive."
He added that though the turnout was low, he believed that the final tally reflected the overall views of the people. "I don't think the result in the election would have been much different" if every registered voter had cast a ballot, he said.
The parochial school that Mr. Giuliani visited was the Allen Christian School in St. Albans, Queens, which was founded by the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, a Democratic Congressman who was one of Mr. Giuliani's most prominent black supporters during the campaign.
In an indication of Mr. Giuliani's burgeoning national standing, Mr. Giuliani said at the news conference that he had received congratulatory calls from two Republicans who are considering running for President in 2000, Jack Kemp and Dan Quayle. And yesterday afternoon, Mr. Giuliani taped a skit for David Letterman's "Late Show."
Mr. Giuliani also spoke about the election in light of his predecessors, noting that his margin of victory was just below that of the last Mayor to be re-elected as a Republican, one of his idols, Fiorello H. La Guardia. He contended that he was relieved that he had not beaten La Guardia's record.
"I am kind of happy about that because his picture stands behind me and I don't want him to get angry at me," Mr. Giuliani said. "He's given me a lot of good advice."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: Man in The News -- Vito John Fossella Jr.;
City Hall To Capitol

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Within 24 hours after voters had transformed him from an obscure city councilman to the newest member of Congress, Vito J. Fossella Jr. had received three standing ovations from fellow House Republicans, been sworn in by Speaker Newt Gingrich and voted to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service.
Mr. Fossella's resounding victory on Tuesday over a Democrat who was seen as a formidable opponent landed the 32-year-old Staten Islander squarely on the national political stage. His election, aided by more than $1 million in assistance from the national Republican Party, was celebrated by G.O.P. leaders not only as a sign of the party's appeal, but as a harbinger of victories in next year's midterm elections. 
 "I want to be able to hit the ground running," Mr. Fossella said early this morning on a sunrise flight to Washington. "I feel a certain eagerness to get things in place, to begin doing the work I was elected to do."
Few would have predicted such a role three years ago when Mr. Fossella, then a 29-year-old lawyer who had worked in the mayoral campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani, won a special election to fill the Council seat of Alfred C. Cerullo 3d, who was appointed to a job in the Giuliani administration.
Conservative on a host of issues, from abortion to affirmative action, Mr. Fossella was one of just a handful of Republicans on the Council and seemed decidedly out of step with his colleagues in the heavily Democratic body.
There were few, if any, who considered him a contender for much in New York City politics beyond his Council position -- representing one of the city's most conservative bastions -- or for a position within Staten Island.
But that was before May, when Susan Molinari announced she was resigning the Congressional seat that had been in the Molinari family since 1981 to take a position as an anchorwoman on a CBS television program.
Championed by his primary political benefactor, Guy V. Molinari, the Borough President, Mr. Fossella mounted an impressive campaign against the Democrat, Eric N. Vitaliano, a 15-year Assemblyman, ultimately winning nearly two-thirds of the vote. Besides Staten Island, the district includes the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst.
In his three years on the Council, Mr. Fossella developed a reputation as a hard worker and an avid student of legislation, although he was not among the body's most outspoken members.
"He's smart, and he took the job very seriously," said Kenneth K. Fisher, a Democratic City Councilman from Brooklyn, "He's articulate, practical and a little judgmental. He hasn't identified himself with many larger issues that I can think of, except for the landfill."
Indeed, it was a bill introduced in the Council by Mr. Fossella to close the Fresh Kills Landfill, a 3,000-acre garbage dump on Staten Island, that provided him with his highest visibility.
"He got a lot of points on Staten Island for introducing the bill to close the dump," said Councilman Jerome X. O'Donovan, a Staten Island Democrat.
But Mr. O'Donovan, like many Democrats, questioned how independent Mr. Fossella would be of Mr. Molinari -- the Borough President refers to Mr. Fossella as a son -- and predicted that the new Congressman would likely be "pretty much another soldier in Newt's army."
Mr. Fossella shrugged off such criticism with a laugh. "Guy is a strong fighter for Staten Island, and I have a good working relationship with him," Mr. Fossella said. "Does that mean that I can't be independent? Of course not. When I have disagreements with him, or whenever I might have disagreements with the Speaker, I'm not afraid to state it publicly. But the fact is that very often we do agree."
In addition to his ties to Mr. Molinari, the new Congressman was a political protege of the late Michael J. Petrides, a member of the city's School Board and a Staten Island political strategist. It was Mr. Petrides who led Mr. Fossella to join the 1992 re-election campaign of Representative Molinari and, the following year, the mayoral campaign of Mr. Giuliani.
Vito John Fossella Jr. was born on March 9, 1965, in Staten Island and grew up in the comfortable, middle-class South Beach section. His father is a former city official who became a successful construction engineer, and his mother is a florist. Mr. Fossella, the fourth of seven children, was a basketball player at Monsignor Farrell High School, where he got his first taste of politics in the student council.
He attended Iona College in New Rochelle, then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a degree in economics in 1987. He worked as a management consultant with Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, then went to law school at Fordham.
In 1990 he married Mary Patricia Rowan, a second vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank. They have a 2-year-old son, Dylan, and are expecting their second child, whose due date was Election Day.
Politics has been something of a family pastime for Mr. Fossella. His father served in various appointed positions in the city administrations of Mayors Edward I. Koch and Abraham D. Beame, and his uncle, Frank Fossella, was a City Councilman for four years, until he was defeated by Ms. Molinari in 1985. Mr. Fossella's great-grandfather James A. O'Leary represented Staten Island in Congress, from 1936 until his death in 1944.
Still, Mr. Fossella broke with tradition by becoming the family's first Republican. "It happened when I was 25 and, even though I was a Democrat, I found myself voting more and more for Republicans," he said. "For the most part, my family reacted well. But still, I would love to have been a fly on the wall."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE SUBURBS;
Contrasts for Democrats Are Stark in 2 Counties

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
In the traditional Republican bastions of New York City's suburbs, Tuesday night's election tallies signaled stark contrasts in Democratic fortunes: a stunning victory in Westchester but crushing losses in Nassau.
Exuberant Democrats in Westchester were celebrating Andrew J. Spano's lopsided victory for the top prize of county executive, which he won by a margin of about 17 percentage points over his Republican opponent. They also made gains in the county's Board of Legislators. 
 But glum Democrats in Nassau County were licking their political wounds, having been swamped in their countywide races by ratios of more than 2 to 1 and having suffered the defeat of several Democratic incumbents in local posts.
"Westchester is a Democratic county now," said a campaign consultant, Hank Morris, "but Nassau is still rock-solid Republican."
For years, Democrats had been making inroads in both counties, but in different ways.
Westchester's Democrats had been gaining as changing demographics gradually tipped the county's voter enrollment in their favor until they now lead Republicans by 44,000 registered voters. But that underlying political shift had been masked as popular Republican incumbents like County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke continued to hold sway.
Nassau's dynamic was different. With Republicans holding a 3-to-2 enrollment edge, the Democrats made only modest headway picking up new voters. But through pluck and luck, they had managed to score victories at the polls to the point where they now hold 43 local offices, up from 17 in 1990.
The Nassau Democrats succeeded despite facing what is considered the toughest local Republican organization in the nation, the Nassau County Republican Committee, with its legendary party discipline, fund-raising capacity and fine-tuned field operation, complete with its own printing plant.
But on Tuesday, everything changed.
In Westchester, with Mr. O'Rourke retiring as County Executive, the Democrats capitalized on their new majority by electing Mr. Spano to succeed him.
But in Nassau County, it was the Republican organization that -- like a sleeping giant -- roared back to life. County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta rolled to a landslide re-election over his Democratic opponent, Lewis J. Yevoli, winning by 67 percent to 31 percent, and Mr. Gulotta's running mates did almost as well.
The Nassau Republicans ousted several Democratic incumbents, including a city councilman in Glen Cove, two North Hempstead Town Board members and a county legislator. They also won the Oyster Bay supervisor's post, from which Mr. Yevoli is retiring, and a vacant State Senate seat.
Nassau and Westchester are major political entities in statewide politics, and they have special symbolism to the current Republican hierarchy. Nassau is the home of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, and Westchester is home to Gov. George E. Pataki.
"The campaign to retake the Governor's office has begun in Westchester County," said the state's Democratic chairwoman, Judith Hope, after Mr. Spano won.
Westchester differs from Nassau, said Mr. Morris, the campaign consultant, because it has more urban pockets where Democrats have built more of an organization, and because it has more swing voters.
Recalling the Republican heyday in Westchester, Alfred B. DelBello, the only other Democrat ever to have won the county executive's post there, said that "when I came in," the Republicans had 50,000 more voters than the Democrats. His election was considered an anomaly.
But the Republicans have hardly conceded Westchester. The county party, headed by State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, who is no relation to Andrew, is still a major force. Several of its incumbents ran well on Tuesday, including District Attorney Jeanine F. Pirro, who was re-elected by a wide margin.
"What's happening is that sooner or later, the Democrats are taking over, but the Republicans still outspend them like mad," said Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College and a former Democratic leader in Westchester.
In both Nassau and Westchester Counties, personalities, issues, tactics, money and infighting all played roles in Tuesday's results.
The campaign of Andrew Spano's Republican opponent, Ted Dunn, never caught on with the voters. Mr. Dunn is the Mayor of Rye, but his patrician image as a Harvard graduate and retired millionaire from Wall Street did not seem to appeal to working-class Republicans or Democrats.
Although Mr. Dunn spent large sums of his own money, his negative television commercials drew criticism as being distorted, and they apparently backfired. The ads were prepared by Arthur Finklestein, a frequent consultant to conservative Republicans.
Another Republican consultant, Michael R. Edelman, said it was a mistake to use "slash and burn negative politics" in the suburbs. He said, "You can't, in an area that is so sophisticated and becoming more Democratic, present a politician who comes across as just being another mean Republican."
In Nassau, Mr. Gulotta, the County Executive, raised nearly $4 million and apparently spent it well, flooding homes with television commercials and mail. Mr. Yevoli raised only about $200,000.
Mr. Gulotta may have been unbeatable to begin with. As an entrenched incumbent based in Hempstead Town, which has a majority of Nassau County's population, he has cultivated countless civic groups over the years.
Four years ago, after big deficits and tax increases, Mr. Gulotta had a hard-fought re-election challenge. But this time, everything seemed to fall his way: an improved economy, more stable county finances, reduced crime, declining welfare rolls and rising employment.
Despite Mr. Yevoli's reputation as a tough underdog, he apparently failed to get his message across in the news media.
"If the old Lew Yevoli, the scrappy, energetic, tireless Lew, had waged this campaign," Mr. Morris said, "he would have given them a hell of a fight. Unfortunately, he retired before the election."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE GOVERNOR;
Whitman Pleased at Victory In New Jersey, However Slim

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman put the bravest and most optimistic face possible on her narrow victory today, saying that the election that almost ended her political career was, in fact, a triumph.
Her portrayal was clearly rendered with an eye to keeping her national standing in the Republican Party and maintaining her ability to lead the Republican-controlled Legislature in her second term. Both have been damaged by her near-defeat, political analysts said. 
 The first sign that Mrs. Whitman may face difficulties with the state's Republican legislative leaders came just two hours after she described her re-election as an affirmation of her record and the national Republican Party's tax-cutting agenda. And it came on the very issue that nearly vaulted Mrs. Whitman's Democratic opponent, State Senator James E. McGreevey, into the State House: the high cost of automobile insurance in the state.
The Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican, said he did not plan to push through Mrs. Whitman's proposal to reduce auto insurance rates, which she had promoted throughout her campaign. He said that he was not opposed to her plan, but that he wanted to look at other options, including a proposal that Speaker Jack Collins of the Assembly, a Republican, is working on.
Nor did Mr. DiFrancesco promise swift action by lawmakers, saying that he did not know whether legislation to reduce rates would be approved during the lame-duck legislative session later this year. "We could or we may not," he said.
At the town hall in Woodbridge, where he is Mayor, Mr. McGreevey said he intended to keep the pressure on Mrs. Whitman and the Legislature to reduce auto insurance premiums. He also said that he would "most probably" seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination four years from now. Page B4.
Although Mr. McGreevey was a virtual unknown in the state when he began this year's race for governor, he came within a percentage point of toppling Mrs. Whitman on Tuesday. With nearly 100 percent of the precincts counted today, Mrs. Whitman led by about 27,000 votes in the unofficial tabulation. She had 1,126,727 votes to Mr. McGreevey's 1,099,321. Murray Sabrin, a Libertarian candidate, had 113,836 votes, and all others had 65,338.
But Mrs. Whitman, using her own arithmetic, said today that she did not view the margin as a one-percentage-point victory. She noted that she is the only New Jersey Republican to win a statewide race since 1985. She also pointed out that Republicans make up only 20 percent of the state's registered voters and that President Clinton won the state by 17 percentage points last year.
"I am just extraordinarily pleased with what we did, that we turned around a 17-point plurality by Bill Clinton last year to a one point plurality for this administration, which is an 18-point shift," she said.
Mrs. Whitman said that she was not troubled that 53 percent of the electorate cast votes for her opponents. "I find it very rewarding that I am standing here as Governor-elect," she said. "It's only the people who don't understand the state of New Jersey that would think there would be some huge mandate. Would every governor seeking re-election love to be carried into office on the shoulders of an adoring electorate? Of course, you would. But that's not reality; that's not what happens. And it certainly doesn't happen in a state like this. This is a significant victory."
She also dismissed questions about whether the close contest may have tarnished her image as a national Republican leader and her future political prospects. "I don't care," she said. "I only care about the state of New Jersey. That's all I ever have cared about."
Each of Mrs. Whitman's three statewide races has been close. She defeated Governor Florio in 1993 by the same 1 percent margin that she achieved over Mr. McGreevey on Tuesday. In 1990, despite being outspent by a margin of more than 10 to 1, she narrowly lost a challenge to Senator Bill Bradley by 3 percentage points, wounding Mr. Bradley's national standing. When she was asked today if Mr. McGreevey may have done to her what she did to Mr. Bradley, she responded, "Gee, not at all."
Cliff Zukin, a veteran pollster and political science professor at Rutgers University, said that Mrs. Whitman's national standing, along with her power over the Legislature, was most definitely diminished by her poor showing at the polls on Tuesday. "People are going to take her less seriously," he said.
Mr. Zukin also offered another view of Mrs. Whitman's arithmetic. "The same forces that gave Bill Clinton a 17-point win should have given her a 17-point win: popular incumbent, chief executive, good economy, low unemployment, crime going down," he said.
Both Democratic and Republican national party leaders invested heavily in the New Jersey governor's race, hoping to help set the stage for Congressional and gubernatorial contests next year. The race was also closely watched by conservative leaders in the Republican Party, who disagree with Mrs. Whitman's support for abortion rights and viewed her struggle to win re-election as vindication that their beliefs are the direction in which the party should be moving rather than toward Mrs. Whitman's brand of moderate Republican politics.
But Mrs. Whitman said that the party was big enough to accommodate Republicans with varying views on abortion. "That's an important message for some people," she said. "But it's not the only issue on which people go to the booths and vote." She noted that prominent Republicans, like the former Vice President, Dan Quayle, who oppose abortion rights, campaigned on her behalf. She said that "sends a message that this party is bigger than that."
"We agree on 90 percent of the things and this party is bigger," Mrs. Whitman said.
Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, who is the chairman of the Republican Governors' Association, stood at Mrs. Whitman's side today to emphasize his point that her victory illustrated voters' approval of the Republican approach to government. He said that Republican victories in gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia four years ago were a "precursor of the tidal wave victory we had across America in 1994."
"The Democrats wanted to turn that around in this election, and that's why they put in so much effort in here," Mr. Branstad said. "Despite that, your outstanding Governor won re-election."
Today, Mrs. Whitman did not offer any specifics on what areas would be her focus in a second term, beyond the issues of auto insurance and high property tax rates, which also dominated Mr. McGreevey's campaign. She said that she would look to reduce property taxes by encouraging the state's municipalities to consider sharing more services and programs. On auto insurance, she vowed that she would keep her promise in this campaign to make sure that rates are reduced for drivers.
Even though her own party will continue to dominate the Legislature, after beating back a vigorous challenge by Democrats, she may have difficulty winning approval for any plan that limits lawsuits arising from car accidents. About a quarter of the state's lawmakers are also lawyers. The New Jersey chapter of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America contributed more than $350,000 to incumbent legislators in this fall's campaign.
She said that she was not wedded to her proposal, and planned to meet with legislative leaders next week to discuss whatever options they may have to bring down rates. Mrs. Whitman spent much of today taking phone calls from well-wishers and giving television and radio interviews.
By contrast, four years ago, Mrs. Whitman arrived at the State House on the morning after she defeated Gov. Jim Florio to announce that she was beginning work immediately on keeping her campaign promise to cut state income tax rates.
Mrs. Whitman said that she would outline her agenda for her second term in January, when she unveils her budget and makes her inaugural address and annual speech to the Legislature. She said that she did not know whether she would make any changes in her cabinet, but that she had appointed a transition team to help shape her administration.
Since New Jersey does not allow governors to serve more than two successive terms, she was asked how she felt about being a lame-duck governor.
"People better be a little careful of this lame duck," she said with a broad smile. "She's got four years to quack."

Trizec Hahn Adds An Office Building

BYLINE: BY CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Trizec Hahn Corporation, the Canadian real estate company, announced yesterday that it had purchased a 35-story office building in the garment district for $59 million.
The 605,000-square-foot property at 1065 Avenue of the Americas, at 40th Street, is Trizec Hahn's fifth commercial property acquisition in the metropolitan region since January. Trizec Hahn, like several other publicly traded real estate companies, has been on a shopping spree in the New York region in the expectation of a spike in office rental rates after a long recession in the market. 
 "Trizec Hahn continues to acquire well-located assets in improving markets," said Gregory C. Wilkins, the president of the company.
The company also closed yesterday on its $159 million purchase of Newport Tower, a one-million-square-foot office building on the waterfront in Jersey City, from The Limited Inc. and the Georgetown Company. With the latest deals, the company would own six towers in the New York region with a total of five million square feet of office space.
Trizec Hahn also is a bidder for the landmark Chrysler Building.

HEADLINE: Market Place: Red-Hot Revival in Real Estate;
Overheating Is Feared With Surge in Vulture Investing

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
In the world of professional real estate investing, no one is flying higher than Wall Street's vulture funds, which in the early 1990's swooped in to buy distressed properties whose values have since soared as the economy has recovered.
And no one is feeling more on top of the world than Blackstone Group. In five years, it has raised millions of dollars to buy real estate, produced eye-popping returns of more than 50 percent a year and snagged prominent properties including Worldwide Plaza, the office tower that occupies a block of Eighth Avenue at 50th Street in Manhattan. 
 Indeed, Blackstone has been so successful that big investors are flocking to the firm, which plans to announce today that it has closed a $1.1 billion real estate investment fund. With that much money at its disposal, Blackstone, which jokingly calls itself a stealth investor because of its low public profile in real estate, joins the ranks of Wall Street giants like Goldman, Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Colony Capital.
But for all of these firms, the air is increasingly turbulent. The rebound in almost all kinds of real estate, all over the country, means that there is far less carrion for the vultures to devour. Meanwhile, there is more competition for properties; money has been pouring into real estate investing, both through the private funds and through the public property companies called real estate investment trusts, or REIT's.
All of which is prompting some market watchers to worry that real estate may overheat even faster than is traditional in what has long been a boom and bust business. Although the funds are a relatively small force in the trillion-dollar American real estate market, they are a potent one, often serving as the catalyst that prompts other investors to move into a particular region or kind of investment.
The recovery in real estate is forcing the funds to adopt new strategies in their efforts to sustain the 20 percent or more annual returns their investors have come to expect. Not only are the funds branching out into operating companies, luxury hotels and movie theaters, they are also venturing even farther afield by starting to develop new projects from scratch. And the vultures are gaining a taste for everything from escargot to enchiladas as they search the globe for their traditional fare -- properties (or property owners) with problems.
"The way the business is moving now, you really have to learn to surf the wave," said Stephen A. Schwarzman, president of Blackstone.
He and other fund managers say their strategies have constantly been evolving to take advantage of new opportunities (which is why the funds now refer to themselves as opportunistic investors or opportunity funds, rather than vulgar vultures).
In the last year or so, "the nature of the investing has changed quite a bit, but it also changed in 1993 and 1995," said Owen D. Thomas, who heads the real estate funds at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. "In the early days, it was mostly distressed debt, then it evolved into more of a pure real estate strategy, and more recently it has moved to operating companies and development."
To be sure, the fund operators say that they are well aware of the cyclical nature of real estate and agree, sometimes reluctantly, that investors must scale back their expectations for profits. And even though they are developing vacant land and building new projects, the funds assert, they will avoid the excesses that led to disaster in the late 1980's.
"Because we all remember what overbuilding did, we are carefully monitoring supply and demand," said Daniel M. Neidich, chairman of the investment committee of Goldman, Sachs's Whitehall real estate funds. "The money available for development today is much more focused and cautious than in the late 80's."
The funds also argue that they seldom compete directly against the REIT's, which tend to prefer the safest and most stable properties. (Shares of REIT's, which are like real estate mutual funds for small investors, are generally traded on stock exchanges.)
"REIT's will buy everything that's chocolate or vanilla, but they can't digest rocky road," said Thomas J. Barrack, chairman of Colony Capital. One of his firm's strategies is to buy properties with problems, fix them up, and then, he said, "sell them to the REIT's at phenomenal numbers."
There is evidence that the funds are still managing to find bargains, at least compared with other kinds of investors. The vultures spent $2.8 billion on big office buildings in the first three quarters of this year, and bought space for an average of $94 a square foot, according to John Lyons, the head of Granite Partners, a New York investment and research firm. REIT's, which spent $17 billion, paid $126 a square foot.
Still, funds are now paying far more for buildings than offices fetched just a few years ago. And a decade ago, when values were similar to today's levels, according to the data from the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries, American real estate was heading for disaster.
"If you were to carbon-date the American problem, it would probably be in 1985 and 1986," recalled Richard N. Gunthel, senior managing director of Bankers Trust/Alex. Brown, a unit of Bankers Trust New York that both advises clients about distressed real estate and buys on its own account. "It seemed to Northeasterners that it was a regional dust-up in the oil patch, but that influenza spread through the country in a counterclockwise direction."
Much of the most speculative property ended up in the hands of the savings and loans that had financed it; once they went bust, the mortgages moved to the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government body charged with clearing up the mess.
That is where Wall Street first came in. Investment bankers started buying Resolution Trust loans in bulk for relatively little money, breaking up the blocks, restructuring the loans and selling them off. "Wholesale to retail -- it was a lovely game while it lasted," said Jeffrey W. Baker, senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, the big real estate firm controlled by the Mitsubishi Estate Company.
Pension funds were attracted by the returns Wall Street was getting, but that was not the only reason they favored the funds that investment banks started to raise. State and corporate retirement plans had traditionally bought buildings directly, or through managers who were paid no matter how successful, or unsuccessful, the investment turned out to be. For many retirement plans, this strategy has been a bomb.
But Wall Street set up its real estate funds the same way it structured funds that bought stocks or private companies. The investment banks had to put up some of their own money -- so they were at risk, too -- and they hit pay dirt only if the investment was very successful. (They typically take 20 percent of the profit off the top and a pro rata share of the fund's gains.) So the interests of the managers and the investors are aligned, as they say in the investment business.
More recently, the huge run-up in the stock market -- and its recent volatility -- have also helped fuel pension funds' interest in real estate funds. "What's driving it is some concerns about the valuations of financial assets," said Kurt H. Smith, director of real estate consulting for the Frank Russell Company, which advises pension plans.
But the amount of money moving into the funds and into real estate in general is making Mr. Smith and advisers like him a little cautious. "There's a risk with so much money flowing in," he said, adding that he was keeping an eye out for the return of "ego-driven trophy buyers."
Certainly, a lot of money has come into the funds, money they must spend fairly fast. The Institutional Real Estate Letter reported this summer that eight funds were trying to raise $2.5 billion from investors, and, all told, opportunity funds had $8.5 billion on hand, which, with borrowing, would allow them to buy $34 billion of property; that is more than the $29.8 billion of office building purchases in the first nine months of this year.
What kind of property? Luxury hotels have become popular of late; Blackstone recently bought four Swissotels, including the Drake on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, while Colony owns both the Stanhope, at Fifth Avenue and 81st Street, and a stake in the company that runs the exotic Aman resorts in the Far East.
Suburban office buildings have fallen out of favor, but towers in downtowns remain attractive, especially if they have some sort of financial or operating problem, like outdated facilities or big vacancies.
Investing in all kinds of real estate companies is a common theme. In the past the companies were usually in trouble, but today they may be healthy concerns looking to expand or to set up joint ventures with the funds to buy property.
Colony has probably gone farthest afield in terms of the kinds of investments it makes. "We concentrate a lot on businesses that use real estate, not just on real estate businesses," Mr. Barrack said, explaining why his firm bought a chain of movie theaters in England, a race track in California, and a stake in some duty-free shops in airports.
The lean-and-mean mantra echoing through corporate America is also providing purchases for the funds, as companies concentrating on their core missions decide to stop fooling around with real estate investments. Morgan Stanley, for example, recently picked up a development called the Woodlands from Mitchell Energy.
A few more funds are even venturing into new development, where both Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been active for some time. Together, they own Playa Vista, a planned community that is supposed to go up on the site of the old Howard Hughes airport, where the Spruce Goose was built (Dreamworks SKG, the new movie studio owned by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, is supposed to put its headquarters there). Colony is building a golf-course community for soon-to-be-senior citizens near Las Vegas, Nev., while Bankers Trust is financing a development of Western-style housing in Shanghai.
International investing is where many of the funds are pinning their hopes, even though, as Mr. Gunthel of Bankers Trust notes, a number of American firms that have tried it have failed. But others have succeeded; Blackstone, for example, this year bought Descartes Tower outside Paris, which is I.B.M.'s European headquarters. Latin America is proving popular, and funds have just started dipping their toes into the deeply troubled real estate market in Japan, where Goldman, Sachs recently bought a loan portfolio from a bank.
And just when all the easy pickings seemed to be disappearing, new opportunities may be about to open up from an unexpected quarter. The recent financial problems in the countries of Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and Malaysia, look likely to provide the vultures with some of their traditional fare.
"There haven't been any transactions yet, because everybody's trying to figure out the laws in the countries," reports John Coppedge, a senior managing director of Cushman & Wakefield in Hong Kong. "But I think it's going to happen."

Chart: "High Stakes Game"
Private investment funds, which scooped up distressed real estate in the early 90's and resold it at huge profits, have had to change their approach as the real estate market has recovered. With fewer opportunities for cheap investments, the funds have begun investing in other types of buildings and even developing their own projects. Here are some examples.
 
LUXURY HOTELS
The Drake in New York City is owned by Blackstone.
 
INTERNATIONAL
Recently, Blackstone bought the Descartes Tower just outside of Paris.
 
OFFICE BUILDINGS
Properties include the Citicorp Center in Los Angeles, which is owned by Goldman, Sachs.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Fluffing Up Warhol: Where Art and Fashion Intersect

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Andy Warhol, who died in 1987, remains one of the most provocative American artists of the postwar years. It is almost impossible not to have complicated feelings about him -- as a cultural figure he was as repellent as he was attractive -- but his influence on contemporary art and thinking has been immense and continues to grow.
Unfortunately, little sense of this importance is conveyed in "The Warhol Look/Glamour Style Fashion," the tame, patchy exhibition that opens tomorrow at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Far from distilling this artist's heady but caustic essence, the show offers a dose of Warhol Lite, a blandly celebratory view of his work that feels a little too much of a piece with the art world's recent and uncritical alliance with the fashion industry itself. 
Organized by the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh under the curatorial eye of Mark Francis and Margery King, the show claims a two-fold agenda. First, it sets out to examine the role that fashion and concepts of glamour played in shaping Andy Warhol's art. Second, it seeks to demonstrate how his art, in its turn, shaped and continues to shape fashion today.
To anyone with even a glancing familiarity with Warhol's work, neither thesis is much in need of demonstration. The artist began his career as a successful fashion illustrator in the 1950's. In the 1960's his personal style -- the silver hair, the sunglasses, the James Dean leather jacket -- had as great a public presence as his art. In the 70's, he was an integral part of New York's haute couture inner circle, presided over by tutelary deities like Diana Vreeland and Halston. (Warhol painted Halston's portrait; Halston used Warhol's paintings of flowers in his fabric patterns.)
This story has often been told, and "The Warhol Look" adds little to it but a plethora of incidental details. This is far less a show of art, in fact, than of cultural ephemera. For each of the handful of Warhol paintings included, there are dozens of magazines, snapshots, souvenirs and personal relics, most of them from the Warhol Museum.
The use of such material is always fraught with problems. It can often be illuminating when assigned to footnote status (as in the Whitney's recent Keith Haring show) and even essential when used to flesh out the career of an artist working in impermanent media (as in the current retrospective of the performance artist Jack Smith at P.S. 1 in Long Island City, Queens). But in this case, its overwhelming presence tends to make Warhol's output look thin and predictable, which wasn't the case.
The show's archeological bias declares itself from the start in a row of simulated department store windows in front of the Whitney's third-floor elevator. Two are re-creations of windows Warhol designed for Bonwit Teller in 1955 and 1961 (in the second of them he used his early Pop paintings as props). A third is a version of a Barneys New York display assembled by Simon Doonan in 1989 as a tribute to Warhol the compulsive shopper, and it has a welter of Barbie dolls, cookie jars, vintage porn magazines and designer-label shopping bags that Mr. Doonan gathered from flea markets. It has been meticulously reconstituted here.
In fact, few items in any of the Whitney re-creations actually belonged to Warhol. (The paintings in the Bonwit window are 1980's copies by the artist Mike Bidlo.) Maybe that's why the results have the slightly seedy, denatured air of ethnological displays. Yet even the wealth of authentic Warholiana that lies further on in the show has a similar feel, as if it were far removed from the artist's touch, transformed into the cool, systematic data of textbook history.
The problem is evident in the first gallery, labeled "Hollywood Glamour." There is, of course, absolutely no question of the formative, enduring, devotional role this ideal played in Warhol's life and art; his painted portraits of stars are camp versions of religious icons, with the mix of reverence and amused affection that implies. But little sense of that passion comes across in the dutiful lineup of items here.
Warhol's adolescent scrapbook of fan club photos is on hand, as is his vast collection of publicity shots of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, carefully arranged on the walls, and a couple of examples of the great Liz and Marilyn paintings from the early 60's hang nearby. But nothing gives off much heat, and the central placement of a 1991 Gianni Versace dress, which uses Warhol's Marilyn face, brings the temperature down even further, reducing Warhol's effect on fashion to a triviality.
The gallery documenting Warhol in the 50's is equally uneventful, with a selection of his elegant drawings and mock-ups of women's shoes surrounding a dummy dressed in a beige suit that he had custom-made for himself in Hong Kong in 1956. The point, for what it is worth, seems to be that when Warhol was drawing like a dandy, he was also dressing like a dandy.
The selection from the Factory era of the 60's has more bite, mainly because this was Warhol's most inventive period. The art he was making was extraordinary (though almost none of it is here), as was the persona he fashioned for himself, part waiflike E.T., part rough-trade punk. Judging from the show, these years, in which he established himself as an artist and filmmaker, saw his most innovative involvement with commercial fashion, and the handful of items here (a dress stamped Fragile Handle With Care; a blouse with an S & H Green Stamps pattern) give some idea of the fascinatingly perverse things he was up to.
It is in the next section, though, devoted to the theme of cross-dressing and the cosmetic refashioning of the body, that the show finally flickers to life. The material isn't exactly new, but it covers a span of 30 years and offers a focused take on the fluid nature of sexual identity, an issue crucial to understanding Warhol himself and fashion as a cultural phenomenon. The work ranges from drawings of drag queens made by Warhol in the 1950's to film and video clips of several of his gender-bending superstars, including Candy Darling, Holly Woodlawn and Jackie Curtis (seen in a hilariously raucous clip from "Women in Revolt"). It also includes a striking painting from his 1975 series "Ladies and Gentlemen," which was done in the format of Warhol's commissioned celebrity portraits but depicts black and Latino transvestites.
In the painting on view, pigment has been trowled onto the silk-screened face like a thick layer of makeup, echoing the alterations that Warhol was constantly making to his own features. For years he wore wigs to cover his baldness (several are on view here), but they were only the most obvious evidence of his lifelong experiments with changing his appearance and his sexual identity.
In a photo taken by a friend around 1952, he has worked over his own profile with pen and ink to reduce the size of his nose (he later had plastic surgery), and the same corrective process is the subject of his famed 1962 painting "Before and After," which hangs in the gallery. Polaroid self-portraits from 1981 show the artist posed in an array of Marilyn- and Liz-style wigs. And in a vitrine, one finds a sampling of the contents of the artist's bathroom shelves: a jumble of moisturizers, skin medications, hair removers, perfumes and makeup.
The words emblazoned on the gallery wall, "Drag and Transformation," could have been -- and probably should have been -- the title for the entire show. The idea of sexual mutability, with its implications of self-transcendence, is implicit in virtually everything else on view, and it helps define Warhol's most radical and subversive role, that of a homosexual artist who -- daringly for his time -- took the visual codes and attitudes of a gay subculture and recast them as mainstream art.
Exactly how that recasting took place within the context of early postwar culture and what its consequences have been are matters of considerable interest, and scholars are just beginning to address them head-on. (The art historian Kenneth E. Silver published a seminal essay in 1993; Hilton Als contributes a good one to this show's catalogue.)
In the 1970's, Warhol took heat both from the women's movement and from the gay liberation movement as a reactionary figure, one whose art perpetuated gender stereotypes and economic elitism. These accusations have since been rethought (without being resolved), but they can still be usefully brought to bear on any consideration of fashion itself.
One rarely hears such reservations raised in the art world today, however, and that's too bad. The current alliance between art and fashion bears every mark of being a marriage of economic convenience rather than one of shared sensibilities. The commercial art world, still feeling vulnerable and adrift in an uncertain time, gets support from a robust consumer industry; that profession, in its turn, picks up a little rubbed-off cultural luster. It's an exchange that should leave everyone feeling more than a little embarrassed.
Warhol, for his part, seems to have approached fashion, as he did every other aspect of his life, with ambivalence, from the position of a rapt insider who was also, at heart, an outsider, enthralled but unfooled. For this reason, among others, he is an artist whose career rewards close and repeated scrutiny. "The Warhol Look/Glamour Style Fashion" certainly has material on hand for such a project, and there's definitely a show inside this one screaming to get out. Maybe the Warhol Museum will go for it in the future, with a little more daring and a lot more art.
"The Warhol Look/Glamour Style Fashion" opens tomorrow at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, and remains on view through Jan. 18. Its presentation in New York, sponsored by Bloomberg News, is accompanied by "Fashion and Film," a film and video presentation organized by Matthew Yokobosky, associate curator of film and video at the Whitney, through Jan. 11. The Warhol show will travel to the Art Gallery of Toronto (Feb. 16-May 3), the Barbican Art Gallery in London (May 28-Aug. 16), the Musee de la Mode in Marseilles (fall 1998) and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney (winter 1998).

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Pound On Surprise British Rate Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against the British pound yesterday after the Bank of England surprised financial markets by raising interest rates.
The central bank had been expected to keep rates steady this month, given the recent turmoil on world markets, including London's. But the bank held to its anti-inflation policy, raising its benchmark base lending rate to 7.25 percent, the fifth rate rise this year and the base rate's highest level in five years. Britain's big commercial banks followed suit, raising their base lending rates. 
 The rise in borrowing costs comes after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, indicated last week that preparing Britain for eventual membership in a European single currency might involve lowering the current 2.5 percent inflation target. That would imply tighter monetary policy.
Mr. Brown told Parliament last week that there was no realistic prospect of Britain's joining the monetary union in the current Parliament, which could run until 2002. His announcement was attacked by business organizations, many of whose members want Britain to join the single currency soon to remove the sort of currency fluctuations that have hit exporters this year.
"It's clearly a very aggressive anti-inflation stance the bank has adopted," said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy. "This will give reason for doubt as to whether this is the last rate rise."
Indeed, expectations that the Bank of England would raise rates again spurred buying of pounds.
"The feeling is that the Bank of England may use this as a platform for many more hikes in the future," said Russ LaScala, manager of spot currency trading at Citibank. "This is a good buy zone for sterling."
Higher interest rates help the pound by making deposits and bonds denominated in it more appealing to global investors.
The pound rose above $1.69 before settling in New York trading at $1.6895, up from $1.6827 on Wednesday, and its highest level since July.
The dollar got a lift against the mark after a report showed new orders to German manufacturers unexpectedly fell 1.8 percent in September from August. The dollar traded in New York at 1.7234 marks, up from 1.7165 marks.
The dollar was little changed against the yen as concern that trade tension might arise outweighed expectations that Japan's economy was not performing well enough to prompt the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates any time soon. The dollar settled at 123.03 yen, down slight from Wednesday's six-month high of 123.07 yen.
In other trading, the Korean won fell sharply against the dollar amid concern over the country's ailing financial industry and as traders fretted that the authorities might soon abandon efforts to defend the currency.
"We see extreme pressure on that currency," said Peter Cera, an analyst with the State Street Bank in Boston. "We've seen a lot of selling. Their banking sector is very, very weak and we're in a situation where they may be running low on reserves. It's like going to the limit on your credit card."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Asia Drop Sends Shivers Through Builders

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Engineering and construction companies the world over salivated when Southeast Asia planned some of the world's tallest skyscrapers, the world's longest building, an Asian Silicon Valley, mega-scale dams, dozens of power plants, thousands of miles of roads and numerous refineries, railroads, water systems and airports.
But with Asian financial markets in turmoil and economic growth slowing, projects are being canceled or postponed, and construction companies are seeing one of their most promising markets shrivel. 
 A typical victim is the Fluor Corporation, which announced on Monday that its earnings would be well below expectations, in part because the Asian turmoil was making customers more cautious.
"I think 20 to 30 percent of the projects that are on the drawing board will be stretched out," said Ralph DiSibio, senior vice president of the Parsons Corporation, a privately held company in Pasadena, Calif.
Gary Prendergast, an executive partner at Black & Veatch in Kansas City, Mo., agreed. "There is going to be some pain," he said.
Just how much pain, though, is open to question. It is not clear just how bad things are in Southeast Asia, where governments are still wrestling with which projects to kill.
Most construction executives say they view the problems as transitory. They plan no layoffs, though they may slow hiring in Asia.
Stocks of construction companies have been hurt, although sometimes other problems contributed. Shares of Fluor, which has internal problems, fell more than 9 percent on Monday alone and now trade at half their 12-month high. Shares of the Foster Wheeler Corporation have fallen to about $32 from a 12-month high of $48.125, and Chicago Bridge and Iron is at $16, down from $23.625.
Other companies could be hurt as well, including those that build and own power plants, like the Southern Company of Atlanta or Edison Mission Energy, a subsidiary of Edison International, the Los Angeles-area utility. One such company, the AES Corporation, has said it will shift its focus from China to Eastern Europe and Latin America.
Southeast Asia was perhaps the fastest-growing market for builders of power plants, airports, roads, rails and water systems. The World Bank once estimated that Asia would need to spend up to $2 trillion on these projects over the decade beginning in 1995.
Still, each company's exposure is not overwhelming. Fluor says that 20 percent of its backlog is in the Asia-Pacific region. The Bechtel Group, which rivals Fluor as the largest American construction company, counts about 15 percent of its business there. But the Jacobs Engineering Group has little business in Asia.
So far, non-American companies have taken the biggest hit. Hopewell Holdings, controlled by Gordon Wu of Hong Kong, took a $647 million charge against earnings after the collapse of a $3.2 billion mass-transit project in Thailand.
ABB, based in Switzerland, took a $100 million charge after it lost the contract for the Bakun Dam hydroelectric power project in Malaysia, the largest project in the company's history. Nevertheless, ABB said last month that it planned retrenchments in Europe and would focus on the Asian market.
Malaysia also delayed an airport, a highway and the KL Linear City, a 1.2-mile-long building, billed as the world's longest, that would have been built over a river in Kuala Lumpur.
Indonesia postponed 14 power plants indefinitely and put 9 others under review. It also delayed two oil refineries, 29 toll roads and a bridge. Among the delayed Indonesian projects was a $525 million gas-fired plant that would be partly owned by the Enron Corporation of Houston. Among the partners in other postponed projects are Duke Energy, California Energy, Morrison-Knudsen and Unocal.
Most companies were reluctant to discuss what projects they were bidding on and which were canceled or delayed. But it appears that scuttling of projects already under way is not the big issue -- it is delays or cancellations of future projects.
"We have not seen an impact on our current activities," said James O. Rollans, senior vice president of Fluor, based in Irvine, Calif.
Fluor officials also contend that many projects are for private providers, not for governments, and will thus be insulated from some shocks. Perhaps Fluor's biggest project in the region is a $1.2 billion contract to build a power plant in Indonesia for Edison Mission Energy.
But even private projects could suffer in a downturn. The power plants sell to state-owned utilities, and Indonesia is expected to try to lower the tariff it pays for electricity. Edward R. Muller, president of Mission Energy, said his company had had no such contact from the Indonesian Government.
The Bechtel Group, based in San Francisco, had a petrochemical project in Thailand canceled and was actively bidding to become the contractor on one of the postponed Indonesian projects, industry executives say. Jennifer Gee, spokeswoman for Bechtel Asia-Pacific, said the company, which is privately held, did not comment on such matters but was still committed to Asia.
Many of Bechtel's projects are in the Philippines, where it is building the nation's first independently owned power plant and several office towers, and owns part of the Manila water utility.
Not everyone thinks the damage will be so bad. "I just came from a construction industry presidents' forum and I didn't hear a lot of discussion about it," said Richard Beumer, chairman and chief executive of the Sverdrup Corporation, a privately held concern based in St. Louis.
Ernest Bower, president of the U.S.-Asean Business Council, said the turmoil might have a silver lining -- promoting privatization of projects and development of capital markets in Southeast Asia. Both would be good for American companies in the long run, he said.
Survivors might also find competition diminished. A slowdown "will get a lot of people who frankly shouldn't be in the business out of the business," Mr. Muller of Mission Energy said.
Many executives said that Asian nations would find a way to finance the projects because they were essential for further economic growth and because their people were demanding better life styles.
"Those genies are out of the bottle," Mr. DiSibio of Parsons said. "They aren't going to go back." He also said China's market would "dwarf all that's happening in the Far East today."
Michael S. Dudas, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York, said that "Asia exposure is manageable" for global companies. With stock prices dropping so much, he recommends shares of Foster Wheeler and Chicago Bridge and Iron.
But Tobias M. Levkovich of Smith Barney Inc., who downgraded all the stocks in the group on Sept. 4, said: "We're not ready to step in yet. The market is pretty fluid."

HEADLINE: Companies Reported Spending More on Research

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Pushing to develop new products, or new twists on old ones, American companies increased their spending on research to $118.65 billion last year, 9 percent more than in 1995, the National Science Foundation reported yesterday. Another big jump is projected for this year as companies seek to sustain sales by offering something new to consumers.
But while companies spent more from their own pockets, the Federal subsidies they received for research fell slightly, to $20.9 billion, as they have almost every year in this decade. And while corporate outlays to develop new products took a big jump, spending on basic research has held steady at $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion a year through the 1990's, the science foundation said. As a percent of the total, it declined in 1996. 
 For 1997, the science foundation projected $130.6 billion in corporate outlays for research and development, a 10 percent rise, while the Federal research subsidy, a victim of budget cutting, is expected to fall slightly, to $20.8 billion.
Basic research is a weak link in this picture. Some economists argue that without more spending on basic research, new-product development will eventually suffer. The foundation defines basic research as an attempt to gain more comprehensive scientific knowledge "without specific product applications in mind." It is the sort of discovery process that at Bell Labs resulted in the invention of the transistor, a breakthrough technology that in turn made possible a host of new products. Most new-product development relies now on existing technologies, an approach that has not yet slowed the flow of new salable products.
"The sense that I have, in terms of working with companies, is an awakening awareness that we can grow significantly in sales volume and earnings per share through product R & D," said Stanley Jaskolski, chief technology officer at the Eaton Corporation, and president of the Industrial Research Institute, a trade association.
Eaton, for example, a Cleveland-based manufacturer of truck transmissions and other parts, recently began to market an anti-collision radar device, mounted on trucks, and is developing a miniature camera on a chip that would replace rear view mirrors, flashing on dashboard screens scenes that drivers now rely on mirrors to see. Both products are based on existing technologies.
The institute also says that its members are increasingly financing basic research at universities, while cutting back this work at corporate laboratories.
Corporate spending on research and development is heaviest in pharmaceuticals and electronics and has fluctuated with the business cycle. The $118.6 billion outlay last year compared with $108.7 billion in 1995 and $97.1 billion in 1994.

Despite Sluggish Sales, Toyota Earnings Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that earnings rose in the fiscal first half as cost cuts, growing exports to the United States and Europe, and the weaker yen made up for slack sales in Japan.
The auto maker's vice chairman, Iwao Isomura, said there was no sign that Japanese consumers' appetite for cars had begun to rebound. "I'm annoyed," he said. "Conditions are ripe for a recovery in demand, yet sales remain so sluggish." 
 The Japanese Government needs to do more to help the economy, Mr. Isomura said, and Toyota itself is trying to spur sales by introducing new cars and increasing spending on sales incentives.
Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker, is also being hurt by Thailand's economic crisis. It is the biggest seller of cars in that country, accounting for 30 percent of the market.
Toyota said yesterday that it would halt production at its two Thai factories from mid-November to at least the end of the year because of poor demand.
Toyota's pretax profit increased 26 percent in the half ended Sept. 30, to 324.56 billion yen, or $2.6 billion, from 258.50 billion yen a year earlier. Net income grew 43 percent, to 187.56 billion yen from 131.50 billion yen.
Reflecting an accounting change, sales fell 7 percent, to 3.798 trillion yen from 4.083 trillion yen. Toyota said sales would have risen a few percentage points if not for the change.
The results were for the parent company only. Toyota will report results for the complete corporate group later.
The earnings were announced after the end of today's stock trading in Tokyo, during which Toyota rose 30 yen, to 3,330 yen.
Toyota is hardly the only foreign auto maker to be experiencing problems in Thailand. The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation said today that the Thai currency's plunge had resulted in a foreign-exchange loss of 34 billion yen, or $276 million, on money it borrowed to pay for an aggressive expansion drive in Thailand.
Mitsubishi forecast that the foreign-exchange loss would result in a group net loss of 40 billion yen in the current fiscal year, which ends March 31.
Stephen Volkmann, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd., said that "it shouldn't be a big surprise that Thailand has become an expensive problem" for Mitsubishi, given that the company had made significant investments there.
Like Toyota, Mitsubishi is also struggling with weak demand in Japan. And last week, its president and chairman said they would step down because of the company's involvement in a scandal involving payoffs to racketeers.
Mitsubishi made its announcement after stock trading had ended. During the session, the company gained 16 yen, to 500 yen.
In another corporate development in Japan today, an index of Japanese bank shares fell to its lowest level in eight years, declining 2.9 percent, because of concern that a securities firm's filing for bankruptcy protection this week could add to the banks' bad-loan burdens.
The securities firm, the Sanyo Securities Company, filed for court protection from creditors on Monday.
Ken Tsubouchi, general manager of the Nomura Asset Management Company, said, "The fear is that since bankruptcies are on the rise, and banks have to foot the bill, one day it'll be too much for them to bear."

Army Outpost At Crossroads Has New Foes

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
NAME the cause, and it's better than even money that it has ignited a demonstration outside the armed forces recruiting station that sits on a traffic island in Times Square.
Usually, it is a foreign-policy issue that attracts protesters to the booth, as the station at West 43d Street is commonly called. Wars have naturally got the juices flowing, from Vietnam to the Persian Gulf, but so have lesser blips on the we're-mad-as-hell screen. 
 While these self-satisfied times aren't producing many protests, the 360-square-foot station is hardly off the hook. The terrain has shifted for New Yorkers wanting to give the booth the boot from the perch it has occupied for half a century.
One critic is Thomas K. Duane, an openly gay Councilman from Manhattan, who is unhappy with the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy requiring soldiers to keep their homosexuality to themselves. Since a city human rights law forbids New York from doing business with anyone who discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, Mr. Duane says that no exception should be made for the military and its occupation of a precious piece of real estate -- rent-free, at that.
The Times Square Business Improvement District can also think of better uses for the space, though it has not offered specifics. Nothing against tradition or the armed forces, said Gretchen Dykstra, the BID's president. "All of that history is wonderful," she said. But bidness is bidness, as they would say in the South. "We want it relocated," Ms. Dykstra said.
In truth, the recruiting station is likely to stay put for a while. Transportation Commissioner Christopher R. Lynn, who has jurisdiction over the traffic island, sympathizes with Mr. Duane on the "don't ask, don't tell" issue; he is openly gay himself. But he has also noted that the booth has been on the site for a long time and that the military is a way out of poverty for many young New Yorkers.
The issue probably won't die. Mr. Duane plans to rally public support and hold a Council hearing, an aide said, and the Councilman could not be more emphatic on the matter. "There's no reason why we should let such a symbol of bigotry occupy one of the most valuable pieces of real estate in the country," he said in September.
With Veterans Day approaching, perhaps it will not be deemed an offense against human rights to observe that whatever the military's failings may be, it is for many a good deal more than a symbol of bigotry. Try a symbol of national purpose.
R. Andrew Shore, a Manhattan lawyer, was sufficiently troubled last year by an editorial calling for the booth's removal that he wrote to this newspaper to say that "ending the armed forces' presence would banish some history, and a small bit of romance, from the crossroads of the world." Contacted this week, Mr. Shore did not want to get into the question of gay people in the military. But he was not alone among New Yorkers in describing the station as nothing less than "a symbol of the sacrifices that America made for the world in the 20th century."
It is also more active than some people might realize. "This is the most heavily trafficked walk-in station in the country," said Lieut. Col. John H. Bullock Jr., commander of the Army's New York City Recruiting Battalion.
THESE are good days for recruiters in the city, perhaps in part because unemployment here is 9.3 percent, nearly twice the national average. Colonel Bullock's battalion has far exceeded its quota -- its "mission," in Army jargon -- and the trend is conspicuous in Times Square, where 34 people were signed up in the past year, compared with a target of 14.
Those numbers, while not vast, are more than solid, said Staff Sgt. Lary Ruiz, the Army recruiter in Times Square. "This station is considered a powerhouse," he said. "We get young people coming in. We also get people who work in the area and are looking to change their life."
The booth itself could stand a change. It looks a little sad these days, its shabbiness made all the more conspicuous by the Disneyfication taking place around it.
Eliot Goldman, a lawyer in the area, has contacted the Army to suggest renovation ideas. "If you destroy that recruiting station, you destroy the essence of Times Square," he said, adding that the island has also long been a New York "speaker's corner." Political protest and the booth have gone hand in hand for decades.
"It serves as a rallying point," he said. "It even gives Duane a soapbox and a place to have rallies."

Price of Long Bond Rises a Bit as Auctions Stir Demand

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury bonds with long maturities bounced back from early weakness yesterday to finish higher for a second day, after the Government's quarterly debt refunding concluded with strong demand. Shorter maturities lagged, however, and ended the session mixed.
The 30-year bond rose 17/32, to a price of 102 19/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.18 percent, from 6.22 percent on Wednesday. 
 There were two Government auctions yesterday -- one of 52-week bills, the other of 30-year bonds. Dealers first pushed yields higher in the market to make sure that the new securities would be more attactive to investors. Market participants were also cautious before today's employment report for October.
In the auctions, traders saw decent demand as jitters continued in the equity markets, making Treasuries more attractive because of their relative safety. Small investors were said to be doing much of the buying in the bill auction.
In the first auction, the Treasury sold $12 billion of new 52-week bills at an average rate of 5.14 percent. In the final leg of the Government's quarterly refunding, $10 billion of a new 30-year issue was priced to yield an average of 6.201 percent.
Jack Ablin, executive vice president and head of the fixed-income department of Barnett Capital Advisors Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla., considered the auction results strong. "It's going to pave the way for solid total returns going forward in the bond market," he said.
Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com in Menlo Park, Calif., said that demand during the auction from domestic accounts was better than expected.
He noted, however, that the 30-year sale was the better of the two auctions. The bid-to-cover ratio, representing the total number of bids compared with the total amount of the auction, was 2.82 to 1, a very strong level, for the 30-year bond.
"Over the last 12 long-bond auctions," he said, "the bid-to- cover ratio has averaged 2.42 to 1. Today's ratio was the best in 10 years."
The market is now focused on the release of the October employment report. The consensus among economists is that the number of jobs added to American payrolls last month was about 200,000, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.9 percent. But Mr. Jones said he believed that even a relatively strong report might have a muted effect on the market.
"Until certain issues are resolved about effects of the Asian crisis on the U.S., yields of Government securities are not expected to venture far from where they are now over the short term," he said.
Treasuries with shorter maturities were weighed down yesterday by a surprise interest-rate increase overnight by the Bank of England. The central bank lifted its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 7.25 percent.
The Treasury market interpreted the move as a reminder that economic growth exceeding long-term trend levels keeps central bankers inclined to tighten monetary policy.
The following are the results of yesterday's bill and bond auctions:

HEADLINE: Havana Journal;
Castro's Cigar, a Namesake, and Smell of Trouble

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
There may be times when, as Freud said, a cigar is just a cigar. But when the cigar in question happens to be a Cohiba, that is surely not the case.
To Cubans, Cohibas are a symbol of revolution because they were first made for Fidel Castro and remained his favorite cigar until he gave up smoking. On Wall Street, on the other hand, they have become one of the most visible badges of material success, so cherished by tobacco lovers that Cigar Aficionado magazine recently compared a Cuban-made Cohiba to "a superb main course at a Michelin three-star restaurant." 
 But now the company that has made Cohibas here since the mid-1960's finds itself in a dispute with an American competitor that is selling a cigar with the same name and a similar logo. And as might be expected, Cuban officials are fuming, dismissing the Cohiba marketed in the United States as an inferior product that damages the reputation of the entire Cuban cigar industry.
"We think it is cheating the consumer," said Adargelio Garrido de la Grana, a lawyer for Habanos S.A., the Cuban Government's cigar export corporation. "What a mixture!" he snorted, scorning the rival Cohiba's composition, which includes tobacco grown in the Dominican Republic, Indonesia and Cameroon. "It sounds like a real cocktail."
Because of the 36-year-old American economic embargo against Cuba, Cohibas made here cannot be legally imported into the United States. But the strategy of both parties to the dispute suggests that they may be looking to the day when the embargo and the Helms-Burton Act, which last year tightened restrictions on Cuban commerce, are lifted and products made here can again be sold in the American market.
General Cigar Holdings Inc., a New York-based company, says it began using the Cohiba name in the United States as early as 1978. But it was not until this year that lawyers for Habanos formally challenged that trademark, saying its property, which takes its name from an Indian word for tobacco, had been illegally expropriated.
"It is very disconcerting that a serious company would try to appropriate the name of one of the most famous and sought-after cigars in the world by taking advantage of the inability of Habanos to enter the U.S. market," said Ana Lopez, the Cuban company's marketing director.
She described the rival Cohiba as "a fraud" that "neither offers the superior characteristics of the Habanos Cohiba nor compares with the quality of any other Cuban brand."
But A. Ross Wollen, a lawyer and senior vice president for General Cigar, said his company had acted entirely properly, and predicted that the United States Patent and Trademark Office would eventually reject the Cuban complaint, which is still pending. "We registered the name Cohiba 20 years ago, but it has had limited distribution until now," Mr. Wollen said. "Internationally, most people associate Cohiba with the Cuban cigar," he added, but "we do not intend to sell our cigar internationally. We are happy to be selling it in the United States."
Mr. Wollen also denied Cuban accusations that General Cigar was trying to deceive smokers. "Our packaging is different from the Cuban Cohiba, so we don't think consumers are confused," he said. "It is very clear in our advertisements and promotions that our cigar is made in the Dominican Republic."
But because of what the Cohiba name signifies here and around the world, the dispute has overtones that are as much political as commercial.
"Cohiba is a fruit of the Cuban revolution, and as such our most precious jewel," said Francisco Linares Calvo, president of Habanos.
In fact, Cohibas were initially produced seven years after the 1959 Cuban revolution brought Mr. Castro to power. According to a history published by the company early this year, a cigarmaker-turned-soldier began rolling cigars for a friend who was one of Mr. Castro's bodyguards. The bodyguard soon began sharing the cigars with his boss, who loved their flavor and asked for more.
At first, Mr. Castro reserved them for his own use and that of close associates, but eventually he began handing out Cohibas as gifts to heads of state and other foreign visitors, giving the brand international renown.
Habanos acknowledges that it did not begin mass selling of Cohibas until 1981. But it argues that since Cohibas were sold here in limited amounts in the 1970's on Cubana Airline flights and in special hard currency shops for foreigners, that should be enough to establish commercial marketing of the brand before General Cigar's registration.
Cuban officials also maintain that the American company was able to lay claim to the Cohiba brand name only because the economic embargo prevented them from registering the trademark in the United States. Experts say that while that argument is not likely to stand up in litigation, General Cigar's behavior raises other questions.
"The bottom line is that this does run counter to fairness," said Pamela S. Falk, author of the book "Cuban Foreign Policy" (Simon and Shuster) and Professor of International Trade and Commercial Transactions at the City University of New York School of Law. "According to international treaties, you can't take a name that is famous and has been commercially marketed and claim it as your own."
On the other hand, she added, the fundamental issue "in terms of the law is registration, so it is very unlikely the Cubans can win this one," since they "inexplicably failed to register in the United States a trademark they had registered in all sorts of other countries."
The dispute comes as Cuba has embarked on a major effort to increase tobacco production and cigar exports. Production in 1996 was about 70 million cigars, which earned Cuba more than $100 million.
Habanos declined to disclose any revenue or profit figures from the 11 varieties of Cohiba cigars it now makes. But conversations with workers during a tour of one of its factories here made it clear that the line is very lucrative.
Workers, none of whom wanted to be identified by name, said nearly all of them earn a base wage of $7 to $8 a month. A single Cohiba Esplendido cigar, in contrast, retails here for twice that amount, and can fetch up to $50 on the black market in the United States, compared with $15 for one of the rival Cohiba's Churchills.
As a result, the streets of Havana are full of hucksters trying to sell what they claim are boxes of Cohibas smuggled by employees from factories here. Most of what they offer turns out to be a low grade imitation of the Cohiba, but some, the workers themselves admit, is not.
"They steal from us," one employee said, complaining about the low wages paid by the state-owned company. "So we steal from them."

HEADLINE: 3 Aid Groups For Refugees Are Charged With Fraud

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 6

 BODY:
To the unemployed refugees who were its clients, the Albanian American Civic Association in the Bronx seemed to offer a much-needed helping hand. When they visited its storefront on Astor Avenue, they would receive stacks of brochures, chat with a "job developer" and fill out detailed forms. Then they would go home to await calls for job interviews.
Those calls never came, state investigators said. Instead, the association filed forms in 1996 fraudulently claiming to have placed two dozen refugees in jobs, in order to receive $20,000 in state funds. Yet none of the refugees received so much as a job referral, the investigators said. 
 Today, the association's job developer, Gasper Kalaj, was charged with one count of third-degree grand larceny and 22 counts of first-degree falsifying of business records, and its job placement contract was suspended by the state. Repeated calls to the association's office were unanswered.
The Albanian group was one of three immigrant-aid organizations accused today by the State Office of the Welfare Inspector General of making false job placement claims. In a 40-page report, the inspector general recounted how the groups fabricated placement records using forged letterheads, falsified signatures and fake addresses to justify receiving a total of $160,000 in state and Federal funds last year.
The inspector general, Paul Balukas, said that lax oversight by the state and the nonprofit organization it had hired to manage the placement program -- the Church Avenue Merchants Block Association in Flatbush, Brooklyn -- made it likely that the fraud his office had uncovered was being repeated across the city.
Dan Hogan, a spokesman for the State Office of Temporary Assistance, which runs the refugee job placement program, said that the three organizations had been chosen by the state and not by the Church Avenue Merchants Block Association. But he said the state had expected the merchants group to assist in overseeing the groups. The state has asked the merchants association to return $75,000, the total it feels is owed for the fraudulent cases.
Kathleen Masters, general counsel for the merchants association, said she had not seen the report and could not comment on it.
A second group accused of doctoring its records, the Vietnamese American Cultural Organization on Baxter Street in Manhattan, which had a grant of $34,000, falsely claimed successful job placements in 20 out of 37 cases reviewed by the inspector general. The investigators contend that the group forged letterhead stationery in several of those cases.
But the group's executive director, Joseph Hien, said the organization was forced to falsify documents because Chinatown restaurant owners were paying the refugees in cash off the books and had refused to sign letters acknowledging their employment. But he said the job development officer, Tony Pham, had been dismissed for falsifying documents.
The third group, the Association of Engineers and Scientists in Manhattan, which had a $105,000 grant, took credit for finding jobs for 36 people who in fact already had jobs when they visited the group's John Street office, the inspector general said. A person who answered the telephone at the group's office said no one was available to comment.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Jump to 2-Month High

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The number of United States workers applying for state unemployment benefits jumped last week to the highest level in two months, a sign that job growth may be losing momentum.
First-time jobless claims rose by 16,000, to a seasonally adjusted 315,000 in the week that ended last Saturday, the Labor Department said. That is the highest level since the week that ended on Aug. 30, when claims totaled 325,000, and above analysts' expectations that claims rose by 8,000 last week to 305,000. 
 Still, the total level of new claims has remained at or below 315,000 for nine weeks -- a stretch not matched since early 1989. "The demand for labor is still very strong, and we're seeing obvious constraints on the supply side," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., before today's report.
In the previous week, claims fell by 13,000, to 299,000, initially reported as a drop of 16,000, to 297,000.
The four-week average for new claims, a less volatile measure of employment conditions, rose last week to 308,250 from 305,500 the previous week.

HEADLINE: Albright to See Arafat and Netanyahu to Try to Break Impasse

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
With only modest progress after four days of Israeli-Palestinian talks here, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is making plans to meet in Europe next week with leaders from both sides, American and Israeli officials said today.
Ms. Albright wants to show accomplishments and "real momentum" in Middle East peace efforts before she arrives at a Middle East economic conference in Doha, Qatar, on Nov. 16, the officials said. 
 Arab countries, including America's allies like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have threatened to boycott the economic conference, or to send low-level delegations, because of the long Palestinian-Israeli deadlock that Ms. Albright is trying to crack.
But James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said, "We don't feel a greater sense of urgency about the Middle East peace process because of the Doha conference."
Officials of all three sides said there was good will and seriousness at the talks this week, but no breakthroughs, especially on the larger issues. Those include Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, a freeze on Israeli settlement activity and other provocative unilateral actions, the further withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and how to move quickly to talks on a final settlement between the two sides, including the status of Jerusalem.
On the pressing issues that matter most to the Palestinians: the troop withdrawal and final-status talks, there was no progress at all, officials said. The Israeli Foreign Minister, David Levy, could not negotiate serious alterations in the Israeli package, officials said, and the Palestinians rejected the idea of dealing with the issues as a package.
That is why Ms. Albright wants to see the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, next week, in separate meetings, probably in London and Geneva.
The two sides also discussed smaller questions, known as "interim issues," which were supposed to have been settled 10 months ago. Those include a new airport for Palestinians in Gaza, a seaport, an industrial park and safe passage for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Officials said no agreements were concluded because the details remain complicated and all the required experts were not here. For instance, officials said, while the airport is largely resolved, there are still details to be settled over how to schedule takeoffs and landings and air rights. On the seaport, the difficult issue of how to inspect shipments to insure Israeli security has not been worked out, they said.
But Israeli and Palestinian officials were eager today not to criticize the other, and Mr. Levy and the Palestinian negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, were complimentary. "It's true that we did not reach any agreement in the different areas, but I can say that we did reach a great deal of understanding and common ground on each other's needs," Mr. Abbas said.
Mr. Levy said, "I believe that our work in this week has restored trust and has provided a good basis for our continued work, and I am returning home very satisfied."
The Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Dore Gold, however, said today that the Palestinians were not heeding Ms. Albright's admonitions for a "time out" on provocative actions. "It's outrageous that just as Israel is taking risks to conclude negotiations on a Palestinian airport in Gaza, the Palestinians are launching a four-pronged attack on Israel at the United Nations," he said.

HEADLINE: Bronx and Staten Island Recover All Lost Jobs as Other Boroughs Lag

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
The Bronx and Staten Island are the first boroughs to recover all the jobs that were lost in the recession of the late 1980's and early 90's, a report on the city's economy said yesterday.
By contrast, Manhattan suffered far greater losses in the recession than the other boroughs and has regained about 1 in 7 of its lost jobs, the study said. That performance is despite strong gains in industries like Wall Street, business services and tourism. 
 The report, issued by City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, suggests a David and Goliath theme for the economy over the last decade: The poorest borough, the Bronx, and its smallest, Staten Island, suffered far less and have been made whole first. The giant, Manhattan, still finds itself in a hole.
Manhattan has certainly retained its place as the main job engine. Of the 121,000 new jobs in business in the city from the end of the recession in 1993 to the end of last year, according to the most recent county-by-county figures available, more than two-thirds have been in Manhattan.
The borough's steep losses earlier in the decade and the relatively strong growth in the other boroughs, notably Queens, have resulted in a slight shift in the economic mix, the study said. In 1989, 67.2 percent of the jobs in the city were in Manhattan. By the end of last year, 65.2 percent were.
Queens, the second-largest borough in total jobs, increased its share in that period, from 13.2 percent in 1989 to 13.6 as of Dec. 31, 1996, the report said.
The study said that the Bronx was back to about where it was before the recession, as measured by total jobs, and that Brooklyn and Queens had each regained more than 40 percent of their losses.
Only Staten Island has surpassed its 1980's peak. As of Dec. 31, the borough had a record 78,371 jobs, 8,200 more than at the pre-recession peak in 1989.
The report also found a disparity between how large and small companies create jobs. The smallest enterprises, with fewer than 20 workers, have been one of the strongest contributors to growth, the study said. The tiny-company category was the only one that employed more people at the end of last year, 17,000 more, than in 1989.
Large companies, employing 500 or more people, had 109,000 fewer workers at year's end, compared with 1989. Manhattan, with many big corporate headquarters, suffered particularly in the recession, losing 135,000 jobs in the big-company category from 1989 to 1993.
Officials at the Comptroller's office acknowledged that because of methodology, the study left some questions unanswered and that some were apparently unanswerable, what economists call "statistical noise." The State Labor Department, for example, would count a company that moved from one borough to another as two entries, a loss for one borough and a gain for the other.
A company that laid off so many from its work force that it crossed the threshold into a smaller-company classification could distort the numbers as well, the officials said. Counting the performance of companies that were fluctuating in size along with the economy only approximates the roles of the different-size businesses, they said.

HEADLINE: Sour Taste of Nafta: Old Friends Become Foes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
For Representative Scotty Baesler of Kentucky, the turning point came last summer when Fruit of the Loom announced that thousands of workers in his state would be laid off and the jobs moved to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
Representative Sam Farr of California is concerned about how duty-free flowers from Colombia have crippled the cut-flower businesses in his district. 
 Representative Alcee L. Hastings of Florida says that his state's tomato and citrus industries have been badly hurt by Mexican imports, and he fears further damage from imported fruit from Chile.
These Congressmen are three of a dozen or more Democrats who, at considerable political risk, voted to support President Clinton four years ago on the North American Free Trade Agreement but plan to vote on Friday against giving him the authority he wants to help him negotiate further trade pacts. Under this "fast-track" authority, Congress may only approve or disapprove trade agreements but not amend them.
These Democrats' votes could mean the difference between victory and defeat for the President.
Mr. Clinton is posing the trade matter as a central element of the country's foreign and economic policy. But in interviews, many of the Democrats who voted for Nafta and plan to vote against fast-track showed how, as is often the case with trade legislation, the lawmakers' focus is more on local concerns than on ideology or party loyalty.
"I can't afford to alienate my friends any more," said Representative George E. Brown Jr. of California, who was blasted by labor unions for his vote in favor of Nafta and who won re-election last year by fewer than 1,000 votes.
The interviews also illustrated two other important points about trade politics:
The first is that the victims of free trade -- those whose jobs move overseas or whose businesses suffer from competition abroad -- are identifiable and become important political forces. The main beneficiaries -- consumers who pay lower prices for imports or people who see their communities prosper because businesses that export products are expanding -- often do not think of their gain in political terms.
The second point is that many Democrats who voted for Nafta do not believe they have received enough political support from the Clinton Administration and business interests to offset the pressure they face from organized labor to vote against trade expansion.
In Representative Baesler's case, the underwear plants that closed are not even in his district, which is in central Kentucky around Lexington. But he is running for the Senate next year, and he needs support in southern Kentucky where the layoffs occurred.
Fruit of the Loom employment in the area has dropped to 5,000 jobs from 11,000 just two years ago. "We're being impacted by global competition," a company spokesman, Mark Steinkrauss, said last summer when the latest round of layoffs was announced. "We can do the same work cheaper somewhere else."
In an interview, Mr. Baesler explained what this meant for him politically. "People say it was Nafta that caused them to lose their jobs," he said. "I don't know if this was the case. But the companies that have benefited from Nafta have done an extremely poor job explaining this to the public, and, frankly, you get awfully tired of carrying their water."
Mr. Farr said that he was unwilling to give President Clinton a free hand on trade matters because the President had done nothing to solve the problem involving cut flowers in his congressional district around Monterey, south of the San Francisco Bay area.
More commercial flowers are grown there than in any other district in the country, Mr. Farr said, but business has recently been bad.
The reason, he said, is that 70 percent of the cut flowers sold in the United States are now imported from Colombia. Under a trade agreement meant to encourage other agricultural crops in the Andes besides those used for narcotics, Colombian cut flowers are the only ones imported that are not subject to tariffs.
"The President could change this with his signature," Mr. Farr said, "but he has not done so. He talks about job improvement, but he doesn't take any action."
Mr. Hastings said he worried about the damage that imports have done to Florida's tomato and citrus industries, where many of his constituents work. But he also said he was especially angry because neither the Clinton Administration nor the businesses in South Florida -- like banks that benefit from free trade -- helped him politically after his vote for Nafta.
"I took my bullet from labor," he said, "and they didn't come to my rescue."
Esteban E. Torres, a Democrat from Los Angeles, made the same point. "Those of us who stuck our necks out last time have been burned for nothing," he said. Mr. Torres has organized Hispanic legislators to oppose the fast-track legislation.
Nowhere is the Administration's political problem on the trade issue more apparent than it is in Massachusetts. According to Government data, Massachusetts companies exported $15.3 billion worth of goods last year, making it one of the largest exporting states.
But all 10 members of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation, all Democrats, have announced their opposition to the fast-track legislation. Three of them -- Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Edward J. Markey and Martin T. Meehan -- voted for Nafta.
"No one opens a plant or expands one and says, 'By the way, I'm doing this because of lower barriers to trade,' " said a staff assistant who handles trade matters for a Massachusetts lawmaker. "But trade gets blamed for all the job losses."
Communications companies employ 100,000 workers in Massachusetts and benefit enormously from expanded trade, he said, and scores of high-technology companies based in the state depend on exports.
But on fast track, the aide said, "I didn't hear from a single one of them. Not a one called me."

HEADLINE: Diplomatic Approach to Iraq Is Big Risk for U.N.'s Leader

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Less than a year after taking office as Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan may have put his reputation on the line in his first major crisis by choosing diplomacy over confrontation to deal with Saddam Hussein.
"Kofi feels this is a situation of war and peace," a diplomat who has known the Secretary General for years said this week, suggesting why Mr. Annan had not left the matter in the hands of the Security Council. "He feels a moral obligation to get involved." 
 A conciliator by nature, the Secretary General is an extremely popular administrator inside the system. Some diplomats ask, however, whether this approach will work with the world's most difficult characters.
In this case, Mr. Annan is gambling against historical odds that diplomacy might persuade the Iraqi President to end his ban on American arms inspectors rather than provoke an attack by the United States.
"This is Kofi Annan's moment of challenge," said Ruth Wedgwood, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who specializes in the United Nations. "This is the time to stand up for the Security Council's authority. The Secretary General's offer to negotiate evades the authority of the inspection system."
Ms. Wedgwood, who is also an international law specialist at the Yale Law School, said that this gesture to the Iraqis may prove to be a "profound error."
In all its aspects, the current Iraq crisis is a cliffhanger for the United Nations, which has enjoyed one of its greatest successes in Iraq.
No on-site inspections of places where Iraqis may be producing or storing prohibited arms have taken place since Oct. 27, when Iraq ordered Americans working for the United Nations commission charged with disarming Iraq to leave the country and demanded an end to flights over its territory by American U-2 spy planes. The flights were temporarily suspended this week.
Today in Baghdad, Mr. Annan's three emissaries -- an Algerian, an Argentine and a Swede -- were still waiting for a reply to a letter they delivered on Wednesday asking Saddam Hussein to change his mind. They have been promised an answer before they leave Iraq on Friday, probably without a meeting with the Iraqi leader, the Secretary General's spokesman said today. They have, however, spoken with Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi leader's chief deputy.
If the answer is not positive, Mr. Annan said late tonight, he will end his personal intervention in the dispute and return the matter to the Security Council. Mr. Annan made the statement during a visit to Santiago, Chile, through a spokesman, Juan Carlos-Brandt.
In sending the delegation to Baghdad, the Secretary General broke with the practice of making the Iraqis deal with only the Council and its unique creation, the United Nations Special Commission, which was set up with the sole purpose of disarming Iraq. Until all prohibited weapons are destroyed, Iraq cannot hope for the lifting of crippling sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Saddam Hussein, knowing he has some support in the Security Council for the lifting of sanctions from France, Russia and Egypt, has seized on the Secretary General's gesture as an opening to negotiate with the United Nations by circumventing both the Security Council and the disarmament commission.
At stake is the Security Council's bold peacetime experiment in dealing with a renegade nation by effectively destroying its ability to make war. If this approach crumbles in the case of Iraq, it will not be easy for the Council to take this course again in the future.
Many diplomats say the Council's ability to impose this kind of control over a belligerent nation should not in any way be compromised.
Sir Brian Urquhart, a former Under Secretary General who has written several books about the organization, said that any weakening of the Security Council -- by the Secretary General or the member nations -- would be a grave setback, especially in the post-cold-war era when the Council was foreseen as taking on a greater global role.
"It was all supposed to have changed in 1990," he said. "The Council would be able to function as Franklin Roosevelt and everyone else thought it would function, as a fearless arbiter against aggression."
Sir Brian believes that if there is an erosion of Council authority, it is the countries who dominate it who are to blame, as opposed to Mr. Annan. In the case of Iraq, French and Russian businesses are either owed money or are promised future oil contracts. Seven years of sanctions is a long time to wait.
"The real trouble with governments," Sir Brian said, "is that for most of them the short term is more important than the long term. An oil contract is more important than worrying about in some distant future Saddam Hussein will resume his world domination program."
On Wednesday, Richard Butler, the Australian arms control expert who is executive chairman of the inspection commission, told the Security Council that Iraq was taking advantage of the break in surveillance by hiding or tampering with equipment.
Iraqis acknowledged today that they had moved some equipment out of the way of cameras in recent days but said this was to get the machinery out of range of American missiles. Were cameras disabled? Well, the Iraqis told the Security Council in a letter, one did get wrecked when an Iraqi missile blew up during tests Wednesday.
United Nations officials are not impressed by the explanations.
And today, in Washington, Secretary of Defense William Cohen reiterated the Administration's dissatisfaction with Iraq. "There is sufficient time to consider a whole panoply" of responses to Iraq's actions, Mr. Cohen said. He said those responses "could include further economic measures. They could include military as well."
Mr. Annan, in his ten months in office, has had mixed results in his efforts to break deadlocks. He has had a good working relationship with the Security Council, diplomats say. But he is also establishing a reputation for taking on intractable problems alone, even at considerable political risk to himself.
In June, he took out of the hands of the United Nations Human Rights Commission a stalled investigation into allegations of massacres in Congo, formerly Zaire. He named a new team of investigators after consulting with President Laurent Kabila, but Mr. Kabila blocked that team also and the Secretary General had to turn to Bill Richardson, the United States representative, for help.
Mr. Kabila says he has changed his mind. But the investigating team has yet to be dispatched. It is in New York awaiting the return of Mr. Annan, who is in Latin America.
There are few public officials easier to blame than a United Nations Secretary General, as Mr. Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, discovered when governments made catastrophic decisions in Bosnia, Somalia or Rwanda and then blamed him if toothless, stripped-down peacekeeping missions failed.
Stephen Schlesinger, director of the World Policy Institute at the New School for Social Research in New York, who formerly worked for the United Nations, called Mr. Annan "an accommodator" whose style of management was a positive factor in many ways because of the difference it has made to the working atmosphere of the organization at a critical moment in its history.
"Boutros-Ghali was a man who kept everybody on edge," Mr. Schlesinger said. "I remember a distinct change in the organization when Boutros left. It was like a great thorn being taken out of the body."

HEADLINE: Three States Investigating Sales Practices of Met Life

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Regulators in Florida and Texas and the Attorney General in Massachusetts are investigating whether the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the nation's second-largest insurer, has misled tens of thousands of life insurance customers, increasing the costs of their coverage and promising benefits that many never got.
The investigations have been developing as policyholders in several states have filed suits against the company in a widening case that many lawyers say rivals the recently settled one against the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the nation's leading life insurer. Some analysts said the Prudential settlement might ultimately cost the company up to $2 billion. 
 Executives at Met Life said they were cooperating with the investigations in Florida and Massachusetts and were confident that in the end no evidence of widespread, improper activity would be found. They said they had not been notified of an investigation by Texas officials.
News of the Florida investigation was reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal.
"I can't guarantee that 100 percent of the cases were handled perfectly," said Lawrence A. Vranka, a Met Life vice president, "but I feel that when the investigations are concluded that there will be no finding of widespread improper activity."
Mr. Vranka and other Met Life executives said they thought that no more than a small number, at most, of their more than 11.5 million policyholders might have been affected. They said the company won a lawsuit against a policyholder in California on similar allegations earlier this year, after a seven-week trial, and were confident they would prevail in the other cases.
Charges of improper sales practices have roiled the life insurance industry for the last few years. Scores of suits have been filed and hardly any of the leading life insurers have been unscathed. Florida and Massachusetts have just completed investigations of the John Hancock Insurance Company, which announced agreement last week on a settlement of a class action lawsuit. John Hancock paid $6 million in a separate settlement with Florida. Bill Nelson, the Florida Insurance Commissioner, said that his investigators were in the early stages of looking at more than a dozen other companies.
In Massachusetts, Joanna Connolly, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, said, "We have gotten hundreds of complaints involving about 20 companies."
Most of the complaints grew out of sales in the 1980's, when interest rates were high. To compete with other investments yielding high returns, insurance companies increased the returns on their cash- value life insurance policies. In a practice known as churning, agents encouraged many customers to cash in their old policies, with low interest rates, to buy new ones that paid higher interest rates.
In some cases, customers were told that because interest rates and dividends were high, their policies would pay for themselves after seven or eight years. These were known as vanishing premium policies. When interest rates eventually fell, out-of-pocket costs increased. And premiums that were expected to vanish did not. Millions of life insurance customers have complained that their insurance agents did not fully explain to them how their policies would perform.
Met Life and other life insurers have been encouraged by a recent New York State court decision in which a judge declared that the risks of these policies were clearly described in the customers' contracts. Because the customers had therefore been informed, the judge ruled, the insurers could not be accused of deception.
Met Life executives said that after the company paid $20 million in fines and $50 million in restitution in 1994 to settle allegations that its agents had sold life insurance policies as retirement plans, they began closely monitoring sales. Now, they said, they call all new customers after 45 days to make sure that they understand what they bought and that they are satisfied with the terms.
Florida and Massachusetts officials said they began their investigations of Met Life in the spring and Texas officials said they began looking into possible violations in late summer.
Mr. Nelson, the Florida Insurance Commissioner, said, "Our primary goal is to give any and all victims the opportunity to get their money back."

HEADLINE: LeFrak Announces Plans for 189-Room Tourist Hotel in Jersey City

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
In a new sign of resurgence in Jersey City, Sam LeFrak, the developer, announced plans yesterday to build the first hotel on the waterfront intended for tourists as well as business travelers.
The 189-room $21 million hotel would be on a 1.7-acre site in the Newport complex that the Lefrak Organization owns next to the Newport-Pavonia PATH station. 
 An additional waterfront hotel, a 200-room Doubletree Guest Suites, is under construction. It is aimed primarily at business customers.
Lefrak is negotiating financing with the General Electric Credit Corporation, and no date has been set to begin building, the president of the company, Richard LeFrak, said.
Nevertheless, Sam LeFrak, 79, appeared ebullient at a news conference and recalled that there were many doubting Thomases in 1986, when his company started the 400-acre complex that includes the Newport Center Mall, as well as offices, condominiums and apartments.
"The vision we saw in the early '80's, when we looked upon bankrupt railroad yards and abandoned piers, not only has taken shape but continues to enhance Jersey City and the entire metropolitan area," he said.
Another company, the Cali Realty Corporation of Cranford, said it hoped to construct what would be the tallest office building in New Jersey.
From 1993 to last year, 12,000 jobs were added in Jersey City, mostly along the waterfront, said Thomas Gallagher, Director of the Department of Housing, Economic Development and Commerce.
Robert Deeley, a regional vice president of Marriott International Inc., which would operate the proposed hotel, said the company was drawn to the waterfront because of easy access to highways and other transportation.
Jersey City, like much of northern New Jersey, has a large immigrant population. Family members visiting for weddings and other events often stay in Weehawken, Secaucus or Newark, Mayor Bret D. Schundler of Jersey City said. "Now they'll be staying in Jersey City, closer to their families."
Lefrak said it would open a 138,000-square-foot food market at the site of a Bradlees discount store in Newport that closed last year.
The proposed 1.8-million-square-foot office tower, in the Harborside Financial Center and built in partnership with the Garden State Corporation, is tentatively called the American Financial Exchange. It would take shape if the developer can lease half the building, the chief operating officer of Cali Realty, Brant Cali, said. The developer has hired Insignia/Edward S. Gordon as leasing agent, Mr. Cali said.
The builder has not obtained Planning Board approval for such a large building, which Mr. Cali said would be at least 50 stories. The city already has the state's tallest office building, a 42-story tower at 101 Hudson Street, a few blocks from Harborside.
Cali bought the Harborside center a year ago for $292 million. Garden State is run by Peter Mangin of Jersey City, a lawyer, and his uncle, Frank J. Guarini, a former Congressman. Mr. Mangin is also a developer of the Doubletree.
Cali owns 2.5 million square feet in Jersey City, or 40 percent of the prime office space, Mr. Cali said, and it is 99 percent occupied.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT ISSUES LAST-MINUTE PLEA ON TRADE MEASURE

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton, fearing defeat in his quest for expanded trade negotiating authority, made an unusual public appeal for support tonight, accusing interest groups of intimidating members of the House who might otherwise vote for the bill.
Opponents of the so-called fast-track legislation gained new ground today, prompting Mr. Clinton to cut short a trip to Texas for the dedication of the George Bush presidential library and return to Washington to lobby publicly and privately for votes. 
 Also making a last-minute appeal and gaining some promises of "no" votes was Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Minority Leader, who opposes the measure.
Mr. Clinton warned that defeat of the trade measure would damage the international standing of the United States and threaten growth in the domestic economy.
"A vote against fast track will not create a single job, clean up a single toxic waste site, advance workers' rights or improve the environment anywhere in the world," he said in an urgent appeal presented in the White House briefing room at the request of the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, who is supporting the measure.
"But," the President said, "it will limit America's ability to advance our economic interests, promote our democratic ideals, our political leadership."
Mr. Clinton argued that if the House vote were taken in secret, "it would pass overwhelmingly," but he said members of Congress were under intense pressure to vote against the measure, an oblique reference to the political clout of organized labor, which opposes it. He accused House members of being more concerned about their own political futures than about national economic policy.
"The deadline concentrates our attention markedly," said President Clinton, who added that he was not asking for the vote to be postponed. "We think we can get there by tomorrow night and that's what we're trying to do," he said.
President Clinton had more than half his Cabinet fanned out across the Capitol earlier today to press wavering lawmakers in advance of the House vote on Friday.
But as Cabinet secretaries traipsed from office to office, Mr. Gephardt and Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan defiantly led their own battle.
At midday, Mr. Gephardt appeared at a news conference to showcase 15 previously undecided Democrats who had decided to vote against the measure. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California said she opposed it out of fear that global trade would lead to a "race to the bottom" unless the Administration made labor rights a negotiating point. She said she was "asking President Clinton to withdraw his request, to go back to the drawing board."
Mr. Gephardt began the day in his red-carpeted office where he described squalid living conditions on the Mexican side of the border. He said he wanted global trade to improve standards of living by committing the United States to fight just as hard for labor and environmental protections as it does for intellectual property rights. "I think you're seeing workers and middle-class families and environmentalists stand up and say this is important," he said.
Mr. Clinton decided late this afternoon, while aboard Air Force One, that he needed to take drastic measures on the issue. His decision came after Mr. Gingrich informed Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff, that the measure was headed toward certain defeat unless Mr. Clinton could deliver more Democratic votes.
Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who has been working with the President, sounded less optimistic than he had a day before, saying he could bring in 45 to 55 Democrats -- short of the 60 to 70 he had predicted on Wednesday.
Early this evening Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that the President was short "at least a couple of dozen" votes in the House and that the situation was so dire that the Republican leadership, in consultation with the White House, might not go ahead with the vote.
The signs of trouble came early. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, set up shop for more than an hour first thing this morning in a basement office to answer questions from undecided lawmakers. But only a handful showed up, among them Republicans Bob Schaffer of Colorado and Wes W. Watkins of Oklahoma.
Mr. Clinton has argued that the fast track authority is crucial for the United States to maintain a leading role in global trade. The legislation strengthens the President's negotiating power by allowing Congress to approve or defeat but not amend trade treaties.
At the Bush library today, the President mustered support from Mr. Bush, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and Mr. Bush said, "I am passionately committed to his position -- President Clinton's position -- on free and fair trade."
But Mr. Clinton's brand of centrist politics has left him in danger on an issue that fractures the Democratic Party, and while Mr. Gingrich and his deputies have been fighting for Mr. Clinton's trade policy, they have encountered resistance from Republicans who are seeking concessions on other issues.
"We know that the President wants fast track rather badly," said Representative Henry J. Hyde, a Republican from Illinois who wants to keep family- planning funds from going to overseas groups that counsel abortions. "And we would like him to be cooperative."
For many House members the legislation has become symbolic of a larger debate over who wins and who loses in an era of global trade when the United States is competing with developing nations with lower labor and environmental standards. And the battle has significance for the next Presidential race as well.
Patrick Buchanan, a 1996 Republican Presidential candidate, spoke out against the bill before a House committee today. And Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Gephardt are expected to be Democratic primary contenders with sharply different stances on economic policy.
Today, in his office just off the Senate chamber, Mr. Gore met with five undecided Democrats -- Nita Lowey of New York, Earl Pomery of North Dakota, Juanita Millender-McDonald of California, Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Zoe Lofgren of California. Asked if he had won over any votes, he said, "several."
Representative Lowey noted that environmental groups had come out as a block against the trade legislation. She said that she was still undecided and that voting for the bill or voting against it were "both bad choices."
Some lawmakers privately acknowledged that they were making their decisions on political grounds, loath to antagonize labor, which they believe will be more helpful to them in next year's campaign than Mr. Clinton.
John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. roamed easily through the corridors of the House today, greeting members and reminding them that he opposed the trade bill.
Other House members said what mattered was how their regions had fared under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Georgians were protesting that peanuts had not been sufficiently protected against diseased imports. (Former President Jimmy Carter telephoned members of the Georgia delegation to argue in favor of the legislation.) Midwestern farm state legislators were concerned about Canadian wheat imports. Representative Henry Bonilla was said to be concerned about traffic generated by trucks crossing the border from Mexico.
Representative Karen Thurman, a Florida Democrat, held lengthy talks with the Administration about her belief that the Florida citrus industry had been damaged by trade with Mexico and could be hurt further by trade agreements with Latin America. Today she said the Administration had not done enough to address the delegation's concerns. "They were nice to us," she said, "they talked and went through the hoops over it, but they kept coming back with stuff that was kind of estoric to us."
En route to Texas Mr. Clinton did what he could. He brought with him on Air Force One two Republicans considered undecided or against him -- Representative Michael Forbes of New York and John L. Mica of Florida, and tonight he invited 20 lawmakers to the White House.
Mr. Gingrich, meanwhile, put down his own rebellions. At one point he met with Republicans who wanted an iron-clad commitment from the President that he would not veto legislation on military programs. Mr. Gingrich pressed the White House for more concessions on spending bills that he could use to rally conservatives to the President's cause. But Mr. Clinton said in his White House appearance that he was trying to accommodate lawmakers on economic issues "that we can resolve honorably."

Clinton in Public Appeal For More Trade Muscle
President Clinton made a public appeal in which he accused interest groups of intimidating members of the House to vote against a trade bill that would grant him broader negotiating powers. A1
 
Crime Wave in Mexico
Mexicans frustrated by the worst wave of common crime in their memory have increasingly lost confidence in the police, and that in turn has undermined efforts to open up the country's authoritarian politics to greater democracy. A1 

Twist in Mexico Murder Case
Three doctors have been charged with the murder of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, a Mexican drug barons who died four months ago after plastic surgery, the head of Mexico's anti-drug agency said. Now the mutilated bodies of two of the doctors have been identified after being found in sealed drums along a rural highway in the southern state of Guerrero. A third body was found, but has not been identified. A7
 
Annan's Iraqi Gambit
Secretary General Kofi Annan's choice of diplomacy over confrontation in dealing with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has been criticized as undermining the authority of the Security Council, but it reflects his personal style. A1
 
Albright Plans Mideast Talks
After little progress in four days of talks with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said she was making plans to meet separately with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, next week, probably in London and Geneva. These talks will precede a Middle East economic conference on Nov. 16, which several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have threatened to boycott because of the deadlock in talks. A13
 
Brazil Defends Currency
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, trying to keep inflation at bay, has raised interest rates sharply and devoted billions of dollars of reserves to defend his currency from devaluation. The strategy seems to have calmed local financial markets and helped Brazil avoid the fate of Southeast Asian nations whose currencies were routed by speculators. But it may prove unpopular with voters leading up to next year's elections. A9
 
Power Vacuum in Thailand
The resignation of Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has virtually stalled the management of Thailand's ailing economy. As the stock market meanders, two coalitions, each headed by a former Prime Minister, announced at almost simultaneous televised news conferences that they had gathered enough parliamentary votes to form a new government. The public just watches nervously. A11

Judge Ends Nomination Over False Family Story
James Ware, a Federal District Court judge in San Jose, Calif., admitted that his brother had not been the victim of a racist murder in 1963, something he had claimed in speeches for years as a formative event in his life that made him "hungry for justice." He asked President Clinton to withdraw his nomination to become the only active black judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A1
 
Rights Nominee Vote Delayed
With the Senate Judiciary Committee poised to defeat the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the top civil rights enforcer, his backers delayed a vote in order to make a last ditch drive for support. A22
 
High Blood Pressure Warning
In a reversal of longtime health gains, fewer adult Americans are aware they have high blood pressure, fewer are getting effective therapy, and more are dying, Federal health officials said after issuing new treatment guidelines for the ailment that affects 50 million Americans. A14
 
A New Battle at Gettysburg
The National Park Service selected a group of developers to build a new visitor center, museum and large-screen theater within Gettysburg National Military Park, an expansion of park services that some preservationists call a commercial intrusion onto hallowed ground. A26
 
Bush Library Is Dedicated
In the company of three other Presidents and six First Ladies, the 41st President of the United States was celebrated at the dedication of the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum. A28
 
Although the American presidential libraries have been mocked as ego trips for former Presidents, most scholars who have used them agree that with few exceptions they are an enormously valuable resource for academicians, students, authors and the general public. A28
 
Tax Survey Draws Fire
A plan developed by Speaker Newt Gingrich calls for a voluntary 14-question survey to be mailed to every taxpayer early next year to ask what they think of the I.R.S. Critics said the plan, which would cost $30 million, is a waste of money and an attempt to politicize the issue. A28
 
Singer Blamed for Suicide
A father told a Senate committee exploring the effects of music on children that his 15-year-old son shot himself last December after listening to songs about death and the antichrist on the Marylin Manson album "Antichrist Superstar." A21

Sex Seminar Under Attack
The president of the State University of New York at New Paltz is under fire from the Governor and one of the system's trustees after a women's studies conference on sadomasochism, lesbianism and other sexual topics was held on the New Paltz campus last weekend. Governor Pataki, in a statement, said it was "outrageous" that state money was spent on the conference.

HEADLINE: Health Care Is Too Important for Partisanship

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Move Under Way to Try to Block Health Care Bills" (front page, Nov. 4) points up that health care reform is again being treated as a partisan issue rather than the bipartisan issue it should be. The health care system is in critical condition.
Costs are rising at twice the rate of inflation and will double in the next 10 years. The number of uninsured -- estimated to be between 41 million and 44 million -- is increasing by a million a year, and the quality of care continues to erode. 
 Competition and managed care have been promoted as solutions, yet the marketplace has done little to stem long-term cost, quality and coverage problems, which show no sign of abating.
Opponents of reform being considered in Congress contend that the proposals would increase costs even more and drive more people out of health coverage.
Yet without change in the way we deliver and pay for health care, costs will rise more rapidly and the number of uninsured will grow larger.
Partisan posturing only aggravates the problems for all Americans.

HEADLINE: Give Clinton 'Fast Track,' or We'll Pay the Price

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Antitrade forces who have argued that the United States has little to gain and much to lose by granting President Clinton "fast track" authority on trade negotiations are on the wrong side of history (editorial, Nov. 6).
In 1975 United States exports represented only 4 percent of its gross domestic product. Today, after two rounds of the multilateral trade negotiation and the North American Free Trade Agreement, exports constitute 8.2 percent of a much larger gross domestic product. 
 Opponents of free trade are eager to hold up examples of American companies shifting their production abroad. But many foreign companies have opened facilities in the United States; five million Americans now work for foreign subsidiaries.
In addition, engaging South America in a trade partnership increases the likelihood that its more than 300 million consumers will buy and use American-made products. As the United States has relinquished its historic leadership in trade, Europe, Japan and Brazil have stepped up their presence in the region. These nations are seeking preferential agreements for themselves rather than to establish an open market for all.
President Clinton is right. If we turn our backs on the challenge of global competition, we will pay the consequences: higher prices and fewer choices for consumers and less secure, lower-paying jobs for our workers.

HEADLINE: Give Clinton 'Fast Track,' or We'll Pay the Price;
Read the Report

 BODY:

To the Editor:
President Clinton is trying to garner Congressional support for his "fast track" authority on trade agreements by proposing reviews of labor and environmental practices of potential trade partners and the parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement, particularly Mexico (front page, Nov. 4). He also wants to involve the World Bank in expanding worker rights.
No new report is necessary on Mexico's failure to comply with its obligations under the labor side agreement to Nafta. All that the President need do is to read the reports of his own National Administrative Office in the Labor Department, which detail how Mexican authorities have frustrated the attempts of Mexican workers to organize. 
 Moreover, there is no evidence that the World Bank has ever intervened with its member governments to mitigate egregious abuse of worker rights (for example, Indonesia, which the World Bank considers a "star" performer).

HEADLINE: A Rising Disquiet Among the Bogs;
Environmental Worries Block Plan by New Jersey Farmers To Expand Cranberry Fields

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: SPEEDWELL, N.J.

 BODY:
Steve Lee watched the rising water flood the sunken cranberry fields, gently buoying the vine-tethered crop. Then the harvesting machines rolled through, shaking the berries loose to float on the surface like a vermilion carpet.
"Some people may think it's thick enough to walk on, but I know you can't," Mr. Lee, a cranberry farmer, said. 
 Across five generations, this red harvest has brought prosperity to the 35 or so farm families who work the cranberry bogs of New Jersey's pinelands. Thanks to this swatch of wildness, the nation's most densely populated state is also the third-largest cranberry producer in the world, after Massachusetts and Wisconsin. But this year, the usual rigors and rhythms of harvest time are mixed with disquiet, and some anxiety for the future.
At issue are the farmers' efforts to make it easier to expand their 3,800 acres of fields into adjacent wetlands -- including portions of the Pine Barrens. While the proposal has the support of state environmental officials and some state conservations groups, it is opposed by Federal environmental agencies and national environmental groups, who fear that the loss of wetlands to agriculture will damage the sensitive ecology of the state's pinelands.
Recently, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency decided to put the plan on hold, pending further study. To the farmers, the decision was a rebuke to what they see as their own ecological sensitivity.
Their crop, they insist, is native to the wetlands and as much a part of it as the 84 species of birds, 14 species of mammals, 14 reptile types and 12 species of fish that thrive there. It is the perfect no-till crop and it requires the purest of waters, so by necessity, they argue, they must be good stewards of the land, careful with pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers that could contaminate the groundwater and streams and eventually their product.
The farmers are hardly crying immediate economic hardship. With an annual harvest valued at about $25 million, cranberries rank fifth among New Jersey's agriculture products. Divided among a mere 35 cranberry-growing families, it is a lucrative business. What the growers fear, though, is competition from abroad -- that their ranking and revenue will be lost to the new, spacious and less regulated frontiers of cranberry growing in Chile and British Columbia.
"It's been very frustrating," said Bill Haines, the state's largest single grower, whose 1,000 acres of production bogs amid 10,000 acres of forested wetlands account for almost a third of the total state cranberry acreage. "We have only scratched the surface of the demand, and the markets for our product and juices are growing in Europe and Canada. The thing hampering us in getting those markets is lack of product."
Michele Breyer, assistant director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, said her group generally supported modest expansion of the cranberry bogs sprinkled throughout and along the fringes of the 1.1-million-acre Pinelands National Reserve. The reserve, established by the national and state governments in 1978, sits atop the Cohansey Aquifer, the largest aquifer east of the Mississippi, and its commissioners, including Mr. Lee, have supported the expansion proposals.
"Cranberries are a native fruit to the wetlands and part of our culture," Ms. Breyer said. "And the farmers, with their emphasis on pure water, have an impact on protecting the wetlands. We believe in moderate expansion."
Those who are holding up Federal approval said that they were not opposed to some increase in cranberry acreage but insisted that it could be accomplished on less environmentally sensitive upland areas. They agree with growers that cranberry bogs have far less impact on the wetlands than other agricultural practices and are nothing like the developments that fill in the wetlands forever. They also concede that cranberry growing adds little contamination to the area.
But to the opponents, the issue is not contamination but the manipulation of the natural environment. "Cranberry beds are actively maintained as a monoculture and provide no structural diversity," said Cliff Day, supervisor of the New Jersey office of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. He noted that the growing areas for the creeping vines were scraped and cleared of trees, shrubs and grasses and made inhospitable to wildlife naturally found in the wetlands.
William Neil, the associate director of the New Jersey Audubon Society, which also opposes speeding the permit process for cranberry farmers, said that the magnitude of the proposed change was significant. In the last five years, the state had lost 609 acres of wetlands to development. Cranberry farmers are seeking 300 acres, concentrated in Burlington County, over five years.
Under the proposal offered this year, the farmers were seeking a general permit to add up to 10 acres a year without going through the rigorous special permit process of the Federal Clean Water Act, which requires the approval of a host of agencies. The current system holds that every speck of wetlands is valuable and endangered, and that cavalierly allowing expansion is the slippery slope to the disappearance altogether of wetlands, Mr. Day said.
Michael Hogan, counsel to the state's Environmental Protection Commissioner, said that in exchange for approving the growers' plan, his agency had also required them to finance programs to plant endangered trees like the Atlantic white cedar in the pinelands.
"They don't destroy wetlands, but they do modify them," Mr. Hogan said. "In the process, though, they create more wetlands but they don't get any credit for that. If New Jersey doesn't position itself in the cranberry industry, the people who make the products are going to go elsewhere."
Massachusetts, with 12,355 acres of cranberry bogs, ranks first in growing the crop, followed by Wisconsin with 8,679 acres under cultivation. Expansion of the crop is strictly regulated in each of those states -- a fact that opponents of the New Jersey plan point to as evidence that a thriving industry does not require a blank check to expand.
The industriousness that seizes cranberry bogs each October contrasts with the still and nearly silent forested swamps they border. There are still many thick, pristine stands of red maple and birch, but far fewer clusters of the prized Atlantic white cedar that was harvested in the 19th and 20th centuries for building materials. The cedar trees soar upward to form a canopy that shades the forested, swampy wetlands that are thick with pygmy pines, gnarled and woody sheep laurel, and wild blueberry in its lowest lying areas.
"For every acre of cranberry bogs, we have 10 acres of woods and swamps to support it," Mr. Lee said. "We call it all a cranberry growing system and tell regulators to look at the whole thing. Then you can see the diversity of it all."
The pressure to expand is great, he said, adding that he and his brother, Abbott, had not been able to expand their 130 acres of bogs since 1985, when, he said, the Clean Water Act lumped their activity in with "mall developers and housing developers."
For Mr. Haines, with his larger landholdings, the pressure for the new permit process is not so great. He has about 140 acres of old blueberry fields into which he can expand cranberry production without government approval.
"We have the room to expand on our farm, but it is more important for the industry itself to be able to expand," he said as he sat in his office. Over his left shoulder, hanging on the wall in a simple pine frame, was a saying penned in stylish and flowing calligraphy on parchment that read, "Cranberry growers get bogged down in their work."

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Stocks Fall 5%; Investors Act on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply in Asian markets early today.
Hong Kong's key Hang Seng index dropped 521.14 points, or about five percent, to 9,891.42, at the mid-morning break. Dealers said investors went on a selling spree because of higher interest rates. 
 Investors were nervous because of higher interbank rates, which have been spiked up to defend the local currency, dealers said.
In Tokyo, stocks were sharply lower here this morning. At the close of trading, the Nikkei index of 225 leading issues was down 697.51 points, or 4.22 percent, at 15,836.36. On Thursday, the Nikkei rose 85.82 points, or five-tenths of 1 percent.
In the United States, stocks ended lower yesterday in a decline led by makers of personal computers.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.33 points, or one-tenth of 1 percent, to 7,683.24. I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard were among the component stocks that dragged down the Dow, amid concern that lower prices for PC's would hurt earnings this holiday season.
I.B.M. drew attention to falling prices when it introduced an Aptiva PC for $999, its first foray into the red-hot sub-$1,000 market. Lower prices allow PC makers to sell more machines, though they make less in profit for each one sold.
"This Christmas there is concern that the average selling price is lower," said Bob Finch, a money manager at Aeltus Investment Management. "From a consumer perspective, they don't see the need to spend more than $1,000."
I.B.M. fell 17/16, to 101 1/16. Shares of Hewlett-Packard, another Dow component as well as another personal computer vendor that sells a sub-$1,000 machine, slumped 15/16, to 63 5/8. Broader market indexes were also lower yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index declined 4.73 points, or five-tenths of 1 percent, to 938.03. The Nasdaq composite index fell 13.89, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,623.44.
Over all, it was the third quiet session in a row for the stock market, following a tumultuous six sessions.
"My gut is we had a correction, and we're going through a quiet period," said Ken Fisher, who runs his own $1.7 billion firm in Woodside, Calif. "We're still seeing people who are shaking off their emotion about last week."
Among personal computer makers, the Compaq Computer Corporation dropped 1 1/2, to 65 7/16 and the Dell Computer Corporation, the top direct-mail retailer, declined 2 5/8, to 81. Dell, however, does not offer a $999 computer.
Compaq, whose shares more than doubled this year, has fallen 16 percent since hitting a high on Sept. 22.
Intel fell 1, to 73 5/8, its third straight decline. Analysts said they expected company officials to issue a gloomy forecast at a meeting with analysts today because of the potential for lower demand in Southeast Asia and the popularity of lower-priced personal computers.
Aluminum Company of America fell 1 3/4, to 72 1/4, and was the top decliner in the Dow, after Tom M. Van Leeuwen, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said slack Asian demand was expected to hurt ingot prices. Mr. Van Leeuwen cut his earnings forecast by 7.3 percent, though he maintained his "buy" rating, as recent price declines take into account the weaker outlook.
The biggest gainers were retailers, which jumped on hopes that healthy employment trends will bring a strong holiday selling season this year.
Wal-Mart, which said sales in stores open more than a year climbed 6 percent in October, saw its shares rise 13/16, to 36 7/8. The Dayton Hudson Corporation, whose sales jumped 6.1 percent, gained 3 1/4, to 68 3/4. Kohl's reported a 14 percent jump, and saw its shares rise 11/16, to 69 7/16.
The News Corporation's American depository receipts, each representing four ordinary shares, rose 13/16, to 20 3/8. The Australian media company said first-quarter earnings rose 7.1 percent in United States dollar terms.

Man Pleads Guilty To Photo Pornography

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
An unemployed computer engineer from Long Branch pleaded guilty yesterday to taking sexually explicit photographs of a 14-year-old girl two months after meeting her in an Internet chat room, Federal prosecutors said.
The man, Richard C. Crandon, 39, took the photographs on Aug. 17 after driving to the girl's home in Coon Rapids, Minn., and taking her back to New Jersey, said Gail Nichols, an assistant United States attorney. 
 When Mr. Crandon learned that the girl's mother had reported her missing, he left the girl at a bus stop in State College, Pa., Ms. Nichols said.
Mr. Crandon is also facing charges in Minnesota, said Rick Loewen, a special agent with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.

HEADLINE: East Europeans Fill Job Gap in Florida

BYLINE: By DENNIS BLANK

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Nov. 7

 BODY:
This is the land of the perpetual help-wanted sign.
Even though 700 people move to Florida every day from elsewhere in the United States, economic development officials say, there are still not enough newcomers to satisfy the never-ending demand for service workers to meet the needs of the tourism industry. 
 But some hotels have found one way of at least partly plugging the gap. They are hiring workers from Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania.
"It has been a godsend," said Moira Oliver, director of human resources for the Hyatt Orlando. "I honestly don't know what we would do without them."
These workers, who fill 30 jobs at the Hyatt alone as housekeepers, laundry workers, janitors, food service workers and the like, are provided by a contractor, Florida Coastal Maintenance from Venice, Fla. The Hyatt Orlando would not divulge the amount but says it pays a flat fee to the company, which handles payroll tax withholding and other administrative chores.
Florida Coastal recruits the workers by placing advertisements in European newspapers and in New York and Chicago papers read by recent immigrants.
In a system reminiscent of the European "guest worker" programs of the 1960's and early 1970's, the hotel workers here are among 55,000 Eastern Europeans picked annually in a Government-run lottery and granted one-year work visas. Many who hold these American work permits, known as H-2 visas, receive one- and two-year extensions before they return to their country.
In the Czech Republic "it is very hard to get a good job," said Antonin Sandor, 39, a Czech native who works for $5.85 an hour in the Hyatt Orlando laundry. He shares a nearby $650-a-month apartment with three other employees, gets most of his meals free at the hotel and is supplied with uniforms. He says he is able to save about $500 a month. If allowed to stay at his job for three years, Mr. Sandor expects to have enough money to build a home in the Czech Republic.
By recruiting workers from the old East bloc countries, where jobs do not pay nearly as well, hotels here are able to meet some of their needs for low-skilled employment without having to increase wages and benefits as much as might otherwise be required to lure American workers from other jobs. It is a small part of an overall strategy aimed at attracting students, retirees, people on welfare and migrants from other states at a time when the United States labor market is at its tightest in a quarter century.
The Hyatt chain employs 100 foreign laborers from the old East bloc countries around the nation, half in Florida.
Florida Coastal has been providing imported workers to the Hyatt-Key West and two other hotels in the Florida Keys since 1988 and started providing them in Orlando last year. Gale Killion, human resources director at Hyatt-Key West, said many of the workers eventually became permanent employees. "We have had some problems," Ms. Killion said, "but most have been very dependable."
Just this week Ms. Oliver and personnel officials from four other Hyatt hotels flew to Switzerland in an effort to persuade culinary schools to send their students as interns to fill vacancies in Hyatt kitchens.
Personnel directors say that elsewhere in the nation a lot of hotels have turned to schools like New Hampshire College, in Manchester, which brings in 75 students who have completed three years of schooling in the hospitality industry in Canada, Europe and Latin America, trains them for three months and then places them in jobs that range from desk clerks to accounting.
While Federal officials say a number of cheaper independent hotels have hired illegal aliens, that is much riskier than relying on the H-2 visa program. Last year 110,000 illegal immigrants were forced to leave the United States. Nearly 1,700 were deported from Florida. Lemar Wooley, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami, said it was "not unusual" to find undocumented workers in the hotel industry.
Ann Krutchik, personnel director for Marriott in Fort Lauderdale, who recruits workers for nine Marriotts in the state, said, "It is becoming more and more difficult to hire because there is more competition."
Service industries are eager to recruit imported workers because the labor pool for low-wage, relatively unskilled work is so shallow. With the unemployment rate in the Orlando area at 3 percent, students and retirees are snapped up instantly.
"Employers are hungry," said Tom Weinberg, chairman of Wages, a local coalition dedicated to finding jobs for welfare recipients in five central Florida counties.
Many hotels in central Florida are working harder to keep the employees they have and are offering special incentives for new ones, such as $50 bonuses for any employee who recruits someone to the hotel. At the high-end hotels, employees usually start at $6 an hour and receive full medical, dental and life insurance benefits. They are also given pay increases and promotions for improved job performance.
With recruitment of new workers so difficult, "we are focusing more attention on retention," said Rosa Pettus, human resources director at the Peabody Hotel in Orlando. "Going to the outside can be very challenging."

HEADLINE: Michael von Clemm, 62, Eurobonds Pioneer

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
Michael von Clemm, an investment banker who used a lifelong interest in anthropology to help pioneer the global Eurobond market, died on Thursday at his family home in Wellesley, Mass. He was 62.
The cause was a brain tumor, his son-in-law, William Iselin, said. 
 Mr. von Clemm, who held senior positions at Credit Suisse First Boston and Merrill Lynch, lived most of the last 35 years in London, where since 1996 he served as president of Templeton College, Oxford University's graduate management school.
As one of a handful of multilingual bankers residing in London in the 1960's, Mr. von Clemm recognized that growing numbers of individuals, corporations and even countries were looking for ways to invest abroad without becoming entangled in national currency controls.
Thus were born "Eurocurrencies" -- money on deposit in countries outside of those that printed it. The idea of offering dollar-denominated certificates of deposit in Europe was jointly devised by Mr. von Clemm, who at the time worked in London for the First National City Bank, and a friend, Stan Yassukovich, who worked for the London office of White, Weld & Company, an American investment bank.
The bankers who began accepting the deposits also recognized they might lend the money at higher rates to customers seeking to borrow foreign currencies from an offshore source. Mr. von Clemm was one of several bankers credited with devising a way to spread the risk of those loans by transforming them into a short-term security that could be traded and whose interest rate varied according to changes in international financial markets -- the Eurodollar floating-rate note.
"Today's seamless global stock and bond markets would never have developed without Michael von Clemm," said John M. Hennessy, former chief executive of the American branch of Credit Suisse First Boston. "There are many countries that have access to credit today solely because of him."
In 1971, Mr. von Clemm joined the London-based company that is now Credit Suisse First Boston. In his 15-year tenure there -- the last seven as chairman -- Mr. von Clemm led the investment bank to its still-dominant position as the largest underwriter of Eurobonds, debt securities issued outside the confines of any national market that are denominated in any of a variety of currencies, including marks, yen, pounds or dollars.
Mr. von Clemm, who was born March 18, 1935, in New York City, earned four degrees in anthropology, graduating from Harvard College in 1956 and from Corpus Christi College of Oxford University in 1962.
Reflecting that academic background, he was said to have come upon his interest in international banking in a less-than-usual way: While living for 14 months with the Wachagga tribe in Tanzania, he became intrigued by how people who were normally separated by great distances managed to exchange and barter goods when they came together.
He also dabbled in other careers along the way. He worked as a crime reporter for The Boston Globe in 1959 and 1960 and taught at the Harvard Business School for four years. While working at Credit Suisse First Boston, he also served as chairman of Roux Restaurants, owner of Le Gavroche, which for a time was the only restaurant in Britain with three Michelin stars.
In 1984, while scouting a site for a processing plant to house Roux's planned venture into packaged foods, Mr. von Clemm came upon a ramshackle stretch of the London waterfront known as the Docklands. He thought the docks, occupied by abandoned warehouses where a century ago ships unloaded their cargoes of bananas from the Canary Islands, could provide vast, inexpensive space to house the back-office operations of securities firms like Credit Suisse First Boston.
That proved the beginnings of Canary Wharf. Mr. von Clemm's firm initially considered joining a partnership to develop the property, but instead signed on only as a tenant. The company thereby avoided the financial trouble that led its primary developer, Olympia & York, to lose the property to lenders shortly after it opened in 1992. Today, however, the Canary Wharf complex is 95 percent occupied, and generally considered one of the prime business sites in London.
In January 1986, at age 50, Mr. von Clemm resigned abruptly from Credit Suisse First Boston and implied that he was leaving the Eurobond business, saying he wanted "new mountains to climb." But barely two months later he joined Merrill Lynch as chairman of its capital markets subsidiary, serving as the primary diplomat for the company to its network of global customers. He retired at the end of 1992, but continued to invest through a private company, Highmount Capital.
Mr. von Clemm also served on the board of Massachusetts General Hospital, the Harvard School of Public Health, the East Africa Development Bank, and the U.S.-Korea Business Council. In addition, he was a member of the corporate boards of Eastman Chemical and the Liberty Financial Companies.
Mr. von Clemm is survived by his wife, Lisa Hunnewell von Clemm; two daughters, Stefanie Claire von Clemm of Boston and Charlotte von Clemm Iselin of London; a sister, Alison von Clemm Curtis of Switzerland, and a grandson.

Rome Talks Seek to Defuse Trade Disputes

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Dismantling hidden barriers to increased trans-Atlantic trade was the focus of two days of discussions here by European and American business leaders with government officials from both sides of the Atlantic.
Participants in the discussions, which ended today, pleaded with the United States and European Union for a "globally harmonized and market-driven legal framework" for electronic commerce, and made proposals aimed at defusing a trans-Atlantic trade conflict that threatens an estimated $4.5 billion of annual pharmaceutical trade. 
 The business leaders, about 70 executives of major European and American corporations, also called on European and American negotiators to expedite an agreement on financial services when negotiations resume in Brussels next week.
The gathering, known as the Trans-Atlantic Business Dialogue, produced a 17-page industry wish list with appeals to eliminate duplication -- and consequent increased costs -- in certifying products on both sides of the Atlantic.
When Washington and Brussels moved to liberalize trans-Atlantic trade in the mid-1990's, it became clear that a trans-Atlantic free-trade zone, similar to the North American arrangement with Mexico and Canada, was impractical.
Instead, corporate leaders told political leaders it was more important to expand the $2 trillion in trans-Atlantic trade by simplifying the hodgepodge of duplicate registration and testing requirements. European and American officials then invited executives to meet to make proposals. They met in Spain in 1995, Chicago last year and Rome this year.
One important subject of discussion was how to defuse a potential trade dispute focusing on a European Union directive that threatens trade in pharmaceutical products. If enforced on the Jan. 1 effective date, the directive will block deliveries to Europe of tallow and gelatin derived from cattle carcasses because of the presumed threat of mad cow disease. About 40 percent of the tallow and gelatin used in Europe to produce filler and casings for pharmaceutical products like pills and tablets comes from the United States. Industry officials said about 85 percent of medicinal products sold in Europe would be affected. "We face the threat of a ban on all this trade," said Stuart E. Eizenstat, the United States Under Secretary of State.
Martin Bangemann, the European Union Commissioner for Industry, said a possible solution would be to postpone enforcement of the directive to allow non-European suppliers time to adjust to the new European requirements. "We are determined to find a solution," he said.

HEADLINE: El Nino Versus El Nonsense;
Keeping Cool Heads in Midst Of Serious Ocean Warming

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Early this summer, Smith Barney Inc.'s Latin American stock trading desk in New York held a meeting for brokers and money managers on how the latest episode in the periodic warming of Pacific Ocean waters known as El Nino might affect corporate profits across that continent.
"Commodities traders have been interested in El Nino events for years," said Jon B. Davis, the company's meteorologist, who was flown in from his office here for the gathering. "But this was the first time I'd seen the equities side talking about it." 
 At the time, Mr. Davis took the meeting as a healthy sign that El Nino was finally getting the respect it deserved. As traders in the energy and agricultural markets have long known, El Nino conditions are linked to drastic shifts in weather patterns across much of the globe.
Since then, though, El Nino has gone on to become to weather what the O. J. Simpson case was to the legal system. Loose talk has gathered so much momentum that El Nino has smashed through the common sense barrier into misconceptions that are influencing consumer behavior and businesses in ways that leave Mr. Davis and other meteorologists shaking their heads in amazement and dismay.
"I knew it was completely out of control," he said, "when a broker in New York told me he'd heard people in elevators saying they didn't need to buy a coat this winter because of El Nino. You can have plenty of cold days -- you can have record cold days -- even if past El Ninos suggest that conditions in the Northeast will be milder than normal."
The misconceptions have put meteorologists in a tough position. No one wants to play down the dangers associated with this El Nino. Already, much of Southeast Asia is in the grip of a drought that threatens to cut production of internationally important crops like coffee and palm oil. Some mines in Asia dependent on hydroelectric power have even closed.
Weather linked to El Nino has also cut potential wheat yields in Australia, delayed spring planting in Brazil and Argentina, and ravaged the tourist trade on the west coast of Mexico. Peru shut down all anchovy fishing for three months, forcing thousands of fishermen out of work and sending futures traders scrambling to bid up the prices of alternative animal feed ingredients. And most meteorologists believe much more is still to come, especially for North America.
Still, weather experts shudder at how exaggerating the likely impact of El Nino could end up costing businesses and consumers a lot of money: unnecessarily canceled vacations, hasty and poorly executed roof repairs where they may not be needed, overconfidence about low energy prices based on projections of a mild winter in the snow belt, shady stockbrokers hyping investments in building supply companies -- the list is endless. And they worry that unchecked misconceptions will end up breeding public skepticism when El Nino hype and misinformation are eventually exposed.
Michael R. Smith, president of Weather Data Inc., a weather forecasting and consulting firm based in Wichita, Kan., said he concluded things were "out of hand" during a recent trip to Southern California when he heard a television weatherman there attributing a wildfire to El Nino.
"You always have fires at this time of year out there," Mr. Smith said.
In the Midwest, harsh weather is much more common and sensitivity to changes is heightened because of its effects on transportation, farming and commodity markets. But Midwesterners, too, are not immune from El Nonsense. Although there is nothing unusual about fall blizzards on the Great Plains, for instance, Mr. Smith has fielded countless calls from clients assuming El Nino played a role in the severity of the snowstorm that socked the region late last month.
El Nino "events," as Mr. Davis and other weather experts call them, develop every three to five years. El Nino -- a reference to the birth of Jesus -- got its name from Peruvian fishermen, who noted nearly a century ago that the periodic ocean warming often peaked around Christmas.
The Peruvians realized such conditions often went hand in hand with unusually heavy rains and flooding. In recent decades, computers, satellites and vastly improved data gathering have made it clear that El Nino's tentacles spread to vast areas in Asia, Australia and Africa, which become much more susceptible to drought.
The warming water pattern also increases the likelihood of hurricanes and violent weather on Mexico's west coast while tending to suppress such giant storms in the Atlantic Ocean. During the winter, much of the southern tier of the United States, from California to Florida, is likely to experience heavier, more frequent winter rains.
El Nino commonly shakes up global temperatures, too, altering normal patterns enough to have an impact on certain regional energy markets. The Upper Midwest, a major cold weather market for natural gas, typically experiences milder-than-normal winters during an outbreak.
El Nino began to achieve celebrity status this summer when ocean temperatures rose so rapidly that this year's episode began shaping up as the strongest yet recorded, surpassing that of the winter of 1982-83. The climbing temperatures sent marlin, swordfish and other exotic warm water species north as far as Washington State, much to the delight of American anglers and TV camera crews.
But they also dredged up memories of the torrential winter rains and tornadoes in Southern California and other unusual weather attributed to the 1982-83 El Nino. By some estimates, weather linked to that El Nino killed 2,000 people around the world and caused $13.6 billion in damage.
Many Californians are rushing to prepare for an equally brutal winter this year. Demand for roofing material, gutters and related products is up as much as 20 percent from a year ago, according to Matthew Janke, inventory control manager for Ace Hardware, who monitors shipments from the hardware cooperative's warehouses to Ace members. Some Ace stores are encouraging the frenzy with special end-of-aisle displays tied to El Nino.
Indeed, local retailers that stand to benefit from "El Nino" can be quick to spread misconceptions. "The current extreme heat displays the power of El Nino," trumpeted a press release on Tuesday by Pioneer Roofing Tile Inc., which is based in Fontana, Calif., about 50 miles east of Los Angeles. It was looking to gain publicity to help increase sales of its roof repair products.
"That's ridiculous," said Mr. Davis, the Smith Barney meteorologist. No weather condition over just a few days in any one area should be blamed on El Nino, and while temperatures in Southern California were unusually high recently, extreme autumn heat there is not associated with El Nino, he said. Diane Hernandez, a spokeswoman at Waters & Company, Pioneer's public relations firm, said that "local media" had been the source of the company's information.
Lest anyone take too laid back an attitude about the potential dangers, a group of California state agencies is sponsoring El Nino preparedness briefings in communities ranging from San Diego to Chico, about 150 miles northeast of San Francisco. Local newspapers, television and radio stations feature a steady diet of El Nino-related reporting that runs the gamut from sober to silly to sarcastic.
"This is the best-publicized potential disaster in history," said Mr. Smith, the weather consultant. "Some of the precautions like cleaning out flood-control channels will pay off handsomely if there are problems. But people are drawing too close a parallel to 1982-83."
The deluge of coverage has spilled well beyond California, meteorologists say, and overwhelmed cautionary notes about how varied the impact of El Nino is likely to be around the country. Indeed, this year's El Nino has already diverged from the norm in many ways.
As often happens during an El Nino episode, Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia have suffered from drought this year. That calamity became acute and big news around the world last month when fires set to clear land burned out of control. That sent choking clouds of smoke across the region. By contrast, neither Australia nor India, which are also prone to El Nino-related droughts, have had severe water problems yet.
Such variations mean that it is just as easy to bet too heavily on El Nino-driven weather as to prepare too little. Cocoa future prices, which had been rising based in large part on fears that El Nino-related dryness in West Africa would limit this year's harvest, have tumbled recently with reports that those fears appear to be overblown.
Investors also need to be aware that business conditions may be very different from the last big El Nino 15 years ago. Even if weather patterns in the months ahead come close to those experienced in the fearsome 1982-83 El Nino, the results this time could be quite different. Already, for example, sugar production in Central America has been less hurt by drought than some investors expected because many farmers now irrigate their fields.
In any event, analysts note, bets on El Nino's impact have to be weighed against the many other factors that also affect business. Tensions with Iraq could send energy prices soaring even if this El Nino, as expected, produces a milder winter across much of North America.
Rather than betting on how closely this El Nino will track previous events, some businesses are focusing on the market volatility that comes with uncertainty about the weather. Utilicorp United, an energy provider and trader based in Kansas City, Mo., recognizes that natural gas prices could tumble in a mild winter but it has opted to buy and store more gas this winter than normal, according to a company spokesman. It does not want to worry about price gyrations after each winter storm.
Strange as it may seem, given El Nino's still-gathering strength and increasing fame, the biggest risk to the economy lies in what may come after El Nino has faded from the headlines. If El Nino wanes or gradually disappears altogether by next summer, as Government forecasters currently expect, farmers in the Midwest can expect fairly normal growing conditions.
But if temperatures in the eastern Pacific sink early and quickly fall into lower-than-normal ranges -- an event known as La Nina -- the chances of drought here in the world's most important farm region soar. With grain supplies already near post-World War II lows, La Nina could send prices to record highs, punishing consumers around the globe while encouraging farmers in developing countries to expand their environmentally disastrous practice of setting forest fires to clear land.
"Just the threat of that has limited the interest farmers have in selling all of the crop they are harvesting now or pre-selling next year," said Charles Flory, editor of ProFarmer Newsletter in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "The grain markets are saturated with information about El Nino but we certainly haven't factored in that worst-case scenario."

Traders in commodity markets have long known that the periodic warming of Pacific Ocean waters known as El Nino can have dramatic effects on weather patterns around the world. But this year for all the genuine dangers associated with the latest outbreak, weather experts worry that fears of El Nino have become so exaggerated that businesses and consumers may end up overreacting to the threat. One example: prices in commodities like cocca and coffee rose this summer, only to retreat after initial worries appeared overblown. Charts show the prices for coffee and cocca since July of 1997.

HEADLINE: Markets Fall Worldwide; Dow Off 101

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The around-the-world stock slide was back in sync again yesterday with another 3 percent fall in Hong Kong helping to depress markets in Europe, Latin America and the United States.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 195 points before recovering at the close to finish off 101.92, or 1.3 percent, at 7,581.32. European markets fell more than 2 percent. The biggest declines came in Latin America, with the Brazil market off more than 6 percent to a level below where it plunged last week. Mexico was down 3.5 percent. 
 The losses worldwide suggested two negatives for stocks. One is that the market's rally in recent days, which nearly erased the record 554-point plunge in the Dow average on Oct. 27, came too fast.
The second is that the drag on economic growth in the United States and the damage to American corporate earnings from the expected slowdown in Asia may have been underestimated. The slowdown is coming from the increase in interest rates needed to support currencies in Asia and calm financial markets.
"So this could still play out for a while," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in San Francisco. "We are not condemned to disaster, but some seem to be taking it too lightly."
Computer and high-technology stocks, including I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard, led the markets lower. These sectors have seesawed day to day, partly because of the feared impact from the slowdown in Asia. Stocks of companies that could be especially hurt by a slowdown of growth here, like Whirpool, Allied Signal and Goodyear Tire, also dropped sharply as more investors considered the drag from Asia on American growth next year.
Also adding to the decline was the Labor Department's strong employment report for October, which showed a 284,000 increase in nonfarm payroll jobs, a rise in hourly earnings and a drop in the unemployment rate to a 24-year low of 4.7 percent. All the data aggravated inflation concerns at a time when the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has noted that labor markets are already tight and likely to add to wage pressures.
But analysts said they did not think the strength of the jobs report would force the Fed to raise interest rates when its policy-making committee meets next week. That is because a rate increase in the United States could contribute to the turmoil in Asia and Latin America by forcing interest rates higher there.
In the bond market, the inflationary fears generated by the employment report depressed prices and sent yields on shorter maturities higher. But the losses were probably much less then they could have been because of buying from investors seeking a haven from the stock market turmoil. The yield on the 30-year Treasury settled at 6.16 percent, down from the 6.20 percent average at auction on Thursday.
One new element adding to the fear about contagion from financial turmoil in Asia yesterday was the recent decline in South Korea's currency and record 6.9 percent drop in its stock market.
Alone, the South Korean economy is the size of the four Southeast Asian countries -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines -- that became embroiled in the financial turmoil starting last summer.
"In a nutshell, if the crisis in South Korea were to deepen, the economic impact on Japan, the United States and emerging markets would be much greater because Korea's economy equals the size of the Southeast Asian countries already in trouble," said Desmond Lachman, global coordinator for emerging market research at Salomon Brothers.
John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said there was "still plenty of uncertainty" in the economic and financial outlook.
"It is easy to see," he said, "that the Korean economy is under pressure, and we don't know what government response will be."
The South Korean currency, the won, had held up well at the beginning of the Southeast Asian crisis, which started with the devaluation of Thailand's currency, the baht, in July. But at the end of October, the won began to tumble against the dollar, and is now off about 6 percent. Currency traders say that it was the next target to test.
South Korea also has a troubled banking sector and faces a presidential election next month that could make it more difficult for the Government to respond to a crisis. South Korean banks have been roiling emerging markets by selling a lot of the Latin American and other emerging market bonds they hold to raise funds. That selling has been a reason for the sharp decline in this market the last several days.
Mr. Lipsky said there could be another surprise if the financial turmoil does not subside. That would be in Europe, where, he said, investors and policy makers had not taken the Asian crisis seriously enough. "No one seems to be considering what would happen if the 1998 growth outlook for Europe became downbeat," he said.
In trading yesterday, things could have been worse, but an early rebound of the Dow that narrowed its loss to about 70 points helped European markets rally a little before closing. And the afternoon rebound from a 195-point deficit seemed to help Latin America, where Brazil's Bovespa index was off 10 percent at one point.
Thomas McManus, investment strategist at NatWest Securities, noted that the performance recently of consumer stocks, which generally hold up better when economic growth is slowing, compared with stocks sensitive to higher interest rates and sluggish growth, shows that investors are beginning to worry about a drag from Asia.
Since Oct. 14, the Morgan Stanley index of cyclical, or interest-rate-sensitive, stocks is down 9.7 percent, while the Morgan Stanley index of consumer stocks is off 1.3 percent.
One sign of investor confidence may be in the mutual fund data for the week ended Wednesday. It shows $2.8 billion of inflows into equity funds, compared with an outflow of $1.3 billion the previous week, according to AMG Data Services. But Robert Adler, the head of the firm, also noted that all equity funds had only regained about 44 percent of the value they lost in the previous week.

HEADLINE: With the Apocalypse Almost Now, It Becomes a New Field of Study

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
Doomsday prophecies have already become a familiar staple of popular television series, shrill tabloid headlines and trade paperbacks, but now the coming millennium has found a home in academia in a new scholarly field: millennial studies.
A surge of interest among scholars in what they refer to as "end-time" has produced a wave of books, papers, courses and conferences. Last year Boston University even created a Center for Millennial Studies as a clearinghouse for scholars. 
 With so many focusing on the millennium, new areas of research are opening up, ranging from reactions to the first millennium, the year 1000, to the impact of the apocalyptic tradition on the nuclear age. Throughout this new field, the term "millennium" increasingly refers not simply to a unit of time -- 1000 years -- but also to the biblical prophecy interpreted by some to mean that Jesus will appear, followed by Armageddon, a battle between good and evil, and by His 1,000-year reign on earth.
A result is that millennialists can be divided into "roosters" and "owls," according to the director and co-founder of Boston University's millennial center, Richard Landes. "The roosters say the apocalypse is imminent," he said in an interview. "Jesus, Paul and John, the presumed author of the Book of Revelation, were all roosters. The owls are the ones who say: 'Not yet. It is still the middle of the night.' " (Mr. Landes says he's an owl.)
At the heart of the new scholarly effort, Mr. Landes said, is the question: "What role do imagined futures have in shaping the present? The apocalypse is used as a conceptual framework for discussion of future cultural mutations."
Mr. Landes was one of the 100 or so scholars who attended a three-day conference this week sponsored by the millennial center and called "The Apocalyptic Other: Millennialist Views of Unbelievers Among Jews, Christians and Muslims." Historians, medievalists and theologians traded theories on the world's end and listened to papers on topics including "Locusts From the Bottomless Pit: Islamic Orientalism and Protestant Eschatology" and "The Mongols as Nonbelieving Apocalyptic Friends Around the Year 1260?"
In between papers, the scholars chatted about similarities between "Eco-Prophecy" (of the destruction of the environment) and biblical prophecies of the end of the world. They scanned the T-shirts and books for sale, like "Omens of the Millennium," by Harold Bloom, "Questioning the Millennium," by Stephen Jay Gould, and "The 2,000-Year-Old Man in the Year 2,000: The Book," by Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner.
Mr. Landes, author of "Relics, Apocalypse and the Deceits of History," a book on the first millennium, said that previously scholars believed there had been no reaction to the approach of the year 1,000. But thousands of Christians made pilgrimages to Jerusalem, he said, and the Peace of God movement of the 990's -- "weeping penitential warriors in huge public gatherings" -- had all the markings of a millennial movement.
Elsewhere, American historians are examining the way apocalyptic ideas have pervaded American culture. Paul Boyer, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin, helped set the standard for contemporary millennial studies in his 1992 book, "When Time Shall Be No More."
"Polls show that 30 to 50 percent of Americans believe that the end of history is foretold in the Bible," he said in a telephone interview. "Anyone interested in American culture has to take that seriously."
Mr. Boyer traces the evolution of apocalypticism from the Pilgrims, who believed they were founding a new Jerusalem, through the evangelical groups of the 18th and 19th centuries, with failed movements like that of the Millerites, followers of William Miller. Miller predicted the Second Coming in about 1843. When it didn't materialize, his disciples suffered what has come to be called "the Great Disappointment." (The Millerites were the forerunners of the Seventh-day Adventists, who do not ascribe an exact date to the end of the world.)
Mr. Boyer showed how "prophecy belief" has continued to shape ideas about nuclear war, the rise of Communism in the Soviet Union, the relationship between Israel and the Middle East.
In a similar vein, other scholars are examining millennarian ideas in contemporary American religious and political movements.
Michael Barkun, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, is studying how militia groups use the idea of the apocalypse, while Charles B. Strozier, a historian, has linked end-time beliefs with contemporary fundamentalist sects.
Hillel Schwartz, a senior fellow at the Millennium Institute in Arlington, Va., has studied how doomsday prophecies incorporate notions of economic ruin and fiscal horror, like "the Antichrist arising from the midst of the governors of the European Economic Community or the World Bank," he wrote in a recent essay.
At the Boston conference, Dr. Kenneth G. C. Newport, who teaches theology at Liverpool Hope University College in England, traced the image of the lamblike beast from the book of Revelation to its role in the theology of David Koresh and the Branch Davidians. Four years ago, 76 members of the sect and 4 Federal agents died during a siege of the Branch Davidians' compound near Waco, Tex. The lamblike beast is generally interpreted in Christian belief to be an ally of the Antichrist, who will appear before the end of the world actually occurs, Mr. Newport said.
"Koresh probably did intend to keep his promises to 'come out,' " Mr. Newport said. But, he added, "When on 28 February 1993, the F.B.I. arrived and laid siege to the Mount Carmel center, it must surely have seemed to those inside that those days had now come."
What happens to apocalyptic groups when the end of the world doesn't come? Some, Richard Landes said, simply reset the date. "When it didn't happen in 1,000," he said, "the French, for example, redated it to 1033."
"I think the whole notion of the Second Coming is an example of resetting the date," Mr. Landes said. "You say it didn't happen the first time, in the year 1,000. So you say it is going to come in the year 2,000."
Mr. Landes has no fear that interest in millennial studies will die out on the first day of the 21st century. "An apocalypse is like a ticket to the Superbowl," he said. "Once the game's over, if the right team doesn't win, you end up with people trying to bleach out the more embarrassing aspects. We're here to build an archive of late 20th- and early 21st-century material for future historians."

Surge in Jobs Last Month Raises Inflation Fear
The nation's unemployment rate declined to 4.7 percent in October, the lowest since 1973, the Labor Department said in a report that provided compelling evidence of further stamina in the United States economy.
 
 But the report contributed to weakness in the American financial markets because it showed an unexpected pickup in wages that could presage higher inflation. Some economists also worried that the Federal Reserve's flexibility to thwart inflation with higher interest rates has been hindered by the financial-market turmoil in Asia and Latin America, which could suffer from any upward pressure on rates.

HEADLINE: U.S. Immigration Court Grants Asylum to German Scientologist

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Nov. 7

 BODY:
A Federal immigration court judge has granted asylum to a German member of the Church of Scientology who claimed that she would be subjected to religious persecution had she been required to return to her homeland, the woman's lawyer and a Scientology official said today.
While few details of the case were available, it is believed to be the first time the United States has given asylum protection to a Scientologist. The Church of Scientology has been waging a highly public international campaign against what it considers discrimination against its members by the German Government. 
 The asylum case comes as the treatment of Scientologists in Germany remains a topic of dispute between Washington and Bonn, which has refused to recognize Scientology as a religion.
Officials at the German Embassy in Washington said today that they had not heard of the asylum decision and would have no reaction until it was confirmed.
For the last four years, the State Department has criticized Germany's treatment of Scientologists in its annual human rights report. But the dry language of the reports did not reach a level that might have been expected to justify asylum.
An immigration court judge decided to approve the woman's application to remain in this country after a hearing last February. Officials at the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington said they were unaware of the case.
John E. Lund, an immigration lawyer in Tampa who represents the German woman, said his client was in the United States legally.
"She voluntarily applied for asylum," Mr. Lund said, "and the matter was referred to the immigration court by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The court made the decision, based on her individual facts, that she should be granted asylum."
Mr. Lund said the woman's case was not part of any orchestrated effort by the Church of Scientology to publicize its claims of discrimination.
"Our matter was totally outside of any campaign by the church," Mr. Lund said. "This individual was acting solely on her own."
To protect relatives still in Germany, Mr. Lund and Scientology officials refused to disclose the woman's name or where she lived.
The asylum process is closed to the public for the protection of asylum seekers, said Richard L. Kenney, a spokesman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the immigration courts. Mr. Kenney said the decision of an immigration judge was final unless the Immigration and Naturalization Service appealed.
Kurt Weiland, an official with the Church of Scientology International, said a dozen German witnesses testified at the immigration hearing that the woman faced severe persecution in her homeland.
"She proved her suffering, the damage she experienced emotionally and economically, and how she was ostracized from society, all for no other reason than her religion," Mr. Weiland said.
German officials consider Scientology an extremist organization dedicated to bilking its parishioners of money. The German Government has barred Scientologists from membership in major political parties and placed the organization under surveillance. Some local governments have prohibited Scientologists from holding public service jobs.
Church members in Germany also claim that they have been barred from other types of jobs, that their businesses have been boycotted and that their children have been expelled from public schools.
Under international standards and American law, actions that restrict a person's rights to practice his or her religion, including prohibitions against membership in political parties or holding government jobs, could constitute persecution, said Karen Musalo, a lawyer and director of the international human rights project at Santa Clara University in California.
"Taken cumulatively," Ms. Musalo said, "these constitute serious forms of discrimination against the practitioners of a particular religion for the sole reason of their membership in this religion."
Under immigration law, religious persecution is one of five justifications for granting asylum to a foreigner in the United States. The others are race, nationality, political opinion and membership in a particular social group. People who are granted asylum are generally allowed to become permanent residents within a year.
In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, immigration judges heard 54,276 applications for asylum and granted 4,293 of them.
Mr. Kenney said that a decision made by a judge in one case would not be binding on applications by people in similar situations. Each request for asylum, he said, is judged individually.
A State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said he was unaware of the Scientology asylum case. But Mr. Rubin said the treatment of Scientologists in Germany was discussed on Wednesday by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in a meeting in Washington with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany.
The Clinton Administration has discussed the issue several times with German officials. While maintaining that Scientologists should be granted religious freedom, Ms. Albright herself accused the church of distorting history last summer when it compared its treatment to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany.
In January, 34 show-business celebrities ranging from actors to studio heads signed a $56,000 full-page advertisement in The International Herald Tribune scolding Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany for his Government's "shameful pattern of organized persecution" of the Church of Scientology.
The German Government has maintained that Scientology is not a religion, but a profit-making venture. Officials have argued that restricting the activities of the church members is necessary to protect against the expansion of an extremist group in a nation with acute sensitivities on the subject.
Until a landmark reversal in 1993, the United States Government also refused to recognize Scientology as an organized religion. In that year, the Internal Revenue Service granted tax-exempt status to the organization.
Congress entered the dispute last week. The House International Relations Committee approved a resolution condemning the German Government for its treatment of Scientologists and members of other minority religions.
The resolution drew a sharp protest from Foreign Minister Kinkel, who called the accusations of discrimination baseless and argued that Scientology's goals in Germany were exclusively economic.

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE DECLINES TO 4.7%, LOWEST SINCE 1973

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Unemployment fell last month to 4.7 percent, the lowest rate since 1973, helping push the hourly earnings of workers higher, the Government reported today.
Although this was good news for workers, private economists fear that an increasingly tight labor market will revive inflation, which has been remarkably absent through nearly seven years of economic expansion. 
 "We are beginning to see a pickup in wage increases that's closely related to the very low and still-declining unemployment rate," said Michael L. Penzer, senior economist at the Bank of America. With the unemployment rate well below 5.5 percent for the last year and a half, some acceleration in wages and prices is practically inevitable, he said.
In normal circumstances, the Federal Reserve would be expected to take some countermeasure, typically raising interest rates, to keep price increases in check. But with the recent financial turmoil in Asia, the Fed will be reluctant to raise rates at its meeting on Wednesday, analysts agreed, since such action could further upset global markets.
President Clinton seized on today's news to boast of the strongest economy in a generation and to appeal to Congress to set aside any fears that restoring broad Presidential trade authority would ultimately cost American jobs.
"Every time there's a trade agreement, we hear dire predictions of the consequences for American workers," he said at a news conference where he urged lawmakers to renew his authority to put trade pacts on the so-called fast track for quicker Congressional action. "The opponents of fast track would have you believe that if we hadn't done these trade agreements in the last five years, we'd still have all the good new jobs we have and we wouldn't have lost any jobs. That is simply not true."
Mr. Clinton said the economy, bolstered by exports to markets the United States had long sought to pry open, had added 13.5 million jobs since 1993. Analysts noted that the unemployment rate was nearly two percentage points lower than when the President signed the North American Free Trade Agreement in December 1993.
The assumption that the Federal Reserve would stay on the sidelines for the time being seemed to blunt market reaction to the unexpectedly strong job figures. Bond prices fell a bit and interest rates edged up, while stocks finished well above their lows of early in the day as the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day with a loss of about 102 points.
The Labor Department's monthly report was unambiguous in its portrayal of economic vigor, surprising analysts with its breadth as well as impressing them with such figures as payroll growth of 284,000, about one-third more than what most analysts had expected.
Factory jobs rose a sharp 54,000, continuing their recovery from a lull that ended just over a year ago, and construction added 20,000 last month, the biggest increase since May. Jobs in finance climbed 18,000, with 5,000 of these in brokerage houses, lifting the expansion of this industry to 19,000 since June.
"The job market continues to crank out new positions at an unsustainably fast rate," said Joshua N. Feinman, an economist at Bankers Trust. "Wages are starting to creep up, too."
As for the pay increases, the survey of employers showed a 6-cent jump, to $12.41, in average hourly earnings, a hefty increase that followed gains totaling 11 cents in August and September. Analysts said a 40-cent-an-hour increase in the Federal minimum wage that took effect Sept. 1 appeared to have been only a modest factor in the overall advance.
"Tightness in the labor market is intensifying," said Tim O'Neill, chief economist at Harris Bank/Bank of Montreal, noting that average earnings are now 4.2 percent higher than in October 1996, a half-point more than the September-to-September rise. The 4.2 percent rise is the largest for any 12-month period since July 1989.
Figures for hourly earnings, however, are not considered as good a measure as the Government's Employment Cost Index, calculated quarterly, which makes adjustments for shifts in the mix of higher-paid and lower-paid workers.
The decline in the unemployment rate, to the lowest since October 1973, resulted from a rise of 179,000 in the number of people with jobs combined with a shrinkage of 106,000 in the labor force, a combination that thinned the ranks of the jobless to fewer than 6.5 million.
Adult women accounted for much of the lower unemployment rate, as the jobless rate for women dropped to 4 percent.
Although there were more women with jobs, the main reason for the lower rate was fewer women in the labor force.
The jobless rate for all women, including teen-agers, dropped to 4.6 percent last month, the lowest since December 1969, from 5.1 percent in September.
The jobless rate for adult men was unchanged at 4.1 percent while that for all males was down one-tenth of a point, to 4.8 percent.
Some analysts fretted that the proportion of the working-age population that is in the labor force has now slipped to 66.9 percent from a March peak of 67.3 percent. A shrinking pool of available workers, if not reversed, would tighten the labor market even more and could mean mounting wage pressure.
One seeming anomaly in today's report was a plunge in the so-called quit rate, the share of the unemployed who voluntarily left their latest job. That is a statistic that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has often cited. After climbing sharply for much of the year, the quit rate fell to 11.2 percent last month from 12.9 percent in September.
This suggested that workers were more uneasy about their jobs, reluctant to leave in hopes of finding a better one despite a market where demand for workers is extremely strong.
By region, the improvement in the unemployment rate came from the South and West, each of which registered drops of three-tenths of a point, to 4.6 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively.
The jobless rate in the Northeast was unchanged at 5.3 percent, while the rate in the Midwest remained the nation's lowest at 4.2 percent.
A report today from the Federal Reserve showed that consumer borrowing rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.9 percent in September, a decline from the 4.2 percent rate in August and the slowest pace in three months.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says It Is Prepared To Use Force on Iraq

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Signaling a growing frustration with diplomatic efforts, the Clinton Administration made clear today that the United States was prepared to retaliate with force if President Saddam Hussein continued to defy the United Nations.
While President Clinton said the United States and its allies had to be "firm and resolute," Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen declared that "clearly some action" had to be taken to punish the Iraqi President. 
 Mr. Cohen, emerging as the Administration's strongest voice for retaliation, explicitly raised the possibility of a military strike.
In an interview on the ABC program "Good Morning America," he said the United Nations Security Council could consider "greater economic sanctions" and implied that it could refuse to renew the deal that allows Iraq to sell some oil for food and other relief supplies.
He then added: "There are a variety of things that can be done to put more pressure on Saddam Hussein, but clearly there are other options. There are military options, as well."
Mr. Cohen's remarks -- coupled with new warnings from Baghdad that Iraqi forces will shoot down American U-2 spy planes that fly over Iraq -- appeared to increase the possibility of a new military confrontation with Iraq, although officials said the United States would do nothing before the Security Council considered its options in a meeting on Monday.
For now, the United States has not put its sizable forces in the region on a heightened state of alert, as it did last year before attacking Iraq when Mr. Saddam Hussein's forces pushed into the Kurdish region in northern Iraq. But on Thursday the commander of the United States Central Command, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, canceled a scheduled port call this weekend by the Nimitz, the aircraft carrier steaming around the Persian Gulf.
In all, the United States has 20,000 troops in the region. More significantly, it has a dozen warships able to launch cruise missiles into Iraq, including the Nimitz, two cruisers, four destroyers, three frigates and an attack submarine. There are also more than 200 fighter aircraft stationed aboard the Nimitz or at bases in Saudi Arabia.
"We have everything we need," an Administration official said.
Ever since the latest confrontation began last month, the United States has been careful to insist that the matter was for the Security Council to resolve first, playing down the likelihood of a unilateral strike. The coalition against Iraq that fought the Persian Gulf war in 1991 has frayed, with countries like France, Russia and China arguing that it is time to ease sanctions imposed at the end of the war.
Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said they are worried that a strike by the United States would split the coalition. Those sensitivities, an official said today, are the reason the United States is unlikely to act on its own before exhausting diplomatic efforts at the United Nations next week.
"You're better off moving more slowly, with the international community, than acting unilaterally in a way that could do what Saddam Hussein wants, which is to divide the coalition," the official said.
At the State Department, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said she expected that the Security Council would take "firm action" to compel Mr. Saddam Hussein to cooperate with international inspections of Iraq's weapons and drop a demand that all Americans be excluded from the inspection teams.
She declined to elaborate on what that action might be, and Mr. Clinton, speaking to reporters at the White House, said it was inappropriate to discuss any options the United States and its allies on the Security Council might be considering.
The President added, however, that he had seen "no indication" that the United States' allies had lost their resolve. "Everyone seems to be united in their determination to restore the inspections on terms that the United Nations decides, not on Saddam Hussein's terms," he said.
With United Nations envoys having failed to break the impasse, however, officials sounded increasingly impatient today.
"We went the extra mile diplomatically by allowing and supporting the idea of this mission," the State Department's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said of the envoys' trip to Baghdad.
"To the extent that governments around the world want to see all diplomatic means pursued before going farther in the Security Council towards firm action, this mission hopefully will have united the world in the conclusion that we've done all we can," he said.

HEADLINE: Racism Is (a) Entrenched? Or (b) Fading?;
The Answer for Many Is (b) as Optimists Dispute Decades of Pessimism on Race Relations

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
"America in Black and White," a new book by Stephen and Abigail Thernstrom, is a vast, data-laden study whose most important conclusion is that the United States has gone a long way in the past six decades toward eliminating the stain of racism from the white American heart.
"A Country of Strangers: Blacks and Whites in America" by David Shipler, another large, data-filled book, comes to the nearly opposite conclusion. Racism has not disappeared, says Mr. Shipler, but has simply gone underground; so this is still a nation living on two sides of a yawning racial divide. 
 Two weighty new books; two very different points of view on what remains the primordial American subject: race. In a publishing season that has brought a large outpouring of new works on race relations, these two ambitious books represent a sharpening of the debate. How to characterize the two points of view?
Prof. Randall Kennedy of the Harvard Law School speaks of two traditions, one optimistic and the other pessimistic, that have almost always coexisted on the fiendishly complicated question of race. The two traditions -- debated this week at the Manhattan Institute in New York, where the Thernstroms faced off with some of their adversaries -- are present in virtually all of the new books.
"The pessimistic tradition, represented by such very different figures as Thomas Jefferson and Malcolm X, holds that racism is so deeply entrenched in the American soul that it will never loosen its grip, even if it does change form," Mr. Kennedy said. "Then there's the counter-tradition, the optimistic tradition, represented by Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr. and many others: We have gigantic problems but we shall overcome."
The optimistic tradition, which includes Mr. Kennedy's own book, "Race, Crime and the Law," may represent a new turn in the scrutiny of race in America. While many points of view have always competed for attention, it is probably fair to say that the pessimistic tradition -- or at least the view that the country is doing badly in its efforts to bring about true racial justice -- has predominated for several decades. Now, judging from the recent flood of new books, a troubled optimism has risen more strongly than ever before.
For most of the last 30 years or so, the prevailing view expressed in books and by political leaders like the Rev. Jesse Jackson or the directors of the major civil rights groups was that America was continuing to fulfill the dire predictions made by the Kerner Commission report. Formed in the aftermath of the devastating urban riots of the 1960's, the Kerner Commission predicted that the country was "moving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal." It also found that the main responsibility for this unfavorable state of affairs was "the tenacity of white racism."
That theme ran heavily through much of the commentary on race. There was, for example, Andrew Hacker's 1992 book, "Two Nations," a national best seller whose basic argument was that the Kerner Commission was correct. Another influential book of the time was Derrick Bell's "Faces at the Bottom of the Well," which argued that even those herculean efforts we hail as successful will produce no more than "short-lived victories that slide into irrelevance as racial patterns adapt in ways that maintain white dominance." Clearly, books like Mr. Shipler's and several others, including "Long Way to Go," a study of race in Milwaukee by Jonathan Coleman, though more nuanced, elaborate on the pessimistic tradition. They try to show, in large part by examining the states of mind of both blacks and whites, that racism continues to be responsible for many of the disadvantages that blacks experience.
In one climactic moment near the end of his book, for example, Mr. Shipler reports on a corporate diversity training seminar during which the leader asks how many of the people present had "considered not having children because of racism." When a dozen or so women, mostly black or Hispanic, stand up, having decided that the "trial of raising a black child in America would be too severe," Mr. Shipler uses the occasion to reflect on the enduring strength of racial misunderstanding:
"We cannot escape from our intimate histories, our unacknowledged racial mixtures, our awkward and unsatisfying efforts at integration. We have not completely purged the prejudices from our inner thoughts: We do not discount the body's appearance, the voice's sound, the suspicions of the mind's inadequacy."
That is a powerful statement. But it is also exactly the sort of declaration that has been energetically challenged by the new wave of books.
The most encyclopedic and perhaps the most optimistic of them is the Thernstroms', which has already been widely reviewed, both positively and negatively. Among the others is Mr. Kennedy's "Race, Crime and the Law," a penetrating study of the ways in which racial politics has affected the legal system. In it Mr. Kennedy argues that we have moved a long way since the era of Jim Crow toward eliminating racism from the law.
Among the most sharply polemical of the new books are "Liberal Racism," by the journalist and essayist Jim Sleeper, and "The Ordeal of Integration," by Mr. Kennedy's colleague at Harvard, the sociologist Orlando Patterson. Both rail against what Mr. Patterson calls "the bizarre cult of the victim that has become the hallmark of late-20th-century liberal doctrine."
Mr. Patterson writes perhaps the harshest and most unforgiving response to the Kerner Commission-Hacker point of view. He cites one passage in Mr. Hacker's book in which the author describes the pain he says parents must feel at telling their children they will never be "treated as other Americans."
"Oh God!" Mr. Patterson writes sarcastically. "And this is barely the start of the daily pile of agonies. . . . For even a Colin Powell must know in his heart that even though he may have headed the greatest military machine in the history of the world, he is still only a nigger in the eyes of the land he has so loyally served."
Similarly, Mr. Sleeper, a strong opponent of what he calls "diversity-driven color coding," argues that many liberals have fostered the idea that "one's skin color determines one's destiny." Put another way, he says, the very people "who fought nobly to help this country rise above color have become so blinded by color that they have leapt ahead of conservatives to draw new race lines in the civic sand."
These books in the optimistic tradition are by no means alike, and none proclaim that racial equality has been achieved. But they are all inclined to give the country a good deal more credit in the battle against racism than the books in the pessimistic tradition. Speaking of the Kerner Commission, for example, the Thernstroms say: "What is striking, with the benefit of hindsight, is not how prescient the report was, but how far off the mark it has turned out to be."
What the authors do disagree on is the cause. The Thernstroms argue that more progress was made between 1940 and 1960, when there were no special government programs aimed at insuring racial equality, and they use that argument in a powerful attack on affirmative action. Mr. Patterson, by contrast, is an ardent defender of affirmative action and gives it credit for much of the progress that has been made.
Still, Mr. Patterson writes, "The changes that have taken place in the United States over the past 50 years are unparalleled in the history of minority-majority relations." And where serious problems exist, including the high number of black males in the criminal justice system and the rise in out-of-wedlock births among blacks, Mr. Patterson rejects the conventional "two-nation" theory that racism is at work.
Not surprisingly, each of the various arguments seems to carry a political subtext. Those who emerge in the "pessimist" camp are more likely to favor racial preference programs, the "optimists" to oppose them.
Mr. Patterson alone seems to break this pattern. Though clearly in the optimistic camp, he argues in his book, "Affirmative action has made a major difference in the lives of women and minorities, in the process helping to realize, as no other policy has done, the nation's constitutional commitment to the ideal of equality, fairness and economic integration."

HEADLINE: HOUSE POSTPONES TRADE-ISSUE VOTE

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
President Clinton encountered new obstacles today in assembling the majority needed to pass legislation granting him expanded trade authority, forcing him to ask House leaders to delay a vote on the bill at least until Sunday.
Mr. Clinton spent another day and night seeking votes for the so-called fast-track measure, but the gains were slim. By nightfall the White House still appeared to be about 10 to 15 votes short of a majority. 
 The trade debate became entangled in the unrelated issue of funds for family planning programs overseas and the subtle play of politics and egos between the President and Speaker Newt Gingrich.
The White House expressed hope that an additional 48 hours would give the President time to make his case for the measure, which allows him to negotiate trade treaties that Congress must approve or reject without amendment.
The President again issued a public plea for support today, as he had on Thursday night, insisting that the nation's economic security depended on a renewal of his unencumbered power to negotiate trade agreements, a power that other world leaders possess. Every President since Gerald R. Ford has had such authority, but Mr. Clinton allowed his to lapse before the last election, fearing the issue would divide his party.
"More than ever, our economic security is also the foundation of our national security," the President said today. "Our strength depends upon our economic allies, our trading partners and our economy. It affects our ability to get other nations to cooperate with us militarily, and against the new threats of terrorism and drugs, organized crime and weapons proliferation."
He said defeat of the measure would send a signal that the United States did not want to be a full partner in the global trading system.
"It would be folly to turn back now," Mr. Clinton said in a televised statement from the Roosevelt Room in the White House.
The White House also prepared amendments intended to attract support. One would declare fast-track authority to be a matter of national security, making a vote against it more difficult. Another would set up Congressional delegations to monitor compliance with trade agreements. A third would give the President authority to impose harsh sanctions on countries that violate agricultural trade pacts.
But the President's task of rounding up votes was complicated by a high-volume debate on the question of financing family planning programs overseas, a politically charged issue that is certain to cost the President votes no matter what position he adopts. A partisan squabble over how to conduct the census in 2000 was also injected into the debate, with some Republican threatening to withhold support for the trade bill unless President Clinton drops his plan to use sampling rather than direct counting.
Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, insisted family planning and the census should not be linked to the trade debate.
Opponents of family planning and abortion want Mr. Clinton to rescind United States financial support for international organizations that provide or counsel abortion. The appropriations bill for State Department foreign operations contains $385 million for such programs.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott warned Mr. Clinton this morning that if he did not agree to a compromise on the abortion issue, he would lose the House vote on the trade issue because anti-abortion members who now support the bill would defect.
But several Democratic members of Congress -- including some who now support "fast track" authority -- protested vehemently, saying such a reversal would cost him votes.
Mr. Clinton also had to contend with restive members of his own party who have been alienated by his assertions that opponents of the trade measure are succumbing to pressure from labor unions and environmental groups. And he angered some Democrats today by saying that a vote for fast-track authority is a "no brainer," implying that opponents were acting irrationally.
Mr. Gingrich, whose credibility as House leader is also at stake, said he had persuaded several more Republicans to support the measure, bringing the Republican count to about 160. That means that Mr. Clinton could win with the votes of 60 Democrats, less than a third of the party caucus but still a high hurdle in a party deeply divided on the issue of free trade.
"We are going to cooperate with the Clinton Administration in every way we can to get it through," Mr. Gingrich said. "In all fairness, they face a much harder job and the labor union pressure -- and, frankly, blackmail -- has been so extraordinary."
Mr. Gingrich is the President's firmest ally on Capitol Hill on the fast-track bill, but he is making certain that Mr. Clinton suffers the agony of having to drag reluctant members of his own party into the "yes" column.
One White House official expressed confidence that ultimately Mr. Gingrich would deliver enough votes to assure passage. "He doesn't want to be the first Speaker since Gerald Ford was President who could not get fast-track authority through the House," the official said.
But Representative Richard Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House and the chief of the fast-track foes, expressed concern that the President, in his eagerness to accommodate Mr. Gingrich and the Republicans, would cut deals that are anathema to Democrats.
"This fast track is bad enough," Mr. Gephardt complained. "The President should publicly stand up and say that he won't trade away core Democratic values for Republican votes."
Commerce Secretary Bill Daley and the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, were on the Hill again today on behalf of the Administration and announced that they had snagged five undecided votes, from Representatives Bob Clement of Tennessee, Anna Eshoo of California, Ike Skelton of Missouri, Bobby R. Etheridge of North Carolina and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota.
"This is a matter of national security," said Mr. Skelton. "This is about America staying engaged in the world."
But several other Democratic House members were infuriated that President Clinton had suggested that they opposed the measure only because they were beholden to organized labor, which strongly opposes the bill. Mr. Clinton said Thursday that the bill would win overwhelmingly if the vote were held in private, implying that many Democrats would vote no only because they feared retaliation from the unions.
Mr. Gephardt called Mr. Clinton's questioning of the motives of his opponents "a sign of desperation."
"Members of Congress are honorable people who base their decisions on what they believe is in their constituents' best interest," Mr. Gephardt said. "I don't question the motives of those who disagree with me.
The President's comments also provoked a half-dozen Democratic women in the House to call a news conference to denounce any suggestion of a compromise on international family planning programs.
When he came into office, Mr. Clinton signed an executive order rescinding President Reagan's order banning financing for any international family planning groups that perform abortions or counsel on abortions and provide family planning services. Now some Democrats fear that Mr. Clinton is considering agreeing to Mr. Reagan's language.
"The White House wants to work, in this period of time before the vote is brought up again, some secret deals on the appropriations bills," said Rosa L. DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut. "Our votes are not for sale in this process. We won't allow playing fast and loose with appropriations bills and policy that we feel deeply about."
Representative Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat who is undecided on the trade issue and strongly supports abortion rights, said any compromise on funds for family planning would be "unconscionable," and said it would probably cause her to vote against the trade bill.

Takin' Up for Daddy

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: COLLEGE STATION, Tex.

 BODY:
The Bushes were supposed to be celebrating. But they were too busy vindicating.
The Yalie was too a Texan. George Bush did too make the right decision when he took his foot off Saddam's neck. Dan Quayle was not a mistake. George Bush should too have raised taxes. George Bush was too a better man than Bill Clinton. 
 Two-term Presidents have the luxury of obsessing about their legacy. One-term Presidents are left rationalizing their rejection.
That may be why Bush fils the Texas Governor played cactus at the august tableau of the Bush Presidential Library at Texas A & M. Stepping up to the microphone with his mother and father, Bill and Hillary Clinton and all the other White House alumni decorously arranged behind him, George W. praised his father as "a man who entered the political arena and left with his integrity intact." Get it?
As President Clinton looked intently down at his speech, Governor Bush spit out an anathema against the man who had beat his father. George Bush, his eldest son said, was a "war hero, loving husband . . . and a President who brought dignity and character and honor to the White House."
He talked about the judgment of "objective historians." Subtext: The Bushes still loathe Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and Ted Koppel. (One of the Governor's strategists drolly told me I was O.K., for a Commie.)
The Aggie cadets in brown shirts sitting near me whooped at the Governor's brazenness.
The Clintonites grumbled that as George W. sneered at Mr. Clinton's ethics, Neil Bush, who barely survived his brush with the S.&L. scandal, was in the front row, and that the Bushies, so scornful of Clinton-Gore fund-raising escapades in the White House and on Air Force One, had pressured the White House into giving one of their rich friends, the Aga Khan, a ride back from the dedication to Washington on Air Force One.
George Stephanopoulos found George W.'s edgy speech not only bad manners but bad politics. "Get over it," he said. "They keep believing they can exalt themselves by running down Clinton's character. But Clinton keeps winning."
George W. was serving notice on that stage that he would be the instrument of vindicating his father's loss to Bill Clinton, by whupping Al Gore's Ellen-lovin', no-controlling-legal-authority-excusin', tree-huggin' self. At the luncheon the Governor hosted afterward, one Aggie big shot speculated about the land the university could use for the George W. Bush Presidential Library, so that it could be adjacent to his dad's.
Bush pere must have feared they were on the brink of a horrifying etiquette breach, because he made a point of saying in his speech that Bill had beat him "fair and square."
George W. does not have the exquisite manners or clubby discretion of his father. He brags that he went to Sam Houston Elementary School in Midland, not Greenwich Day School, and he speaks with a twang that makes you believe this George Bush really does like beef jerky. Like his mother, he can bristle, and blow -- and he never forgets a slight, much less a rout.
After his father's defeat, the hotheaded Junior transformed himself into an engaging, disciplined politician, a Presidential contender. (He and rival Dan Quayle greeted each other warily at the dedication.)
"George W. is more like Reagan than like Bush," said a former Bush official who thinks George W. will be the next President. "He knows what he believes in."
George senior, who hates reflection, self-aggrandizement and assessing blame, insists he will not write his Presidential memoirs.
His ambivalence about attention was on poignant display at the dedication. He bit the inside of his cheek and squirmed and looked sheepish, at times almost scowling, at all the lavish praise from his predecessors. (Nancy Reagan, who never invited the Bushes to dinner at the White House residence in eight years, couldn't resist a bit of condescension, calling Mr. Bush Ronald Reagan's "other loyal partner." Barbara listened, all Greenwich granite.)
Since Mr. Bush will not sit still to write about "the big I," he must find other ways to make sure his Administration gets credit for starting some of the economic and foreign policies that have contributed to peace and prosperity -- not to mention a second term for Mr. Clinton.
Why write a memoir when you can run a son?

Colleges Look for Answers To Racial Gaps in Testing

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
Universities around the country are facing an agonizing dilemma: If they retain their affirmative-action admissions' policies they face growing legal and political challenges, but if they move to greater reliance on standardized tests, the results will be a return to virtual racial segregation.
Test scores by black and Hispanic students remain stubbornly below those of whites. This phenomenon, which cuts across all income groups, is only now being widely studied, with several scholarly reports offering new explanations for it. 
 At the same time, longtime critics of standardized tests are finding wider sympathy for their argument that the tests are misguided. New data suggest that S.A.T. scores and their professional-school equivalents are weak predictors of academic and career success.
Still, admission officials say that much as they would love to rely more on nuanced measures like essays and interviews, the pressures to use test scores are growing from the sheer volume of applicants, limited budgets for evaluating them and the rise of college ranking guides that emphasize test scores.
Many officials agree with Donald M. Stewart, president of the College Board, who says that the risk of increased reliance on standardized tests is "simply, the resegregation of higher education."
"We're looking at a potential wipeout that could take away an entire generation," Mr. Stewart said. "The social cost of that would be too high. America can't stand that."
Concerns over standardized tests are as old as the tests themselves. But with the nation's two most populous states, California and Texas, now forbidden to use race in university admissions, and with similar bans anticipated elsewhere, those concerns have become central to the searing national debate over race relations.
In the past few months:
*The Texas Legislature has ordered the University of Texas system to accept all students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their class irrespective of their S.A.T. scores.
*The Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund has filed a lawsuit against the State of Texas, saying that its high school graduation examination, on which black and Mexican-American students fail at a much higher rate than non-Hispanic whites, is discriminatory.
*The University of California has set up a commission to consider whether to drop or reduce the importance of S.A.T.'s and is increasing its budget to reach out to members of minorities.
*The American Bar Association and the Law School Admission Council have begun a study intended to find ways to reduce reliance on the Law School Admission Test (L.S.A.T.) across the country.
*The Educational Testing Service of Princeton, N.J., which administers many of the country's standardized tests, has grown defensive. It issued a lengthy statement warning against overreliance on the tests and urging that many measures of merit be simultaneously used. "Equating scores with merit," it said, "supports a mythology that is not consistent with the reality of data."
 
The Scores
Adding Meanings To the Numbers
The issue of race and merit is freighted with emotional and political baggage, as was made clear when Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray published "The Bell Curve" (The Free Press, 1994), a best seller asserting that the likeliest explanation for the gap in scores is genetic.
Most of the discussion since then has been an effort to discredit the book's explanation -- widely criticized as racist -- in favor of socioeconomic, historic, psychological and cultural ones. The legal and popular attacks on affirmative action have only added to the sense of urgency on the topic in the scholarly literature.
American Psychologist, the premier journal in its field, published by the American Psychological Association, has dealt with aspects of it in nearly every issue of the past half year, with titles like "Schooling, Intelligence and Income" and "A Threat in the Air: How Stereotypes Shape Intellectual Identity and Performance."
Change magazine, largely read by administrators in higher education, devoted seven pages in its March/April 1997 issue to the article "Standardized Testing: Meritocracy's Crooked Yardstick," and The Chronicle of Higher Education, a weekly publication, has been running frequent news and opinion pieces on the subject.
The gap in scores between non-Hispanic white students and black and Hispanic students tracks across all tests, from I.Q. to achievement tests. It narrowed in the 1970's and 80's but has remained steady in the past decade.
The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, arguing that "African Americans are struggling to overcome 200 years of white supremacy and educational segregation" and therefore need affirmative action to progress, gave over part of its most recent issue to a comparison between white and black scores on the S.A.T.'s, A.C.T.'s, L.S.A.T's and Medical College Admission Test, or M.C.A.T.'s. The article sought to show that a reliance on such scores would prove devastating to blacks.
Among the data cited were that the median combined M.C.A.T. for whites rejected for admission to medical schools nationwide in 1996 -- 25.2 out of 30 -- was significantly higher than the median M.C.A.T. score of blacks -- 23.5 -- who were admitted.
In addition, the article pointed out that while blacks make up 10 percent of the more than 1.1 million high school seniors who took the S.A.T., they constituted only 1 percent to 2 percent of those scoring in the range required by many of the nation's elite universities. Only 659 of the 110,000 black college-bound seniors who took the S.A.T. scored above 700 out of a possible 800 on the math part, and only 900 scored above 700 on the verbal section. Nationally, 62,517 students scored above 700 on the math part and 52,835 scored above it on the verbal part.
The gap, the study argued, means little about the potential for blacks' achievement, and the authors cited an arresting example from history. In 1951, Martin Luther King Jr. took the Graduate Record Exam for admission to a doctoral program at Boston University. The verbal aptitude score of a man who is now viewed as among the nation's greatest orators ever was in the third quartile, or below average. His quantitative score was in the bottom 10 percent, and he was in the bottom quarter for tests in physics, chemistry, biology, social studies and the fine arts.
The journal said that if tests were used as the main measure of potential by admissions committees at the nation's top colleges and universities, "black enrollments at these institutions will drop by at least one half and in many cases by as much as 80 percent."
A study published by New York University Law Review in April makes a similar point for law schools. It concluded that if they were to apply to blacks a formula for admissions based on L.S.A.T. score plus grade point average typically used as a cutoff for whites, the precentage of black applicants admitted across the country would fall to about 3 percent from the current 26 percent.
Most universities use a combination of test score and grade point average as a threshold for admissions, with the scale generally lower for minorities than for whites. Those who qualify in each group are then examined for other factors, like special talents and unusual backgrounds.
The Center for Individual Rights in Washington has recently sued the University of Michigan on behalf of white students who said efforts to increase campus diversity by admitting black and Hispanic students with lower tests and grades violated the Constitution.
This suit follows a successful similar one against the University of Texas and a referendum in California that ended racial preferences in admissions. Today, all universities in both states are struggling for ways to keep minority students applying and admitted without offering them admissions preferences.
There is a twist to the testing gaps: the standardized tests themselves were designed half a century ago at least partly to reduce the impact of family and background on university admissions. The idea was that not every student was born rich but that any student could study hard and prove scholarly potential.
While certain groups, notably East European Jews and some Asians, have found such tests an entrance ticket into elite institutions, others, mostly African-Americans and those of Hispanic origin, like Puerto Ricans and Mexican-Americans, have not.
Scholars are divided over the reasons for the continuing gaps in scores.
A few, like the authors of "The Bell Curve," argue that some groups are simply better able to learn than others. Indeed, the book said that since "less intelligent" groups were having far more babies than more intelligent ones, the United States faced an unseen peril in an era when intelligence was the key to economic progress.
Other scholars say the tests themselves have a kind of cultural bias detrimental especially to the poor and underprivileged. Questions, they say, refer to things like "regattas" and "esthetics" that are more familiar to certain classes.
Increasingly, scholars are pursuing a third approach, a complex blend of psychology and culture. They say that pure socioeconomic arguments do not suffice and suspect that the answers lie in nuanced group dynamics.
"It is clear that socioeconomic status will not substitute for race in these data," said Linda F. Wightman, author of the law school study and an associate professor in the department of educational research methodology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
"Within any ethnic group," Ms. Wightman said, "as the socio-economic status goes down, so do the scores, but within the same socio-economic status, there are big differences between groups."
 
The Results
Trouble Assessing Ability to Achieve
Wendy M. Williams and Stephen J. Ceci of the Department of Human Development at Cornell University published an article in the November 1997 issue of American Psychologist entitled "Are Americans Becoming More or Less Alike?" in which they concluded that although the black-white gap had hardly gone away, it had decreased.
They referred to pioneering work done by the New Zealand scholar James Flynn, who has found that for the past 65 years I.Q. scores have been increasing in every country where they have been measured and that I.Q. scores of black Americans are about where white ones were two generations ago.
This suggests, Professor Williams said, that there is much greater malleability of such tests than previously believed and that I.Q. tests, like S.A.T.'s, are open to unforeseen influences like, probably, the sophistication or urban nature of the society in which one lives.
Support was lent to that view by a study presented in August by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis. They found that comparing I.Q. test scores of blacks and whites in their last year of high school and again at the end of college showed that blacks improved their scores more than four times as much as whites, cutting the I.Q. gap in half.
Professor Williams, like Robert J. Sternberg at Yale University, argues that current standardized tests measure a specific, static kind of intelligence when there are, in fact, several different kinds of intelligence.
Professor Sternberg has created a model of a three-pronged intelligence, analytical, creative and practical, and says that when students take the intelligence tests he designed, high scorers are more ethnically and racially diverse.
A different and equally intriguing study was carried out by Claude Steele of Stanford University, suggesting that blacks, like women, absorb negative self-images from the environment, driving down their scores on standardized tests.
As reported in American Psychologist in June, Professor Steele found that when blacks taking a test were told that such tests showed no distinction in white-black scores, they did as well as the white test-takers. But when they were told nothing or had to tick off their race on a form before starting, their scores were lower than those of whites. Similar gaps emerged for women.
"Blacks in America are like people on thin ice," Professor Steele said in a telephone interview. "Any little creak means a lot. We can manipulate the environment to make it more or less trustworthy for them."
All of these studies arrive at a time when those mistrustful of standardized tests have begun accumulating a critical mass of data suggesting that the tests are less predictive of academic or professional success or both than many had believed.
A study of doctors trained at the medical school at the University of California at Davis from 1968 to 1987 found that those with lower scores and grades because of race or unusual background went on to careers indistinguishable from those admitted on academic merit alone.
Professor Lightman's study of law school admissions found that 73 percent of the black students who would not have been admitted under a pure scores-plus-grades formula went on to graduate and pass their bar exams. This is lower than the white rate of 90 percent passing but is impressively high, nonetheless.
A recent unpublished dissertation at the Harvard Graduate School of Education contends that of students admitted in three classes in the 1950's, 60's and 70's, those with lower S.A.T. scores and more blue-collar backgrounds ended up more successful, as measured by income, community involvement and professional satisfaction, said Marlyn McGrath Lewis, director of admissions for Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges.
And Professors Williams and Sternberg jointly published a study in American Psychologist in June showing that the psychology Graduate Record Examination was of limited use in predicting success as a psychology graduate student, correlating mildly with first-year grades but almost nothing else.
 
The Future
Perpetual Search For Perfect Test
The gathering data along with the gathering storm over affirmative action have produced, for the first time, a cross-disciplinary movement to take a hard look at the role of the tests, up until now limited largely to advocacy groups like Fairtest in Cambridge, Mass.
The use of tests to determine who gets a National Science Foundation scholarship and the use of P.S.A.T.'s to determine semifinalists in National Merit Scholarships have therefore come under greater attack.
Christopher F. Edley Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School, is planning a seminar later this month at Harvard to deal with the topic in the hope of coming up with recommendations for the nation's universities.
"Given the weak predictive ability of the tests," Professor Edley said, "it is reasonable to worry that the public has seriously misunderstood the proper role of these tests in the selection process.
"The challenge for higher education leaders is to understand that these simple grids and indices are a bad way to think about merit. And as pressure mounts to dismantle affirmative action, there will be increased pressure to abuse these tests."
Some 284 colleges, like Bates College in Maine, have chosen to stop requiring test scores from their applicants.
William Hiss, a vice president of Bates, said that internal college data showed that those who did not submit their scores but were admitted got 160 points lower than those who did submit their scores. Yet, the two groups show no difference either in grades or graduation rates.
The lower scorers, Mr. Hiss said, include not only minority students but also whites from working-class backgrounds, students who grow up speaking another language at home, more women than men, and those with what he called "spike talents," those who are excellent musicians or set designers or athletes.
Bates's no-test policy had helped double its minority representation, Mr. Hiss said.
Still, most colleges and universities see no reason to abandon the tests, saying they must simply keep them in perspective. The tests may be weak predictors of performance but are still among the best in a country with widely varying academic standards in high school.
For the moment, then, the main impact of the discussion seems to be to push admissions officers to search for broader measures of merit and potential. The problem is that doing so is expensive and often laborious.
But Robert M. Berdahl, chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, said such steps were necessary, adding: "We're on the verge of a major debate over the validity of these tests because the mood of the country is to say that affirmative action has run its course. Yet we must continue to offer opportunities to those denied them in the past. We're struggling here with an issue that is at the very heart of American society and we cannot let this one go."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "VERBATIM: A Better I.Q. Test?"
Robert J. Sternberg of Yale University argues that there are three kinds of intelligence -- analytical, practical and creative -- and that most I.Q. tests measure only the first. On his tests, black and Hispanic students do relatively better than they do on traditional I.Q. tests.
 
These are sample questions from his test for high school seniors.
 
PRACTICAL
 
1. Think of a problem that you are currently experiencing in real life. Briefly describe the problem, including how long it has been present and who else is involved (if anyone). Then describe three different practical things you could do to try to solve the problem.
(Students are given up to 15 minutes and up to 2 pages.)
 
2. Choose the answer that provides the best solution, given the specific situation and desired outcome.
 
John's family moved to Iowa from Arizona during his junior year in high school. He enrolled as a new student in the local high school two months ago but still has not made friends and feels bored and lonely. One of his favorite activities is writing stories. What is likely to be the most effective solution to this problem?
 
A. Volunteer to work on the school newspaper staff.
B. Spend more time at home writing columns for the school
C. Try to convince his parents to move back to Arizona.
D. Invite a friend from Arizona to visit during Christmas break.
 
Each question asks you to use information about everyday things. Read each question carefully and choose the best answer.
 
Mike wants to buy two seats together and is told there are pairs of seats available only in Rows 8, 12, 49, and 95-100. Which of the following is not one of his choices for the total price of the two tickets?
 Chart shows seat prices, by row
A. $10.
B. $20.
C. $30.
D. $40.
 
CREATIVE
 
1. Suppose you are the student representative to a comittee that has the power and the money to reform your school system. Describe your ideal school system, including buildings, teachers, curriculum, and any other aspects you feel are important.
(Students are given up to 15 minutes and up to 2 pages.)
 
2. Each question has a Pretend statement. You must suppose that this statement is true. Decide which word goes with the third underlined word in the same way that the first two underlined words go together.
 
Colors are audible.
 
flavor is to tongue as shade is to
 
A. ear.
B. light.
C. sound.
D. hue.
 
3. First, read how the operation is defined. Then, decide what is the correct answer to the question.
There is a new mathematical operation called flix.
It is defined as follows:
 
 A flix B = A + B, if A > B
but A flix B = A x B, if A < B
and A flix B = A / B, if A = B
 
How much is 4 flix 7?
 
A. 28.
B. 11.
C. 3.
D. -11.
 
ANSWERS. Practical: 2,A. 3,B. Creative: 2,A. 3,A.

Clinton, Under Fire, Wins Delay in Trade Vote
In an effort to win passage of a bill giving him expanded trade authority, President Clinton asked members of the House to put off the vote at least until Sunday. He tried to win more votes, but the gains were slim, and he appeared to be short of a victory. A1 

Iraq Rebuffs U.N. on Weapons
United Nations envoys returned from Iraq with a message from President Saddam Hussein that he would not reverse his decree barring American arms inspectors. He renewed threats to attack American spy planes that fly over Iraq to monitor its weapons program. A1
 
The Clinton Administration made clear it is prepared to retaliate with force if Iraq persists in defying the United Nations. A6
 
Bishop's Sister Attacked
The 63-year-old sister of Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia was assaulted with a hammer at the cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas, in southern Mexico. She was hospitalized but is not in critical condition, doctors said. A 23-year-old man confessed to attacking her and criticized Bishop Ruiz, who survived a shooting attack a few days ago, for being an advocate of the Zapatista rebels who for several years have tried to promote the rights of indigenous peoples in the state.

French Strike Nears End
A five-day siege of France's highways by striking truck drivers began to wind down as members of the largest union approved a wage accord with trucking companies providing a 6 percent raise and setting a minimum salary for experienced drivers. Other unions rejected the settlement and said their drivers would try to maintain the barricades, which have disrupted trade and left many French larders bare. Still, they praised the settlement as "a significant advance." A4
 
Leader Emerges in Thailand
An opposition leader favored by investors and executives said he had enough support in Parliament to form a new Government in Thailand. Chuan Leekpai, 59, has been Prime Minister before and has a reputation for honesty. His proposed Cabinet lineup reflects a coalition of several parties, which may hamper the fiscal reform necessary to stanch the country's damaged economy. Thailand was buffeted by a currency devaluation this summer that wrought havoc on Southeast Asian markets. A8
 
Torture Reported in Zambia
Amnesty International charged that about 34 people detained after a bungled coup in Zambia last week had been tortured. They urged President Frederick Chiluba's government to stop the torture, which it said included the infliction of cigarette burns, beatings and electric shocks. Amnesty said the detainees, many of them military officers, had been denied food and water. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Iranian Opposition Figure Sees Little Hope for Real Change

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: NICOSIA, Cyprus, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Iran's leading opposition figure has said that while Mohammed Khatami, the country's new President, sincerely wants to liberalize the country and improve relations with the United States, the short-term prospects for either development are poor.
"He knows what political freedom and intellectual freedom mean, but he also faces daunting obstacles and knows that there are many enemies who want to restrict these freedoms," said Abdolkarim Soroush, who is widely regarded as the philosophical leader of the movement to separate government and clerical rule in Iran. "Nor do I think he will make any overtures soon toward the United States." 
 Dr. Soroush made his remarks in an interview on Sunday after a two-day conference here at which about 100 intellectuals, scholars and business people from Iran, the United States and more a dozen other countries debated the status of relations between political Islam and the West.
Dr. Soroush used the forum to reassert his demand for the separation of religion and state, saying "there can't be any official interpretation, or official class of interpreters of Islam."
Acknowledging that such views had drastic implications for the current Iranian Government, Dr. Soroush said he had paid a heavy price for his stance. He said he had been beaten up by "thugs and hooligans" believed to be members of a religious militant group, dismissed from his post at Teheran University and permitted to publish his latest book only after agreeing to include a chapter by an Iranian hard-liner with whom he disagreed.
But Dr. Soroush said that his presence at the gathering was a triumph of sorts for the reform movement. He said that after seizing his passport six months ago, the Iranian Government gave it back to him so he would be able to attend the conference.
"My presence here is definitely a healthy sign," Dr. Soroush said.
Mr. Khatami and Ataollah Mohajerani, the Minister of Islamic Culture, had written to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's supreme religious leader, asking that the passport be returned, Dr. Soroush's associates said, but no one seemed to know why Ayatollah Khamenei had agreed.
Ever since Mr. Khatami, 54, won a landslide victory in national elections last May based on his call for, in effect, an Iranian perestroika, Iranians and Western governments have been awaiting signs that the new President will make good on his campaign promises. The appointment of a liberal Cabinet reinforced hopes for change. But Dr. Soroush's cautious pessimism and that of other Iranians at the meeting suggested that champions of Iranian liberalization may have to be patient.
"I don't think that change can come overnight, but I think that we've already seen some movement," said Graham Fuller, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst and now a senior analyst at the Rand Corporation who also spoke at the meeting.
Several Iranian scholars pointed to indications of a more permissive mood inside their country. Writers and scholars now have less difficulty winning approval of their work from clerical censors, they said. And Mr. Mohajerani, whom Mr. Khatami appointed as Minister of Islamic Guidance and Islamic Culture, has deleted the "guidance" part of his ministry's name, arguing that Iranian believers neither need nor want such official direction.
But several scholars warned that President Khatami was still far weaker than Ayatollah Khamenei, who has supreme power over all state institutions and is much more rigid than Mr. Khatami. They also warned that any effort to warm ties with Washington would make President Khatami's administration vulnerable to attacks from Iranian hard-liners and thus jeopardize the new Government and the prospects for internal liberalization.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 18, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 8 about an Iranian opposition figure misstated his interpretation of the new President's thinking on Iranian-American relations. The opposition figure, Abdolkarim Soroush, said he did not believe President Mohammed Khatami would make any overtures soon toward the United States, but Mr. Soroush did not say Mr. Khatami wanted improved ties.

The Life of Marietta Tree.
By Caroline Seebohm.
Illustrated. 447 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $27.50.
 Marietta Tree's high-WASP background had all the makings of the glamorous fantasy that Ralph Lauren has burnished to a high gloss: a New England pedigree that predates the Revolution (she was born Mary Endicott Peabody, the granddaughter of the founder of the Groton School), a prep-school adolescence, with summers in Northeast Harbor, Me., and the full complement of fizzy coming-out parties in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Transplanted to England in the early years of her second marriage, to Ronald Tree, she presided over Ditchley, the stately home he had refurbished with his former wife (who, as Nancy Lancaster, went on to great renown as a decorator). In Europe and America, Marietta traveled in what used to be called ''the highest circles.'' Indeed, the surface of her life remained impeccable until her death, in 1991, at 74. But this book cannot sustain the fairy tale, if only because in the long run neither could she.
 Caroline Seebohm (also the author of a biography of Conde Nast) depicts Tree as the high-minded product of her upbringing at the hands of a parsimonious mother (who once professed indignation at a guest's request for two lumps of sugar) and a severe father, an Episcopal clergyman. The God of the Peabodys was, it seems, remote and joyless, punitive, without compassion -- not unlike the Peabodys themselves. When, at the age of 30, Marietta decided to divorce Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer in New York, to marry Ronald Tree, her mother rebuked her: ''You have let down your family and your society and your God.'' It was the Peabody sense of duty -- a Puritanical noblesse oblige -- coupled with her considerable ambition that in time propelled Marietta into the realm of politics and public service. 
 Her political views were often at odds with her social circumstances. A fact checker at Life magazine and a shop steward for the union, she frequently dined out with Henry R. Luce, the magazine's founder and editor in chief. Making the acquaintance of Winston Churchill and the Marquess of Salisbury, she took them to task over the state of affairs in postwar England. Isaiah Berlin characterized her as ''a progressive, liberal figure who was mixed up with a lot of naive left-wing sympathizers.'' Her later friendship with the Kissingers and her attendance at parties for the Reagans were seen in some quarters as a betrayal of her Democratic principles.
 It is tempting to think that, had Tree been born a mere 20 years later, she might have fulfilled her childhood ambition to be a senator. At 21, she announced to an audience of friends, ''I intend to get power through connection with a man.'' As it happened, she became the lover of Adlai Stevenson, accompanying him on the campaign trail, consoling him in defeat. It was Stevenson who, in 1961, as the American Ambassador to the United Nations, recommended that she be appointed United States representative to the Human Rights Commission there. 
 Though Marietta, like Pamela Harriman, attained through men what women of her time were forbidden to attain for themselves, Seebohm makes no attempt to nominate her as a martyr for the feminist cause. In fact, Marietta repeatedly distanced herself from it. In 1967, she angered her fellow female delegates to the New York state constitutional convention, by refusing to sign three resolutions pertaining to women's rights.
 If Marietta was unconcerned with women's lack of political and economic power, surely it was because she recognized in herself an alternative power, the power of attraction. Boy-crazy at an early age, she was by all accounts irresistible to the opposite sex. On visits to her grandparents at Groton, she commanded the hungry gaze of 180 boys at once. Seebohm paints a picture of her at 17, departing for a year at school in Florence, on a boat pulling away from a dock lined with ''stricken male admirers.'' Men leave love notes in her handbag; they kiss her, though she knows their wives. After Ronald Tree began spending more of his time at their house in Barbados, Marietta was free to entertain the attentions of other men, among them Stevenson and, later, a British architect and urban planner by the name of Richard Llewelyn-Davies. In her 70's she found love yet again, with a debonair widower -- and Groton alumnus -- by the name of Eben Pyne.
 We can only begin to imagine the desire this long-legged blonde, 5 feet 10, with patrician features and a 39-inch bustline, must have inspired. And yet, for all that her relationships were intensely romantic, they seem to have been sexually tepid. Another woman in a position to know reported that for Adlai sex was ''not urgent.'' Ronnie proved to be bisexual. Someone close to Llewelyn-Davies confided to Seebohm that sex was ''not Richard's thing.'' And Eben, by his own admission, was unaware that Marietta had had a mastectomy. Her own squeamishness when it came to sex is corroborated by a friend's recollection that she walked out on movies the minute the action took a carnal turn.
 The only instance of white-hot passion in her life appears to have been her affair with John Huston, the film director, in 1945, just before her husband, Desie, returned from the war. Spending the weekend at a friend's house in the country, she and Huston made such vigorous love that the bed collapsed. With Desie back, John retreated to California -- at Marietta's request -- where he waited for her to arrange a divorce. Meanwhile she and Desie went with some friends to Barbados, to stay with Nancy and Ronald Tree; it was there, with the memory of sexual ecstasy still fresh in her mind, that Marietta fell in love with her host and embarked on a romance more in keeping with her penchant for chastity. 
 A few weeks before Huston died, Marietta went to visit him in a hospital in Newport, where, Seebohm reports, his electrocardiogram ''started jumping with excitement as soon as she entered the room.'' She was, his friends maintained, the only woman he ever really loved. She was also the woman who walked away. Where others played hard to get, Marietta was genuinely unattainable -- needing men's approval and all the while disdaining sex. ''She flirted with that cunning mixture of promise and denial that kept them permanently on edge,'' Seebohm writes.
 The contradictions in her character are staggering, and the author, to her credit, has let them stand. Marietta protests being called a socialite, but given the choice between a boring dinner party and an evening at home with a good book, she picks the dinner party. Her humanitarianism is offset to some degree by her refusal to give her daughter Frankie any dolls. Both of her daughters -- Frances FitzGerald, now a distinguished journalist, and Penelope Tree, who rose to fame as a fashion model in the late 60's -- cooperated with Seebohm on this book, and it is largely thanks to their candor that this portrayal is so subtle and persuasive.
 In the end, however, the reader comes away considerably less enchanted with Marietta than her countless friends and admirers (with the possible exception of her second husband, whose memoirs stop in 1945 and never mention her). She lacked a sense of humor, we are told. Nor, we gather, was she much of a wit. ''All women should go to Marietta Tree School,'' proclaimed George W. Goodman, the economist. If only he had elaborated on the curriculum. 
 But Tree's charms evaporate on the page through no fault of her own. When Seebohm refers to Huston as a ''stronghold of testosterone,'' or to Saratoga and its environs as a ''culturally challenged region,'' her ready embrace of the cliche nearest to hand does not inspire confidence in her ability to articulate what, for those who knew Marietta, evidently went without saying.
 Threaded throughout her story is a litany of rules by which to live -- many of them handed down from her parents: Be punctual; don't be sarcastic or laugh too much; don't be direct. And Marietta's advice to a school friend: ''Always look as if you're having a wonderful time!'' Virtue consisted above all in keeping up appearances. 
 Dying of breast cancer, she told her friends she had the flu. In this era of 12-step talk shows and secrets for sale, her reticence is at first glance dignified and striking. But as the discrepancy between her performance and her experience becomes apparent, we see the sacrifice her dissembling required and the toll it took, as well. Her actions and reactions were dictated by an image of herself, and, even among those closest to her, she insisted on it -- in the name of duty or honor, at the expense of the truth. Would that we could regard her stoicism as heroic.

Save '27 Bank, Petitions Ask

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON 

 BODY:
The Marine Midland Bank on the northeast corner of Amsterdam Avenue and 96th Street is the sort of solid, stately presence that nearby residents have come to assume is permanent. So when the bank began preparing to move to a storefront across the street and rumors began to circulate that the building would be sold, perhaps to a high-rise developer, concerned neighbors swung into action.
"They came to a community board meeting, and I gave them some tips on organizing," said Jan Levy, a member of the landmarks committee of Community Board 7. 
 On one sunny weekend last month, nearly 2,300 signatures were collected on a petition to have the bank designated a landmark, said Jonathan Minikes, an organizer, who lives in a building next door to the bank. "The response was tremendous," Mr. Minikes said.
Built in 1927, the building, which until a few years ago was a branch of the East River Savings Bank, is an example of the monumental Classical Revival style, with Ionic columns and a spacious, richly appointed interior. "These were the halcyon days of bank building," Ms. Levy said. "They were palaces of finance, sturdy buildings where you felt like your money was safe."
During the wave of urban renewal on the Upper West Side in the late 50's and early 60's, high rises were built in the area. The bank remained.
Last year, Marine Midland acquired 11 East River Savings Bank branches. At the end of this year, said a spokeswoman for Marine Midland, Pat Wood, the bank branch will move across the street. The old East River Savings Bank building, she said, "is under contract to be sold," but she would not say to whom.
The Landmarks Preservation Commission has scheduled a hearing for Nov. 18 on whether to give the bank landmark status. The building was considered for designation once before, in the late 80's, but no action was taken. JANET ALLON

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT GLOBALLY;
Trailblazers, A Fund for You

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
AS if emerging markets did not prove exciting enough for investors recently, now comes an even more speculative alternative: The Pre-Emerging Markets fund, introduced last week by State Street Global Advisors, the money management arm of the State Street Corporation in Boston.
The Pre-Emerging Markets fund is not, as its name implies, designed to invest in parts of the world where the economies have yet to grow. Rather, explains Peter Leahy, a State Street managing director, the fund invests in countries whose economies "are emerging but which are not included in any of the well-known, investible indexes," like those tracked by Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. 
 So if buying shares of promising young companies based in Botswana, Ghana, Ecuador, Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritius, Kenya, the Ivory Coast or Bangladesh seems like the thing to do, this might be the fund that can make it happen.
But it is not open to individuals. Its formation as a common trust fund means it is available only to investors not subject to United States income taxes -- that is, pension funds, foreign entities and the like.
And rather than trying to pick the best-performing stocks in those markets, the fund will be passively managed -- that is, it will invest in companies that dominate the indexes of those individual countries. Initially, it will limit investments to about $3 million, for all markets combined.
Of course, the fact that State Street is introducing the Pre-Emerging Markets fund now raises the question of whether investor confidence was at all affected by the recent selloff in post-emerging and still-somewhat-emerging markets.
On that, Mr. Leahy demurs. "We're not saying that now is the time to buy pre-emerging markets," he said. "The timing is purely coincidental. But we think that a critical mass of our clients might be interested in expanding their investment horizons, and this is a tool to help them to diversify."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT GLOBALLY;
Asia Strategy, From One Who Has Been There

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
WARREN B. BAILEY is no J. Mark Mobius, the guru of emerging markets at the Franklin Templeton mutual funds.
But for the last seven years Mr. Bailey, an assistant professor of finance at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell, has taken his own money to the front lines in Asian emerging markets. While most Americans who dare to invest in these places do so by popping a check into the corner mailbox, Mr. Bailey, 38, is often in Asia -- checking out a fast-food company's wares in Manila, for example, or buying stock in Tsingtao, the Chinese brewer, on its first day of trading in Hong Kong. 
 In this interview, Mr. Bailey maps out his approach to Asian emerging markets, appraises the recent turbulence there and describes some of his successes and failures. His basic advice to wannabe emerging-markets investors: "Have a strong stomach and no ego."
Mr. Bailey had an initial stake of $24,000 in the market, added a few thousand dollars each year and says the holdings are now worth $70,000 to $80,000.
But now he gets a chance to start anew: for personal reasons that have nothing to do with the recent tumult in Asia, he plans to liquidate the portfolio shortly. However, he will resume his do-it-yourself investing style in Asia's developing lands soon.
Q. Tell us a little about yourself and your experience in investing.
A. I was born in Brooklyn, went to Cornell, got an M.B.A. at McGill and a doctorate at U.C.L.A. My first teaching job was at Ohio State in 1986. I've been at Cornell since 1991, and was tenured three years ago.
I collected and dealt in coins as a kid, but I didn't buy my first stock until after the 1987 crash and after I had read Peter Lynch's book, "One Up on Wall Street." Then I invested in a few domestic stocks.
Q. Do you own any American stocks now?
A. I have about $40,000 to $50,000 in consumer stocks like McDonald's and Pepsi and a strong interest in oil companies, particularly those that produce in secure areas.
Q. How did you get interested in Asia?
A. I made my first trip to Thailand in 1984 when I was a grad student, and I was amazed at how industrious the people were. And then, about seven years ago, I recognized that certain academic problems, like political and currency risk, were best studied with data from nontraditional markets.
At about the same time, I left Ohio State and found myself with about $24,000 in pension money. I could have rolled it over into another pension fund or taken it out and started a brokerage account.
I chose to be adventurous instead. Most of these Asian countries have laid the groundwork for good, safe, long-term investing, while also offering the opportunities that exist in places that are not fully developed.
The timing of the move was great, because Saddam Hussein was getting comfortable in Kuwait about then. It was a time of great pessimistic sentiment, and I bought four blue-chip stocks in Singapore, one in Malaysia and one in Hong Kong and said let's start with this.
Since then my teaching and investing activities in Asia have proceeded in parallel.
Q. Do you use an American broker?
A. No, I use a foreign broker, except for the Asian stocks that trade here as A.D.R.'s. But anyone with a sizable portfolio, say $500,000 or more, can get their American broker to do it, and some American firms will do these trades for smaller accounts.
When I first decided to invest the money myself, I sent faxes to brokerages in Singapore and Jakarta, asking them what I needed to do. I got a lot of funny, handwritten notes and unintelligible responses. I got one from a brokerage in Jakarta that said to wire them the money and they will fill out the forms later. Yeah, right.
Some time later I was at a conference talking about my situation with an Indonesian official involved in securities regulation. He pulled out a card and said: "This is my uncle's business card. He is a broker -- why don't you call him?" I took the card, said thank you and walked away real fast.
Anyway, I ended up going with a Singaporean broker attached to a respected bank as my main broker in the region.
Q. Have you had a problem getting orders filled at the prices you wanted?
A. Brokers in former British colonies operate under strict rules, and you are not likely to get ripped off. The only place I ever had a problem was in Jakarta, when I was trading very thinly traded stocks in very small amounts. But it wasn't clear if I was being ripped off or if I was merely paying for the liquidity that was being supplied.
Q. What is your investment strategy?
A. It is based on two principles. The first, my Peter Lynch principle, is to find a company that seems to have a sensible product, seems to do a good job and could benefit from economic growth.
Second, most professional managers have built-in impatience. If you ask a fund manager today if he thinks Thailand is going to stink forever, he will say "of course not," but he is going to be evaluated on performance three months from now.
I try to combine those principles: find things that make sense and buy them when others will not or cannot. And I have had some successes and some failures.
I found a good company when I went to Manila in 1995. I was told that Jollibee Foods, a Philippine fast-food company, is even more popular than McDonald's with the locals. It is a combination of McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken and it follows an aggressive "value pricing" strategy.
I took a look at the restaurants and bought some shares in nominee or street name, because foreigners can't buy Philippine shares. That is a big game in Asia. You can pretty much avoid ownership restrictions if you are willing to trust your broker.
Q. What about failures?
A. So far my approach has not worked well in China. In 1993 I bought shares in Tsingtao, the beer company, on the first day it was offered on the Hong Kong exchange. I read the prospectus and it did not seem grossly overpriced. But I did not find out until later that even though they have a good product, the company hasn't built good distribution networks. The stock has been on a roller-coaster ride ever since I bought it.
Lack of information has also hurt me with Brilliance China Automotive, a mini-bus maker and the first Chinese company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock did well to begin with, because people were looking at the vehicle market in China. But the vehicles they turn out are not any good, and no one is pressuring them to do better. The stock went public at $16 and went as high as about $34. I bought at $26, thinking I was clever. The stock fell as low as $5, and is now $9.75.
When people ask me what I like in China, I tell them I would like to buy a 30-year call option -- something that pays off if the underlying instrument goes up -- on China's gross national product. At the moment, there is no equivalent of 3M, Intel or McDonald's to buy there that represents an honest piece of that economy.
Q. How do you get your ideas?
A. I spend two to four weeks in Asia every six to nine months. I do research and am surrounded by students who want to hear about it. I get phone calls and E-mails from former students who are living in the region. And I read The Economist and The Far Eastern Economic Review every week.
Q. What are your thoughts about the recent turbulence in Asian emerging markets?
A. These are not situations where whole societies and economies are collapsing. In Asia there are a lot of very solid economies with basically well-run governments that are just screwing up right now.
There has been an unfortunate spillover, too, with Malaysia getting painted with the Thai brush, but that is how markets work. People who are imperfectly informed rationally overreact to protect themselves. It is almost ridiculous for the Malaysian ringgit to be so cheap, because it implies so many bargains in stocks, real estate, vacations. I am going to be spending a lot of money next summer, or perhaps over the winter, in the region.
Q. Any tips for neophytes on picking stocks?
A. I would ask which industry typifies the country's promise. And then I would try and identify a solid company in that industry. In Singapore, look for financial services and shipping companies, for example. In Indonesia, look for natural resources companies.
Q. What advice would you give to people who are thinking about investing on their own in Asia, or in emerging markets generally?
A. Have patience, a sense of humor and a trustworthy broker. Buy safe, big companies that make sense, hold them for a long time and buy them when everyone else is afraid. Have a strong stomach, and no ego.
And travel to the region. When I went to China for the first time in 1992, I crossed by land from Hong Kong, and found that it was like going into Mexico from Tijuana. There were no threatening soldiers; if anything, it was extremely friendly. And it punctured any notion I had of a highly authoritarian state. Had I not done that in person I would not be comfortable investing there.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
How Brazil Scares Korea, and Vice Versa

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
When it comes to speculation, there are no national boundaries. As world markets swooned at the end of last week, the most intriguing report came out of South Korea. Banks there had borrowed money and loaded up on Latin American bonds. Now, facing margin calls, they were dumping the bonds.
Huh? 
 What, you might ask, were Korean banks doing buying bonds from countries halfway around the world? The same thing, it appears, that they were doing buying Russian and Turkish securities. They were looking for yield. And to maximize the profit, they were buying on margin.
Korean banks, like those in a number of other once-rapidly growing countries, have a lot of home-grown bad loans to confront as their economies slow. And it looks as if some of them were rolling the dice elsewhere, trying to get even. With those dice coming up snake eyes, their problems have grown.
When Asia's troubles surfaced in the summer, some clever traders figured they were good for American markets. As one hedge fund manager explained last week while lamenting his losses, Japan has been the big exporter of goods to Southeast Asia. So Japan's already sick economy will be the big loser if Asian economies stop growing.
And why should that be good news here? A lot of speculation around the world has been financed by borrowing at Japan's incredibly low interest rates. If Japan's economy ever strengthens and rates rise, that could be a big threat to many markets. A weak Asia makes that less likely and can keep the speculation going.
It makes a certain amount of sense, and it may yet work out. American markets are logical havens for those newly worried about submerging emerging markets. And Japan's low rates mean that those who want to speculate can still do so cheaply, assuming their credit is good. The questions now are just how much tighter credit is going to get for dubious borrowers, and whether the will to speculate will be as strong as it was.
It makes for an interesting quandary for investors, and an even more interesting one for the Federal Reserve policy makers who are supposed to decide this week what they will do about short-term interest rates. Look at the economic data in this country, including Friday's job report, and you could easily conclude that the American economy is in danger of overheating -- and that a Fed tightening is in order. Look at the turmoil in world markets, and you could easily conclude that the Fed should ease, as it did after the 1987 crash. Add them together, and you get the Wall Street consensus, that the Fed will nervously do nothing.
Logically, third-world bond markets ought to stabilize before their stock markets do. Buyers of Latin American Brady bonds are now getting about 6.2 percentage points above American Treasuries on the part of the loan not guaranteed by the United States, nearly double the figure a month ago. There are probably some bargains in such bonds, but it appears that would-be buyers are holding back, waiting to see just how much leveraged speculation, a la Korean banks, is in danger of coming undone.
Given the American public's belief in stocks, it is unlikely that the stock market here will collapse. Even with Friday's 102-point drop, the Dow Jones industrial average was up for the week. But the risk remains that more evidence of unexpected and unwise speculation will emerge. We may be just starting to learn how interconnected world markets now are.
