HEADLINE: Chase's Share Price Is Lowest in 12 Years

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The share price of the Chase Manhattan Corportion closed at a 12-year low yesterday, and interest rates on its long-term debt rose - a result of the banking company's weak earnings and unconfirmed rumors of its difficulties in borrowing money, analysts said.
''There are a lot of negative stories converging about Chase,'' said Ann Robinson, an analyst at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. She said Chase's fundamental problem of a rising level of delinquent loans had been made ''more scary'' by the rumors about its borrowing difficulties. 
''It's clear there are worries in the marketplace about liquidity and funding the company,'' said Arthur Sotor, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company.
The share price of the nation's second-largest banking company ended the day at $13.875, down $1.1254 for the day and $3.25 for the last week. Like most other banking companies, Chase has had weak stock for nearly a year. In early October 1989, after its stock traded as high as $44.875, it issued more than 16 million new shares at a price of $40.125 a share.
At yesterday's closing price, Chase stock yielded about 17.9 percent, assuming that it continues to pay a 62-cent quarterly dividend. Many investors and analysts doubt that Chase can maintain the high yield of the dividend despite promises by its executives. Chase officials note the dividend can be paid from earnings of its highly profitable credit card banking operation in Delaware, even if Chase Manhattan Bank in New York is hard pressed to make large dividend payments to the holding corporation, which then makes payments to shareholders.
In the bond market there were several signs that investors were reluctant buyers of Chase issues. An issue of 10 percent Chase notes due in 1999, for example, was traded yesterday with a yield of 13.35, or 4.45 percentage points more than Treasury notes, up from 12.90 percent a day earlier. Among other New York banking companies with similar notes, a Chemical Banking Corporation issue was quoted at about 14 percent, while a Citicorp issue was at about 11 percent.
In the private placement market, no agreement has yet been reached with Japanese investors on a $100 million issue of long-term debt that officials at First Boston proposed to Chase several weeks ago. One banker close to the deal said, however, ''It is still very much alive.''
Elsewhere in the bond market, a Chase issue that sold last week with a two-year yield of 13.01 percent has increased in price to about 100 1/2, to yield 12.71 percent. An official at Salomon Brothers, which bought most of the note issue, said that, contrary to market rumors, the Federal Reserve did not put any pressure on the firm to buy the issue.
In the short-term markets, where Chase is a heavy borrower despite cutbacks over the last few years, Steve Rautenberg, a spokesman for Chase, said yesterday that ''our entire funding operation is operating normally, including the interest rates we are paying.'' A similar statement was issued by Chase officials on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Fund Yields Stay Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday, underlining the lack of clear direction that has enveloped the market for nearly two months.
''The money markets remain listless as they await the Federal Reserve Bank to take some action, which is not likely to happen anytime before a budget compromise is achieved in Washington.'' Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, said, Therefore, he added, the money market yields are expected to continue in a very narrow range. 
Managers of tax-exempt money market funds increased the average number of days that securities are held in portfolios by one day, to 59. Many analysts said the level was still high, and the reason might be that managers were still taking advantage of the high rates available, maximizing their investments while awaiting an expected decline.
 
Tax-Exempt Assets Fall
Assets fell by $308 million, to total $80.9 billion, as the average seven-day tax-exempt compounded yield increased by 2 basis points, to 5.56 percent for the week, and the 30-day average yield rose by 7 basis points -or hundredths of a percentage point - to 5.46 percent. Analysts said the rise in yields might have been caused by a large supply of new issues and fewer buyers.
For investors in a 28 percent tax bracket, the equivalent taxable seven-day compounded yield is 7.72 percent, and for investors in the 33 percent bracket, it is 8.29 percent.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets of better than $100 million that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the USAA Tax Exempt Money Market fund produced the best return. The compunded average yield is 6.30 percent, or about 74 basis points better than the average. The fund is distributed by the USAA Investment Management Company of San Antonio.
Assets of taxable funds, meanwhile, increased by $2.1 billion, to a record $402 billion, with assets of institutional funds up $600 million, to $84.8 billion, and consumer funds assets up $1.5 billion, to $317.2 billion.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios decreased by one, to 46.
Donoghue's said the seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund was off by a basis point, to 7.74 percent, the same as the 30-day average yield, which slipped to 7.75 percent.
Of the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million, Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market fund had the best return for the fourth straight week. The yield was 8.58 percent, down slightly from 8.59 percent the previous week.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 13.86 in Another Lackluster Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Wall Street suffered through another day of the blahs yesterday, with stocks down only slightly despite several fairly strong declines.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 13.86, to 2,557.43, bringing the relentless slide in the Dow to 442 points - or nearly 15 percent - since mid-July.
Stock market activity picked up a bit more, climbing to 147.5 million shares from 141.1 million the day before.
But 883 stocks fell and 130 hit new lows - including Sears, Roebuck and Dayton Hudson - while 599 rose and 18 hit new highs. 
Traders attributed yesterday's somewhat stronger volume to activity in advance of the ''triple witching hour'' tomorrow, when Standard & Poor's futures, stock options and index options expire.
The event coincides with the Jewish New Year today and tomorrow, when many traders take off either or both days, often raising volume in advance of the holiday and increasing market volatility during the holiday sessions.
While I.B.M. rose an encouraging 1 1/8, to 108 3/8, Merck, one of the Big Board's most popular drug stocks, slumped 3 1/8, to 76 7/8, after Patricia Lee of Vector Securities questioned its prostate drug, Proscar. It was the third-most-active Big Board stock, with nearly 3 million shares changing hands.
American General, the Texas insurance giant, plunged 6 3/8 in heavy trading to 33 5/8, after saying it was less likely to sell the company.
General Electric topped the Big Board active list, falling 2 1/2, to 56 1/8 -a new low - on three million shares.
Traders said Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a newsletter, said G.E. and General Electric Credit might be vulnerable because of their heavy loans for real estate and leveraged buyouts.
''In a nervous market, people are looking for any excuse to sell,'' one trader remarked.
Even so, Hugh Johnson, chief strategist for the First Albany Corporation, a brokerage house based in Albany, described the market as ''friendless, trendless, directionless, featureless and stuck.''
He argued that investors were ''still gun-shy - very comfortable with substantial cash positions - sitting this one out.''
''There isn't any event, or expectation of any,'' he said, ''that'll stir a sense of urgency to move investors off the fence.''
Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress yesterday, Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, gave investors no reason to believe interest rates might be heading down. He remarked, ''The oil shock has clearly increased both the probability of inflation and recession.'' While nothing new, the chairman's remarks helped raise investor frustrations, one trader said.
Moreover, Mr. Johnson argued, at this point even an interest-rate reduction might not be enough to lift the stock market.
''Even if we get an agreement on the 1991 budget deficit - which we should get,'' he said, ''and that's followed by a reduction in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve, very few investors believe it will stir any sustainable move up in stock prices.''
''As long as the Middle East crisis hangs over the market,'' he said, ''the focus remains on the Middle East. It's raised the risk of investing a decibel or two by injecting uncertainty into any forecast of inflation and interest rates or the economy and earnings.''
Among the strong moves, Ralston Purina rose 2 7/8, to 100, after John M. McMillan, food analyst for Prudential-Bache, said it would ''keep outperforming the market.'' Quaker Oats rose 2 3/8, to 45 5/8.
American Stores fell 1 3/8, to 64, after saying it would explore the sale of Acme Markets and use the money to cut debt. UAL fell 5, to 100, amid interminable doubt that its unions will find financing for a buyout.
Occidental Petroleum slid 1 3/8, to 21 3/8, in heavy trading after The Wall Street Journal raised doubts about its dividend. The oil producer said it remained ''committed'' to the $2.50-a-year dividend.
Disney fell 3 3/4, to 90 3/8, after a new low of 90 1/4. David Londoner of Wertheim & Company cut his earnings estimate in the wake of concern over theme-park attendance but continues to recommend the stock.
 
Nikkei Index Off Again
TOKYO, Thursday, Sept. 20 (Reuters) -Tokyo stocks fell again today after closing Wednesday at a low for 1990. The benchmark Nikkei 225-share index closed today down 123.19 points, to 23,602.98, after slumping 158.65 on Wednesday in thin volume. Banking issues and high-technology blue chips led declines. ''Where's the bottom?'' Masahiko Tsuyuzaki, chief trader at Tachibana Securities, asked rhetorically. ''Right now the market consensus is that the Nikkei will fall to 21,000. But some people are saying it may fall as low as 18,000 or 15,000.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in fairly active trading yesterday, as market participants reacted to comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, by selling short-term notes and buying long-term bonds.
In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that the continuing crisis in the Persian Gulf could further weaken the economy, but added that he saw no signs suggesting a recession was imminent.
More significant to credit market participants were comments from the Fed chairman that strongly suggested that inflation was a more important byproduct of the Middle East situation than recession. And Mr. Greenspan's comments suggested once again that the Fed would not be prone to ease credit until Congress passed a credible budget package. 
''The fact that Greenspan was talking about inflation rather than recession was good news for bonds,'' one trader said, ''because it reinforces the notion that the Fed is being vigilant as an inflation fighter.''
Robert Dederick, executive vice president and chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said: ''Mr. Greenspan now seems to be more willing to run the risk of recession than before. The message that comes through here is that if there is a recession, so be it.''
 
Survey of Economic Conditions
To traders, Mr. Greenspan's comments outweighed in importance the release of the Fed's ''beige book,'' a survey of economic conditions prepared by regional Federal Reserve banks, as well as weak figures for August housing starts, which provided further evidence the housing industry is in recession.
The Fed survey, which covered a six-week period ending in early September, characterized the economy as either ''expanding slowly or declining in most areas.'' In the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions, weakness was most apparent, the report said.
''If it weren't for the Middle East, the beige book and the housing starts numbers would be met with all kinds of calls for a further easing in Fed policy,'' said Jerry L. Jordan, a senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. ''But the Fed is sitting there bound and gagged.''
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020, which have sagged in price recently, were offered at 97 11/32, up 18/32, to yield 9.00 percent, compared with 9.05 percent late Tuesday.
The Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes also benefited from Mr. Greenspan's remarks about inflation, and by late yesterday were offered at a price of 99 1/4, up 5/32, to yield 8.86 percent.
The Treasury announced late in the afternoon that it will auction $11.5 billion worth of two-year notes on Sept. 25, and $8.25 billion of four-year notes on Sept. 26.
In when-issued trading after the announcement, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.04 percent. The four-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.39 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to up slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.36 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday. Six-month bill rates rose by two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 7.29 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, two foreign governments priced issues.
 
Province of Manitoba Debentures
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for an offering of $350 million worth of 10-year debentures for the Province of Manitoba.
The 9 1/2 percent securities, which mature Oct. 1, 2000, were priced at $99.733, to yield 9.542 percent, 65 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities are noncallable for life.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
That issue was followed by the Government of Malaysia, which priced a $200 million 10-year note offering through an underwriting syndicate led by Salomon Brothers.
The 9 7/8 percent notes, which are noncallable for life, mature Sept. 27, 2000. They were priced at $99.00 to yield 10.036 percent, 1.15 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 8 3/4 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to up 1/8 point.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mostly Higher in U.S. After Sharp Jump in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly higher in United States trading yesterday after surging in Europe as currency markets drew encouragement from comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, who seemed to suggest that interest rates were not likely to be cut soon.
Gold prices declined worldwide. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $386 an ounce, down $1.60 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank later quoted gold at $385.60, off $2.50. 
Speaking before a Congressional committee, Mr. Greenspan said the nation was not in a recession, although events in the Persian Gulf were putting new and substantial pressures on the economy.
The dollar has been losing ground in recent weeks amid speculation that the Fed would ease interest rates to stimulate the sluggish economy. When rates move down, the nation's securities become less attractive to foreigners, thereby diminishing investors' appetite for dollars.
 
A Favorable Reaction
The initial reaction among currency market participants to Mr. Greenspan's comments ''was favorable because it seemed to downplay the likelihood of a near-term easing,'' said Marc Chandler, senior strategist at the consulting firm IDEA.
 
Pound Declines
The dollar gained sharply yesterday at the expense of the British pound, which fell after the president of the West German Bundesbank, Karl Otto Pohl, hinted that Britain might not join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, or E.R.M., as expected. The E.R.M. is built into the European Monetary System and limits the fluctuations of 9 of the European Community's 12 currencies. It is expected that the pound will strengthen if Britain joins the mechanism.
In London, the pound fell to $1.8855, from $1.9190 late Tuesday. In New York it dropped to $1.8833, from $1.9140 on Tuesday.
The dollar also jumped against the German currency, ending the day at 1.5730 marks, up from 1.5525 the day before.
Against the yen, however, the dollar fell slightly in New York trading, closing at 137.68 yen, down from 137.75 on Tuesday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar had closed at 138.05 yen, up 0.37 yen from Tuesday. Later in London, it was quoted at 137.55 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, were: 1.3105 Swiss francs, up from 1.2900; 5.2670 French francs, up from 5.1995; 1,175.00 Italian lire, up from 1,162.50, and 1.1563 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1590.
Gold fell in London to $386.75 an ounce, from $388.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to $385.50, from $387.80 late Tuesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold dropped $4.50, to $385.35.
Silver prices were little changed. On the Comex in New York, silver closed at $4.769 an ounce, down from Tuesday's $4.790. In London, silver bullion was trading at a late bid price of $4.82, unchanged from Tuesday.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Jordanians Meet Frustration In Search for 'Arab Solution'

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Sept. 20

 BODY:
As Iraqi troops were storming toward Kuwait City on Aug. 2, King Hussein of Jordan was awakened at 6 A.M. by a phone call from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
''Have you heard?'' King Fahd asked the sleepy Jordanian King. ''The Iraqis are within a few kilometers of Kuwait City. Can you ask them to withdraw to the disputed area'' on the Iraq-Kuwait border?
Crown Prince Hassan, brother of the Jordanian King, gave this account of the events during a long breakfast interview at his palace this morning, adding that King Hussein had quickly called Baghdad and reached the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. Later that day, Prince Hassan said, the King spoke to Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi President, and pressed King Fahd's case. 
And so, the Prince said, with those calls in the early hours, the elusive and so far futile search for an ''Arab solution'' to the gulf conflict began.
For the last six weeks, King Hussein has been shuttling among Baghdad, Rabat, Cairo and other capitals in the Arab world, the United States and Europe - trying, Jordanians say, to be an honest mediator. But now Prince Hassan and other Jordanians candidly acknowledge that King Hussein has nothing to show for his efforts - no progress to report, not even a clear plan to offer. [In Washington, Administration officials said the United States opposed King Hussein's current peacemaking attempt. As they spoke, Arab oil industry executives said Saudi Arabia had stopped its oil deliveries to Jordan, which have long constituted about half of Jordan's daily consumption of oil. Pages A8 and A9.] If there has been movement toward a solution to the crisis, ''I don't have knowledge of it,'' Prince Hassan said.
A senior Jordanian official acknowledged: ''I don't think we have a coherent ready-made recipe. I don't even think that is possible in this situation.''
The King's efforts might have succeeded in the first days, the Prince and many others here assert, had not the United States and others quickly decided to send in military forces.
But Jordan can point to no tangible progress, and some foreign diplomats say they have concluded that the King's travels are really just to show the audience at home that he is active, concerned and involved, despite denials from the Royal Palace that this is his motivation.
Prince Hassan acknowledged that officials in Washington, suspicious of Jordan's activities with Iraq, were saying that ''we are just playing for time, or trying to play out the Iraqi tactic of just gaining time.'' The Prince shook his head.
''But if you say the Arab solution is dead,'' he added, ''I say in the first weekend an Arab solution was offered and undercut'' by the United States.
 
Economy on Verge of Collapse
While King Hussein has continued his quest for the Arab solution, his country has fallen deeper and deeper into trouble. Jordanian officials say that is one reason the King has tried to mediate in the crisis.
By all accounts, the nation's economy is on the verge of collapse as a result of Jordan's decision to comply with the United Nations sanctions against Iraq. ''We are teetering on the edge of that,'' the Prince said.
And because of the widespread perception that Jordan supports Iraq, the country has few places to turn for help. Iraq and Kuwait, long Jordan's patrons and largest trading partners, are in no position to help now. Several other Arab countries that had been friendly are expelling Jordanian residents.
The Prince also said Saudi Arabia, Jordan's third-largest trading partner, was no longer willing to buy most Jordanian products.
Other countries are so suspicious of Jordan's motives, he added, that they have even been reluctant to offer aid for the thousands of refugees pouring over the border from Iraq.
Looking west for help, the Prince acknowledges, is not such a bright prospect just now either. The United States Congress is openly angry at the King, and the Prince and other Government officials accuse the Bush Administration of harboring secret designs to take control of the Arab world's oil.
''I think the Americans are thinking, 'Let's deal with the present brush fire, but while here, let's stick it out for keeps,' '' the Prince said. ''That doesn't mean American troops won't be seen withdrawing. It can be done more subtly.''
Prime Minister Mudar Badran went further and suggested that American companies had helped engineer the gulf conflict to create a new market for American-manufactured arms.
''When the military industry of the West realized that the end of the cold war would stave off wars, there was a need to think of ways and areas for marketing the weapons,'' he said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday.
 
Messages to Washington
Despite all that, Prince Hassan said he and his brother were trying to show Washington that Jordan was still an ally. King Hussein has written a letter to be delivered to every member of the Senate and the House on Friday, presenting Jordan's case. Prince Hassan, an articulate, Oxford-educated 43-year-old, is planning a trip next week to Washington, where he wants to testify before a Congressional committee.
''You can envy me that task,'' he said with a wry smile. ''The assumption is they will fry me alive.''
As all this goes on, King Hussein returned this evening from another diplomatic mission, this time in Rabat, Morocco, where he discussed the gulf crisis with the leaders of Morocco and Algeria - trying again, his brother said, to find a formula. The Algerian radio reported this evening that the King would leave shortly for Baghdad for another set of talks with President Hussein. A palace official said there was a chance that King Fahd would join them there, but Saudi officials dismissed that idea.
King Hussein was last in Baghdad two weeks ago. After the visit ended, neither the King nor the Iraqi leader said a word about their meetings. But today Prince Hassan acknowledged that the talks had been a failure.
''I'm afraid that is the case,'' he said. ''That is why he is making this last attempt with other Arab countries.''
''Maybe it is'' grasping at straws, the Prince added. ''But at least it is an attempt to see if anything is possible.'' And if it is not, he said, ''I think we are closer to war than ever before, because nothing is being offered but sign language.''
If war comes, he said, it will be largely because every Arab attempt to resolve the crisis has been thwarted by American intransigence and ignorance of the Arab world.
''The basic problem is outsiders looking into the area without any understanding of the perceptions in the area,'' he said. ''They should know that the problem with the Iraqis is that every time something happens to pressure them, they become more adamant on the question of withdrawal.''
 
'The Americans Knock It Down'
Still, he said, ''every time a group of leaders say they have a package, the first thing that happens is that the Americans knock it down by beginning with the assumption that nothing short of complete Iraqi withdrawal is acceptable.''
He added, ''To be symmetrical, the Iraqis have not been too forthcoming either.''
But the Americans concern the Prince the most. ''It has a lot to do with the cold war ending,'' he said, ''and this development of what the American are calling this 'new world order.'
''On an entire world scale, it seems you are now gaining brownie points for being anti- or pro-American.''
In that environment, he added, ''there is a sense that we are being punished as wogs who don't know our place and have stepped beyond our bounds.''
The Prince says he suspects he knows how he and his brother can redeem themselves in the eyes of Washington. But he cannot do it, and does not want to.
''Jordan is abiding by all the items of the U.N.,'' he said. ''We are not playing the American role, but we are not playing the Iraqi role either. I don't know what more we are meant to say. What are the magic words? Are we meant to be pejorative about Saddam Hussein? It would be tantamount to making a U-turn, which we are not prepared to do, and I don't think anyone should be expected to do so.''

HEADLINE: The Job Is Picking Up Garbage; 100,000 Want It

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
Frank Moos, who was laid off a year ago by a Wall Street brokerage house, postponed his honeymoon for a week just so he can take a written exam tomorrow for a city job. The job is picking up garbage.
Mr. Moos is one of more than 101,000 people scheduled to take the test for 2,000 jobs that are expected to be open in the New York City Department of Sanitation over the next four years -the largest number of applications on record for any Civil Service test.
When only about half that number are taking the Civil Service exam to become firefighters and a fifth to become police officers, such a turnout is striking. City officials say it is a testament to the times, when a job that pays well, offers security and does not require a high school diploma has mass appeal. 
''I want job stability,'' said Mr. Moos, 30 years old, of Ridgewood, Queens, who was laid off from his $26,000-a-year job as a clerk in the reorganization department of Drexel Burnham Lambert in September 1989 after six years. He found work only last month as a delivery man for a florist.
His motive was echoed by many others who signed up to take the test, including several college students, one of whom is studying to be a psychiatrist; a food preparer in an airport restaurant; an insurance claims adjuster, and a special-education teacher in the Bronx, who explained, ''I would get more money as a sanitation worker than as a teacher.''
Mr. Moos (pronounced mose) said he had become disillusioned with the uncertainty of Wall Street.
''I decided not to go back on the Street again because, first, there were few jobs, and two, I was disgusted,'' he said. ''Nothing was safe in that type of industry. You could be there one day and gone the next. So I decided to take all the city tests.''
So far, he has passed tests for police officer and correction officer. He said he is waiting to see if he is offered a job and will take the court officer's exam in November.
Another applicant, Robert Bimonte, 19, who lives in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, is studying psychology at John Jay College and is interested in becoming a psychiatrist.
But he said if he was offered a job, he would probably become a sanitation worker because of the ''good security.''
For Mr. Bimonte, the Sanitation Department is like family: his father is an assistant chief and his mother works as a clerk there. ''I've seen how the department has taken care of me and my family,'' he said.
 
Work as Aide
Michael Calabria, 20, of Richmond Hill, Queens, a police science major at John Jay, said hauling garbage is not so glamorous as being a police officer, but it pays well and is much safer.
And as a college aide for the Sanitation Department over the summer, he said, he learned that sanitation ''is much more than just picking up garbage.'' The department's starting pay is $23,000 a year, and the salary rises to $35,000 after five years, said a spokesman for the Department of Sanitation, Vito Turso.
By comparison, police officers and firefighters are paid $25,977 to start, moving to $31,575 after five years, said a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Personnel, Denise Collins. At six years and above, the police and fire salary is $38,914.
The applicants for the Sanitation Department paid $15 to take the test. They will gather at 26 schools throughout the city at three separate sessions. #2d Test Since 70's Of those who pass, only 15,000 will be chosen at random by a computer to take the more rigorous physical test. The last hurdle is a medical exam. Mrs. Collins said that when the test was last given, in 1983 as the city emerged from its financial crisis, there were 88,000 applications. The test before that had been in 1974, before the city's fiscal crisis.
By comparison, the last exam for police officer in June attracted 26,258 applicants. The police exam is given each year and averages about 20,000 applicants. The largest number of applicants recently was 40,000 in 1982. The Fire Department exam, given every four years, drew 45,405 applicants in 1987.
Last Saturday, Mr. Moos and his wife, the former Laura Ann Donohue, were married in Our Lady of Fatima Roman Catholic Church in Jackson Heights, Queens, but changed their plans when they learned that the sanitation test fell this Saturday, ''We postponed the honeymoon,'' he said. ''She didn't mind at all. She knew I had to take this test.'' 'A Better Deal'
Clifford Josey, 24, of Long Island City, Queens, has been working as a claims adjuster for an insurance company since graduation from Forest Hills High School in 1985 but would become a sanitation worker partly for ''better benefits'' and better pay.
Another applicant taking the test was a 28-year-old man working at a restaurant at La Guardia Airport who asked that his name be withheld so that his employer does not find out he is looking for another job. ''Prices going up the way they are, it's almost impossible to make a decent living from paycheck to paycheck,'' the man said. ''The city is a better deal.''
A large turnout for the sanitation test is not a new phenomenon, but the current outpouring reflects a troubled economy, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''It's now a zero-growth economy,'' Mr. Ehrenhalt said. ''That adds to the desirability of jobs that are relatively well paying and have a good deal of security.''
The Department of Sanitation, which has 1,200 supervisors and 7,000 other uniformed workers, says its average worker lifts five tons of garbage a day. There is no age limit for applicants. The city's personnel director, Douglas White, said that of the 67,000 applicants who actually took the sanitation exam in 1983 about half were minorities.
The director of equal employment for the Sanitation Department, Fernando Camacho, said there was a comprehensive campaign last spring to recruit minority applicants.
''We made a conscious effort to let people know this was a damn good job and how to get it,'' Mr. Camacho said.

HEADLINE: Japan Shielding Gasoline Buyers From Gulf Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 20

 BODY:
Six weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait, motorists in this completely oil-dependent nation are only now beginning to pay a bit more for gasoline, thanks to a Government that exerts quiet but enormous influence to insulate consumers from the Persian Gulf crisis.
So far, the strict control of gasoline prices is the most visible evidence that Tokyo is determined not to allow a repeat of the oil-crisis psychology of 1973 and 1979, which sent the economy into a tailspin and angered voters who are usually docile about high prices.
Japanese consumers already pay more for gasoline than almost anyone else in the industrialized world - a gallon costs as much as $3.75, including taxes of roughly $1.50. Contrast to the U.S. The unwritten rules that have steadied prices in recent weeks provide a vivid counterpoint to the sharp increases in the United States. 
To contain price rises, Japan is using the same mechanism that American trade negotiators regularly rail against: the tight-knit network of Japanese politicians, bureaucrats and industry officials who work together in what some call a Government-sanctioned cartel.
Except for rice, the staple of the Japanese diet and a fiercely protected commodity, oil has always been Japan's most politically charged commodity. That is not surprising in a country that warms most houses with kerosene, is madly in love with automobiles and increasingly disdains nuclear power.
Wholesale gasoline prices finally began to rise this week, and consumers are beginning to face somewhat higher prices at the pump.
Some officials here say that Japan's slowness in gathering political support for a bigger contribution to the forces in the Persian Gulf was partly a result of the fact that many Japanese still see the crisis as a distant problem with little effect on their daily lives.
''Up to now, many Japanese have not seen the gulf problem as affecting them because it hasn't cost them anything personally,'' an influential Japanese executive with close ties to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said the other day.
There are fears that a big increase in gas prices could spawn a consumer and political backlash, much like the sales tax imposed on all goods a year and a half ago that contributed to the ruling party's loss of control of the upper house of parliament. Moreover, it could slow capital spending and consumer buying, both of which are crucial to Tokyo's drive to narrow its huge trade surplus with the United States.
Japan's high gasoline tax is a remnant of the previous two oil-price shocks, which helped to foster huge energy efficiencies. As a result, oil imports have actually fallen considerably since the 1970's, though the economy has leaped in size.
 
'What the Japanese Want'
''What the Japanese want most in their energy markets is stability,'' said Richard J. Samuels, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of the Technology and an expert on Japanese energy policy. ''And they will go to great lengths to insure it.''
Officially, the Government says market forces are the biggest influence on the price of petroleum products. But after weeks of behind-the-scenes wrangling over who would bear the brunt of increased oil costs - Japanese consumers, the country's refiners or the oil-dependent manufacturers - the Government approved a modest increase in the wholesale price of refined petroleum products.
No one has said explictly how much of that increase will be passed along to consumers, though it could be as much as 21 cents a gallon, On a percentage basis, that is roughly 7 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline, compared with a 21 percent rise in retail gas prices in America since the gulf crisis began.
But last week, Kabun Muto, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, warned that the Government would ''closely watch to prevent opportunistic price increases'' and threatened legal action - a step to which the Government here rarely resorts - if retail prices jumped too quickly.
 
Low Price of Kerosene
Under one of the many informal rules that govern this society, the price of home heating oil and kerosene is kept artificially low.
Oil companies typically recover their profits, however, through the sale of gasoline. Also benefiting are Japan's huge number of gas stations - about 55,000, far more than the number in the United States. Though very small, they are usually quite profitable.
In fact, gasoline prices are so high Japan - about twice the level in America, excluding taxes - largely because the industry is so well protected by the trade ministry. Besides policies that shield inefficient gas stations and distributors, the Government requires that most refining be done in Japan, where expenses are high.
 
Rough Justice
Some experts theorize that having allowed the industry to reap its harvest in good times, the Government is now exacting some rough justice, insisting that consumers be protected from huge increases. Companies are being encouraged to dip into private stockpiles of gasoline if such a move will help them stabilize prices. Gas stations are being pressed to keep increases to a minimum.
Both the Government and the companies know they are walking a fine line between an illegal cartel and administrative guidance, the formal mechanism that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, known as MITI, uses to control supply. A sudden jump in prices in 1973 led to an antitrust suit that embarrassed the Government and is still widely discussed.
And there are few Japanese who have not read or heard about the exploits of Taiji Sato, an amateur boxer and gasoline station owner who tried to buck the system a few years ago by bringing inexpensive gas into the country from Singapore. But because he was bypassing the Japanese oil companies, which dominate the refining of petroleum products at giant operations, and selling his imported oil at a below-market price, Mr. Sato angered many people.
In his book, ''How I was Butchered by MITI,'' Mr. Sato contended that the fuel pipelines at his station had been cut by competitors, that his employees had been constantly harassed, and finally, that his banks had refused to extend credit because of pressure from the Government. Mr. Sato was violating a system that had been carefully engineered to assure that everyone made a profit and that excess competition did not ''confuse the market,'' a favorite Government term. Eventually, he gave up and sold his stations to his competitors, at a handsome price.
''It is a ludicrous system to Americans, but I am not sure I am entirely against it,'' said Frank Upham, an expert on Japanese law at Boston College. ''At times, like now, it can pay off.''

HEADLINE: FINANCING BY U.S. URGED IN BAILOUT

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
The head of the Federal agency overseeing the bailout of the savings and loan industry proposed today that the Government provide financing to purchasers of commercial and residential properties to speed the sale of $50 billion in real estate and other assets.
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, said that providing mortgages and other forms of financing to small and large buyers would help the Government sell the property by the end of the year at a higher price than the property is now fetching.
''The basic approach we ought to take is the same kind that a private seller would take and offer financing at the competitive level,'' Mr. Seidman said at a meeting of the oversight board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, in response to a question posed by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, a member of the oversight board.
''If we don't,'' Mr. Seidman added, ''then we will sell less property or at a lesser amount.'' 
 
Real Estate Markets Weak
The Government has generally resisted offering financing in the sales of the bulk of its real estate holdings, largely on the theory that it would require still more outlays of Federal funds. But declining economic conditions and soft real estate markets in many regions, particularly in the Southwest and Northeast, have led to new thinking by regulators on the least expensive way to resolve the savings and loan debacle.
The members of the oversight board did not take action on the proposals to provide financing, but it was clear from their questions that they might act soon to revise Resolution Trust's current policies. The board formulates policy for Resolution Trust. . Its members, in addition to Mr. Kemp, are Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve;Nicholas F. Brady, Treasury Secretary, and two representatives from the private sector: Robert C. Larson, a real estate specialist, and Philip C. Jackson, a former Federal Reserve official.
''There are a lot of people out there who are profoundly concerned about the ability to get loans,'' Mr. Kemp said.
As of July 31, the latest figures available, Resolution Trust's portfolio of assets from failed institutions had swelled to almost $165 billion, 10.8 percent of which was in real estate. Mr. Seidman said the agency had already sold more than $80 billion in assetsbut added that properties had been ''coming in faster than we're selling them.''
Last month, Mr. Seidman announced an aggressive campaign to sell $50 billion in assets by the end of the year.
An advisory committee to the oversight board, also recommended today that the Government re-evaluate its policy restricting financing of asset sales. That committee's acting chairman, Philip Searle, said a nationwide consensus had emerged that the tightening of credit by banks and other lending institutions had become an obstacle to the orderly sale of assets by the Government.
Mr. Searle told the board that there were problems in selling all types of real estate. He said that with the collapse of savings institutions in certain parts of the country it had become virtually impossible to sell raw land.
 
'Going to Require Help'
''Some of the ill-conceived projects are going to require help in financing if they are going to be moved,'' he said.
Mr. Seidman had also raised the idea of seller-financed sales at a hearing of the Senate banking committee earlier in the day.
At that hearing, widespread support began to appear to finance an effort that would ultimately reduce the Government bill from nearly 100 transactions, most of which were completed in 1988, in which savings institutions were transferred to private entrepreneurs. Those transactions are now expected to cost taxpayers more than $69 billion, more than previously estimated.
Resolution Trust said earlier this week that more than $2 billion could be saved by exercising options and repurchasing certain high-interest notes held by the institutions, but that the savings could require an initial expenditure of $22 billion.
Democrats and Republicans on the banking committee said that amount should be appropriated in addition to the amount needed to continue the bailout. Regulators have sought $100 billion to $110 billion to finance the rescue effort for the next fiscal year, which begins in October, but roughly half of that is in working capital that the regulators say would be returned to the Government.
''We ought to save every amount we can,'' said Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the committee. ''Whatever steps need to be taken, I think ought to be taken.'' The ranking Republican member of the committee, Jake Garn of Utah, and other lawmakers concurred.
 
Earlier Effort Recalled
Several committee members recalled the situation two years ago, when Congress and the Reagan Administration failed to appropriate enough money to contain the savings and loan problem, a failure that by many accounts contributed to the current crisis.
Many of the same lawmakers were on the banking committee at the time, some of whom acknowledged that the rush to support cost-cutting measures was a clear attempt both to avoid future criticism and blunt critics who have attributed the present situation to Congress.
Mr. Seidman said the full $22 billion might not have to be spent because the mere ability to exercise the options could be sufficient to encourage the savings institutions to renegotiate the terms of their contracts in a way that would save the Government money.
The options for cutting the costs of the 1988 deals were outlined in a report prepared by accountants, lawyers, investment bankers and consultants from private firms. The report was criticized at the banking committee hearing today by Senator Timothy E. Worth, Democrat of Colorado, who said that one of the major participants in the study, the accounting firm of McGladrey & Pullen, had been accused five years earlier of fraudulent accounting practices in a lawsuit filed by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
The lawsuit blamed the accounting firm for contributing to the collapse of the San Marino Savings and Loan Association, of San Marino, Calif.
The case was ultimately settled three years ago for an undisclosed sum.
Mark A. Jones, a partner at McGladrey, said it had never been found guilty of any wrongdoing in connection with San Marino and that the firm had disclosed two other instances of disputes with Resolution Trust before it was retained.
''Like other national firms, from time to time we get involved in lawsuits,'' Mr. Jones said. ''McGladrey has a clean track record when it comes to such suits.''

HEADLINE: Bulgaria Crawls From Crisis to Crisis

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria

 BODY:
It has been three months since Bulgaria, following the lead of its Eastern European neighbors, held its first free elections in more than four decades. Today, the country is still waiting for a new strategy to deal with an economic crisis that is fast spinning out of control.
Some blame the opposition for delays in dealing with the nation's problems, saying its intransigence helped create Bulgaria's stalemate. Others see the Socialists - who a year ago ruled the country as the Communists - as the culprits for trying to share responsibility for the country's disastrous condition. [The Associated Press reported that early Friday, three months after the elections, Parliament approved the Socialist-dominated Cabinet chosen by Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov, whose Socialist Party won the elections by almost 53 percent of the vote. The main opposition refused to vote on Mr. Lukanov's choices, which apparently represented his decision to abandon efforts to patch together a coalition government with the liberal opposition, The A.P. said.] As the political accusations fly, Bulgaria's economy continues to go from bad to worse. Electricity, gasoline, detergent and some food are rationed. Bread shortages have been reported in areas along the Black Sea coast. 
Cuts in deliveries from the Soviet Union and Iraq have reduced Bulgaria's oil supplies by 50 percent. Industrial production has fallen sharply, the grain harvest has been hit by drought, the rice crop has been contaminated by pollutants, hard currency reserves are dangerously low at $250 million, according to estimates, inflation is rising and, as the cold weather sets in, people are getting anxious.
Standing in line for meat in downtown Sofia recently, Emila Asenova, an accountant with three children, described the hardships, including the stunning news that now even cheese -a staple of the Bulgarian diet - was being rationed.
''There is a crisis in everything,'' she said. ''Already, there are cuts in electricity, which will mean not enough heat, and vegetables are too expensive to set aside for the winter.''
 
Prospects 'Pretty Bleak'
Even the experts are ready to confirm people's worst fears.
''There will be malnutrition because there are foodstuffs that are simply lacking, and no hard currency to buy them,'' said Emil Mutafchieff, a deputy editor at the magazine Ikonomika. ''And we are talking not just about a shortage of food, but of medicines, shoes and clothes.''
President Zhelyu Zhelev, a leader of the opposition who was elected in August in a rare moment of political compromise, has planned a trip to the United States to press for special consideration. Already, Bulgaria has asked Washington for a million tons of feed grain just to help its livestock through the winter.
''We are worried about the winter,'' Mr. Zhelev said in an interview. ''There could be food shortages, electricity shortages. We don't expect a famine in the true sense of the word, but the prospects are pretty bleak.''
Bulgaria, the smallest and most remote of Eastern Europe's new democracies, also worries that it may get lost in the great reshuffling now going on between East and West.
''We have the feeling that we are just a little bit forgotten,'' said Stefan Tafrov, foreign relations adviser to President Zhelev.
A mysterious fire in August at the headquarters of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, formerly the Communist Party Central Committee building, added a new and ominous note to the atmosphere of distrust that has prevailed here since June. At the time, supporters of the Union of Democratic Forces, the main opposition group, took to the streets in protest against the election results, setting off a summer of demonstrations.
 
Politics of Polarization
Antagonism toward the former Communists is so acute and widespead that some here wonder how long a single-party Government will be able to function.
''The camps are so polarized that a Government of Socialists would not be able to do anything with an opposition that does not want to cooperate,'' said Georgi Karasimeonov, a political scientist at Sofia University. The central issue dividing the two groups is the proposed pace and scope of economic change - issues the opposition considers nonnegotiable.
The hope among many members of the opposition, which itself is divided among moderates and radicals, is that the Socialists, overwhelmed by the country's economic problems, will soon be forced into new elections.

HEADLINE: Even With a Desperately Ill Economy, Gorbachev Balks at Radical Therapy

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Like a high-wire artist frozen in midstep, Mikhail S. Gorbachev seems neither willing to risk a perilous dash to capitalism nor able to move back to a socialist alternative. Just days after endorsing the free-market reforms drafted by his principal economic adviser, Stanislav S. Shatalin, the Soviet President called for a national referendum on a crucial feature of the plan, the legalization of private landholding.
That does not entirely surprise Western economists, who speculate that Mr. Gorbachev has only recently taken full measure of both the near-intractability of Soviet economic problems and the breathtakingly radical nature of Mr. Shatalin's proposed solution. For while the 500-day plan would by no means assure a recovery, it certainly would put a stake through the heart of the central authority that brought the economy to ruin.
 
Likely to Be Popular
Two well-publicized features of the Shatalin program guarantee it a broad measure of political and popular support. The plan would devolve control of mineral wealth, as well as virtually all power to tax and spend, to the individual Soviet republics. And it would aggressively defend the living standards of Soviet citizens during the transition, controlling excess national spending by slashing the budget for the military, the K.G.B., foreign aid and grandiose domestic projects. 
American experts, who have been frustrated by Soviet attempts to enjoy the sizzle of free markets without paying for the steak, are eager to think the best of the plan. ''It touches all the right bases,'' said Ed Hewett, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ''It looks better than anything I've seen,'' Richard Ericson, an economist at the Harriman Institute at Columbia Univeristy, agreed.
Abraham Katz, the president of the United States Council for International Business, is particularly enthusiastic about the endorsement of property rights. The plan, he said, ''has bitten the bullet on privatization.''
 
A Hurried Approach
Still, they all admit to more than a little skepticism. One problem is the inherently sketchy nature of a proposal drafted on a few months' deadline. ''I don't know how they expect to set up a banking system in 100 days,'' Mr. Ericson said.
But the more fundamental worry of the experts is: the plan promises far more than it can probably deliver. Under the plan, hardly anyone is to suffer a decline in living standards, and those who do are supposed to be swept along quickly in the rising tide of prosperity.
Padma Desai, an economist at the Harriman Institute, doubts that the budget can be balanced or agriculture successfully privatized without a sharp rise in the price of staple foods. And Mr. Katz wonders what will happen to the unemployed. ''The initial layoffs of 5 to 10 million,'' he said, ''could double or triple very quickly.''
In the initial phase of the plan, pent-up purchasing power would be absorbed by auctioning off some state-owned property and by reducing the Government budget deficit from about 12 percent of gross national product to less than 1 percent. Most subsidies to industrial enterprises, now amounting to perhaps 3 percent of G.N.P., would be eliminated. Farmers would have the option of demanding a share of land controlled by their collectives.
Later, half of all smaller enterprises would be sold. Wages would be indexed to prevent erosion of workers' incomes. By the end of the 500 days, businesses would be denationalized and the prices for 70 to 80 percent of output would be deregulated. Bloated industrial enterprises would no doubt need to shed millions of employees, the plan's advocates concede. But many of the unemployed, they expect, would find work in rapidly growing service businesses.
A fully private banking system would be ruled by a central monetary authority modeled after the United States' Federal Reserve. Foreign currency would be auctioned to the highest bidder. Antitrust laws would prevent newly independent giant enterprises from charging monopoly prices. Residence permits would be abolished, giving Soviet citizens the right to work and live where they choose.
The Shatalin rescue plan was commissioned by Mr. Gorbachev after Prime Minister Nikolai A. Ryzhkov had offended practically everyone by calling for a slow transition to free markets only after consumer purchasing power had been tamed by an immediate tripling of food prices.
 
Perestroika's Problems
But Mr. Gorbachev's own efforts at economic reform lie in tatters. Perestroika, in the words of Nick Eberstadt, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, has been shown to be ''nakedly bad economics.''
Mr. Hewett of the Brookings Institution is more specific. Perestroika, he explains, weakened the old-boy network of party bosses, enterprise managers and planning bureaucrats who owed allegiance to Moscow. But no practical alternative, no hidden hand of free markets, was put in place to keep the sprawling Soviet economy on track. Indeed, the system now seems on the verge of total breakdown, with Soviet cities facing shortages of bread and meat, even as part of the record grain harvest rots in the fields.
According to PlanEcon, a Washington consulting firm, Soviet output is now declining by about 3 percent a year. But falling production, Ms. Desai points out, is only one ingredient in a recipe for chaos. Soviet enterprises, no longer disciplined by central authority, have been raising wages to pacify employees. As a consequence, Ms. Desai says, far too many rubles are chasing too few goods.
 
Threat of Hyperinflation
The current 10 percent inflation strikes at the legitimacy of a regime that long boasted of perfect price stability. Worse, it threatens to explode into hyperinflation as panicky consumers rush to convert soft money into hard goods.
The present troubles of the Soviet economy serve to underline the challenge facing the Shatalin plan. Moreover, the program could be hampered by the lack of hard data on which to project everything from the book value of Government-owned limousines to the potential savings from cutting aid to Cuba. Much of this information has not been tabulated. And much of what does exist has apparently been hidden: Mr. Shatalin has complained that the central ministries, which would be abolished under a radical reform, have withheld critical data from his team.
 
Regional Disputes Expected
Others worry about the plan's shifting of economic power from ministries in Moscow to bureaucrats in the 15 republics. Mr. Eberstadt says that the richer republics, including Russia and the Baltic states, will refuse to subsidize development in poorer regions. ''I expect a noticeable drop in living standards in Central Asia,'' he said.
Mr. Ericson demurs, arguing that the republics that now benefit from Moscow's largesse will be more than compensated by the right to set their own budget priorities and avoid environmentally ruinous construction projects. He is concerned, however, that the central Government will be unable to raise the money to carry out the minimal functions of a national Government. ''I don't think it is realistic to devolve the power to tax,'' he said.
To Mr. Hewett, however, this ''unrealistic'' devolution of power may prove the plan's only memorable feature. A precondition to Soviet economic success, he argues, is the irreversible destruction of central state control that denies nationalist and ethnic differences. ''They need a framework for loose unity,'' he said, ''and Shatalin provides it.''
This does not mean the new system will work. Indeed, Mr. Hewett thinks that it is only a step to a national reordering, in which Russia will serve as the anchor for a Slavic state and the Baltics will break entirely with the confederation. That suggests years of political and economic turmoil ahead. But as Marx put it in another context, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Sees Peace Hopes Waning in Liberia

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, Sept. 20

 BODY:
After visiting Liberia to assess the civil war there, a senior American official has said prospects for a negotiated settlement of the conflict appear to be diminishing.
''I find the situation in Liberia deteriorating,'' Herman J. Cohen, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, said on Wednesday. ''More and more people are in danger of starvation, of death from disease,'' and ''the prospects for increased warfare are growing,'' he added.
Mr. Cohen said he had discussed the possibility that the United States might increase its role as a mediator in the conflict, but was not at liberty to say what the Government intended to do. Both rebel leaders, Charles Taylor and Prince Johnson, urged the United States to become more involved, Mr. Cohen said. 
 
Meeting Is Blocked
He added that he had hoped while visiting Monrovia, the Liberian capital, on Tuesday to meet with Brig. Gen. David Nimley, the commander of the presidential guard, but that he had been prevented from doing so ''because it was too dangerous to go very far from the United States Embassy compound.''
''Virtually throughout my time there,'' he said, ''there was firing and stray bullets were coming close to the embassy.''
He added, ''I saw large columns of smoke, indicating that large sections of central Monrovia are being burned down deliberately by the troops of the late President Doe; so that already is a very bad sign.''
Monrovia, Mr. Cohen said, ''may be destroyed before this is over.''
He also announced that the United States was increasing aid to Liberian refugees and displaced persons, including $2.3 million for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and $1.8 million for relief groups including the International Committee of the Red Cross. This was in addition to $1.6 million already pledged for refugees and the shipment of nearly 40,000 more tons of rice.
Mr. Cohen met on Wednesday with Mr. Taylor in northeastern Liberia near the Ivory Coast border town of Danane.
On Tuesday, he met briefly at the United States Embassy in Monrovia with Mr. Johnson.
After stopping in the Ivory Coast, Mr. Cohen is continuing his tour of West Africa, including visits to neighboring Burkina Faso, which has offered support to Mr. Taylor's rebel movement, and Nigeria, the main contributor to the West African peacekeeping force. Guinea, Gambia, Sierra Leone and Ghana have also sent troops.
 
Common Goal for Rebels Seen
The Ivory Coast, Liberia's eastern neighbor, has not joined the force and is widely seen as sympathetic to Mr. Taylor.
Leaders of the 16-nation Economic Community of West Africa States decided to intervene early last month, asserting that the war was no longer solely an internal conflict because thousands of their citizens were trapped in Liberia while an estimated 400,000 Liberians had fled to neighboring countries.
Fighting by the five-nation force intensified last weekend when Ghanaian planes bombed artillery positions held by Mr. Taylor's group, the National Patriotic Front. After holding talks with the two rebel leaders, Mr. Cohen said that both men ''would like to see Liberia with a truly democratic system, and they would cooperate in organizing that.''
In the past Mr. Taylor, the leader of the larger of the two rebel factions, has equivocated about his intention to hold national elections. Mr. Cohen said, however, that Mr. Taylor indicated his willingness to compromise.
''I have the feeling that Charles Taylor is prepared to negotiate everything,'' Mr. Cohen said.
Troops loyal to Mr. Taylor control most of Liberia. In the heart of the capital, however, Mr. Taylor's forces are fighting Prince Johnson's faction, soldiers loyal to President Samuel K. Doe, who was killed this month, and the West African force, which is trying to impose a cease-fire.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Soviets Urging U.N. Council To Back Iraq Air Embargo

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 20

 BODY:
The Soviet Union is asking members of the United Nations Security Council to send their foreign ministers to a Council meeting next week to approve a plan tightening sanctions against Iraq and occupied Kuwait by imposing an embargo on air traffic there and seizing their merchant shipping, diplomats said today.
The Soviet aim is to underscore the Council's determination to force Iraq to evacuate Kuwait by having its 15 member countries represented by their foreign ministers instead of their United Nations representatives, these diplomats said.
The last time the foreign ministers of the five permanent members - Britain, France the United States, the Soviet Union and China - attended a Security Council session was in 1987, when the Council approved a plan for ending the Iran-Iraq war. 
The Soviet Union has requested other such convocations, but the United States and other Western members say they have rejected Soviet demands for ministerial level meetings in the past by arguing that the Security Council's business was not sufficently important to justify convening their Foreign Ministers.
 
Jordan Appeal Postponed
But they admit that this argument is no longer valid when the Council is finally trying to exercise its power under the Charter to compel compliance with its decisions and when most Foreign Ministers will be in New York anyway attending the United Nations General Assembly.
The Soviet proposal came as the Security Council postponed the issuance of a formal appeal to all nations for aid to Jordan, the country most seriously hurt by the Council's economic sanctions against Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
A diplomat said the disagreement was technical and did not reflect any disagreement about Jordan's need for assistance.
 
Lost Exports Are Cited
Under Article 50 of the United Nations Charter, which gives any country suffering economic hardship from a Security Council decision ''the right to consult the Security Council with regard to a solution of those problems,'' Jordan has asked the Security Council for $1.9 billion in additional foreign assistance to cover the cost of applying the Council's sanctions over the coming year. This includes lost exports to Iraq and Kuwait, reduced remittances from its citizens working in those countries and an end to the cheap oil Iraq was giving it at roughly half the present world price.
The World Bank recently estimated that Jordan could lose a quarter of its annual gross national product as a result of the embargo. But at least 12 other developing countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Yemen and Pakistan, have also asked the Council for economic help running into billions of dollars to defray the cost to them of cutting off trade and other financial dealings with Iraq and Kuwait.
The World Bank believes Egypt will lose 5 percent of output and that more than 50 other developing countries face cuts of 2 percent or more in their rate of economic growth as a result of the Gulf crisis.
 
Precedent Is Feared
The United States opposed Jordan's initial request for the United Nations to organize a special pledging conference at which the world's richer countries would be asked to promise specific sums in aid. Diplomats say it feared this would set a precedent for a string of such pledging conferences to help every developing country hurt by sanctions.
Instead the Bush Administration argues that it can better help poor countries suffering from the impact of the Council's sanctions by privately asking richer nations like Germany and Japan to step up their aid.

HEADLINE: Citing a Default, Saudis Stop Sending Jordan Oil

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 20

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia today stopped all its oil deliveries to Jordan, which have long constituted about half of Jordan's daily consumption of oil, Arab oil industry executives said.
Dealing a harsh blow to the Jordanian economy, which has already been weakened by the gulf crisis, Saudi Arabia notified Jordan that it was witholding the oil because it had not received any payments for some time, the executives said.
Despite the notification, Arab diplomats here and in the gulf region said the oil cutoff was a clear expression of Saudi anger at Jordan, where popular sentiments have been running strongly in favor of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq since he invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
In normal times, Saudi oil shipments to Jordan have been running at an average daily rate of about 33,000 barrels, worth $1 million at current oil prices, Jordan consumes about 70,000 barrels of oil a day.
Western oil executives said the Saudis had already substantially reduced the flow of oil to Jordan through the Trans-Arabian Pipeline, and that the reductions had been especially sharp since the gulf crisis.
 
Oil as Financial Aid
This pipeline, which once ran from Saudi oil fields in the eastern province of the country through Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, has stopped functioning since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. But its Saudi-Jordanian section was still being used to pump Saudi oil to the Zarka refinery in Jordan.
Even though some Arab oil industry officials insisted the cutoff decision was made for economic reasons, many Arab diplomats said Jordan always viewed the Saudi oil largely as part of Saudi financial aid.
Indeed, in the past, Jordan had frequently fallen behind in payments without provoking a total cutoff of oil.
The Saudi move came immediately after several Palestinian leaders, including George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh, went to Amman for a conference a few days ago, where they expressed support for Iraq and willingness to fight against the United States. The bulk of the American troops facing Iraq are stationed in Saudi Arabia.
 
Iraq Supplies Jordan
The Arab oil industry officials, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified, said Saudi Arabia will resume pumping the oil through the pipeline ''as soon as Jordan resumes payment.''
Over the last few years, Iraq has also supplied Jordanian oil needs.
Even though Saudi Arabia slowed deliveries to Jordan just before the Gulf crisis, most Arab diplomats asserted that if the crisis had not erupted, Jordan would have had only to ask to get deliveries back to the average level.
But three weeks ago, Jordan asked that the flow be raised back to all 33,000 barrels a day and the Saudis did not not respond at all.
A senior Arab envoy in Western Europe said, ''To say this has nothing to do with the politics of Jordan in the Gulf crisis is not very believable.'' He added: ''The Saudis, as always, have left a bridge for the Jordanians to cross. If the Jordanians somehow come up with the money the Saudis will somehow find a way to resume pumping''.
But the diplomat said this was unlikely to happen soon and as long as the gulf standoff continues.
 
Jordan Hit Hard
The gulf crisis has hit Jordan hard, depriving it of hundred of millions of dollars from trucking goods to Iraq and from use of its port of Aqaba on the Red Sea as Iraq's main import outlet.
In addition, thousands of Jordanians earned hard currency working in the Gulf region and in Kuwait.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Egypt's Threadbare Economy Worn Further by Gulf Crisis

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 19

 BODY:
An Egyptian recording company owner named Hani Sabet was pondering the other day on how fortunes large or small may be won or lost in these days of crisis in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Sabet said his fortune was lost even before it was found.
He had signed a contract with a Kuwaiti entrepreneur who had demanded exclusive distribution rights for the music cassettes of two Egyptian singers, Hanan and Ihab. That was in late July. The deal was done and the contract signed. The new business partner had flown back to Kuwait to arrange payment - $40,000, half up front, half on delivery. Then, on Aug. 2, the Iraqi Army invaded Kuwait, and neither the business partner nor the money nor the contract has been heard of since. 
''End of story,'' the man said. ''End of deal.''
''Maalesh,'' said friends who heard the story, using an Arabic term that translates roughly as ''never mind.''
 
A Story Typical of Many
The story was one of many retailed here as Egyptians struggle to come to terms with the repercussions of a crisis that impinges directly upon their ability to survive in a threadbare economy that cuts the purchasing power of their money by 40 percent a year.
''It has been a catastrophe in all aspects,'' said Ismael Sabry Abdullah, a prominent economist, during a discussion of the impact of Baghdad's action on Egypt, a leading Arab adversary of Iraq's annexation of Kuwait and a leading Arab supporter of the American military buildup.
''It has set back all Arab development,'' he said of the crisis.
Before the invasion, Egypt's economy was on the skids anyway. The population of 56 million is growing at a rate that far outstrips the ability of the nation's arable land to sustain it. Half of all Egypt's food and 80 percent of its staple wheat is imported.
A foreign debt in excess of $50 billion hangs over the nation. Egypt receives $2.3 billion a year in United States aid, but to avoid suspension of the aid, Cairo has been forced to channel resources into repayment of a $7 billion debt to Washington for military hardware.
 
Meeting in Washington
Egyptian ministers are due in Washington this weekend to try to negotiate an oft-postponed agreement with the International Monetary Fund that would allow them to reschedule some debts and borrow more in return for a program of austerity at home.
Egypt's earnings in recent decades have been gleaned from exporting people to work in oil-rich countries, importing others as tourists and earning revenues from limited oil exports and the transit fees paid by vessels using the Suez Canal. But now many of the guest workers are unemployed, many tourists have been scared away and many tankers are idled for want of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil to ship.
Since Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, and its replacement of Kuwait's powerful currency with the much weaker Iraqi currency, Dr. Abdullah said, ''billions of dollars in Egyptian savings have been lost,'' and remittances from Egyptian workers in Iraq, which once totaled $5 billion a year, ''have for the great part dried up.''
The crisis has pushed up the price of oil, but as a modest exporter, Egypt stands to gain in only a small way: estimates by Western economists put the windfall at $300 million to $500 million a year. And while American warships have replaced tankers of Iraqi crude transiting the Suez Canal, overall revenues are expected to fall by $110 million dollars, the Government says.
A Government minister, Morris Makramallah, said Egypt's losses were estimated at $4.5 billion. But a Western economist said the accounting was not so precise.
Against those losses, the Bush Administration is pressing Congress to cancel Egypt's military debt, in part as a reward for sending tanks and mechanized troops alongside American forces in Saudi Arabia. Cancellation would free Egypt from having to repay $660 million this year. The European Community and Japan have offered emergency aid totaling several billion dollars to countries including Egypt.
''More money by itself does not solve the economic problems of Egypt,'' said Dr. Abdullah. ''You cannot cure a cancer with an aspirin.''
That reflected an assessment among senior Western diplomats that much depends on whether aid funds get lost in the bureaucracy of unproductive Government ministries rather than produce economic growth.
The initial assessment is that the losses could outweigh the gains from the West and the gulf states and from Kuwait's government-in-exile, which has promised to bankroll Egypt's losses and its promised deployment of two divisions in Saudi Arabia.
As for Mr. Sabet, the record company owner, he seemed to have fared better than the authorities. After the Kuwait deal fell through, he said, he courted buyers in the West and Australia for Hanan and Ihab's song and struck another deal. The price, he said, exceeded the lost Kuwait deal by an amount he prefers to keep to himself.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. Rejects Peace Efforts Offered by Jordan's Ruler

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
The United States opposed the latest attempt at Persian Gulf peacemaking by King Hussein of Jordan and has been lobbying among the Arab nations against proposals that would offer any advance concessions to gain Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, a senior Administration official said today.
But the United States would not object if Iraq and Kuwait negotiated their territorial and oil disputes after a complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the official said.
If the withdrawal takes place and Kuwait's Government is restored, the official said: ''Are we willing to talk about whatever Iraq's grievances may have been? Are we willing to ask the Emir to negotiate with Saddam Hussein in good faith on their differences? That's something very different.'' The official said, ''That kind of face-saving is innocuous and doesn't reward him for having done what he did.'' 
 
'Privileged Relationship'
But Administration officials, who insisted on not being identified, said the United States objected to provisions in King Hussein's proposal that would have linked withdrawal of non-Arab forces to Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, established an unspecified ''privileged relationship'' between Iraq and Kuwait in the future, and called for a Middle East peace conference that included the issues of Lebanon and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.
''Like all the other plans that involve rewarding Saddam Hussein, it can't be accepted,'' the senior official said of the King's plan.
Although the King's peace plan appeared to have fallen apart before it made much headway, the official said the Administration believed ''there's a danger'' that a similar approach to ending the Persian Gulf crisis could take hold in the future.
To avoid that, the official said, ''We are pointing out, and I think very successfully, that to appear to reward what Saddam Hussein has done is to increase significantly the danger to everybody in the area and that their security, stability and everything else in the development of the region depend on saying that this behavior is unacceptable, will not be tolerated and nobody will be allowed to profit from it.''
Taking a critical tone, the official said, ''King Hussein has been looking from the time this crisis arose for what he calls an Arab solution,'' and he then indicated that all such proposals have been unacceptable to the United States.
''I haven't seen one yet that did not have some element of concession to Saddam Hussein, whether it's King Hussein's, whether it's Arafat's,'' the official said.
He said the Arab peace proposals that have surfaced thus far are ''all from people who are inclined toward the Iraqi case'' in the crisis. The official suggested that King Hussein might have trouble getting support in the gulf for any peace proposal.
The leaders of that region ''are very bitter at him,'' the official said.
But he said that what concerns the Administration is that ''the Kuwaiti ruling family is not the most beloved in the Arab world.''
That could lend momentum to another peace proposal like the King's failed initiative if the economic, military and political pressure becomes strong enough, officials said.
As the King's actions were discussed in Washington, Iraq said President Hussein wanted American television networks to broadcast a videotaped message to the American people in response to one by President Bush that was broadcast in Iraq on Sunday.
The White House said it would not interfere with the broadcasting of such a tape. But the State Department reported that Assistant Secretary John Kelly told Mohammed al-Mashat, the Iraqi Ambassador, that Mr. Hussein would have to make his own arrangements with the networks.
 
More Reservists Called Up
The White House announced that the President, who has been working to hold together the embargo against Iraq, will meet in the White House on Tuesday with President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, one of the Administration's first allies in the gulf crisis.
Mr. Bush will meet on Sept. 29 with Sheik Jabar al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the deposed Emir of Kuwait, before flying that day to New York, where he will address the United Nations General Assembly on Oct. 1.
The White House declined to comment on news reports that Mr. Bush would visit the troops in Saudi Arabia at Thanksgiving.
The Pentagon continued to bolster its military forces in the gulf region, ordering 7,106 more reserve soldiers and airmen to active duty. That increased the total number of reservists called so far to about 21,000. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said on Wednesday that he expected about 30,000 more to be called by the end of the month.
In a written statement issued by the Pentagon, Mr. Cheney dropped the Administration's objections to a move by Congress to require that the normal legislative procedures be applied to foreign contributions granted to reduce the costs of the gulf operation.

HEADLINE: Time Is Running Out for Bills on Puerto Rico

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
Legislation permitting a vote by Puerto Ricans on the United States commonwealth's political future could come to the floors of the House and Senate this year, but its supporters said today that time was running out for the bill's final passage.
Legislative aides involved in the issue said they expected the full House to vote on the measure quickly, after a committee approved it on Wednesday. They hope the Senate will pass a companion bill that has already been endorsed in committee and is awaiting floor action.
But the two measures differ in crucial details, and it is not certain that there is enough time left in the legislative session, which is expected to end in early October, to work out the differences. 
 
Major Differences
The proposed referendum would allow Puerto Ricans to choose among statehood, independence or enhanced commonwealth status. The new commonwealth plan would establish procedures under which Federal laws and regulations applying to Puerto Rico could be modified in order to enhance the island's economic growth.
One major difference in the two bills involves when and how the referendum's decision would take effect. The Senate would make the referendum decision final but would delay the effective date until 1996 if statehood is chosen. The House bill would subject the referendum's decision to further Congressional review, and if the decision is approved by Congress the decision could be ratified by a final vote of Puerto Ricans in 1992.
''At this point it is really iffy,'' said Angelo Falcon, an analyst at the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, which favors the referendum but takes no position on which is the best solution for the island.
''There are a lot of issues involved here,'' said Mr. Falcon. ''The two bills are very different.'' He estimated that there is an even chance of the bill's becoming law this year, and this would allow the referendum to take place next year.
 
Votes of Nonresidents
The basic idea of a referendum is backed by the Bush Administration and by all major political parties in Puerto Rico. But the consensus ends there, with sharp divisions remaining about what the best outcome for the islanders would be, and even about who should be allowed to vote.
The House bill does not decide whether the 3.5 million residents of the Caribbean island would be the only people allowed to vote, or whether the referendum would include Puerto Ricans living in the United States. The House bill said that should be decided by the Legislature of Puerto Rico in consultation with a ''dialogue committee'' including the island's three political parties.
Under this formula, the House bill leaves open the possibility that nonresident Puerto Ricans could vote in the referendum if they or one of their parents was born on the island.
But opinion is divided on the island over whether mainlanders should be allowed to vote.
There are 2.5 million Puerto Ricans living in the United States, including 900,000 in New York City.
Mr. Falcon said it was impossible to say, based on current polling data, whether the nonresident vote would tip the decision to statehood, independence or enhanced commonwealth status.
 
Polls Show Statehood Leading
''Inside Puerto Rico, the polls have statehood way in front, with independence way back,'' he said. But he added that those opinions might well change in a campaign before a referendum.
The version of the bill before the Senate makes no provision for those living off the island to vote in the referendum.
The Senate bill is different in many other respects from the House bill, and with the Congressional recess looming it is not certain that there is enough time for the differences to be resolved by a conference committee.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Eclipsed in the Reagan Decade, Ralph Nader Again Feels Glare of the Public

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
As sightseers strolled past the Capitol a few days ago, this is what they saw: a gleaming blue sky, a majestic spill of shining white steps and a lanky man in a somber suit leaning over a nicked lectern accusing Congress of hypocrisy.
It was a timeless Washington scene - Ralph Nader on the attack - but also very much a current one. After a decade in which he and his anticorporate ethic seemed to fade from public view, Mr. Nader has been increasingly visible, in the press and in politics.
Has Washington changed, or has he?
''They say, 'Hey, he's on the ascendance again,' '' he said. ''It's the press's own creation. We've been doing what we've been doing.'' 
 
In the News
But it was this summer that Life magazine ranked him as one of the century's 100 most influential Americans. This month, a cover story in Forbes magazine derided him as ''Ralph Nader, Inc.,'' a hypocritical and paranoid empire-builder. And an article this month in Vanity Fair reported, among other things, that he recently ate a hard candy that contained a red dye he has described as unhealthy.
That detail points to Mr. Nader's twin reputations, as a man calling for safer consumer goods and man eschewing consumer goods; as the person who has done the most to make cars safe, and as the person who does not own one. Reflecting on the uneasiness between the two images, Mr. Nader says the debate about whether he is an ascetic misses the point of his work. He has tried not just to reinvent the automobile but also to reinvent the nation's idea of democracy.
''I want people to spend more time as public citizens,'' he said. ''Otherwise they won't be able to enjoy their time as private citizens.'' Asked if he is an ascetic, Mr. Nader said ''no.''
For good or ill, as he moves into his fourth decade of advocacy, Mr. Nader stands almost alone in Washington as an emblem of the difference one person can make, a sentiment shared by the various tourists happening upon this week's press conference.
 
Championing the Little Person
''He's looking out for us,'' said Bill Patterson, a 61-year-old auto lease agent from Jacksonville, Fla., as his wife snapped a photo. ''He's the champion of the little person.''
Last year, Mr. Nader played a central role in passing a California initiative that rolled back the cost of auto insurance. He also led a successful, though bitter, fight against a proposal to raise Congressional pay by 51 percent; when he stepped up to the battered lectern this week, he was seeking the repeal of a smaller increase approved by the House of Representatives.
And old seeds have been producing new harvests: last month, Mr. Nader's old nemesis, the General Motors Corporation, announced its plan to start putting air bags in all the cars it builds in this country.
Discussing perils and prospects of the coming decade, Mr. Nader argues that corporate domination of daily life is at a high and true choice in electoral politics at a low. He says the forces that used to offset corporate influence - family, neighborhood, church, and labor unions - are in decline, leaving the average citizen with fewer buffers.
As workers, he says, citizens are increasingly reliant on employers for necessities like health insurance and child care; as consumers, they are subjected to increasingly sophisticated marketing campaigns. But Mr. Nader also expresses cautious hope: that those conditions would give rise to a hypercitizenship, what he calls ''real democracy.''
''This could be the decade, because we're heading toward economic collapse,'' he said in an interview. ''If there's one thing that galvanizes people from the level of disgruntlement to action, it's an economic collapse.''
It has been 27 years since Mr. Nader, now 56, left his law practice in Hartford, and hitchhiked to Washington. Two years later, his book ''Unsafe at Any Speed,'' published by Grossman, asserted that the Chevrolet Corvair was a safety hazard and that General Motors was ignoring the flaws in order to increase profits.
When the company then hired a private detective to follow Mr. Nader, he was catapulted to national hero status. General Motors eventually paid him $425,000 for the invasion of privacy, endowing him with the money to expand his organization.
 
Reveling in Frugality
Mr. Nader went on to help establish more than two dozen public interest groups. He was also a major force behind the passage of several landmark laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Freedom of Information Act.
Mr. Nader entered the public consciousness not only as an advocate of government regulation but as an embodiment of frugality. He said that for many years he lived in an $80-a-month rooming house and that he now lives in ''a simple room'' near Dupont Circle, though he keeps its address secret.
In the early 80's, he said he was still wearing one of the 20 pairs of shoes he bought at the PX before leaving the Army in 1959. A lifelong bachelor, he says he lives on about $15,000 a year.
The reputation for personal sacrifice is among the targets of the attack this month in Forbes, which paints a picture of a man who travels in limousines and sleeps in a $1.5 million townhouse. The magazine accused organizations affiliated with Mr. Nader of failing to file required tax forms with the I.R.S., and argued that Mr. Nader gets an inordinate amount of his money from rich trial lawyers who share his passion for lawsuits.
 
A Bit Defensive
Mr. Nader disputes those accusations, and his lawyer has sent Forbes a list of retraction demands, threatening a lawsuit. Mr. Nader said the townhouse, where he visits but does not live, belongs to his sister. He said the I.R.S. forms are on file as required, and that contributions from trial lawyers represent less than one percent of his fund raising.
As for the hard candy Vanity Fair reported him eating, he said his throat was parched and that it was the only thing within reach. The magazine said he ate an ice cream bar despite his admonitions against sugar; he said the reporter insisted on buying it for him.
Perhaps spooked by decades of inspection for signs of hypocrisy, Mr. Nader, in a phone conversation, volunteered an explanation for why he had been scratching his eyebrows during the interview: simply because they had itched. ''It might have been misinterpreted as a nervous twitch,'' he said.
Though he keeps it on a tight leash, Mr. Nader does have a sense of humor. ''I don't want to get into a excursus on eyebrows,'' he said.
 
Partial to the Courts
A more serious criticism of Mr. Nader involves his fondness not for ice cream but for lawsuits. For example, his critics point to his adamant opposition to no-fault auto insurance laws that would reimburse the injured for medical expenses but prohibit them from suing for pain and suffering. That opposition, they say, drives up the cost of insurance and channels huge sums into the pockets of middle-man lawyers.
But Mr. Nader bristles at the suggestion that the right to sue be curtailed. Without the ability to sue for pain and suffering, he said, an injured person is reduced to the ''state of a chattel.'' Mr. Nader calls the courts ''the least corruptible of the three branches of government.''
He has been called shrill, dour, and a national nag, and Mr. Nader's speaking style can reinforce the suspicion that he lives in a realm beyond normal human passions. Attempting to outline a vision of the future, Mr. Nader slips quickly into the colorless cant that has earned him a reputation as tedious: ''Rights and remedies are the foundation, and on top of that are strategies, tools, and know-how.''
The answer for problems in the home, he says, is for people ''to go to the village green and improve their polity, their community.''
 
A Dream Career
For most people the public realm is a means to an end, better schools or fewer toxic wastes. Mr. Nader often appears to view the trip to green as the end in itself. ''I just think that the striving for justice, when you spell it out, has to be seen as a source of pleasure,'' he said.
What would he do if he lived in a perfectly just society, with no more striving needed? The question delights him.
''I would be a satirist,'' he said. ''Once you live in a perfectly just world, the goal of society would be humor - what would be the point of anything else?''

HEADLINE: New Rift Is Created in Budget Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, and the Bush Administration's chief economic policymakers disagreed today over how to proceed with an agreement to reduce the Federal budget deficit once one is reached.
But for the third straight day, White House officials and the top Congressional leaders met for hours in a back room at the Capitol without reaching an accord.
The prevailing view in the Capitol is still that some resolution will be found before automatic across-the-board spending cuts go into effect in most Government programs Oct. 1, the beginning of the 1991 fiscal year. But legislators and their staffs who express this opinion say they cannot imagine how the deadlock will be broken. 
Mr. Dole offered one suggestion today that he characterized as merely procedural and not a solution to the impasse. The White House apparently rejected it, at least initially.
 
Dole Wants Two-Package Deal
Mr. Dole proposed that the budget deal be divided into two packages. One would include spending cuts and tax increases that could be agreed to by the two sides.
The other would include a capital gains tax cut and other measures that would result in reduced revenue or increased spending. Each of these, under Mr. Dole's proposal, would have to be offset by a comparable tax increase or spending reduction.
A person close to the negotiations said that John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director, opposed the idea, mainly on the ground that it would diminish the prospects of a reduction in the capital gains tax rate.
Mr. Dole acknowledged tonight that the White House had balked at his plan. The Administration officials, he said, recalled that Mr. Dole had failed last year to get a capital gains measure through the Senate under somewhat similar procedures.
Mr. Dole said he thought his idea might actually ''enhance'' approval of the capital gains measure.
 
Democrats Might Agree to Plan
In any event, he said in an interview, he did not see his proposal as an ''icebreaker'' in the budget negotiations but merely as a procedural step once an agreement was arrived at.
Some Democrats have informally suggested that they might agree to a separate vote on a package of capital gains cuts and some offsetting tax on the wealthy.
Among the other deficit-increasing proposals that have been offered by the two sides are increases in child-care benefits, a lower standard deduction on Federal income tax returns, tax breaks for oil and gas producers and a more generous tax credit for poor workers.
The negotiators plan to meet again Friday.
The participants have refused to talk about the substance of their negotiations publicly. But some legislators and staff assistants received briefings this morning on the first two days of talks. Afterward, several of them said they had been told that nothing tangible had been accomplished.
The talks, in a back office of the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, involve eight men without their staffs. In addition to Mr. Foley, Mr. Dole, Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman, they are: the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and the Republican leader, Bob Michel of Illinois; the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
 
Restating Tax Positions
For part of the meetings, said those who received a rundown on them, the two sides restated their positions on taxes.
The Republican position is that a capital gains tax cut is needed to stimulate a flagging economy, that wealthy people would actually pay more taxes with a lower capital gains rate because they would be encouraged to sell investments and that higher income taxes on the wealthy would produce a drag on the economy.
The Democratic stance is that a capital gains reduction would primarily benefit the well-to-do and that it would thus be unfair unless it were offset by some other higher tax on the wealthy.
''What we have,'' said a Democratic staff assistant, ''is two different world views.''
When the tax discussions seemed to be going nowhere, the talks turned, at Mr. Darman's suggestion, to spending cuts in entitlement programs. These are programs like Social Security, Medicare and agriculture price supports for which payments are made automatically to everyone who meets the qualifications.
 
Wear of Meetings Is Showing
Republicans want to cut these programs more heavily than the Democrats do.
The participants are beginning show the wear of the tedious meetings in their faces.
At one point today, Senator Dole left to get a haircut. ''I walked back in, and I had not missed a thing, and they never missed me,'' he said.
Asked how the Administration officials and Congressional leaders could stay at the bargaining table for so long when so little progress was being made, one official said that neither side wanted to be blamed for cutting off the talks.
 
They Don't Want to Say Goodbye
''What keeps you at the table,'' he said, ''is often not what you say but what you don't say. That is the word, 'goodbye.' ''
The other reason, of course, is the pressure both sides feel from Oct. 1 deadline, a week from Monday.
The Office of Management and Budget has said that furloughs of Federal workers would begin immediately.
Officials at the Federal Aviation Administration said that air traffic controllers would be required to take two and a half working days off every 10 days and that overtime would be abolished.
The result, the aviation officials said, would be the cancellation of about a third of the flights taking off from major airports during the peak hours of travel.
Similarly, meat and poultry inspection would be curtailed, student loans would be reduced, Social Security checks would be delayed and virtually all Americans would quickly feel the pinch.

HEADLINE: Who Should Pay for the S.& L. Bailout?

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Kennedy 2d; Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, is a member of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Though pushed for now from the front pages of the newspapers, the cost of the savings and loan bailout is mounting. A year ago, President Bush said the price tag wouldn't top $50 billion. Today we know that the bailout fund will be bankrupt before Election Day, with scarcely one-third of all bankrupt and brain-dead savings institutions laid to rest.
The question is not whether to pay. It is how to pay. And it is who pays. The current bailout law raises funds according to a costly ''borrow and spend'' philosophy that adds billions to the bailout cost in interest. It drives up interest rates and the budget deficit. It also places the bulk of the bailout burden on those who can least afford to bear it: America's working and poor families. 
This deficit spending ''cure'' may be worse than the disease. We need legislation to finance the bailout on a pay-as-you-go basis so we won't jeopardize the country's economy.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that at least another $100 billion, excluding interest, is needed to pay off the depositors of failed S.& L.'s. This awesome financial burden should be borne up front over five years with three discrete measures. First, by a 7.5 percent surtax on the unearned income - interest, dividends and capital gains - of individuals earning over $100,000 per year, excluding the first $7,500 of such income. Second, by a 5 percent surtax on the income tax of corporations earning over $75,000 per year. Finally, by closing the ''angel of death'' loophole that forgives taxes on appreciated capital gains when the asset owner dies.
These provisions will raise $21.2 billion per year, paying for the bulk of the bailout in 5 years rather than 40.
Such legislation makes sense. It saves hundreds of billions of dollars in interest payments. Data from the General Accounting Office and the Office of Management and Budget indicate that the total cost of the bailout, if paid for under the current law, will be $1.369 trillion. Incredibly, over $913 billion of that amount will be spent just to pay interest on borrowed funds. That's a tab we send to our children and grandchildren because we lack the courage to pay today. And it shifts the bailout burden from those who cannot afford to bear it to those who can. Over the last decade, working and poor families have endured a double whammy: reduced earning power and higher tax rates. Families in the middle have watched their taxes creep up by over 3 percent. Their incomes have kept pace only because they work longer hours and second jobs. The income of the poorest fifth of our families actually dropped by 9 percent, while their taxes rose 3 percent.
The wealthiest Americans, however, have enjoyed a double bonus: deep tax cuts of up to 23 percent and stunning income growth. Income from dividends climbed 49 percent; from interest, 106 percent; from capital gains, an astounding 109 percent. A booming stock market also brought huge increases in corporate income. Much of this new wealth resulted from the high interest rates generated by rogue S.& L.'s as they dueled for depositor dollars.
The Federal Reserve Board estimates that 28 percent of the bailout money will pay off depositors of $100,000 or more. And that doesn't include the wealthy investors who chopped up deposits in excess of $100,000 into smaller accounts to obtain full Federal insurance coverage.
Of course, all efforts must be made to recover the ill-gotten gains of the white-collar crooks who ripped off America's S.& L.'s. The cold reality, though, is that no matter how many criminals we catch, we will recover only a fraction of the money lost. The taxpayers are stuck for the rest.
Rarely, if ever, has our Government asked less of the wealthy and powerful than it does today. As our nation faces the greatest financial crisis in its history, it is only fair that they take up their appropriate share of the bailout burden. Working families should not be asked to pay for a crisis that brought them nothing but higher interest rates on their home, business and consumer loans.
A pay-as-you-go financing plan for the savings and loan bailout will save hundreds of billions of dollars, inject fairness into the bailout process and allow our children to build a future better than the present.

HEADLINE: Rinfret Is Said to Be Sitting on Own Funds He Donated to Campaign

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
While telling Republican leaders that his campaign is broke, Pierre A. Rinfret has not spent the $540,000 of his own money that he contributed to the campaign, top Republicans said yesterday.
Instead, they said, Mr. Rinfret was trying to set up a meeting with them today in which he would insist that they raise at least $1 million for radio and television advertising before he would agree to spend his own funds. Several Republicans said he told them at a reception for Vice President Dan Quayle on Tuesday that he had transferred the funds to a separate bank account.
 
Campaigning Suspended
Mr. Rinfret's use of his own money as a lever on Republicans is particularly significant because Republican leaders have conceded that he would not have received the Republican nomination for governor if it were not for his promise to donate his own money to the campaign. The candidate, an economic consultant, has said that his net worth is $14 million. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Rinfret told Republican leaders that he had no more money for campaigning and that he was ''probably going to have to shut down our operations on Friday'' unless Republicans started supporting him financially. That strategy of pressuring party leaders prompted Mr. Rinfret's campaign manager to quit. Mr. Rinfret, who said he would now be his own campaign manager, has suspended campaigning.
Mr. Rinfret told The Associated Press last night that unless state Republican leaders made the $1 million commitment to his campaign, he might abandon the race and ''go sailing for 40 days.'' He added that he might endorse Herbert London, the Conservative Party candidate, if he did not receive the commitment.
Mr. Rinfret also told The Associated Press that he was upset with state party leadership. ''The party is a disaster. There is no party,'' he said, adding that he was referring to Republican leaders in state government.
Mr. Rinfret's running mate for lieutenant governor, George F. T. Yancey Jr., said that he had spoken to Mr. Rinfret and that in appealing to Republican leaders, he was ''rattling the cage and hoping someone will come to the rescue.'' He added that ''we need $1 million to get on TV.'' Mr. Yancey said that in any event he would continue his campaign, which has been conducted almost entirely upstate.
Peter Rinfret, Mr. Rinfret's son and business associate, declined to comment last night on whether the candidate's $540,000 was still available. ''We'll file our financial reports and then everyone will know,'' he said. The next report is due Oct. 5.
 
Two More Leave Campaign
The disclosure of the unspent money came as the Rinfret campaign shakeup continued with the ousting of the press secretary and deputy press secretary, Bryan Flood and Kelly Naioti.
The campaign staff's key survivors have few ties to the state Republican Party. They are Eddie Mahe, a Washington political consultant; John Denny, a Pennsylvanian who was recommended by Mr. Mahe and is the deputy campaign manager, and Peter Rinfret.
Republican legislative aides blamed Mr. Mahe for the pressure tactic and said Republican leaders might demand his removal from the campaign as a price of cooperation.
The disclosure that Mr. Rinfret has not spent his own money was buttressed by figures he reported to the State Board of Elections and his own statement last week that he had raised $1.25 million. It was not known whether that figure included his own funds.
He has run a relatively low-budget campaign against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo that Republican political consultants doubted has exceeded $700,000. He has had no radio or television advertising and his biggest expenses during the summer were payroll and chartered aircraft for campaigning.
Several Republicans, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Rinfret's $540,000 was to be used for late campaign commercials but that he has told them he would not spend that money at all if they did not raise $1 million. Most state and local candidates in recent years have been expected to finance much of their own campaigns.
Another Rinfret campaign associate, William E. Simon, the former Secretary of the Treasury, said he had not quit as finance chairman but would '' work hard for Pierre's election within the constraints of my travel schedule.'' He said Wednesday that he would leave for the Far East next week and not return until after the November election. He spent much of the summer on his yacht in Europe.
The main figures in the negotiations with Mr. Rinfret are J. Patrick Barrett, the Republican state chairman; State Senator Roy M. Goodman, the Manhattan Republican leader who recruited Mr. Rinfret as the candidate, and the Republican legislative leaders, Ralph J. Marino, the State Senate majority leader, and Clarence D. Rappleyea, the Assembly minority leader. Mr. Barrett and State Senator Guy J. Velella, chairman of the State Senate Republican Campaign Committee, planned to meet with him last night.
Mr. Goodman and Mr. Barrett are multimillionaires themselves and Mr. Goodman is sitting on at least $1 million in State Senate and Manhattan Republican campaign funds. Mr. Marino and Mr. Rappleyea have access to political action committees interested in state legislation.
 
Steering Clear of Dispute
The state's two top Republican elected officials appeared to be steering clear of the controversy. State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said he had had no contact with his running mate, Mr. Rinfret, on the matter, while Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato did not return telephone calls to his office. A press aide said he was in Washington yesterday and today.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the party's New York City mayoral candidate last year, did not return a telephone call seeking his reaction.
The mood among other leading Republicans was mixed - either anger at Mr. Rinfret for what they considered pressure on them and his isolation from the party, or sympathy with him because the party seemed to have isolated him.
Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island, the leading Republican municipal official in the city, reflected the latter view when he said that ''you can't throw a neophyte to the wolves.''

HEADLINE: $9 Million Won For Loss of Arm In Drunken Fall

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
A dishwasher who fell onto a subway track and was hit by a train has been awarded $9.3 million in damages even though he was drunk at the time of the accident.
In one of the largest personal injury awards ever granted in New York State for loss of a limb, a Bronx jury on Wednesday awarded $9.3 million to Francisco Merino, 30 years old, a resident of Pueblo, Mexico, who lost his left arm.
Lawyers for the plaintiff said Mr. Merino had testified that he had been drinking when he fell to the tracks at the 183d Street IRT station on April 10, 1980, and was hit by a northbound train. 
But they argued that their client would not have fallen to the tracks if transit workers had followed agency procedures and removed him from the platform when they noticed that he was intoxicated.
 
Finding Called 'Ludicrous'
Lawyers for the New York Transit Authority, saying Mr. Merino was to blame for his injury, called the jury's liability finding ''ludicrous'' and its award ''excessive.'' They said they would appeal the decision.
The Transit Authority lawyers said the token clerk who saw Mr. Merino on the platform had followed agency procedures, which require transit employees to notify the transit police if they see a passenger who ''appears unable to take care of themself because of intoxication or some other reason.''
The token clerk called the station command center to report that there was an intoxicated person on the platform, the authority's lawyers said. About 15 to 20 minutes after the call was made, Mr. Merino fell to the tracks. The lawyers could not say whether the command center had notified the transit police of the problem.
The Bronx jury awarded Mr. Merino $8.6 million for future pain and suffering, $514,800 for future loss of wages, $16,875 for loss of earnings, $200,000 for pain and suffering, and $17,055 for medical expenses.
 
Cut in Award Expected
Legal experts in torts said yesterday that they expected the award to be substantially reduced on appeal. In the past when the Transit Authority has been found fully liable for the loss of a person's dominant arm, awards have ranged from $1.25 million to $1.5 million, said the legal experts, who called Mr. Merino's award one of the largest of its kind.
George C. Christie, a professor at Duke Law School and an expert on torts, said: ''If the guy were a baseball player like Jose Conseco, then an award of that size would not be out of order, because it would represent real economic loss to the person in terms of earning power. But even if it were a jogger or amateur violinist who lost a limb and could no longer pursue their passion, this would be a very large award.''
Mr. Merino, who had been working in the United States as a dishwasher for a year before the accident, said through his lawyers, Harry H. Lipsig and Partners, that he would not discuss the case. The Associated Press said Mr. Merino's wife and four children live in Pueblo.

HEADLINE: LAW: AT THE BAR;
When the Public Interest Becomes the Interest of The Corporate World

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, law school deans in New York received invitations to attend a ''Constitution Day'' banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. It was held Monday and the featured attraction was Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy of the United States Supreme Court, giving the first annual Gauer Distinguished Lecture in Law and Public Policy.
Not only could the deans attend the $150-a-plate dinner without charge, but they could also bring along six professors or students. (''The dress for adults is black tie,'' the invitation stated. ''Since this may create a problem for students, a dark suit and tie for the gentlemen and an appropriate dress for the young ladies will be quite acceptable.'') The tempting offer came from an organization most had never heard of but that sounded simpatico: the National Legal Center for the Public Interest of Washington. But when the academics showed up, many were taken aback. 
In contrast to most public interest law gatherings, the Waldorf event was attended mostly by older white men. There were fewer beards, more cigars. The hosts were not the usual assortment of civil rights, consumerist and women's groups but American Telephone and Telegraph, Dow Chemical, General Motors and International Paper.
For Jordana Schwartz, who as a third-year student at Fordham Law School helps run soup kitchens and a homeless shelter, it was a revelation. ''I wasn't aware that all these corporations were interested in public interest law,'' she said.
Most of those active in what is generally called public interest law say times are bad. Money is tight, interest down. But according to those at the National Legal Center for the Public Interest, which one of its leaders described as ''an anti-Nader Nader organization,'' the problem is not so much one of a bad economy or waning idealism as one of terminology.
This is a group that has taken the famous dictum of Charles E. Wilson one step further. It is no longer only what's good for General Motors that is good for America, but what's good for Dow Chemical, Amway, Shell Oil, 3M and others represented on the legal center's board of directors. And if one does not believe it, the center's officials do not let you forget that it has qualified for tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
The legal center, founded in 1975, defines itself as a ''nonpartisan, educational and public service foundation'' whose core values consist of ''the rights of individuals, freedom of enterprise, private ownership of property, balanced use and protection of private and public resources and limited government.''
According to its 1989 annual report, a document filled with references to stalwart conservatives active in the group like William Bradford Reynolds, Robert H. Bork, and Bruce Fein, the center runs a ''Federal judge identification program'' (which seeks ''to identify those who believe that the appropriate role of the judiciary is to interpret the law, not make it''); organizes seminars for corporate counsels, and publishes what it calls ''white papers'' and ''monographs.''
Recent feuilletons include studies on the ''hidden costs'' of affirmative action and on the ''impossibilities'' of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989; upcoming is a study by Ronald Reagan on why the 22d Amendment, which limits Presidential terms to two, is ''detrimental'' to the commonweal. The center also supplies the usual conservative suspects for programs like the ''MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour,'' including Terry H. Eastland, the center's resident scholar, and Gary L. McDowell, formerly its vice president.
Then there is the Gauer lecture, inaugurated by Justice Kennedy with a heartfelt exegesis on the framers of the Constitution in which he sounded suspiciously like a civil libertarian. Mr. Gauer, a California businessman and former finance chairman for Mr. Reagan when he was the California Governor, is now retired. But according to his wife, Marian, ''one of the very important parts of Ed's day, every day, is being an American.''
One reason he established the program, said Mr. Gauer, who is 88 years old, is to bring some clarity to the law. Lawyers, he complained, have really taken over the country. He noted in particular the Federal anti-racketeering laws, which, he said, could be applied just as appropriately to Democrats ganging up on Mr. Reagan, President Bush, or Oliver L. North as to some of the alleged malefactors being prosecuted under those statutes.
Perhaps the term ''public interest lawyer'' is what the economists describe as ''infinitely elastic.'' Or perhaps the phrase has reached that stage of terminal exhaustion and utter meaninglessness described by Orwell in ''Politics and the English Language.''
If, after all, ''the American Way'' can be usurped by liberals, perhaps ''public interest'' is fair game for conservatives. It was enough to make one dinner guest, Dean Monroe Price of the Cardozo Law School, wax nostalgic.
''One longs for the days,'' he said, ''when code words were code words.''

HEADLINE: LAW;
Suit Over Death Benefits Asks, What Is a Family?

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
In what is apparently the first Federal lawsuit of its kind, the surviving lesbian partner of a deceased A.T.&T. employee has charged the company with discrimination for refusing to pay her the same death benefits it would have paid to a husband.
Sandra Rovira, who filed the suit, says her life with Marjorie Forlini, an A.T.&T. manager who died of cancer two years ago, was as much a marriage as any heterosexual union. The women had even formalized their relationship in a 1977 ceremony for relatives and friends, and they exchanged rings and vows.
''Margie and I bought a house together and raised my kids together, and when she was sick, I washed her, I went to the doctors with her, I prayed with her,'' said Ms. Rovira, 42 years old, of New Rochelle, N.Y., who was married before she met Ms. Forlini. ''She died in my arms. But when I called A.T.&T., they treated me as if I was nothing and our whole relationship was nothing. It was so humiliating. We were a family like any other family, and we deserved to be treated like one.'' 
 
'Someone Who's Hurting'
A.T.&T. says its benefits are for legal spouses only, and since the law does not recognize homosexual unions, it does not either. ''We recognize that this is someone who's hurting, but this was not a legally protected marriage,'' said Maureen Lynch, an A.T.&T. spokeswoman.
With more homosexual couples living openly in long-term relationships, the question of what constitutes a family is becoming a pressing one -for the courts and for employers, whose benefits policies are coming under attack.
Over the last five years, many cities have recognized ''domestic partnerships'' for some limited purposes. And many other efforts to have the benefits of marriage extended to domestic partners are under way, in legislatures and in the courts.
The changing status of domestic partnerships also affects unmarried heterosexual couples, who face similar problems in obtaining health insurance and death benefits. But unmarried heterosexual couples have the option of getting married.
''I think there will be broader recognition of domestic partnerships in the next five years, at least in large cities,'' said Nan Hunter, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and former director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project. ''The law is not very well developed yet, but I expect that there will be more cases in a variety of contexts, asserting that where a nontraditional couple's relationship functions as a marriage, it should be treated as a marriage.''
 
Issues to Be Settled
But even for those sympathetic to the concept, nettlesome questions remain. For while marriage is a clearly defined status, there is no consensus about what constitutes a domestic partnership. Do the partners have to live together? And, if so, for how long? Must they contract to be responsible for eachother's support? Or is a simple affirmation of a committed relationship enough? And should there be a formal process for dissolving the partnership?
The question of what constitutes a family comes up in many areas, including housing rights and sick leave plans:
* In 1989, New York's highest court ruled that a gay couple was legally considered a family under New York City's rent control laws. At the same time, the city board of education is being sued by gay teachers seeking health insurance for their domestic partners.
* Municipal employees in several cities, including Los Angeles, Madison, Wis., and Berkeley, Calif., are entitled to sick leave to care for a domestic partner, or bereavement leave to attend the partner's funeral. A law with similar provisions was adopted, then overturned by a referendum, in San Francisco, and will soon be back on the ballot. And in Seattle, a law was passed giving benefits to city employees' partners, but it now faces an active repeal initiative.
* A few unions and municipalities, and a handful of private employers, including the American Psychological Association, The Village Voice and Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., the Vermont-based ice cream company, offer health insurance to the domestic partners of their employees or members. But the Internal Revenue Service recently ruled that the cost of insurance premiums is taxable income for the domestic partner.
* Several places, including West Hollywood, Calif., Ithaca, N.Y., and Madison, allow all residents, not just municipal employees, to register domestic partnerships with the municipal clerks. Because private employers are not compelled by law to offer benefits to domestic partners, registering might not result in any tangible benefits, but it might help to establish the right to family membership rates at the local Y, or to visiting privileges when one partner is hospitalized.
Many experts on family law and domestic partnerships see such registrations as a necessary first step toward the widespread recognition of domestic partnerships. And, they say, homosexual partners are not the only ones who stand to gain.
''People may think of this as primarily a gay issue, but in the places where domestic partnerships are being recognized, the majority of those who take advantage of it are unmarried heterosexual couples,'' said Arthur Leonard, a New York Law School professor who writes a newsletter on gay issues.
Many municipalities that have been offering benefits to domestic partners agree, saying that about half the participants are unmarried heterosexuals.
Despite the new policies of a few employers and municipalities, advocates for gay people say changing something as fundamental as society's concept of a family is not quick work.
''It's a real uphill battle,'' said Paula Ettelbrick, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a New York-based gay rights advocacy group, and the lawyer who is representing Ms. Rovira against A.T.&T. ''We're talking about overhauling a whole system that was based on the 1930's family consisting of a male wage-earner, a nonworking wife and some kids.''
 
Lag in Benefits Programs
Ms. Ettelbrick said the A.T.&T. case, filed last month in Federal District Court in Manhattan, is a perfect example of how changes in social realities have outpaced employer benefits.
''They have a corporate policy that, like a lot of corporate policies, says they don't discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or marital status,'' said Ms. Ettelbrick. ''But gay and lesbian employees can't get married, so because of their sexual orientation, they're denied the benefits that spouses get, even though, where there's a death, they have the same needs as any other family that's lost a wage-earner.''
Experts say private employers have been reluctant to expand benefit packages to include domestic partners. ''It's a trend in the public sector much more than in the private sector,'' said Stephanie Poe, a spokeswoman for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit research group based in Washington. ''In this economic climate most employers are not expanding their benefits and would bring in domestic partners only with extensive cost controls, such as imposing waiting periods.'' She added that they might exclude pre-existing medical conditions, and might refuse to cover those at high risk of serious illness, like those infected with the AIDS virus.
''We talk to employers and unions and insurance companies and the question that always comes up is, where do you draw the line,'' said Thomas F. Coleman, who heads the Los Angeles-based Family Diversity Project, a nonprofit research and education group. ''Having a registration system is very helpful in providing some evidence that the people are not just making it up at the last minute when they want something, but that they have considered themselves a family, and held themselves out as a family all along.''
Ms. Forlini and Ms. Rovira clearly considered themselves a family, intermingling their lives and finances for the 12 years before Ms. Forlini's death. Frank and Alfred, Ms. Rovira's two sons, lived with them from the time they were 11 and 8, and Ms. Forlini claimed one or both of them as dependents on her tax returns for many years.
Ms. Rovira took care of Ms. Forlini while she was ill. And when Ms. Forlini died, in 1988, Ms. Rovira and Frank were the ones with her.
The A.T.&T. benefits plan for managers provides for a year's pay to the spouse and unmarried dependent children under 23 of an employee who dies of an illness. In addition, the plan says A.T.&T. may, at its discretion, pay some benefit to other relatives who have been dependent on the employee.
Ms. Forlini's lawsuit seeks damages ''in excess of $75,000.'' The suit says the company breached its own policy of not discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or marital status and in so doing violated the Federal pension laws.
 
'Not for People Like Me'
''I was Margie's executor, and when I was going through her personal things, I saw the pension and benefits book,'' said Ms. Rovira, who works as a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society. ''At first I just put it away, but then I thought I certainly felt like a spouse, so I would call A.T.&T. and ask. Their reaction was that I was being ridiculous, that this was not for people like me. Then as I thought more, I said that even if I didn't qualify, my children probably would.''
Ms. Rovira said A.T.&T. told her over the phone that there was no application for benefits and that she would not qualify. Ms. Rovira said she then sent the company a formal request for death benefits, along with extensive documentation of her relationship with Ms. Forlini. She said A.T.&T. did not acknowledge receiving her request until weeks later, when she called to inquire about its status and was told that her claim had been rejected.
A spokeswoman for A.T.&T. said the denial of benefits does not violate the company policy of not discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or marital status.
''If we have a benefit for spouses and you don't have a spouse, that doesn't mean we've discriminated on the basis of marital status,'' said Maureen Lynch, of A.T.&T. ''If you're single, you're not being discriminated against, you just don't have anybody who's eligible for that benefit. And from a philanthropic standpoint, A.T.&T. has done a lot for the gay community, and is widely considered a very good place for gay people to work.''

(Alan Zale for The New York Times); ''People may think of this as primarily a gay issue, but in the places where domestic partnerships are being recognized, the majority of those who take advantage of it are unmarried heterosexual couples,'' said Arthur Leonard, a New York Law School professor who writes a newsletter on gay issues.

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
A VISIT to New York City can often seem surreal. But those who yearn for the surreal - for real - would do well to spend a night or two at the new Paramount Hotel at 235 West 46th Street.
Feel free to wear black. The turtlenecked maintenance workers wear black. The doormen wear black. Even the match sticks and the postcards are black.
The recently reopened 610-room hotel is the much-touted brainchild of the hotelier Ian Schrager of Studio 54 fame. It is his group's third hotel - along with Morgans and the Royalton - expressly designed to be hipper than thou. The hotel, formerly the Century Paramount, has been revamped by the French designer Philippe Starck. Mr. Starck, who once referred to himself as the ''Baader-Meinhof of design,'' designed the fashionable interiors of the Royalton, where the doormen also wear black. The Paramount, where double rooms run $110 to $170 a night, has been marketed as a budget version of that hotel, and, as at the Royalton, a major amenity is style. 
There is no sign outside. (If you have to ask - well, you know.) But the hotel is instantly recognizable from the street by the stylish doormen with landscaped hairdos and the roses sticking out of marble slots in the entrance foyer.
When we checked in on a recent weekend, the hotel had been officially open for only a few weeks. We couldn't resist the temptation to try it, even though a letter to guests written by the general manager offered this caveat: ''We appreciate your understanding that the hotel does not yet offer all the service and amenities that will be part of this exciting new idea.''
On a Friday evening, the lobby was abuzz with young European and Japanese tourists, who seemed to make up the majority of the Paramount's clientele. They frequently kissed one another on both cheeks, smoked reams of non-filter cigarettes and had the kind of natural chic that makes a ripped T-shirt with cigarette burns look glamorous.
Throughout the weekend, brigades of dreamy young tourists from abroad, who might have walked straight out of the film ''Mystery Train,'' decorated the rather austere lobby, reading their maps and green Michelin guides while parking their sunglasses on the tables.
We waited about 20 minutes to check in. In an elevator with Popsicle-orange lighting, a young man named Chris whisked us to our room, which didn't turn out to be the kind of room we had requested. It was extremely dark and had two tiny beds rather than a double. (In addition, a Chinese restaurant had surreptitiously papered the entry with a cascade of flyers.) Chris was extremely apologetic. In fact, without exception, the employees at the hotel were dedicated and friendly, despite their brutually fashionable uniforms. We went back downstairs and were told that the key to room 1636 - our new room - was ''being worked on'' and would be ready tomorrow. Master key in hand, Chris took us up to the 16th floor. We passed something called a ''weather mirror,'' a slanted glass panel with lighted lettering, designed to tell guests the latest forecast. ''Where did they get that idea?'' we wondered. ''Our owner is a weatherologist,'' Chris explained.
 
A Clever Economy
He then opened the door to Room 1636, a cleverly disguised small, bare-bones hotel room. ''I guess you know who this gal is,'' Chris said, referring to the highbrow headboard, a blow-up of Vermeer's ''Seamstress.'' He told us about the room's other amenities - a VCR and television cabinet that contained a switch for ''mood lighting.'' The mood lighting, turned on by flicking a green ball, projected white squiggles like paramecia on the ceiling. He showed us Philippe Starck's bathroom, a compact tubless wonder with a shower, with barely enough room to hang wet towels. ''And here's your cone-shaped sink,'' he said.
As in a ship's cabin, which it somewhat resembled, the room was notable for a clever economy of space. There was one wastebasket (ah, minimalism). As in a weird D. M. Thomas reverie, the room was white. Quite white. A Starck-designed light hanging over a small desk, which faced the bed, looked like a surrealistic stethoscope.
The bed - a comfortable one, as it turned out - was placed low to the floor and was covered with brass-buttoned white throw pillows and a crisp white bedspread. White may be great as a fashion statement, but unfortunately, putting white in a hotel room is a little bit like putting white on an elephant. The bedspread highlighted the spills, and even some stray hairs, left by previous occupants.
There was no refrigerator - which is probably to be expected for only $120 a night in New York. We were told that room service would be available in a couple of weeks. But there was a decent view of the theater district, especially the red ''Gypsy'' sign at the St. James Theater. We asked Chris if he had any restaurant suggestions. He had heard Orso was nice. ''It's the place I'd take my parents,'' he said, eyeing us. Between this comment and trying to share a cone sink, we suddenly felt ancient.
 
Who Needs an Alarm?
We slept blissfully - too blissfully. We never received our 8:45 wake-up call. Bleary-eyed, we ambled past the weather mirror - it said ''RAIN, WARM'' - and took the elevator, a green one this time, to the mezzanine. When we saw a man trying to read his newspaper in the balcony area clutching his table lamp like a flashlight, we opted for the brighter breakfast room. It offered a delightful buffet of fresh berries, yogurt, muffins, croissants and good coffee.
We felt fortified. Who really needed a wake-up call when Rolling Stones music was playing in the lobby?
The lobby of the more upscale Royalton, which will probably be preserved one day as an example of fin-de-siecle thinking, has an edgy, menacing, somewhat sinister quality. Furniture is shrouded in slipcovers; chairs look like intrauterine devices.
The lobby of the Paramount is friendlier - although, as at the Royalton, a visitor would be hard-pressed to enter this lobby and say, ''Now, this is New York.'' The public sitting area, plunked on checkered carpeting in the middle of the room, offers little intimacy. Though rather foreboding, a stark set of steps in the rear offers a dramatic backdrop. But despite its severe, concrete-like interiors, the lobby has something spunky about it.
Postcards, for instance, are sold from playful ''trees'' (but black-and-white postcards only). A shop sells black and white objects -watches, sewing kits, and white combs with black checks on them. It also sells newspapers and magazines from around the globe, including L'Express, Time Out, The Face and, most appropriately, Zoom, the International Image Magazine.
 
Air of Mystery
We decided to check out the ladies' room. Like many other aspects of the Paramount, the design was imbued with mystery. A silver free-form toilet-paper dispenser, which looked as if it was designed by Yves Tanguy, held not only paper, but also a single fresh rose. A cryptic mirror by the sink said ''warm air'' but offered no clue as to where it was supposed to come from. Wary of sticking our hands into strange mechanical devices, we nevertheless reached into a crevice behind the mirror, and (behold!) warm air gushed forth.
Special features of the Paramount, which were uncompleted at the time of our stay, are supposed to be finished by the end of the year. They include a 24-hour Brian McNally brasserie and a Dean & DeLuca gourmet shop (both with room service) and a nightclub downstairs where the Billy Rose Diamond Horseshoe Supper Club used to be. A 24-hour staffed day-care center and a fitness club are now open. Videotapes, rented for $6 each, include a ''New York collection'' with selections like ''Ghostbusters'' and ''Annie Hall.''
The lunch menu in the mezzanine dining room included New York kosher hot dogs on Pennsylvania Dutch potato roll ($6) and warm New York soft pretzels with mustard ($4). The latter featured a single pretzel, pelted with salt, situated majestically on a plate accompanied by a container of mustard.
 
Into the Real World
Soon, we ventured out into the sultry streets of Times Square, streets redolent of incense and shish kebab. Like the young tourists in the lobby, we were determined to conquer New York. At the corner of 46th Street and Broadway, a man was selling ''disembodied'' rubber hands that wriggled realistically in lettuce bowls, not far from a stand selling T-shirts that said ''Die Yuppie Scum.'' Who needed ''Wild at Heart''?
Back at the Paramount, the Big Macs being consumed by some Italian tourists glowed poison-green in the elevator's eerie light. The weather mirror said ''SNOW.'' Something told us this wasn't the Travelodge on the turnpike, after all.

HEADLINE: New Visions of Familiar Movie Genres

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
They are movie genres so hallowed and, alas, so overfamiliar, that they glow with the phosphorescence of cliche. They include the film-noir love triangle, the gangster movie, the historical drama, the Nazi occupation thriller and the artist's biography. Is it still possible to jump-start these tired vehicles in the age of the sequel, when previously owned movies seem to be the mother of invention? The answer is an unqualified yes, judging by the offerings at the New York Film Festival in its 28th series, which opens tonight at Lincoln Center.
Nearly half of the festival's 29 featured films from 14 countries are fresh variants on traditional themes. ''Genre-juicing - that's what we're seeing,'' said Wendy Keys, executive producer for programming at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which presents the festival. ''So many of the offerings are genre films, with a twist - a play on the expected.''
''It's remarkable how many of these offerings have a film-historical bent,'' said Richard Pena, the society's program director. ''They assume a burden of experience on the part of the audience, and they use it. But they don't refer to specific predecessors, and they don't burlesque them. Instead, they reinvent familiar film styles and take them in new directions.'' 
 
Gangsters With Ethics
This evening, for example, the festival opens with Joel and Ethan Coen's ''Miller's Crossing,'' a 1929 gangster story starring Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney as crime kingpins who wage war against rival wise guys while competing for the same woman. The festival will conclude on Oct. 7 with Michael Verhoeven's merciless dark comedy ''The Nasty Girl,'' a film about an innocent Bavarian lass who sets out to write an essay called ''My Town During the Third Reich.'' Her investigation creates a sensation, just as the film did at this year's Berlin Film Festival, where Mr. Verhoeven won the award for best director. The movie takes a familiar subject - the legacy of Germany's Nazi past - and treats it in a way that is savagely original.
''Miller's Crossing,'' like some of its gangster predecessors, inhabits a distorted, ominous cityscape in an unnamed metropolis, but it delves more deeply into its characters' complex hierarchies and rivalries as they battle in a universe of subtly rearranged spaces. And ''instead of being a straightforward formula shoot-'em-up, it uses the convention of the gangster drama to examine some really interesting issues,'' said Mr. Byrne, who stars in the film as Tom Reagan, the enigmatic henchman of the Irish-American mob star played by Mr. Finney.
Those issues include ''power and the misuse of power,'' Mr. Byrne said in a recent interview. ''Street power, institutional power, personal power - and the kind of issues, like loyalty, betrayal and trust, that are not found in the conventional gangster movie. I mean, how many shoot-'em-ups begin with a gangster talking about ethics in the opening scene?''
The Coens have stated that they started with a familiar genre they wanted to explore - the gangster film - and that their inspiration was the crime fiction of Dashiell Hammett. ''But the film itself, though a homage to the gangster movies of previous years, deals with relationships in a very complex way,'' Mr. Byrne said. ''It's not simply a pastiche of previous films.''
The festival's other gangland melodrama - Abel Ferrara's ''King of New York,'' to be shown tomorrow and Sunday - is as different from earlier crime-genre films as it is from ''Miller's Crossing.'' It stars Christopher Walken as a drug czar who, after years spent in jail studying philosophy, returns to the streets to reclaim his illicit empire, vowing to divert his wealth to the needy.
''Gangsters are traditionally presented as hot, sexy characters, and what's so fascinating about 'The King of New York' is its coolness,'' Mr. Pena said.
 
Adultery in China
At first, ''Ju Dou,'' also to be shown tomorrow and Sunday, appears to be a love triangle in the classic film-noir tradition, a sort of ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'' set in China in the 1920's. But then the director Zhang Yimou (''Red Sorghum'') and the co-director, Yang Fengliang, abandon cliche as they consider the lifelong consequences of a passionate adulterous relationship between Ju Dou - a beautiful young woman married to an old, abusive, wealthy man - and Tian-qing, her ardent young lover.
''Ju Dou'' has the distinction of being the first Chinese film co-produced by Japan, for the equivalent of $2 million when it was shot in 1989. Given the film's subject of youthful rebellion against tyrannical patriarchy, some have viewed the movie as a metaphor for China itself, in the grip of its gerontarchs.
Both ''Ju Dou'' and ''Miller's Crossing'' introduce an important subtheme of the films at the festival: betrayal, revenge and adultery. ''It's so curious that betrayal and adultery are part of many of these films,'' Ms. Keys said. ''After an era when we've been very cynical, very calculating, very me-generation about infidelity, it's as if film makers are saying that we've reached the time to examine our responsibility for the pain we give others.''
 
Reinventing the Past
Betrayal and adultery are central to ''The Sting of Death,'' the winner of the International Critics' Prize at this year's Cannes International Film Festival. The Japanese director Kohei Oguri (''Muddy Water'') has constructed a tale that weaves the shifting social and historical context of postwar Japan into the story of an adulterous writer's attempt to make amends for his betrayal of his deranged wife. The film will be shown next Friday and on Sept. 30. Betrayal is also the text for the director Jacques Doillon's film ''A Woman's Revenge,'' to be shown Sept. 30 and Oct. 1. In this loose adaptation of Dostoyevsky's ''Eternal Husband.'' Isabelle Huppert and Beatrice Dalle star in the psychological drama about the widow and ex-mistress of a man they once shared.
Another cliche genre, the historical epic, is re-animated by Manoel de Oliveira's ''No, or the Vain Glory of Command,'' to be shown Wednesday and Sept. 29. The 83-year-old director's subject is nothing less than the social, cultural and mythological history of his native Portugal. The film uses flashbacks and surrealistic techniques in an attempt to present the legends, myths and literature of a people.
Among the festival's ground-breaking documentaries is Barbara Kopple's ''American Dream,'' to be shown Oct. 6, which reexamines the traditional labor-managment chronicle. Her new film began as an investigation of a strike against a Hormel meat-packing plant in Austin, Minn., similar to her monumental 1977 work, ''Harlan County, U.S.A.'' But the bitter worker-employer conflict quickly gives way to fierce dissension within the union itself, and this film asks fundamental questions about the survival of union traditions in 1990's America.
 
Masters and Debuts
Two French masters are returning to the festival, which will also be the showcase for the work of a rising star from Finland and two Soviet newcomers. The return of Jean-Luc Godard ''is a very exciting thing for the festival,'' Ms. Keys said, ''since it also marks a return to the work of his heyday.'' ''Nouvelle Vague,'' starring Alain Delon and Domiziana Giordano, is Mr. Godard's self-mocking analysis of political and sexual issues, as well as his celebration of the beauty, and mystery, of images. It will be shown Sept. 29 and Oct. 2.
Eric Rohmer is also back with ''A Tale of Springtime,'' the story of Jeanne, a lonely young philosophy teacher who finds herself at loose ends on the first day of spring. She encounters a new friend, Natacha, who is soon attempting to introduce Jeanne to her father. This unfolding intrigue is part of a new cycle of proposed films for Mr. Rohmer, which he calls ''Tales of the Four Seasons.'' It will be shown Tuesday and Thursday.
The recent work of the director Aki Kaurismaki will be commemorated with two films at the festival, an honor previously accorded to directors like as Godard, Rohmer, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Rainer Maria Fassbinder. The 33-year-old Finnish director ''has evolved a very sophisticated, sure style in a remarkably short time,'' Mr. Pena said. ''One encounters artists now and then whose work is very hot, and who are working at the peak of their form. A showing of only one of their films doesn't quite seem enough.''
''The Match Factory Girl,'' to be shown on Oct. 3, is Mr. Kaurismaki's spare, grimly comic tale of Iris, who performs mind-numbing work in a match factory and lives at home with her parasitic mother and abusive stepfather. ''I Hired a Contract Killer,'' Mr. Kaurismaki's first film in English, will be shown on Oct. 4. In his minimalist style, the director tells the tale of a Frenchman, played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, who is dismissed from the firm he has loyally served for 15 years. Despondent, realizing that he hasn't the courage to kill himself, he hires a contract killer to do the job for him. But when love unexpectedly enters his life, he desperately tries to cancel the contract, with dark yet hilarious results.
A provocative debut by another director, Vitaly Kanevski, is ''Freeze-Die-Come to Life,'' to be shown tomorrow and Sunday. The film, awarded the Camera d'Or as best first film at Cannes this year, is Mr. Kanevski's autobiographical story of two children who learn to survive in an isolated mining community that has one of Stalin's work camps. Mr. Kanevski, who was imprisoned in such a town for eight years as a political prisoner, portrays life in the gulag as nasty, brutish and short. The film has been viewed as a powerful indictment of Stalin's excesses, but it is also a celebration of children's ability to survive and flourish amid the privation, brutality and madness of an era that was without any moral center.
''Taxi Blues,'' the other Soviet entry at the festival, won its first-time director, Pavel Lungin, honors as best director at Cannes. It will be shown Oct. 1 and 2. It is the tale of Schlikov, a bigoted nationalist of a taxi driver, who is stiffed one night by Liocha, a drunken, gifted Jewish saxophonist who leaves the cab without paying his 70-ruble fare. Schlikov's subsequent search for the delinquent musician leads to a contemporary Soviet debate about class envy, anti-Semitism and economic frustration; it also leads to a spiky friendship. The film's examination of the violent and corrupt netherworld of Moscow may be the most harrowing of the portraits thus far to be visible through glasnost, darkly.
 
Of Art and Family
Last year's critically acclaimed newcomer, Jane Campion (''Sweetie''), is back again this year with ''An Angel at My Table.'' The film, to be shown Oct. 4 and 6, is based on the autobiographies of Janet Frame, New Zealand's most celebrated novelist. The film is at once a tribute to a quirky, idiosyncratic personality and an analysis of literary genius. It is also a retooling of that classic movie type, the artist's biography, as it portrays a complex artist in an even more complex contemporary world.
Charles Burnett, a director who is a recent recipient of one of the MacArthur Foundation's ''genius awards,'' is represented at the festival on Oct. 5 and 6 with ''To Sleep With Anger.'' The drama, starring Danny Glover, is the story of a black family from the Deep South that has relocated to Los Angeles, where it is conquered by Harry, an old pal from back home. In his devilish interference, Harry, played by Mr. Glover, demonstrates the persistence of the family's past and the tension between old rural ways and the family's new urban lifestyle.
 
The Nazi Era
''The Nasty Girl'' also reveals the pull between past and present, in its satirical depiction of a German town that has found it comfortable to repress its more uncomfortable memories. ''When Verhoeven was working on this, he didn't know that unification was around the corner,'' Ms. Keys said. ''Given its explosiveness and its reference to such contemporary events, we thought it would work very well for closing night.''
Another evocation of the Nazi era, Christian de Chalonge's ''Dr. Petiot,'' will be shown Sunday and Monday. It is based on real events that occurred during the occupation of France. The doctor, a distinguished Parisian practitioner loved by his family, is asked by his Jewish patients and acquaintances to risk his life by arranging their escape from the Nazi usurpers. If this film sounds suspiciously like a classic occupation thriller, the director turns it inside out into a macabre tale of betrayal and infamy.
 
Vigo Restored
''L'Atalante,'' this year's retrospective offering, is the only feature film of the legendary Jean Vigo, who died of septicemia in 1934 at the age of 29. The film, about quarreling newlyweds who are brought together by a charming bargeman played by Michel Simon, was chopped up, retitled and re-edited by its original distributors. Only now has it been restored to Vigo's original plan by the French company Gaumont. It will be shown tomorrow.
''Vigo was that very rare creature who worked completely on his own, outside the French film establishment,'' Mr. Pena said. ''He was a hero of the French New Wave, and his work was a forerunner for much of the independent cinema we see around the world today.''

HEADLINE: Market Place;
An Unusual Deal for Child World

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Child World Inc., the troubled No. 2 American toy retailer, is scheduled to be sold in a highly unusual transaction in which little cash is put down and the principal holder gets a worse deal than public investors. But stock traders appear to doubt the deal will be completed.
The agreed buyer is an investment partnership planned by Roy Disney's Shamrock Holdings, which signed a definitive agreement late last month calling for it to pay $14 a share, or a total of $28 million, for the 18 percent of Child World's shares that are in public hands. The rest of the stock, held by Child World's corporate parent, the CNC Holding Corporation, is to be bought for securities with a face value of $147.5 million. 
When the plans for the deal were first announced in July, the price of the shares rallied to close to the agreement price of $14. But they have since sagged, selling for as little as $9.625 last Friday. Yesterday, they fell 25 cents, to $10.25.
''The stock is saying it is not going to happen,'' said one retail stock analyst of the transaction. He asked that his name not be used. If the deal falls through, the shares would be expected to fall further.
The agreement calls for Trefoil Capital Investors L.P., an affilate of Shamrock, to make the purchase. A spokesman for Trefoil said the company was ''proceeding with the acquisition,'' but he noted that there were a variety of terms and conditions that needed to be satisfied before it could be completed. He said Trefoil would not comment on the market activity.
Under the takeover agreement, Trefoil need not proceed if it is unable to arrange $230 million in working capital loans for the toy retailer, which says some of its problems this year have stemmed from low inventories. And the deal is contingent on the ''absence of any material adverse change in Child World's business'' after May 5.
Just how adverse that would have to be was not detailed. But Child World's financial results seem to have deteriorated, providing Trefoil with a possible out if it wants one. For the second fiscal quarter ended Aug. 4, the company reported a loss of $8.5 million, or 75 cents a share, compared with a loss of $5.1 million, or 45 cents a share, in the comparable period of 1989.
The company attributed the losses to ''competitive pricing, higher promotional markdowns, freight costs and increased advertising.''
For toy retailers, losses in three quarters, and heavy profits in the Christmas period, are to be expected. But Child World, which operates 176 stores in 31 states has found competing with Toys ''R'' Us, the industry giant, very difficult. Results have declined in recent years, with comparable store sales falling 4 percent last year, mostly in the Christmas season.
For the fiscal year ended Feb. 4, Child World reported a profit of $5.8 million, or 51 cents a share, less than half the profits of the previous year. With losses in the first half of the current fiscal year totaling $16 million, or $1.40 a share, compared with $10.3 million, or 90 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year, the company will do no better than break even this year if it matches last year's results for the rest of the fiscal year. With the economy appearing near recession, even that could be a difficult acheivement.
CNC Holding was formed when the Cole National Corporation was taken private in a 1987 leveraged buyout. Officials of CNC and Child World did not return phone calls seeking comment.
CNC, whose other operations include smaller retailers, has been having trouble of its own, with operating losses steadily climbing. It needs cash, especially because one series of ''junk bonds'' it issued as part of its buyout have just switched from accruing interest in more bonds to accruing it in cash. Without the Child World deal, the company's cash needs would be raised by $23 million a year, with the first payment due in March 1991.
If the deal goes through, CNC will hold on to the $147.5 million in bonds from Trefoil for only a few minutes before transferring them to the First Executive Corporation, a Los Angeles insurance holding company. In return, First Executive will cancel most of that CNC junk bond issue, which it holds.
First Executive will take a bit of a haircut, because the new bonds pay interest at a rate of just 10.07 percent, only part of it in cash, compared with 13 percent on the CNC bonds it is trading in. CNC will make up part of the difference in cash for a few months.
For Trefoil, the Child World acquisition offers an opportunity to buy a company with $830 million in sales for a relatively small down payment of $28 million. If it can turn the company around, profits could be substantial. The question is whether, with Child World profits now deteriorating, Trefoil will still be willing to take the chance.

HEADLINE: Caracas Asks U.S. to Help On Oil Output

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Sept. 20

 BODY:
The President of Venezuela, citing an ''inevitability of confrontation'' in the Middle East, is urging the United States to invest in increased oil production in this South American nation, which holds the largest proven oil reserves outside the Middle East.
''Venezuela is the safe, sufficient and reliable bridge towards energy self-sufficiency for the Americas,'' Carlos Andres Perez said in an interview on Monday at the presidential palace here. ''With the Orinoco Belt, Venezuela has the second-largest oil reserves in the world, after Saudi Arabia.''
Venezuela's light-to-heavy reserves - those that are easily refined - are 59 billion barrels. But the Orinoco Belt, a 20,000-square-mile area north of the Orinoco River in eastern Venezuela, contains 270 billion barrels of extra-heavy bitumen oil, which is less economical to refine but is now being tapped with an experimental technology. A Leading Source for U.S. Venezuela has alternated with Saudi Arabia as a leading source of foreign oil for the United States, which buys two-thirds of Venezuela's production. To help the world market cope with the current oil crisis, Mr. Perez has ordered a 25 percent increase in production, to 2.5 million barrels a day, by December. 
But he said that with American private and public investment, he could almost double Venezuela's production capacity to five million barrels a day by the year 2000.
''Unfortunately, if the crisis in the Middle East explodes in a conflagration that damages the oil wells of the region, the energy crisis will convert into an energy catastrophe,'' Mr. Perez said. ''We can produce more, but we don't have the wells to pump out the oil.''
In contrast to Venezuela's ambitious expansion plans, Mexico, the other large exporter to the Americas, is experiencing a decline in output and is expected to become a net importer within 15 years.
''The hemisphere should see the oil problem with a strategic vision,'' said Mr. Perez, who plans to pursue his proposal on a visit to New York in 10 days.
Earlier this month, Venezuela's Minister of Energy and Mines, Celestino Armas, visited Washington and proposed to American officials and business executives the creation of ''a hemispheric strategic oil production capacity.''
 
U.S. Concerns Bought Out
In a change of policy, Mr. Armas encouraged American oil companies to invest in refining and production in his country, which has the lowest production costs of any nation in the Western Hemisphere. American oil companies operating in Venezuela were bought out in 1975 under a nationalization program.
With a tight budget in Washington, American officials have said they favor increasing Venezuelan production through private investment.
Talks to discuss the proposed plan have been hampered because of bureaucratic reasons in Washington. The United States has not had an ambassador accredited here since July 1989. Confirmation hearings for the new Ambassador-designate, Michael M. Skol, are to be held next week.
At the palace, Mr. Perez played down reports here that with oil prices almost tripling in three months, Venezuela had hit a jackpot. He estimated that his country would earn an extra $800 million this fall - money that would go to servicing foreign debt and for increasing oil production. The country's total foreign debt is around $34 billion.
 
No Discouts to Cuba
In recent days, Government officials have battled reports that international development banks are using high oil prices to justify reducing low-interest loans to Venezuela.
The President also ruled out selling oil at a discount to Cuba. Evidently lured by rising world oil prices, the Soviet Union said last month that it would cut by 20 percent its shipments of inexpensive oil to Cuba. In response, the Cuban Government announced last week the purchase of hundreds of thousands of bicycles to help Cubans get around without cars and buses.
''Even though Cuba is from our region, it does not share our system,'' said Mr. Perez, who heads one of Latin America's longest-running democracies.
Returning to his vision of oil-rich Venezuela guaranteeing the hemisphere's self-sufficiency in energy, Mr. Perez said his proposal was congruent with President Bush's plan for a hemispheric free-trade zone.
''With the creation of the European Common Market, of the Asian market around Japan, the United States needs an alliance with Latin America,'' Mr. Perez said. ''This is a market of 500 million people, with tremendous natural resources.''

HEADLINE: Bribe Charges Backed As Northrop Era Ends

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 20

 BODY:
Thomas V. Jones survived a foreign bribery scandal at the Northrop Corporation in the 1970's and went on to build the company into one of the nation's largest military contractors. Now he is retiring as chairman amid allegations that he may have presided over the payment of bribes by Northrop in the 1980's in an effort to sell a fighter jet in South Korea.
The company and Mr. Jones have denied all suggestions of wrongdoing. But on Wednesday, the day Northrop announced Mr. Jones's retirement at the age of 70, reports appeared that an international arbitration service had concluded that the company paid a Korean business executive $6.25 million to help influence the sale of the F-20 fighter plane. 
 
Arbitration at Company Behest
The arbitration was conducted by the International Chamber of Commerce at Northrop's behest and with the company's cooperation. Northrop has been seeking the return of the $6.25 million, which the company contends was intended to finance the construction of a hotel in Seoul as part of a proposal to reinvest in South Korea some profits from any F-20 sales.
The arbitration report concluded that the $6.25 million payment by Northrop in 1984 to C. K. Park, an executive with close ties to top Korean Government officials, was intended ''for the purpose of promoting the F-20 fighter plane, and not to finance a hotel project.'' The report went on to say that ''Northrop's highest management,'' including three vice presidents directly involved in the F-20 sales effort ''and probably Mr. Jones,'' knew of and approved the agreement with Mr. Park.
''This is not a situation where low-ranking officers colluded to defraud Northrop, but where Northrop acted, probably illegally, through its top management,'' said the report, written by Wolfgang Kuhn, a German lawyer who served as the arbitrator. The findings were first reported today by The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal.
Northrop's efforts to sell the F-20 in Korea have been under investigation for several years. There are two Federal grand juries looking into whether Northrop violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars payoffs to foreign officials. The matter is also being investigated by a House subcommittee headed by John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan.
 
Pledged in 1975 to Halt Payoffs
After allegations in the early 1970's that it had made improper payoffs to sell warplanes abroad, Northrop, with Mr. Jones as chairman, signed a consent decree with the Government in 1975, pledging not to make any further payoffs.
Mr. Jones also pleaded guilty in the early 1970's to a single felony count of making illegal contributions to Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign. In recent years, Mr. Jones and his successor as chief executive and now chairman, Kent Kresa, have endured a series of investigations into other charges of wrongdoing by the company on a variety of military contracts. Earlier this year, Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 counts of failing to test parts for fighter jets and missiles and agreed to pay a $17 million fine.
Yet, in Mr. Jones's career at Northrop, which spanned 37 years, he built the company into one of the nation's premier technology companies, winning contracts for sophisticated weapons like the B-2 Stealth bomber. Mr. Jones stepped down as chief executive at the end of last year and has not been active in managing the company since then. Tony Cantafio, a spokesman for Northrop, said the announcement of Mr. Jones's resignation as chairman had been planned and had nothing to do with the arbitration findings.
 
Northrop Disagrees With Report
Mr. Cantafio said Northrop disagreed with the conclusions of the arbitrator's report. ''It's important to point out that the ruling makes no conclusion or finding to support widespread reports and allegations the company's investment in the hotel was to be used to make payments to Korean Government officials,'' Mr. Cantafio said.
Mr. Park, who died several years ago, was not a Korean Government official, although he was known to be a close associate of former President Chun Doo Hwan, whose administration considered buying the F-20 in the mid-1980's.
Mr. Cantafio said Northrop was continuing to pursue civil litigation in South Korea to force the return of the $6.25 million.
Northrop hired Mr. Park in 1983 as part of an effort to persuade South Korea to buy the F-20, a newly designed fighter that Northrop was struggling to sell both in the United States and abroad. The next year, Northrop agreed to create a joint venture with Mr. Park to build a hotel and office complex in Seoul in keeping with the common practice of reinvesting some of the proceeds from any sale into the local economy. But the complex was never built, and Northrop never sold any F-20's to South Korea.
Northrop eventually canceled the F-20 after the United States Air Force decided not to buy the plane.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Recession Ahead? The Views Vary

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IS the United States entering a recession or isn't it? The sages, here and abroad, differ.
In his Congressional testimony this week, Alan Greenspan said the risks of recession had been increased by the confrontation in the Persian Gulf, but he still saw no downward tilt to the economy. And he said the Federal Reserve would not ease monetary policy until the Administration and Congress reached agreement on a long-term plan for cutting the Federal budget deficit.
The International Monetary Fund, on the eve of its and the World Bank's annual meetings, sounded more bullish this week than Mr. Greenspan. It said the United States would avoid a recession this year and growth would pick up in 1991. 
But, on the bearish side, 58 percent of the 50 economists and forecasting groups surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators predicted that a recession would start this year or in 1991. Robert J. Eggert, Blue Chip's editor, said that in the last two months its consensus forecast for growth in real gross national product in 1991 had declined to 1.2 percent, from 2.2 percent, one of the sharpest drops in the survey's 13-year history.
What explains the differences among these people who peer into the future? Not economic indicators or other facts and factoids available to all economists, but rather three other factors: semantics, assumptions and policy.
Mr. Greenspan's position that it was ''too soon to indicate'' whether the odds on recession are greater or less than 50-50 reflected both his semantics and policy. On the semantic side, he shied away from the ''conventional'' definition of a recession - two consecutive quarters of decline in real G.N.P. - suggesting that a more useful definition was that a recession is a decline so serious that it begins to feed on itself.
If the Blue Chip consensus forecast of 1.2 percent growth in 1991 is about right, and if the Fed essentially shares it, as it apparently does, that forecast could be consistent with a recession, defined as two quarters of negative growth. Such a recession could start, for instance, in the fourth quarter of this year, and last only through the first quarter of next year - or even through the first half of next year. But that would imply a recession that ''did not feed on itself,'' followed by a relatively good recovery in the second half of 1991. In Greenspanian semantics, that would be no real recession, so a recession is not yet in sight.
On the policy side, the chairman of the Fed has two concerns: one, to keep pressure on the Administration and Congress to deal with the budget deficit; two, not to relax monetary policy too soon, lest the markets regard this as an inflationary response to political pressures. That in turn might perversely raise interest rates and give the economy a double blow of higher inflation and lower growth. Cutting the budget deficit would reduce public claims on private savings, ease rates and set conditions in which the Fed could relax monetary policy without fear of pushing up inflation.
The major difference between the more cheerful forecast by the I.M.F. and the others lies in its assumption that the world oil price, now around $35 a barrel, will average $26 for the rest of this year and come down to $21 by the fourth quarter of 1991. This prognosis is based on the assumption that the four million barrels a day lost to the world oil market from Iraq and Kuwait will gradually be replaced by extra output from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other countries, as well as the further underlying assumption that there will be no war or greater loss of oil.
How good are these assumptions? They are certainly wishful. It is true that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has not changed its reference price of $21 a barrel that was in place before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and that an OPEC representative said last week in an interview in Antalya, Turkey, that OPEC still assumes the oil price for the coming year will stay in a range of $21 to $25 a barrel.
But that would represent a steep fall from present prices. Some analysts are making more cautious assumptions. Antonio Costa, special adviser to the president of the European Community, is assuming that oil prices will range from $23 to $27 a barrel during the next 18 months. That would mean, he said, a worldwide transfer of $160 billion to $170 billion in gross revenues from oil consumers to producers; net, after deducting the flowback of payments for higher imports, the increase would represent a shift of $95 billion to $110 billion from consumers to producers - a shock big enough to give the world a new monetary recycling problem. Mr. Costa's estimate assumes a stalemate, rather than a worsening conflict, in the gulf.
Even on relatively hopeful assumptions, however, the gulf crisis, as long as it lasts, will mean somewhat higher inflation, somewhat slower growth and higher unemployment for the United States and the world economy. Policy will counteract those effects but is unlikely to eliminate them.

HEADLINE: Oil Aid Plans By the I.M.F.

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
The head of the International Monetary Fund predicted today that his 152-nation organization would back United States-led efforts to provide financial assistance to countries hurt by the Persian Gulf turmoil.
The I.M.F. managing director, Michel Camdessus, said his agency was exploring a variety of ways to provide financial assistance, including a plan to obtain voluntary donations to recycle higher oil profits back to nations hurt by the rise in energy prices. 
Mr. Camdessus's comments provide backing for the Bush Administration's plan to enlist both the I.M.F. and its sister lending organization, the World Bank, to provide financial help for countries being harmed by the trade embargo against Iraq.
The Administration is counting on the embargo to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. But there is concern that the embargo could fall victim to widespread cheating unless nations harmed by the loss of markets or other economic fallout are adequately compensated.
Finance officials gathered today for the start of a week of discussions as part of the annual meetings of the I.M.F. and World Bank. The finance leaders were expected to review a wide range of topics, from the faltering Soviet economy to the $1.3 trillion debt burden being carried by third world nations.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
2 Named to Succeed Top SCEcorp Officer

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
SCEcorp, the parent of the Southern California Edison Company, yesterday named two successors to fill the shoes of Howard P. Allen, who is retiring as chairman, chief executive and president after 10 years at the helm of one of the nation's largest utilities.
The board elected John E. Bryson, a former state regulator, to be chairman and chief executive. He won out for the top posts over Michael R. Peevey, who received the No. 2 spot as president. Both men have been executive vice presidents. 
Mr. Allen, who turns 65 in October, remains as chairman of the board's executive committee.
Mr. Bryson, 47 years old, who is currently executive vice president and chief financial officer, joined the company in 1984 from the law firm of Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco.
From 1979 to 1982 he was president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates the state's gas, electric, telephone and water utilities. Before that, for nearly three years he was chairman of the California State Water Resources Control Board, which is responsible for water rights and water quality.
Mr. Peevey, 52, joined the utility in 1984 as vice president, overseeing the revenue and governmental affairs departments. Before he joined the utility, he co-founded and served for 11 years as president of the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance, an environmental group. Earlier, he was director of research for the California Labor Federation, A.F.L.-C.I.O., and coordinator of community programs for the Institute of Industrial Relations at the University of California, Berkeley.
SCEcorp, based in Rosemead, Calif., serves four million customers through its Southern California Edison unit in Southern and central California.
Under Mr. Allen, the utility experienced solid growth. He has been trying to make it the largest investor-owned utility in the United States by merging with the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. The $2.5 billion merger, first announced in late 1988 and opposed by the state's Attorney General, must still win approval by state and Federal regulators.
The company has also diversified into nonregulated businesses that include co-generation plants, land development and electrical construction.
Mr. Allen, a 37-year employee of the company, was known for a close eye for detail. The company biography says he demands cleanliness for Edison trucks and plants and insists that employee uniforms ''convey professionalism.''
Mr. Bryson is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford University and received his law degree at Yale University. Mr. Peevey received undergraduate and master's degrees in economics from the University of California, Berkeley.

HEADLINE: Oil Price Rise Gives Algeria a $1 Billion Windfall

BYLINE: By EDWARD SCHUMACHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALGIERS

 BODY:
The sharp increase in the price of crude oil has meant a projected windfall of $1 billion for Algeria at a time when the nation is suffering from economic turmoil, social tension and a pressing foreign debt.
Algeria is neutral in the Persian Gulf conflict, opposing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and also the Western military presence in the gulf, and the Government of President Chadli Benjedid says its political stance is not economically driven.
Algeria, with a population of 25 million, is one of the few large and populous Arab countries to have oil. Because Algeria has been producing at full capacity, its economy is more sensitive to price fluctuations than the Persian Gulf producers that have small populations and large reserves. 
 
Opposed Rise in Output
Inside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, before the Iraqi invasion, Algeria tended to agree with Iraq against Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that the world price of oil was too low. Later, Algeria was part of the OPEC majority that rejected Saudi calls to increase production to make up for embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti supply and lower prices.
After averaging $18 a barrel this year, crude oil has risen to more than $33 a barrel following the invasion of Kuwait. Algeria can use the money. Its economy has been in disarray since the mid-1980's, when falling world oil prices halved its income.
According to the Algerian central bank, the country earned an estimated $9.1 billion in oil and gas exports last year, well below the $13.7 billion earned in 1980, especially when the drop in the dollar is taken into account. Oil is paid for in dollars.
The $1 billion windfall on top of a projected $10.1 billion in earnings this year is based on oil selling at an average of $25 a barrel to the end of the year, officials said. The windfall would be even greater were it not that gas prices, though related to oil prices, do not increase as fast. Nearly 60 percent of Algeria's oil-related exports are in gas - in liquid, natural and petroleum forms.
The United States took $1.9 billion of Algeria's exports last year, most of it in liquid natural gas for East Coast heating. Algeria bought $900 million in goods from the United States, mostly in grains and industrial products. The bulk of Algeria's trade is with the European Community. $24 Billion Debt Officials said they hoped that the windfall would aid in overhauling a $24 billion foreign debt, 70 percent of which matures by 1993. The burden is such that the Economics Ministry had designated three-quarters of this year's oil earnings for debt service, leaving little for badly needed industrial and consumer goods.
Loath to formally reschedule its debt for fear its credit rating may be damaged, the Government is negotiating with a consortium of American and French banks to lengthen repayment periods, in part through a novel plan in which the French Government in July agreed to help guarantee the refinancing of $1 billion to $2 billion with zero-coupon bonds.
Bankers had been resisting Algerian overtures, but the windfall eases Algeria's cash flow and will bolster lender confidence, a European banker said in an interview.
Algeria faces a more fundamental problem - a heavily state-run and inefficient economy gone awry. The death knell to the system was sounded two years ago when hundreds of people were killed here in riots touched off by shortages of food and consumer goods and an unemployment rate that still runs officially at 24 percent. State factories are running at 10 percent to 60 percent of capacity, Algerian analysts said.
 
Wildcat Strikes
A lack of financing, demand and management led to such debacles in recent months as a shortage of bottled lemonade, because the bottling plant ran out bottles. Wildcat strikes have become common, and even the Foreign Ministry has been paralyzed in recent weeks by 700 employees who walked out in a demand for higher wages.
An Islamic fundamentalist party, the Islamic Salvation Front, capitalized on discontent to win 54 percent of the vote in local elections in June, the first open elections to be held since the ruling National Liberation Front took power in 1963.
The fundamentalists, who say they uphold free market principles, are well positioned to win parliamentary elections next year, but aging leaders from the ruling party still uphold the revolutionary socialism of the 1960's.
Officials in the more technocratically oriented Government say they have been forced to move piecemeal to introduce decentralization and what they hope will be eventual privatization. About 300 of the state's 450 companies have been made autonomous, meaning that they must find their own supplies, sales and financing. But the Government still imposes high hiring quotas.
Even officials concede that the prescription is a formula for bankruptcy for all but the healthiest companies, but they say it is the only way they can winnow the state sector.

HEADLINE: Mexico-Chile Trade Accord

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Mexico and Chile will sign a free trade agreement next month, advancing President Bush's aim to form a continentwide zone that can compete with European and East Asian trade blocs, senior officials of both countries said yesterday.
 
President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari of Mexico and President Patricio Aylwin of Chile will meet in Mexico on Oct. 4 to sign the pact, the officials said after a meeting at Mexico's trade offices in New York. 
Jaime Serra, Mexico's Secretary of Trade and Industry, and Alejandro Foxley, Chile's Finance Minister, announced the deal, which is intended to increase the flow of commerce between the two nations, reduce tariffs on imports and eventually eliminate all trade barriers.
If successful, it would go beyond previous pacts, which have been limited to particular goods, not trade in general.
The United States and Mexico hope to reach a similar accord by the end of next year.
 
Mr. Serra said trade between
Mexico and Chile was currently very small but added, ''The potential is tremendous.''
He called the two nations' economies ''complementary,'' noting that Mexico's chief export to Chile was cars, while Chile's main export to Mexico was agricultural goods.

HEADLINE: Policing Japan's Banks Is a Matter of Persuasion

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
The deep problems afflicting the Federal fund that insures deposits at banks and savings and loan associations in the United States may look dire to Americans, but to the Japanese, they are incomprehensible.
The Government here relies on secretive and informal methods for managing problem banks, and they are so effective that most Japanese do not even know there is a deposit insurance system. In fact, the main bank deposit insurance fund has never been tapped, and a smaller fund for credit unions and smaller institutions has been used only once.
''The fact that we've never used the main fund does not mean we don't have troubled institutions,'' an official of the Bank of Japan said. ''But we handle them with means other than our insurance fund.'' 
 
Extralegal Measures
The contrast with the United States reflects one of the least known but more important examples of the extralegal measures used to govern the financial system here, where ''guidance'' done in private replaces open regulatory actions and legal action.
Effective as that system has been in the past, it is likely to be tested by the deregulation of Japan's financial system. The Japanese banking system is undergoing major shifts, albeit at a glacial pace, with interest rates increasingly determined by market forces, protective barriers coming down and banks pursuing a wider variety of businesses.
Economists and Government officials generally agree that the increased competition resulting from these changes will force some Japanese instutitions, particularly vulnerable smaller ones, to close or merge.
The record of Japanese regulators in dealing with troubled banks is barely known because they handle few cases, and those they do are often kept secret. The deposit insurance fund is thus very small and its principal function seems to be putting out a financial statement every year showing how the assets have increased.
 
A Modest Fund
The main fund's assets of 513 billion yen, or $3.66 billion at recent exchange rates, total a modest one-tenth of 1 percent of insured deposits. That is the highest ratio ever, and double the ratio of eight years ago, but it is one-tenth the ratio in the United States in 1987, when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was at its peak, with $18.3 billion in assets.
The emphasis at the central bank and the Finance Ministry has been on preventive regulation. They aim to find problems before an institution collapses. Then - and this is the largest difference from the American system - they use informal means to prod ailing institutions toward help. There are no court battles and usually no public hearings.
''We basically don't feel enforcement of our findings should be handled with legal measures,'' said Makoto Fukuda, head of the small bank division at the Ministry of Finance, where most problems are dealt with. ''We lead management to come to the same conclusions as us.''
''Of course,'' Mr. Fukuda added, ''some won't listen to us. We would then have to take time to persuade them.''
 
Means of Persuasion
Solutions, he said, range from lowering managers' salaries to replacing them, bringing in managers from a stronger financial institution, persuading other financial institutions in the region to provide financial help in the form of low-interest deposits and, if the problems are serious enough, forcing a merger with a stronger institution. In such cases, the Government and other banks provide financial aid.
Usually a regional association to which the sick institution belongs will dip into a private ''mutual assistance fund'' and provide enough low-interest deposits to tide it over, Mr. Fukuda said. If a merger is required, the partner usually comes from this regional grouping.
When a healthy institution helps bail out a sick one, it will receive favorable consideration for profitable Government business or tax breaks later - in other words, completely informal, extralegal measures.
What is making some people here worry is whether such a system will perform well under the rigors of the 1990's. The real estate market, upon which an immense number of loans are based, is weakening. Moody's, the American credit rating agency, has reduced the ratings of several major banks and trust banks because of concerns over their future profitability.
 
Finding Merger Partners
Akio Mikuni, president of Mikuni & Company, the only independent credit rating agency in Japan, said his principal concern was that as profits get squeezed, it would become increasingly difficult for the regulators to find willing merger partners for troubled banks. The only alternative will be to start tapping the deposit insurance fund, or providing even greater forms of informal financial assistance to the healthy banks.
Others worry that tumbling real estate prices could cause severe problems, as happened in the United States. But Yukio Noguchi, a leading expert on the property market and a critic of Government land policies, said even in his worst-case scenario - a decline in land prices of 15 percent annually for three years - the financial and deposit insurance system would remain sound.
''We have been brainstorming on what future measures we may need to take,'' said Mr. Fukuda, the Government banking official. ''Right now, we have no need for a bailout plan, but that doesn't mean we're relaxed. It's a possibility.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Fall in Slow Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped and interest rates rose in sluggish trading yesterday, as credit market participants sold notes and bonds because of a jump in oil prices.
But traders said the price dip was not significant, adding that many of the participants were observing the Jewish New Year.
''Trading is certainly lighter than your average Thursday,'' a government bond trader said. ''The market is just lethargic.'' 
Largely overlooked was news that the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, had suggested that a contentious proposal to cut the capital gains tax rate be taken off the table in the tortuous budget negotiations. But analysts said Mr. Dole's proposal, if agreed to, could break open the deadlocked talks.
 
Value of Swift Accord
Removing the capital gains proposal ''would increase dramatically the chances of an early budget accord,'' said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a firm in Princeton, N.J., that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets.
''And the sooner we get a budget deal, the sooner the Federal Reserve will be in a position to ease interest rates,'' Mr. Stone added. ''I think the Dole proposal is good news, but the market didn't react to it.''
Aside from responding to the sharp rise in oil prices, an auction of one-year Treasury bills was the highlight of yesterday's session.
At the auction, the bills were sold at an average discounted rate of 7.25 percent, down from an average rate of 7.40 percent at the last one-year bill auction on Aug. 23. It is the lowest rate on a one-year bill since the auction on Jan. 11.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 97 2/32 late yesterday, down by 11/ 32, to yield 9.03 percent, compared with a yield of 9 percent late on Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 3/32, down by an eighth of a point, to yield 8.88 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 29/32, down by 2/32, to yield 8.51 percent.
 
Four-Year Notes at 8.40%
The new four-year Treasury notes to be auctioned next Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 8.40 percent. And the new two-year notes to be auctioned next Tuesday were offered at a price to yield 8.04 percent in when-issued trading.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.37 percent, up by a basis point, or hundredth of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late-offered rate of 7.30 percent.
Indications that the Chase Manhattan Bank is having financing difficulties were not to be found in Federal Reserve data released late yesterday. Rumors that Chase was having such problems swirled through financial markets earlier in the week.
In its report, the Fed said that borrowings by eight top New York City banks at its discount window averaged $76 million each day for the week that ended on Sept. 12. By comparison, the average daily borrowings for all banks was $974 million during the period.
Although the Fed does not break down borrowings data by institution, a sharp rise in discount window borrowings by the New York City banks would have provided evidence of a financing problem, since the Fed is the lender of last resort for banks that are in trouble.
Besides the borrowings numbers, the Fed reported that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week that ended on Sept. 10. The third, largest measure, M-3, fell by $3.4 billion.
The money supply report had no effect on prices in the credit markets.
 
Dillard Prices Debt
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Dillard Department Stores Inc. priced a $50 million offering of seven-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The 9 5/8 percent notes, which mature on Sept. 15, 1997, were priced at $99.42 to yield 9.74 percent, 95 basis points above the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary market for corporate bonds was light, the dealers said. The prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most widely quoted issues fell by an eighth of a point to a quarter of a point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher In Volatile but Thin Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar mostly gained ground yesterday in light but volatile trading on world currency markets.
Traders said currencies changed hands in violent spurts that were driven by rumors. Speculation that Japan was about to raise interest rates sent ''people rushing to buy yen for the high-yield attraction,'' said Gilbert Cisneros, a trader at the Bank of Boston's New York office. 
But when the rumor fizzled, traders ''got caught short and dumped yen to buy dollars,'' he said.
Still, much of the day's activity centered on currencies other than the dollar. Lou Calvello, a trader with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said there was a wave of buying of the German mark at the expense of the Japanese yen.
Dealers continued to monitor the price of oil, which jumped to record levels. Recession worries erupted as the price of crude touched $35 a barrel before settling back somewhat.
Over all, activity in the currency markets was light ahead of the meeting tomorrow in Washington of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial nations. Traders said the meeting could provide direction for the currency markets if the ministers issue a statement about the dollar.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 137.05 Japanese yen from 138.05 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar fell to 136.92 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 137.65 yen, down from 137.68 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8690, from $1.8855 late Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.8740 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.8833.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.5773 German marks, up from 1.5730; 1.3210 Swiss francs, up from 1.3105; 5.2815 French francs, up from 5.2670; 1,176.75 Italian lire, up from 1,175.00, and 1.1543 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1563.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.5795 German marks, up from 1.5680; 1.3195 Swiss francs, up from 1.3055; 5.2880 French francs, up from 5.2515; 1.7807 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7670; 1,177.75 Italian lire, up from 1,172.50, and 1.1545 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1575.

HEADLINE: New Bush Tone on Capital Gains Hints at a Budget Compromise

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
As Congressional and Administration budget negotiators wrestled with an impasse over cutting the capital gains tax rate, President Bush pointedly avoided criticizing a suggestion by the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, that the tax cut be severed from the budget package.
Mr. Bush's conciliatory tone in remarks to reporters on the White House lawn contrasted with his demand in a speech to Congress 10 days ago that any budget compromise include a decrease in the tax rate for capital gains.
On Thursday, White House officials rejected Mr. Dole's suggestion that Congress be allowed to vote separately on the tax proposal, along with other measures that would result in reduced revenue or increased spending.
 
Careful Bush Response
Today, the President said he did not want to be considered ''soft on capital gains,'' then refused an opportunity to state Administration opposition to the Dole plan. He said: ''Well, I want to get capital gains. I'm not endorsing the Dole suggestion, nor would I be -would it be appropriate for me to criticize it.'' 
''Look, we're down to the wire, and I believe that's all being discussed right now,'' he said, referring to the high-level budget negotiations. ''Bob Dole is trying to be helpful and trying to get this impasse broken.''
This small break in White House insistence came after the top five Democratic and Republican Congressional leaders and senior Administration officials have spent the last four days in private sessions looking for a way to reconcile Mr. Bush's desire for a cut in the gains rate with Democratic insistence that the cut be offest by higher income tax rates for the wealthy.
While other spending and budget process issues still divide the negotiators, the capital gains tax has become the main point of dispute in the four-month effort to slash $50 billion from the deficit in 1991 and $500 billion over the next five years. Democratic Congressional leaders are drafting a stopgap spending bill that could delay severe cuts in Federal spending beyond the Oct. 1 deadline while negotiations on what to do about taxing capital gains continue.
To some Democrats, it appeared that Mr. Dole's attempt to break the logjam might strengthen the hand of Richard G. Darman, the budget director.
People who have sat through the meetings sense that there is a split between Mr. Darman and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, on the capital gains issue. Mr. Sununu appears to believe that a cut in the capital gains rate is critical to the economy and to the Bush Presidency, while Mr. Darman is believed to think that the issue is not worth putting an overall budget agreement at risk.
The third Administration official in the talks, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, the one who is personally closest to the President, has been tightlipped on where he would come out in a contest between a gains cut or no agreement at all during the negotiations. Even many of Mr. Brady's closest aides are uncertain about where he stands on the matter because he rarely shares with them the advice he is giving the President.
Under Mr. Dole's proposal, the House and Senate would take separate votes on a package of deficit-reducing measures and a second package that included tax-cutting or new spending measures along with whatever means the two parties might recommend to pay for them. Mr. Dole today refined the proposal slightly to say that the two votes would be tied: if on final passage the package including the gains cut was defeated, the deficit reduction package would be considered defeated as well.
 
Approaching Deadlines
Although a number of Democratic negotiators have privately said they find Mr. Dole's suggestion appealing, their public comments about it today were cautious.
The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said it was ''worth exploring,'' and the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, referred to it as ''a creative idea'' at a time when the stalled budget talks need all the new ideas they can get.
While Mr. Gephardt said the negotiators had not imposed any deadlines on their deliberations, a series of deadlines that may finally force action on the budget are beginning to close in. The most pressing is Oct. 1, the start of the Government's new fiscal year.
That is the date when, without the 13 yearly spending bills that finance the operations of the Government, the Government will not have money for its operations unless Congress passes a stopgap spending bill.
It is also the date that some $85 billion in automatic spending cuts required by the balanced-budget law will take effect unless lawmakers can agree on their own budget.
On Oct. 2, temporary legislation that gives the Government authority to keep borrowing is due to expire, and Congress would have to raise the debt limit to let the Treasury sell bonds in the financial markets. Social Security checks, which are mailed out on Oct. 3, are not exempt from the automatic spending cuts, but would be worthless if the Government did not have enough cash on hand to cover them.
As of late today, Congressional leaders had not decided if a stopgap spending measure would include a delay in the automatic spending cuts. Mr. Bush has threatened to veto such a spending bill if it is sent to him before there is a budget agreement.
Some Democratic strategists believe they could muster enough votes to override that veto, particularly if the stopgap bill includes an extension of the debt limit and money the Administration is seeking for military operations in the Persian Gulf.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about Bush Administration reaction to a budget compromise proposal by Senator Bob Dole referred incorrectly to Social Security checks. The checks are exempt from automatic spending cuts under the budget-balancing law.

HEADLINE: CHASE MANHATTAN TO CUT 5,000 JOBS AND TRIM DIVIDEND

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
In a telling new sign of the problems afflicting the nation's banks, the Chase Manhattan Corporation said yesterday that it would take a $1 billion charge against earnings and reduce its work force by 5,000 employees. The nation's second-largest bank also took the unusual and humbling step of cutting its stock dividend by more than 50 percent as part of a drive to rebuild its financial strength.
The $1 billion charge is to cover mounting loan losses - mainly for real-estate deals - and the cost of paring employees. The charge will be subtracted from gross earnings for the three months ending Sept. 30 and should result in a loss for the quarter of about $625 million, the bank said.
Chase's actions are part of a broad cost-cutting trend in the troubled banking industry. Earlier this year, for example, Chemical Bank, one of Chase's long-time New York rivals, moved to eliminate 1,100 jobs to pare its annual costs by $60 million. Manufacturers Hanover has also announced plans to cut 1,400 workers. 
 
Bank Strength Eroding
The strength of many of the nation's major banks has eroded in the last decade because of a decline in their lending practice, as big customers realized they could borrow money more cheaply on Wall Street than from banks. They have also suffered a persistent hangover from bad loans to developing countries made during the 1970's and early 1980's.
More recently, a weakening economy and slumping real-estate prices in many regions have been adding to the damage, hurting even those banks that were previously healthy.
At Chase, the bulk of the $1 billion charge - $650 million - will be set aside to cushion the bank against growing loan losses, largely from poor real-estate deals. The remaining $350 million is the estimated cost of trimming the work force and making other changes that Chase says will cut its costs by $300 million next year.
Chase's move may encourage other banks to act more boldly in increasing reserves to protect themselves against questionable loans, Wall Street analysts said.
''This just increases the likelihood that other banks will step up to the plate,'' said James J. McDermott Jr., a banking industry analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''We also expect more dividend cuts.''
In other moves yesterday, the Midlantic Corporation of Edison, N.J., said it would add $285 million to its reserves for bad loans, cutting its quarterly dividend to 25 cents, from 47 cents, and projecting a third-quarter net loss of up to $160 million.
 
Move by Southeast Banking
And the Southeast Banking Corporation of Miami said it would increase loan-loss provisions by $115 million, eliminating its 10-cent quarterly dividend, and projecting a $87 million loss for the third quarter.
Chase also said yesterday that the blow to its third-quarter earnings would be softened by a a $117 million profit on the sale last week of its office in Frankfurt.
Chase's planned employee reductions, which amount to a 12 percent cut in the work force, were far larger than the 3,000 estimated by analysts in June, when the bank first announced its cost-cutting goals. The company said 3,400 would be from its domestic work force, including 1,600 who have already resigned under a voluntary severance program.
But the bank emphasized its commitment to expanding its profitable consumer banking business, which accounts for the majority of its 20,000 employees in the New York area. About 5,000 employees in Chase's computer operations are scheduled to move from Manhattan to Brooklyn upon completion of the Metrotech project there in 1994, jobs the bank agreed to keep in New York in exchange for $235 million in tax breaks and energy subsidies.
Chase said that despite the huge write-offs, it would end the third quarter with $11.1 billion in capital. That would be enough to meet new regulatory guidelines covering capital-to-debt ratios, which are measures of the solidity of banks, for the end of 1992. The bank, which had net income of $96 million for the first six months of this year, also said it planned to improve capital ratios further.
''This was a bold step to get out in front of all of the issues facing us,'' said Thomas G. Labreque, Chase's president and chief operating officer. Mr. Labreque has taken the lead in the bank's restructuring efforts since being named to succeed Willard C. Butcher as chairman and chief executive next month.
Wall Street was dismayed by the size of the third-quarter loan-loss provisions, which Chase attributed to the deteriorating market for commercial real estate. The bank expects delinquent domestic loans, on which no interest is being paid, to jump 20 percent in the current quarter, to $2.5 billion. It expects to write off $65 million in commercial real-estate loans in the quarter, up from $21 million in the second quarter.
Chase's latest move to bolster reserves follows a similar action in last year's third quarter, when the bank took a $1.1 billion loss. The loss stemmed from an increase of $1.15 billion in its reserves for losses on loans to third world countries, along with about $110 million in write-offs for bad real-estate loans in Arizona.
 
Shares Down $1, to $12.75
Chase's shares fell $1, to $12.75, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with analysts expressing doubts that the bank could finish 1990 strongly enough to report a profit for the year.
But analysts praised the thrust of the bank's plans.
''They had to come out swinging and they did,'' said Mr. McDermott of Keefe, Bruyette. Mr. McDermott and other analysts said there had been rumors on Wall Street in recent days that other bankers were so worried about Chase's financial condition that the bank had found it difficult to meet routine funding needs.
Mr. Labreque said Chase had no projection for when it might reverse its dividend cut, which will drop the quarterly payout to 30 cents a share, from 62 cents. The dividend cut, along with additional sales of property and other assets, the use of $750 million in tax benefits, and earnings, are all expected to help rebuild capital ratios. Such policies are expected to allow the bank to gain approval to underwrite the sale of equities, which the Federal Reserve this week indicated that banks would be able to do for the first time in nearly 60 years.
Chase said it expected that the slump in the domestic real-estate market would continue and would force it to set aside more money in the future to cover losses in its loan portfolio, but it projects that the additional money would be no more than $200 million in the fourth quarter. As a result, the bank expects to report a net profit in the quarter of at least $140 million.
''This should put an end to the rumors about their having trouble getting funding,'' said Frank DeSantis, of Paine Webber.
Most of the $350 million charge for the reorganization will finance the work force reductions, which are expected to provide about $225 million of the $300 million in annual operating savings. But the bank will also be taking charges to dispose of low-yielding tax-exempt municipal loans, packages of residential mortgage loans and some foreign securities.
The new additions to loan-loss reserves will bring Chase's total at the end of the third quarter to about $2.9 billion, or 3.8 percent of all outstanding loans. More than half the reserves, or $1.6 billion, have been set aside against longstanding problem loans to developing nations. Excluding cross-border lending, Chase's reserve to loan ratio is 1.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Rinfret, Denouncing Republican Leaders, Vows to Stay in Race

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
Vowing to continue his campaign for governor of New York but to turn it into a populist struggle, the Republican candidate, Pierre A. Rinfret, yesterday turned on the party leaders who had nominated him and accused them of being interested only in their own political fortunes.
Mr. Rinfret lashed out at the State Senate's Republican leaders, saying they were ''in bed'' with his opponent, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and were leading the state to ''fiscal disaster.''
His wrath spared few. He called State Senator Roy M. Goodman, the Manhattan Republican leader who had recruited him, ''one of the most destructive people in the state.'' 
He said that the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, was ''in bed with Cuomo'' and that Senator Guy J. Velella, the Bronx Republican leader and chairman of the State Senate Republican Campaign Committee, was ''one of the most dangerous people in the state.''
Later, at a news conference of his own, Senator Goodman speculated that Mr. Rinfret was suffering from ''mental exhaustion and fatigue.''
''The tension and fatigue of the campaign have evidently caused our candidate to say things which, on reflection, I feel sure he will wish to modify,'' Mr. Goodman said, adding: ''I'm concerned about him. I want very much for him to take off a long weekend and get some rest, and I say that most seriously.''
Mr. Rinfret, ending three days of suspense over whether he would continue his campaign, told a crowded news conference at his Manhattan headquarters that Republican leaders were ''sabotaging'' his campaign. He had unsuccessfully sought their commitment to raise $1 million for his stumbling campaign.
''They are not interested in the party winning,'' he said. ''They want me to lose because I'm going to upset their apple cart.''
He added, ''Self-styled leaders of the Republican Party turned their backs on New York and turned their backs on me.'' Several Republicans noted the similarity of Mr. Rinfret's tactics to the unorthodox and winning strategy of John R. Silber, the president of Boston University, in the Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial primary this week.
 
'War on the Geritol Set'
Mr. Rinfret, a 66-year-old economist, said that he was ''declaring war on the Geritol set,'' a reference, he said, to the long service of Senators Marino, Goodman and Velella, who are all younger than he.
A millionaire, Mr. Rinfret contributed $540,000 to his campaign, a commitment he made to Republican leaders as a condition of his nomination, but he said yesterday that he had spent only about $100,000 of that money.
Typical of his often confusing and contradictory statements at the news conference, Mr. Rinfret said at one point that he might spend ''a couple of million'' and at another point, ''we'll play it by ear.''
''I'm in this race until Mario Cuomo and the politicians, Democrat or Republican, who are destroying this state are put out of business,'' he declared, reading from a statement.
 
Concern for Republican Senate
State Senate Republican leaders and aides expressed confidence that Mr. Rinfret's break with the party would not affect their effort to retain a State Senate majority in the face of the most determined Democratic challenge in many years. Other Republican politicians were not so sure.
Mr. Rinfret's running mates remained loyal to the party. The nominee for lieutenant governor, George F. T. Yancey Jr., a cheese manufacturer from Wayne County, said he shared Mr. Rinfret's frustrations over the lack of party support but added, ''I'm not going to build any walls between myself and the party leaders.''
State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, the only Republican holding statewide office, said he was ''totally disassociating myself from the name-calling and the personal attacks.'' He added that Mr. Rinfret ''ought to stick to the issues.''
Bernard C. Smith, a former State Senator from Northport, L.I., who is the Republican candidate for attorney general, could not be reached for comment. He is recuperating from an injury suffered in a fall from a ladder.
Democrats kept discreetly silent yesterday, giving the Republicans every opportunity to batter each other.
Mr. Rinfret said that Senators Marino, Goodman and Velella were ''sitting on three and a quarter million dollars'' in campaign funds and had given him nothing but a $7,000 donation from Mr. Goodman.
The Republican State Committee says it is $1 million in debt. The State Senate Campaign Committee has $1.2 million on hand, and Senator Goodman has at least $1 million available in Manhattan Republican and State Senate campaign funds. Both men contended that their funds were needed for other Republican campaigns.
In response to Mr. Rinfret's accusations, the Republican leaders generally turned the other cheek yesterday and at least publicly said they would continue to support him.
 
Marino Says 'Very Bizarre'
But Senator Marino called Mr. Rinfret's actions ''very bizarre'' and said the candidate's allegations of collusion between the State Senate Republicans and Mr. Cuomo were ''utter nonsense.'' ''He's just looking for an issue,'' Mr. Marino added. Senator Velella said that when Mr. Rinfret asked for $950,000 from the Senate Campaign Committee, the candidate warned him, ''Don't come back with an offer of $200,000 or 300,000 dollars.'' He said Mr. Rinfret was now throwing ''a temper tantrum.''
Mr. Rinfret had asked leading Republicans to meet with him yesterday to discuss his campaign finances, but J. Patrick Barrett, the Republican state chairman, said that such a meeting was ''inappropriate.''
Mr. Rinfret's criticism of Republican leaders isolated his campaign from the party even more than it had been. It had already taken on aspects of a mom-and-pop operation, with the candidate, his wife, daughter and son working at the headquarters at 575 Lexington Avenue. Mr. Rinfret is also working with Eddie Mahe, who is a Washington political consultant, and half a dozen other professionals not identified with the state Republican Party.
Mr. Rinfret's campaign manager, Assemblyman John Faso, and two press aides, Bryan Flood and Kelly Naioti, resigned this week to protest Mr. Rinfret's attacks on the party.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Bush to Revise Proposal to Sell Arms to Saudis

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Bowing to Congressional pressure, the White House today modified its plans to sell $21 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia and said it would present the package to Congress in stages, with the largest part deferred until next year.
The White House did not say how the sale would be divided. But officials familiar with the package said the first portion, to be submitted to Congress next week, was valued at $5 billion to $8 billion and would include thousands of trucks and TOW antitank missiles. The most controversial weapons included in the deal, F-15 fighter planes and M-1 tanks, would be transferred in the second stage, the officials said. 
 
Bush Makes an Appeal
In Baghdad, the Iraqi leadership issued its most bellicose statement to date in the Persian Gulf crisis, urging citizens to prepare for ''the mother of all battles'' and saying there was ''not a single chance for any retreat'' by Iraq. It also announced retaliatory expulsions of diplomats from the United States, Western Europe and Egypt. Washington responded by expelling Iraqi diplomats. [Page 4.] Apparently embarrassed by the political uproar over the weapons package, President Bush made a strong plea for what would be the largest arms sale to Saudi Arabia in history. The Saudi purchase has drawn criticism from members of Congress who fear that it would seriously erode Israel's military edge in the region.
The President said that meeting ''Saudi Arabia's legitimate defense requirements'' was essential.
The Saudi Ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, said that splitting the arms package into two parts posed no problems for Riyadh. ''We get this phase this week and we'll have another phase in the future,'' the Prince said. ''Overall, we're very happy with the way things are going.''
In a carefully worded statement this evening, the White House sought to put the best face on its compromise on the Saudi arms sale.
''Following consultations with the Saudi Government and the Congress, the Administration has determined that is in the interest of the United States to provide Saudi Arabia with additional means to defend itself,'' the statement said. ''Following our consultations with Congress, we will provide this assistance in phases.''
The White House also sought to reassure Saudi Arabia that the change in plans did not represent any diminishing of Washington's commitment to defending the kingdom against Iraq.
 
Termed Part of Strategy
''The United States has a close and valued relationship with its longtime friend Saudi Arabia,'' the statement said, adding that the arms sale ''constitutes a key dimension of our overall strategy toward the Persian Gulf and could serve as well to protect American lives.''
Saudi Arabia could go to another supplier if the United States does not meet its armament needs. In 1985, when Congressional opposition forced the Reagan Administration to withdraw a proposed sale of F-15 fighter planes to the kingdom, Riyadh ended up buying British-made Tornado warplanes.
A spokesman for the Saudi Government in Washington, Fred Dutton, said earlier today that Riyadh preferred to buy its arms from the United States, but would approach other countries if the Administration was forced to back off from the proposed deal.
''If they can't get what they want here, they'll have to go elsewhere, and will,'' Mr. Dutton said.
 
Reservations on Future Sales
Lawmakers who had criticized the Administration's handling of the Saudi deal said the emergency package would meet little if any opposition on Capitol Hill, but that any future sale of advanced weaponry would require thorough study.
''I still have serious questions about the second part of this package,'' said Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California.
Despite his comment this week that Iraq had brought the region to ''the brink of war,'' Mr. Bush said before leaving for a weekend at Camp David that he still hoped for a peaceful resolution of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
The President told reporters on the White House lawn that he did not intend to send a signal that he was ''shifting more toward the military'' and away from economic sanctions in his effort to force President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to pull his forces out of Kuwait.
But he declined to make a commitment not to start a war.
''I'm not making any commitments,'' Mr. Bush said. ''There are so many contingencies. I've spelled them out. The treatment of American citizens is one thing that concerns me greatly. The possible use of terror is another.''
 
Reports on Terrorists
Reports that Abu Nidal and several other well-known terrorists are now operating out of Baghdad were discussed at a meeting between the President and Congressional leaders this morning. Mr. Bush said he had told the leaders that ''Iraqi support for terrorism would indeed have serious consequences.''
He also said he had expressed his concern about Iraqi treatment of Kuwaitis since Iraq overran the country on Aug. 2. Widespread looting and raping have been reported in recent days, along with what Mr. Bush called ''the systematic dismantling'' of Kuwait's economic and military structure.
After a week in which Congressional criticism of some aspects of his gulf policy became more vocal, the President turned the other cheek, thanking Congress for its support. ''It's good and it's strong,'' he said.
Mr. Bush emphasized his determination to give United Nations economic sanctions a chance to end the Middle East emergency, which entered its eighth week today.
The President said that if the embargo on land and sea shipments to and from Iraq were extended to air traffic, ''obviously the United States would do its part.''
An air embargo is expected to win United Nations approval next week. Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said today that the foreign ministers of the member countries of the United Nations Security Council would meet Tuesday ''to consider the situation in the Persian Gulf and, if appropriate, to adopt a resolution.''
The meeting was called by the Soviet Union, currently the president of the Security Council, to approve the new plan to tighten trade sanctions against Iran and occupied Kuwait by cutting air links with the two countries and blocking Iraqi merchant shipping between third countries.
Mr. Bush said he would welcome a broadcast of a 90-minute tape that Mr. Hussein is sending to the United States in response to an eight-minute message from Mr. Bush that was aired in Iraq last weekend.
''This will finish him off in the United States,'' the President said, laughing. ''I can't speak for the rest of the world. It would just be, nobody could stay awake through that.''

HEADLINE: Monopoly Status Led Cable TV to Gouge

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''House Passes a Bill to Regulate Cable TV, in Part'' (front page, Sept. 11), you quote Representative Edward J. Markey, Massachusetts Democrat, as saying of the cable industry, the ''rate gouging that was going on was so great that even the most fervent supporters of the free marketplace had to recognize the rapacious nature of the industry.''
I find it surprising that at a time when Soviet leaders are learning the basics of economics, a United States Representative can't tell the difference between a monopoly and a free market. Cable television companies were able to price gouge precisely because they were not subjected to a free marketplace; local governments conferred monopoly status on them. Lack of competition is what leads to high prices, not the rapacity of an industry.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Way to Clean House

 BODY:
Oklahomans voted 2 to 1 on Tuesday to put a 12-year limit on state legislators' terms. California and Colorado have similar proposals on their November ballots; opinion polls in both states indicate overwhelming public support, and national polls show the same. Has the time arrived? 
The idea is popular because people are increasingly fed up with their government - with rising taxes, inadequate public services and politicians, some crooked, who perpetuate themselves in office with fat campaign contributions.
There is one good way to fix that: Vote the rascals out. But given the rate at which incumbents get themselves re-elected these days, it may appear that forced retirement is a better way. It's not.
Proposals for capping terms are as old as the nation. The Articles of Confederation limited members of the Continental Congress to three one-year terms within five years, and a plan to limit House members came up at the Constitutional Convention. The modern movement is spearheaded by conservatives. At the national level, Republicans see it as an opening to break the Democrats' grip on both houses. But it also has strong backing from people who identify themselves as Democrats in the opinion polls. The key flaw in term limitation is that it punishes experience. It takes time to learn the ropes of government - to develop the sense to fend off self-serving bureaucrats and lobbyists, to master the intricacies of public policy and to figure out how to get things done. With experienced legislators flowing through a revolving door, power could pass from elected politicians to unelected and virtually permanent staff employees.
Limitation would also make lame ducks of all lawmakers in their final terms. For U.S. senators, serving two six-year terms, a 12-year limit would mean they'd be responsible to no one for their second six years. Looking ahead to unemployment, they would presumably be less interested in their public office than in who on the outside might help them next.
This bad idea comes from a a frustrated electorate. Advocates aim to get the issue on the ballot in a dozen more states by 1992, and are pressing a constitutional amendment in Congress. If incumbents don't like it, they would be well advised to shape up; campaign finance reform is a good place to start. If voters are still dissatisfied let them weed out the bad, one by one. That's the responsible way. Wholesale housecleaning is a cop-out.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Minister in Exile Asserts Oilfields In Kuwait Were Mined by Iraqis

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Iraqi military forces have mined Kuwaiti oil installations, Kuwait's exiled Minister of Finance said today.
The minister, Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, also told reporters he was confident that Iran would not break the United Nations trade embargo against Iraq, a possibility that has been worrying Washington and other governments that support the sanctions.
He reported that Kuwaiti leaders in exile would be prepared to contribute substantially more than the $2.5 billion already pledged to help Middle Eastern countries being harmed by their compliance with the sanctions. The Kuwaitis also have pledged $2.5 billion to support the American military buildup in the Persian Gulf. 
 
Long-Term Damage Difficult
Speaking about the mining of oilfields, Sheik Ali said: ''We have received detailed information on this'' from ''our own people there'' in Kuwait. He said that it would be very difficult to inflict long-term damage on the fields, but that the mines could cause extensive damage on the surface and could set off ''a lot of fires that would be very difficult to extinguish.''
Oil industry experts agreed. They said it might take months to put out such fires, making it that much longer before Kuwaiti production could help to ease any shortages in world supply once the crisis has ended.
Last year, Kuwait produced on average 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, an output near its full capacity. Its oil reserves total about 94.5 billion barrels. Iraq had been producing about 3.1 million barrels and exporting about 2.75 million barrels before its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia and other oil producers have significantly increased output to try to make up the four million barrels a day of exports that had come from Kuwait and Iraq. But there are still concerns that world oil supplies will be tight in the winter, when, analysts say, an additional daily production of one million to two million barrels will be needed.
Oil prices, now about $34 a barrel, already reflect a growing pessimism that the Middle East conflict will be settled peacefully, analysts say. They said the Kuwaiti minister's assertion that Kuwaiti oilfields have been mined - an Iraqi step long rumored - is likely to increase pessimism and cause prices to rise further.
''It will be taken as an indication of the aggressiveness of the Iraqi stance,'' said Graham Duxbury, director of Petroleum Economics Ltd., a London-based consulting company.
Although Iraqi forces are reported to have ransacked Kuwait and caused extensive damage, they do not appear to have harmed the country's oilfield installations and refineries, said Sheik Ali and executives of the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation who were interviewed here.
''To our knowledge, there's no damage,'' said one of the executives, who insisted that he not be identified. He said his information came from a company executive who had left Kuwait this week.
 
Playing Games With Iran
The Kuwaiti minister said he believed that Iran would not break the trade sanctions against Iraq and that Teheran was playing games with Baghdad, its old enemy. He also said it would be very difficult for Iraq to transport oil to Iran. There have been reports that Iran has agreed to take 200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil daily for use in Iranian refineries. Sheik Ali called the reports ''a lot of nonsense.''
Iraq has reportedly also proposed that Iran and Iraq link their pipelines, allowing Iraq to export 500,000 barrels of oil a day, in return for food, medicine and cash.
But the Iranian President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, has repeatedly pledged to abide by the United Nations sanctions. Indicating he believes him, Sheik Ali said his Government's relations with Iran were ''very good.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
SAUDIS TWIST ARMS MUCH HARDER NOW

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Sept. 21

 BODY:
An influential Saudi Government official describes the new attitude as ''No more Mr. Nice Guy.''
He was talking about his formerly reticent Government's new determination to act far more publicly and aggressively at home and abroad to defend Saudi national interests in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
The new assertiveness, which was apparent even early in the crisis, has come sharply into focus in recent days and weeks as the kingdom has unabashedly used the leverage that its oil wealth brings - sending emissaries around the globe to court, cajole and at times, officials here say, strongly pressure foreign governments to come to the assistance of Saudi Arabia.
''We told Japan and the Europeans that if they did not contribute to our defense we would have to consider closely all future contracts by their companies in Saudi Arabia,'' a Saudi official said. ''I think they got the message.'' Previous Maneuvering Discreet This conservative Muslim monarchy has been willing to use its power before, most publicly in the 1973 oil embargo to protest Western support for Israel. 
But other Saudi maneuvering has usually been very discreet. The kingdom quietly financed the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Afghan rebels, the Nicaraguan contras and other forces and parties in Ethiopia, Chad and Somalia, among others, Western and Saudi officials say.
But current Saudi moves are distinguished, according to Western diplomats, by being far more open and un-apologetic in the use of the Saudis' oil-based economic might.
''It's a new game,'' said a Western diplomat in an interview. ''This is a far more assured and aggressive Saudi Arabia than we've seen before.''
 
Notion of Arab Unity Abandoned
Along the way, Saudi officials and Western diplomats say, the kingdom is jettisoning some of its notable discretion, as well as the refrain of seeking ''Arab unity.''
''This crisis has shaken the country,'' the senior Saudi official said. ''We don't give a damn anymore about Arab unity, which never existed anyway. You are going to see us defend ourselves.''
In part perhaps because of such frankness, the Saudis have won broad support, the most obvious instance of which is the deployment of more than 150,000 American troops here.
The Saudis have gone on to win the backing of nations as diverse as Syria, Egypt, Pakistan, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, China and Argentina, and organizations like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations, among others.
 
Moscow's Involvement Sought
In a strong sign of the new Saudi assertiveness, the Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, has just finished a visit to Moscow to restore relations with the Kremlin after a break of 52 years.
Saudi officials openly speak of encouraging Moscow to involve itself directly in the defense of Saudi Arabia, perhaps by ferrying a Syrian armored division to the contested frontier with Iraq, a country that until six weeks ago was a major Soviet client.
At home and in the region, the Saudis have if anything been even more aggressive, moving swiftly on a number of fronts.
To parry any attempt by Iran or Iraq to curry favor among fundamentalist Muslims, the Saudis have sought to buttress their standing as leader of the Islamic world, based on their role as guarantors of the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
Saudi ''ulema,'' the religous leaders of the faith and interpreters of the holy law, have been active in securing the condemnation of Iraq by the World Muslim League, which last week characterized President Saddam Hussein as a blasphemer.
Saudi envoys have also secured a firm alliance with Egypt and Syria against Iraq.
Saudi pressure saw Cairo selected as the new site of the badly divided Arab League. Saudi officials say Saudi dollars helped solidify the new open military alliance with Syria and Egypt.
A senior Saudi official said that Syria already had been given $500 million in cash assistance and another $500 million in promised development projects, an offer he said was eagerly accepted by the Syrian President, Hafez al- Assad, whose nation is financially strapped and no longer able to rely on Soviet support.
The Saudi official said the kingdom expected to give between $1 and $2 billion to Egypt as well.
 
Anger With Jordan
The Saudis are now scathing in their criticism of Arab states they see as adversaries and sympathetic to Iraq. Saudi officials speak openly of their willingness to see Jordan's King Hussein tumble from power and the P.L.O. leader, Yasir Arafat, disappear into ignominy.
This week, oil industry executives said, the Saudis cut off oil deliveries to Jordan, citing Amman's failure to pay. But the executives said the move in fact was a clear expression of Saudi anger at Jordan.
Saudi officials say that they would like to see the United States use the gulf crisis to persuade Israel to seek a settlement with Palestinians on the West Bank, but that they do not care any longer if that settlement includes Mr. Arafat.
''We kissed Arafat on the cheek for years in the name of Arab brotherhood,'' a Saudi official said. ''No more. He's a thug.'' Those are strong words in the Middle East, where memories are long and sanctions among enemies severe. Perhaps as a consequence, the Saudis are taking quick steps to tighten their own security.
 
Triple Military Forces
They are seeking to buy more than $20 billion worth of military equipment from the United States to support a possible tripling of Saudi military forces. Saudi officials also say their intelligence service has increased internal surveillance for possible terrorist attacks.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Leaders Bluntly Prime Iraq For 'Mother of All Battles'

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Iraq's leaders today issued their most bellicose statement of the Persian Gulf crisis, urging citizens to prepare for ''the mother of all battles,'' and backed it up with the retaliatory expulsion from Baghdad of diplomats from the United States, Western Europe and Egypt.
The Government-run television in Baghdad broke into scheduled programs early today with a statement from the ruling Revolutionary Command Council, a close circle of aides and relatives of President Saddam Hussein. The Council said there was ''not a single chance for any retreat'' in Iraq's confrontation with the United States and its allies.
Western and Arab diplomats here said that in referring repeatedly to the possibility of conflict on Iraqi territory, the statement seemed intended to create the impression that Baghdad was anticipating a first strike from the American-led force building to challenge Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
 
No Reference to Peace
The statement was the first since the crisis began to avoid all reference to peace. Diplomats said it appeared to be a rejoinder to President Bush's warnings of ''additional steps'' to force an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the restoration of its now-exiled Government and the release of foreign hostages.
Later, Iraq reported violations of its airspace by aircraft flying at high altitude across its southern border with Saudi Arabia, but did not identify them. The Saudi press agency denied any such incursion from its territory.
Iraq's expulsion of military attaches and other diplomatic personnel was viewed as a response to similar action against Iraqi diplomats or to other acts perceived in Baghdad as hostile, including Egypt's decision to send thousands of troops to Saudi Arabia. Many Iraqi diplomats were expelled from foreign capitals beginning last weekend in response to Iraqi violations of diplomatic compounds in Kuwait.
According to official statements in various capitals, the diplomats expelled from Baghdad today included 3 Americans, 3 Britons, 2 West Germans, 5 Italians, 2 Spaniards and 11 French embassy personnel. They were given between a week to 10 days to leave. [In Washington, the State Department said that in retaliation it was expelling three Iraqi diplomats in addition to those expelled earlier.] British Diplomats Restricted The Baghdad authorities also announced new restrictions on the remaining 22 British Embassy personnel, saying they would be required from now on to give a week's notice if they sought to travel more than 25 miles from the Iraqi capital.
A Government spokesman here said that three Egyptian diplomats had also been ordered out of Iraq, coinciding with Egypt's continued deployment of troops in support of the more than 150,000 American soldiers in Saudi Arabia. The spokesman said that in response Egypt was expelling the Iraqi military attache and two senior diplomats from Baghdad's embassy in Cairo.
A Government spokesman in Paris called the expulsions by Iraq today ''a new escalation'' of the crisis.
While the precise number of Egyptian soldiers heading for Saudi Arabia remains unclear, military officials and Western diplomats here say the deployment involves two divisions totaling more than 20,000 troops backed by 300 M-60 tanks, artillery weapons, armored personnel carriers and air defense systems. The force is being transported through the Saudi Red Sea port of Yanbu.
In an Arab world deeply divided by the American military presence in the region, Egypt has been a leading force in supporting the moves by the United States, a close ally that provides Cairo with $2.3 billion a year in economic and military aid.
 
Hussein on TV, Unsmiling
As the diplomatic isolation around President Hussein deepened, the Iraqi leader appeared on Baghdad television early today unsmiling and in military uniform after a meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council and his Baath Party, an organization that provides one sinew of Mr. Hussein's highly personalized control of the country.
In a show of defiance of the American campaign and of new international efforts to extend the embargo against Iraq and Kuwait to air traffic, a statement read by an announcer over Iraqi television and radio and monitored here said, ''Everybody must realize that this battle will be the mother of all battles, and that God wanted us to wage the battle of liberating the nation and humanity, the battle of liberating Jerusalem and the holy shrines on the land of Iraq.''
It added, ''There is not a single chance for any retreat, for any retreat from waging the battle according to principles of honor and deep faith and determination to achieve victory.''
The statement raised new doubts about the fortunes of an initiative by embattled King Hussein of Jordan -an ally of Iraq - to promote what the monarch terms an Arab solution to the crisis. Under his proposal, an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait would be linked to a United States withdrawal from the region.
 
'A Great Honor' to Do Battle
''We here in the Iraq of the Arabs and Muslims have irrevocably decided to lead this faithful host on the land of Iraq until the honorable result of God's victory,'' the Iraqi statement said. ''It is a great honor for us and we thank the one and only God for it.''
''There is no hesitating or changing goals or the path between starting confrontation and victory,'' it declared.The Council criticized the international embargo and the projected ban on civilian flights to Iraq as an attempt ''to throw the Iraqi people into prison.''
It reserved particular scorn for President Bush, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. ''What dwarfs they are,'' it said of Iraq's enemies. ''May they, most of all Bush and his servants Fahd and Hosni, be accursed.''
The newest statement from Baghdad seemed to escalate its verbal threats. On Thursday, in an interview published in Turkey, President Hussein declared that his country would not grovel before the United States. ''If need be, we will fight for three, four or five or six more years,'' he said. His Information Minister, Latif Nassif Jassem, said that, if attacked, Iraq would ''destroy all oilfields in the region.''
 
U.S. Expels 3 Iraqis
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 (Special to the New York Times) The United States retaliated against Baghdad's expulsions by expelling three Iraqi diplomats from Washington.
The State Department's spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said that one of the expelled Iraqis was the military attache, to match the position of one of the ousted Americans, and that the expulsions brought the size of the Iraqi Embassy here down to 15 people.
As was the case with the American diplomats ordered out of Baghdad, the Iraqis were given a week to depart.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
In Jordan, Saddam Hussein Is 'King'

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 21

 BODY:
First, the masked men on the roof burned Israel's Star of David flag, and the crowd cheered. Then it was the turn of the Stars and Stripes, and the crowd cheered louder. Finally, it was the turn of the Soviet Union's hammer and sickle banner, and the cheers rolled on.
When thousands of Palestinians gathered on a dusty patch of ground here today for a rally in support of Saddam Hussein, the flag-burning provided a climax to two hours of impassioned speechmaking. The hero of the evening, as he has been at many such rallies in Jordan since Iraq invaded Kuwait, was the leader of the Baghdad Government. Mr. Hussein's portraits were sold at stalls and his face looked out from badges on scores of lapels. 
 
Over 50% Palestinian
Here, in a country where more than 50 percent of the 3.5 million people are Palestinians, nearly 900,000 of them classed as refugees by the United Nations, the jeers are not for those who set off a crisis by driving their tanks into Kuwait, forcing at least 500,000 Arabs to pass through here as refugees on their way home to Egypt and other countries. The names that arouse the greatest ire are George Bush, Margaret Thatcher and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, for the military buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for offering it his political backing.
''We like Saddam very much because he returns glory to the Arabs,'' said Nidal Rahwy, a 26-year-old clothing salesman whose family came here as refugees from the 1948 war that led to the establishment of Israel. As a crowd of youths pressed around, he added: ''All people look at Saddam Hussein as a hero. They look to him to liberate Palestine.''
But the most powerful resonance for the cries of ''Saddam! Saddam!'' that rose from the thousands who jostled for vantage points during the speeches was probably a few miles away across Amman's rolling hills, in a sandstone palace scented with blossoms of jasmine and bougainvillea.
King Hussein of Jordan returned here on Thursday from the latest round of the shuttle diplomacy he has attempted from the outset of the Kuwait crisis, this time from an apparently abortive effort, during discussions in Morocco with King Hassan II, to arrange a meeting between Saddam Hussein and King Fahd. Instead of Saudi Arabia's gratitude for seeking an ''Arab solution,'' the King received a shock: Earlier on Thursday, Saudi Arabia abruptly shut down the pipeline that provided Jordan with nearly 50 percent of its oil.
 
Anger Primed at Meeting
Apparently, Saudi anger had been primed by a meeting of Arab nationalists here last weekend that turned into a forum for radical Palestinian leaders and virulent attacks on the United States and Saudi Arabia.
That meeting, like King Hussein's diplomacy, reflected the delicate balancing act that the Jordanian monarch has attempted. With Jordan's economy deeply dependent on trade with Iraq, and with its populace enthusisastic for Saddam Hussein, the King has sought to play the conciliator. At virtually every turn, he has been rebuffed.
To outsiders puzzled by the King's persistence, diplomats here have a simple response: Go out into the streets. There, as at today's rally, the fragility of King Hussein's position is immediately apparent.
In grocery store windows, on the porches of private homes, on the mirrors in the barber shops, hang portraits of Saddam Hussein. Sometimes, the posters show the Iraqi leader with King Hussein, with the two men, smiling, handling a rifle. The body language of the portraits alone seems to suggest which of the two neighboring rulers is the more powerful.
 
The King's Frustrations
While the enthusiasm for Saddam Hussein is strongest among the Palestinians, it is widespread among native Jordanians, too.
The frustrations of the King's position - seeking to save Jordan from further pounding in a war, hoping to shore up his throne, his diplomacy rejected and even derided in Baghdad, Washington and London - was expressed by Crown Prince Hassan. Before a breakfast served in part by a retainer in the uniform of Jordan's desert police, with a red-and-white-checkered keffiyeh on his head, bandoliers across his chest and a silver dagger at his waist, the Prince expressed Jordan's exasperation.
''The meek will inherit the earth,'' he said. ''But for goodness sake, just how meek must they be?''

HEADLINE: Defenders and Detractors View Banks' New Powers

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Bank regulators and Bush Administration officials said today that the Federal Reserve's decision to further relax restrictions that had prevented commercial banks from trading corporate securities would probably not lead to the speculative stock trading and underwriting problems that caused the ban to be written into the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.
But some members of Congress argued that the central bank's action needlessly put bank depositors and the industry at risk at a time when banks were already strained.
Regulators say that the Federal Reserve's decision Thursday permitting J. P. Morgan & Company to underwrite and trade securities does not endanger depositors because regulations make it difficult for the securities arms of bank holding companies to make use of the Government-insured deposits held by the affiliated bank unit. The securities affiliates must operate with separate management and capital to protect the rest of the bank from the risks of stock trading. 
 
Statement From Seidman
''It's appropriate to have commercial banks trading securities as long as they are done by carefully segregated units,'' said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, one of nearly half a dozen agencies that have authority over commercial banks.
But critics said the decision was unwise now because it could further strain the commercial banking industry, where profits are in a slump. They point out that the Government fund that insures bank deposits is already under stress from several bank failures largely caused by bad real estate loans.
''Clearly, the authority to deal in equity securities introduces a new element of risk for institutions insured by the Federal Treasury and the taxpayers,'' said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee. ''It is irresponsible for the Federal Reserve - under any rationale - to willy-nilly add massive new risks to the banking system at a time when the taxpayer-supported insurance fund is strained to the limit.''
John C. Coffee Jr., a professor of securities law at Columbia University, questioned whether the institutional barriers separating the banking and securities units would be adequate.
Such walls ''have proven to be porous in other situations, such as insider trading, and they could potentially be porous here,'' he said.
At the very least, banking and securities affiliates of the same holding company are expected to share customer lists and other information.
 
Savings Bailout Is Cited
Other critics drew parallels to the Federal Reserve's decision in the 1980's to deregulate the savings and loan industry. Many experts say deregulation is a prime reason that the savings industry is now being rescued in the costliest Federal bailout in history.
''In the midst of the savings and loan crisis, I'm highly skeptical that this is the best time to proceed with doing away with Glass-Steagall,'' Professor Seligman said. The Bush Administration has not directly called for the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, although it is in the midst of a broad study of the nation's financial system that is widely expected to call for changes in the law.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has long argued that Glass-Steagall's distinctions between commercial and investment banks should be abandoned.
''We still strongly advocate such repeal because we believe that technology and globalization have continued to blur the distinctions among credit markets,'' Mr. Greenspan said at a Congressional hearing last week. ''Outdated constraints will only endanger the profitability of banking organizations and their contribution to the American economy.''
 
Questions of Jurisdiction
Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission said today that they would have jurisdiction over the securities arms of bank holding companies, while the Federal Reserve continues to oversee both the affiliates and the banking units.
Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, said that many of the questions of jurisdiction had been worked out last year when the Federal Reserve took the first step toward relaxing Glass-Steagall by allowing banks to underwrite corporate bonds.

HEADLINE: Brokers Play Down New Threat

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Securities industry executives said yesterday that J. P. Morgan & Company's newly granted ability to underwrite stocks was not much of a near-term threat. But, they said, it could lead to fundamental changes in their industry and bring new riskiness into the nation's banking system if other banks get similar authority. And Wall Street plans to take these concerns to Washington.
''Congress will find this, frankly, shocking,'' said Robert N. Downey, chairman of the Securities Industry Association, Wall Street's trade group. ''It's adding a new element of risk into institutions that are insured by the taxpayers, and in the past that has gotten them into trouble.'' 
The association's main concern, Mr. Downey said, is whether sufficient ''fire walls'' can be erected between the deposit-taking functions of commercial banks and underwriting activities.
 
Concern About Weak Walls
''I don't mind competing with Morgan bank if the fire walls are high enough,'' he said. ''But my concern is that the Fed is talking about weakening the fire walls at a time when they are more important than ever, given the experience of the savings and loan industry and all the banks that are now in difficulty''
On Wall Street, industry leaders said they did not fear a loss of business from having Morgan underwrite securities - acting as a middleman between a corporation that wants to sell stock and the public that wants to buy it.
They note that the Federal Reserve, in granting the authority to Morgan on Thursday, imposed restrictions that will severely limit the bank's securities role. For instance, Morgan cannot derive more than 10 percent of its underwriting revenues from offering equities and certain debt securities; the rest must come from underwriting Treasury debt.
 
'Let the Best Man Win'
''It doesn't mean a major thing as far as we are concerned,'' said James E. Cayne, president of Bear, Stearns & Company. ''We don't look at this as awesome or earthshaking or anything other than having one new competitor. Let the best man win.''
Robert E. Rubin, co-vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, said: ''We've always run our business to be as effective as possible. We're just going to keep doing that.''
The Fed's decision comes when Wall Street's corporate underwritings have fallen sharply as the economy has weakened, stock prices have dropped and fewer American companies are issuing new stock. The banking decision is still another problem for an industry that has been retrenching as lucrative lines of business like arranging mergers and leveraged buyouts have all but dried up.
Underwriting corporate securities is one of the few businesses on Wall Street in which price competition has remained minimal. By contrast, profit margins from trading securities have been pushed down drastically as large institutional investors continually bargain for better deals on their transaction costs. The fear is that with the commercial banks allowed to compete for underwriting business, margins there will shrink as well.
''Clearly, this is a long-term negative for the industry,'' said Michael Goldstein, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''It brings more competition to a highly competitive industry.''
 
'Long-Term Implications'
John S. Chalsty, chairman of the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, said that while the Fed's decision is a ''moderate non-event'' at the moment, ''obviously it has long-term implications'' and ''changes the structure of the securities business.''
For that reason, some on Wall Street say there is a need for fuller discussion in Washington of the Fed's action, along with any other changes in the Glass-Steagall Act, which was enacted in 1933 and separates commercial banking and investment banking.
Some in the securities industry contend that Wall Street should now be given more banking powers.
''This is another example of the banks getting increased powers without the securities industry getting anything,'' said Donald B. Marron, chief executive of Paine Webber Inc. ''Nowhere in these discussions is the sense that if banks get securities powers, the securities industry gets bank powers. And that seems to be the heart of the issue right now. We are replacing Glass-Steagall by small pieces and with no formal process, and I don't think that's the best way to do it.''
John L. Steffens, chief executive of Merrill Lynch & Company's consumer markets group, said that the Fed had, in effect, pre-empted Congress. ''The issue ends up to be whether or not Congress is happy with being out of the loop in making determinations about the financial-services industry,'' he said. ''There are implications in modifying the regulations without thinking through the overall ramifications.
''And I don't think regulatory dismantlement should take place without some legislative action,'' Mr. Steffens added.

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Prices Rise Sharply

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Crude oil prices climbed sharply yesterday, following big jumps for both heating oil and gasoline.
Traders said a flurry of buying on Thursday afternoon carried over into early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, while concerns remained high about the tense Persian Gulf situation.
Oil for delivery in November settled at $35.43, the first time that oil has sold for more than $35 a barrel since the start of trading in oil futures on the mercantile exchange in 1983. The close was $2.01 higher than the November settlement on Thursday, when the October contract expired with a rally in the closing minutes of trading. That contract ended at $34.71, up $1.53 a barrel from Wednesday's close, and the enthusiasm spilled over into yesterday's trading. 
 
Rush to Buy Contracts
Rising prices for crude oil yesterday were driven by sharper increases for gasoline and heating oil, said Robert S. Jonke, an energy futures trader at Cargill Investor Services. When the price of a barrel of gasoline and heating oil yesterday morning rose well above the cost of buying a barrel of oil and refining it, traders rushed to buy oil contracts, he added.
The price of heating oil for October delivery ended the day up by 5.35 cents, at 97.21 cents a gallon. That capped a series of large increases during the week that could mean higher bills for homeowners this winter. For the week, October heating oil was up 14.42 cents a gallon, or 17.4 percent.
Gasoline for October delivery rose 5.91 cents a gallon, to 97.45 cents, The October contracts for oil products do not expire until next Friday.
 
Anger and Investigations
If heating oil prices stay near $1 a gallon, a homeowner who has spent $1,000 a winter on oil in recent years could end up spending $1,400 to $1,500 this winter, said a New York heating oil executive who insisted that he not be identified. The result would be angry consumers and possible government investigations, he added. But prices would likely fall, he said, if war did not break out in the Middle East.
The price of heating oil usually overtakes the price of gasoline in the autumn, although the increase is usually spread out over the October and November contracts, said Thomas G. Burns, the manager of the economics staff at the San Francisco-based Chevron Corporation. This week's increase in heating oil prices ''is just a faster-than-normal movement toward that happening,'' he added.
October gasoline was up 7.09 cents a gallon during the week, or 7.8 percent, while November oil climbed by $4.27 a barrel, or 13.7 percent, to its highest level in nine years.
Heating oil stocks are fairly high in the United States, and the lack of additional storage capacity has tended to prevent companies and individuals from accumulating large stockpiles to use for speculative purposes. But the availability of extra storage in Europe has sent prices higher there and prompted some eastbound trans-Atlantic shipments of oil, pulling up prices in the United States this week, the New York heating oil executive said.
 
'Flows Toward Highest Price'
Such international movements of oil are common, and some heating oil was shipped from Europe to the United States last winter, when American prices were higher. ''Oil is international, and flows toward the highest price,'' the New York executive added.
Virginia Wiater, an energy futures broker for United Energy Inc., a New York trading company, said oil and oil product markets remained preoccupied with how high prices might rise if a Mideast war broke out and many oilfields were destroyed. ''People feel at any moment the top may be blown off,'' she added.
Traders are particularly nervous about repeated hawkish statements by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and one of his ministers, Ms. Wiater said. The Iraqi leaders have threatened to fight a war with the United States lasting for years, and to destroy all Persian Gulf oilfields during such a war.
Some traders expressed particular alarm about a World Bank estimate this week that oil prices could rise to $65 a barrel if fighting started.
 
Disagreement on Contracts
Some market participants have contended that at least part of the recent run-up in crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange has reflected the type of futures contracts traded there. But experts disagree on the effect.
The contracts are for light, sweet crude, which consists of 10 grades of oil that are less dense and have a lower sulfur content than other grades, making them easier to refine.
Iraq and Kuwait exported mostly light, sweet crude before the imposition of a United Nations trade embargo on Aug. 6, four days after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Other countries are producing mostly heavy, sour oil to make up for the shortfall, and some refineries are poorly equipped to handle this lower-quality oil.
Ms. Wiater said a shortage of light, sweet crude was driving up prices. ''People are now beginning to see that, short term, we're going to have a problem,'' she said.
 
Drop in Premium Cited
But John H. Kingston, the managing editor of Platt's Oilgram Price Report, a daily New York newsletter, said high-grade oil could not be in especially short supply because the premium for the light, Louisiana sweet grade of oil, compared with the slightly heavier and more sour West Texas intermediate grade, had shrunk dramatically in the spot market over the last week. ''That number is absolutely a dead-on barometer'' of light, sweet crude supplies, he said.
The recent increase in oil prices is based on emotion, not supplies of light, sweet crude, said Peter I. Cardillo, the director of commodities research at Jesup, Josephthal & Company, a New York brokerage. ''As far as fundamentals are concerned, there's no news to account for it,'' he added. ''It's pure speculation based on the Persian Gulf situation.''

Nikolai V. Panteleyev has the unenviable task of creating an accounting profession in a nation unfamiliar with profits and losses, let alone concepts like intangible assets, good will or fair value. He likens the job to teaching people to ''learn Chinese overnight.''
His rapidly changing job, called the director of the Department of Accounting of the Ministry of Finance, is one of the more daunting in the Soviet Government as it lurches toward a market economy, and also one of the most important. For the Soviet economy to attract foreign capital, it will eventually need to adopt internationally acceptable accounting standards. To do that, it will have to create an accounting system virtually from scratch. And it will need to teach the new accountants concepts alien to their whole way of thinking. 
Mr. Panteleyev, the Soviet Union's chief accountant, spent yesterday in New York at the end of a two-week visit to the United States. He managed to squeeze in a Broadway show and dinner in Chinatown. Seeing Western Practices But his primary mission was a firsthand glimpse of Western accounting practices and of the various regulatory and professional bodies that allow the system to work. Mr. Panteleyev, 58 years old, was also looking for ideas in his role as co-chairman of a group trying to develop internationally acceptable accounting standards for the 2,000 ventures that have been set up between Soviet-owned enterprises and Western partners. The expectation is that the rules will someday serve as a blueprint for the rest of the Soviet economy.
He acknowledges that it will be difficult for citizens of his country to grasp fundamental business concepts. But ''life will make them learn,'' he said through an interpreter. ''We have been experimenting for 70 years, and our people are used to changes.''
The Soviet system, or what exists of it, is far less organized than that of the United States, a country that has one licensed accountant for every 835 people, or that of England, the country that invented modern accounting, where there is one accountant for every 500 people.
Mr. Panteleyev said the Soviet Union had about 300,000 accountants - in other words, one for every 970 people. But American accountants said those professionals are actually more comparable to controllers in this country, because they are unlicensed and because they are more concerned with central planning than with the proper calculation of a company's profits or adherence to generally accepted accounting principles.
 
No Terms Exist
Nor can the Russian language always capture concepts that the Soviet people are now only beginning to learn. ''The terms just don't exist,'' said Richard Lewis, an accountant in Ernst & Young's Moscow office. ''Yesterday, we were trying to discuss inventory valuation, and were able to make ourselves understood when we discussed the weighted-average cost method.
''But when we went to talk about FIFO and LIFO,'' he continued, referring to the first-in, first-out and last-in, first-out systems of inventory accounting, ''you have to go into lengthy explanations of what they are.''
In some cases, the Soviets have simply adapted English words - like ''good will,'' or they dust off long forgotten words from academic literature, like the word for ''dividend.''
In other cases, like ''intangible assets,'' the words defy translation.
M. Zubaidur Rahman, an accounting professor at the State University of New York in Plattsburgh who along with Ernst & Young was Mr. Panteleyev's host, tried to describe the expression ''fair value'' by coining an improvised Russian term that translates to ''red price,'' because ''red'' generally connotes something desirable in Russian. But the usage did not catch on. Slow Progress While the going may be slow, the Soviet Union has been making progress under Mr. Panteleyev. In the last three months, Western accounting firms have been allowed to compete for the first time against Inaudit, a Soviet group that was the only entity permitted to audit the books of the East-West ventures.
Mr. Panteleyev said he was committed to starting a self-supporting professional institute, along the lines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in New York, as early as next year. The group would be expected to license accountants and create professional standards.
And he has made some headway on his goal to overhaul the rules for joint ventures. In June, the Ministry of Finance issued new rules calling for the ventures to begin accounting for their revenues on an accrual basis, which means when the money is thought to be earned, rather than when the enterprise receives the cash. The hitch: the rule has yet to be applied to expense items.
Mr. Panteleyev intends to tap the growing number of Soviet students who would otherwise have become central planners, urging them to consider accounting careers instead.
''Because the centralized planning system is being eliminated, the universities are reducing the amount of students who study in that field,'' he said, talking like an entrepreneur who is confident that supply and demand will solve his shortage. ''Because of that, we will increase the number of students studying accounting. It will just resolve itself.''
Even though market forces are in his favor, recruiting people will not be a cinch in a country where accountants have a public image that is worse than in this country.
''Unfortunately, the accounting profession is not considered prestigious,'' Mr. Panteleyev said. ''Most of the accountants are women,'' he added, noting that Soviet women have fewer career choices than men.
 
At Ministry 12 Years
Mr. Panteleyev earned a diploma as a teacher of accounting sciences from the Leningrad Financial Institute. He spent five years teaching before becoming the chief financial officer of a Siberian factory. He then accepted a series of Government jobs, joining the Ministry of Finance 12 years ago. He has been in his current post since 1985.
Asked what role American accountants could play in helping the Soviet Union, Mr. Panteleyev cited a Russian saying that revealed he was not entirely uncritical of the United States model. ''As we say in our country,'' he started with a puckish smile, ''those who are drowning should save themselves.''

HEADLINE: Suffolk Chief Offers Layoffs, Not Tax Rise

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., Sept. 21

 BODY:
Faced with a slowing economy and continued resistance to taxes, the Suffolk County Executive today proposed a 1991 budget that would lay off 295 county employees and reduce services but not require an increase in county property taxes.
The proposed $1.3 billion budget, which would begin to shrink the size of government in New York's most populated county outside of New York City, also called for the demotion of 129 county police officers and the elimination of 718 budgeted but vacant positions.
It follows a year in which the Executive, Patrick G. Halpin, said he carried out $60 million in cost-saving measures for the current budget of $1.3 billion that included unpaid voluntary furloughs for county workers, early retirement incentives and cutbacks in overtime, outside contracts, equipment purchases and travel. The budget would bring to 2,573 the number of county positions that have been eliminated since 1988, leaving a work force of 9,915, according to Mr. Halpin's office. 
 
Higher Medicaid Contributions
The earlier steps, Mr. Halpin said today, were not enough to offset the effects of a flattening-out of sales-tax returns that make up about 40 percent of county revenues and an anticipated $45 million increase next year in county contributions to Medicaid and other mandated social-services programs. Mr. Halpin said, for the first time in its history, the county would pay more for programs mandated by the state and Federal governments than for discretionary programs.
The cuts and reductions in the proposed budget were needed, Mr. Halpin said, to close an estimated $103 million gap between expected revenues and the cost of meeting expenses while keeping jobs and services at current levels. He said county property taxes, which account for about 22 percent of revenues and about 17 percent of the total property taxes the average property owner pays, would have to be increased by $195 on the average homeowner's billl to close the gap.
But he said he rejected any tax increase at a time when the county's 1.4 million residents were caught in a declining economic climate and had made clear their insistence that county taxes be frozen at current levels.
''They don't have to read my lips,'' Mr. Halpin said. ''They just have to read my budget.''
He said the layoffs and demotions could be forestalled if the police and other employees agreed to a week off without pay, deferrals of salary increases or a payroll lag that would eliminate one payday next year.
 
'Blood Bath' Predicted
The budget proposal by Mr. Halpin, who is a Democrat, was immediately attacked by the Republican and Conservative majority in the County Legislature and by the police and the independent union that represents 7,000 county employees. The proposal now goes to the 18-member legislature, where sharp debate and amendments are expected before a final budget is adopted in November.
''It will be two months of a blood bath,'' said Michael D. O'Donohoe, a Conservative county legislator from Northport.
The struggle in Suffolk will be heightened by the Republicans' and Conservatives' efforts to regain the county executive post Mr. Halpin won in 1987. Mr. Halpin's first term ends next year. Similar fiscal pressures are being felt in almost all of the state's 62 counties, said Edwin L. Crawford, the executive director of the New York State Association of Counties in Albany. ''Suffolk is in the limelight because they are out of the box with an early budget,'' he said, ''but it's pretty much the same story all over the state.''
 
Sales-Tax Revenue Slows
Most counties had seen increases in sales tax revenues of about 5 percent annually until about two years ago, Mr. Crawford said, but were now registering no increases or slight declines. In Suffolk, Mr. Halpin said, the increases averaged 11 percent annually from 1980 through 1987. From 1988 to the present, he said, the growth had slowed to 1.6 percent.
Suffolk is one of a handful of New York counties that maintains a county police force, a factor that has added to its budget pressure. With 2,583 officers and a base salary of $47,295 for a patrol officer with five years of experience, the Suffolk Police Department is the 13th-largest and among the best-paid forces in the country, said Bradford W. O'Hearn, a spokesman for Mr. Halpin.
The police district includes the county's populous five western towns and accounts for about two-thirds of county property-tax bills in those towns.
Mr. Halpin said the demotions would streamline the police department and avoid layoffs there. But Police Commissioner Daniel P. Guido has warned that the demotions would be damaging to operations and morale. Michael A. Mahoney, president of the Suffolk County Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said that with the demotions. police morale ''will never be the same.''
Charles Novo Jr., president of the Suffolk County Association of Municipal Employees, said the union would lobby the legislators to restore jobs and positions.
''A lot of the problem is mismanagement by the county executive,'' Mr. Novo said.

HEADLINE: Can Heads Be Counted in a Dynamic City?

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
When New York City officials said the Census Bureau had failed to count hundreds of thousands of housing units in the five boroughs - and, they implied, the people living in them - they were challenging more than the Federal agency's arithmetic.
The sheer number of dwellings that the city contended were skipped, even when adjusted downward for vacancies and mistakes, seemed to underscore the question lawyers have been asking in New York's two-year-old lawsuit against the bureau: how can any agency hope to count the population of so vast, dynamic and complicated a place, nose by nose?
''I don't attribute any particular malice to the way the enumeration is completed,'' said Robert S. Rifkind, one of the lawyers representing the city, which has been joined in the lawsuit by other cities, states, civic and civil rights groups. ''It's just very hard to make it work.'' 
In a way, New York is pursuing two separate but mutually reinforcing strategies as it tries to insure that the Census Bureau, which has acknowledged that it missed 350,000 or so New Yorkers in 1980, does not shortchange the city this time.
Even if it fails to result in the addition of significantly more housing units and people to the bureau's counts, the challenge and the attention it received have doubtless increased the pressure on the bureau to adjust its final count using a separate, post-count survey that is the focus of the lawsuit.
In its formal challenge, issued Wednesday after the census housing counts were compared with records from city agencies and utility companies, the city's Planning Department was engaging the bureau on its own statistical turf.
Even the seemingly suspect precision with which the department reported its analysis - it said exactly 254,534 residences were missed - matched the seemingly suspect precision with which the bureau, in a preliminary estimate released in August, put the city's population at precisely 7,033,179. John J. Connolly, an assistant to the Census Bureau Director, Dr. Barbara Everitt Bryant, said there were many ways in which the agency double- and triple-checks its numbers. There are follow-up visits to housing units where residents did not send in forms or mailed back incomplete ones and field inspections of addresses declared vacant or listed as having only one occupant, a danger signal that a ''curbstoning'' census worker may not have taken the trouble to look inside.
People who have not yet cooperated with the Census Bureau can call by Sept. 30 and be recorded over the phone, Mr. Connolly said. And, of course, there is local review, the process in which the city's challenge will be considered.
 
Adjustments Debated
Census officials say they believe that many of the housing units the city said were missing were merely ''mi sallocated'' - recorded in the wrong place - and that residents of those units that the city claims were overlooked are already in the population count, while perhaps 40,000 other units are vacant.
This part of the city's strategy seems likely to result in an increase to the city's population total, but not by so much as the city would like. Peter L. Zimroth, New York City's former Corporation Counsel and who is counsel on the census case with Mr. Rifkind, calls the bureau's corrective efforts ''mop-up procedures'' that are ''inadequate to the task'' and even ''counterproductive, because they lead to lots of errors.''
He and Mr. Rifkind are seeking to have the agency make an altogether different kind of adjustment to its figures based on a separate, post-enumeration survey that is at the heart of the plaintiffs' strategy.
In this survey, the initial field work for which was completed in August, more than 400,000 people around the country were interviewed in 164,000 housing units on census blocks selected to reflect the diverse demography of the United States. Interviewers traveled around each block, listing every housing unit - including ones that the original enumeration did not get - and asking residents their name, address, age, sex, race, relation to the head of the household, whether they own or rent their home and where they lived on April 1, the census day.
 
U.S. Government Will Decide
By comparing the results of the post-enumeration survey to those of the census, the bureau can see who was counted correctly, who was counted incorrectly and who was not counted at all. Then, through extrapolation, the final census tally could be adjusted to allow for the undercount - if the Government decides to do so.
Such extrapolation is used by astronomers to count the stars, by accountants to count corporate profits and by clerks to count cereal boxes on the supermarket shelves.
The Regional Plan Association, a private research organization which has tracked the economy and demography of the region for more than 60 years, has called on the Commerce Department to use the post-enumeration survey to adjust what it believes is an undercount of 600,000 residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in the bureau preliminary estimates.
But convincing the Government to use such an adjustment in determining the apportionment of the nation's Congressional districts and the states' legislative districts and the allocation of billions of dollars in Federal aid is proving difficult.
In 1980, in response to lawsuits seeking the same sort of adjustment, the bureau's staff argued that it did not have enough data to make a valid correction. And in guidelines that were issued as part of an agreement in the New York City lawsuit, the Commerce Department, the Census Bureau's parent, reserved the right to decide not to use the survey to adjust the count if the Commerce secretary sees a ''potential disruption of the process of the orderly transfer of political representation.'' While there is no language in the Constitution that deals explicitly with the question of how the population must be counted - it calls only for an ''enumeration'' of the ''whole number of free persons'' - there is a sharp debate over the constitutionality of such an adjustment.
Still, the scope of the city's challenge may make a post-count correction seem more pallatable, if only by emphasizing how far apart two government entities can be.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
For Cuomo, Albany Road Runs Past Washington

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 21

 BODY:
While campaigning for a third term as Governor, Mario M. Cuomo has been doing many of the things that statewide candidates traditionally do. He has worked crowds at upstate fairs, has debated commuters in Times Square and has broadcast upbeat commercials about the state's good works.
But in the most significant speeches he has delivered since receiving the Democratic nomination in June, Mr. Cuomo has taken the unconventional approach of focusing his attacks not on his opponent, Pierre A. Rinfret, but on the Republican domestic policies of the Bush and Reagan Administrations. For Mr. Cuomo, it sometimes seems, all politics is national. 
While it has never been unusual for Mr. Cuomo to mount scattershot assaults on Washington, he has assembled his thoughts this summer into a broad and forceful critique. He has argued that the Republicans have improperly ceded the fiscal obligation for national problems to the states and in the process have made the country's tax structure more regressive.
By stressing national themes in a gubernatorial campaign, Mr. Cuomo has also knowingly encouraged musing by political observers about his status as a potential Presidential candidate. After Mr. Cuomo made his case against the Republicans in a speech to a politically influential crowd at Harvard last week, the audience was consumed with conjecture about whether the Governor was laying thematic groundwork for a 1992 Presidential campaign.
 
Don't Mind the Speculation
That may or may not be the case. Other than refusing to promise to serve a full four-year term if he is re-elected in November, Mr. Cuomo has sent few signals that he is considering a run for the White House.
But what is clear is that Mr. Cuomo understands from his experience four years ago, when he first flirted with a Presidential race, that the speculation engendered by his speeches has the beneficial side-effect of bolstering his political stature.
''I don't mind you people speculating,'' he said in a recent interview. ''It's probably good for me.''
Mr. Cuomo could, of course, put an end to the speculation by declaring that he will not be a Presidential candidate in 1992. But that might reduce him to being just another governor and, at that, the governor of a state with severe fiscal problems and a mind-boggling array of social crises.
By using his speeches to denounce the Federal Government, Mr. Cuomo seeks to shift blame for those crises from Albany to Washington. And whether or not he plans to run for President, the notion that Mr. Cuomo is of Presidential caliber may buffer him somewhat from hostile public opinion generated by the state's failings.
A poll taken by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion on Sept. 10 and 11 showed that 56 percent of the 821 registered voters questioned thought that the state was headed in the wrong direction but that 65 percent had a favorable impression of Mr. Cuomo. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
By choosing to give his speeches at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, at the State Democratic Convention in June and at a national judicial conference in August, the Governor selected audiences that included national opinion-makers, party leaders and political reporters. He was concerned enough about last week's speech to have a favorite lectern, which was two inches taller than a lectern availailable at Harvard, shipped to Cambridge by Federal Express.
The essence of Mr. Cuomo's case is that Republican domestic policy in the 1980's, known as the New Federalism, reduced income taxes for the wealthy while transferring responsibility for national problems like drugs, homelessness, education and a decaying infrastructure to the states.
 
Attacking the New Federalism
''The nation can no more leave it to the individual states to fight these national problems than it can expect the states' valiant militias and National Guard units to fight and win a war in the Middle East without the Federal Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force -and Treasury,'' he said at Harvard.
In realigning the roles of government, Mr. Cuomo argues, Washington has also shifted a heavy tax burden to the states. And because the states are in economic competition with each other, they have chosen to raise taxes that are least likely to push businesses across the border, he says.
In a variety of states, including New York, those taxes have predominantly been regressive ones like sales, excise and real-estate taxes, which are levied at the same rate regardless of income, rather than progressive ones like the income tax.
By explaining the cause and effect relationship between the New Federalism and a regressive tax structure, Mr. Cuomo is able to illustrate the impact that Republican policy has had on average Americans, not just on cash-strapped governors.
 
'A Rock Star Quality'
Experts on Federal fiscal policy, like Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist, said they will not be rewriting text books based on Mr. Cuomo's economic analysis. But they said the power of Mr. Cuomo's speeches have given new definition to a previously unfocused debate.
''The reception after his speech here had a rock star quality,'' Mr. Summers said. ''There was more thronging to shake his hand than you usually see at a university.''
Because he is the governor of the country's second-largest state and because he attracts more national attention than other governors, Mr. Cuomo says, he has an obligation to speak out against Federal policies that affect his and other states.
''I am not interested in criticizing the President,'' Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. ''I am interested in doing my job as Governor, and I have said we have an umbilical connection with the Federal Government.''
To prove his point, Mr. Cuomo's staff recently compiled a two-page compendium of nice things that he has said about President Bush. The Strongest Case? Mr. Cuomo said that in the past he has been reluctant to take his crusade against the New Federalism on the road because of fears that news organizations would view his comments as posturing for a Presidential race.
''Now I have abandoned all concern about how what I do gets interpreted because I've discovered you can't affect it,'' he said. ''The press will write what they want to write, whatever they believe. It's a better story to some of them.''
But the Governor might have had some idea that his speech at Harvard, where he spoke to a crowd filled with refugees from Michael S. Dukakis's Presidential campaign, would set off a new round of speculation.
No less an authority than Paul G. Kirk, the immediate past chairman of the Democratic National Committee, listened to Mr. Cuomo and surmised: ''My guess is that the Governor may be asking the question, without actually asking it, 'Who among the potential candidates could make a stronger case?' ''

LOOKING FOR A SHIP.
By John McPhee.
242 pp. New York:
Parrar, Straus & Giroux. $ 18.95.

When John McPhee explains in his characteristically lucid way the difference between ullage and innage, the subtleties of the Plimsoil mark, and the length of a Trident-class submarine, and the manner of a Fathometer tracing the contour of the sea bottom, it is hard not to think of him as ''Doc,'' the plain-spoken polymath, the voice of experience. Doc is methodical and thorough, even to the point of being a teeny bit ponderous. While the rest of us are generalizing like mad and cracking feeble jokes, Doc is simply nodding and taking notes. He has the sort of patience that makes people nervous, and an almost exasperating sanity.
 In ''Looking for a Ship,' an account of his voyage with the United States merchant marine, Doc doesn't get rattled when pirates board at Guayaquil. Doc understands the anxiety of seamen eager to be employed. ''If his neurons seemed hyperactive, they had some reason to be'' -- and isn't it just like Doc to put it like that? When a storm blows the ship sideways, Doc doesn't say exactly how he felt, but rather enumerates things that fell onto the deck -- the alarm clock and all the rest of his clobber. In Chile, Doc reads Charles Darwin. En route he reads Nathaniel Bowditch, the father of modern navigation and author of the basic text, and takes pulses. He knows the age of everyone on board. He is patient -- no record here of his losing his temper; and he is restrained -- only eight obscenities, all told, in this account of sailors. (I find Doc's habit of enumerating to be infections.) When the ship is moored in the steamy Colombian port of Buenaventura, another man might have gone boozing and roistering in the waterfront dives with the crew -- I certainly would have siezed the chance to watch this bunch of level-headed sailors lose their marbles -- but Doc heads for the hills: ''We wanted to see the jungle rising to the Cordillera Occidental.'' Typical!!
 Good-hearted, frugal, truthful, fluent, decent and humane, John McPhee is Doc to his fingertips. In the past, I have trusted him on tennis champs, on geology, physics, Alaska, camping, the construction of the birch-bark canoe and a score of other subjects. In an interview in a recent issue of Sierra, the magazine of the Sierra club, Mr. McPhee was reported as saying, ''My next book could be about a ketchup manufacturer...My next book could be about anything.'' As it happens, this, his next book, is about the sorry state of our merchant marine. Why shouldn't I trust him on that subject too? 
 If Mr. McPhee sayd the Peru-Chile trench is steep and the continental shelf is extremely narrow, I believe it. If he reports an exasperated man is saying, ''Another day in the life of Walter Mitty. Heavens to Murgatroyd, we're stuck in the lock,'' I believe that Mr. McPhee reported it correctly. When a man says, unchallenged, ''Five more years, there won't be no more Merchant Marine. It's going down the guts,'' you have to take it more or less as written -- this is the last gasp of the merchant marine. Mr. McPhee allows himself to be fanciful only now and then. Now is his reference to the fact that his Spanish is purely functional and his grammar ''tartare''; then is a passage beside which I have marked ''joke'' in the margin of my copy --I found no others. The sentence read as follows: ''The author Alex Haley is noted for riding on merchant ships as a way of isolating himself from distinctions and forcing himself to write. He could write a book called 'Routes'.''
 Surrendering to his subject while remaining somewhat obscure himself, a technique that he has just about perfected, Mr. McPhee follows the progress of a man named Andy Chase who is looking for a ship to work on. After quite a lot of hullabaloo, Andy lands himself a berth on the Stella Lykes, bound for the west cosast of South America. Mr. McPhee also boards but as a paying passenger, and he ranges over the ship reporting on the moods and experiences of the rest of the crew. It emerges that Andy is the great-great-great-grandson of Nathaniel Bowditch. But even this cannot make him colorful enough to occupy the center of the book, and he is nudged aside in favor of Capt. Paul McHenry Washburn, the Stella Lykes's skipper, who is both a brilliant captain and a self-made eccentric on a heroic scale.
 A poor student, a runaway, a circus performer (he walked on glass and did fakir tricks) and an amateur boxer, Captain Washburn, earned his master's certificate the hard way, under the tutelages of skippers such as Dirty Shirt George Price and Terrible Terry Harmon. Here is Terrible Terry in a storm: ''Do you know how to pray? Then try that. That's the only thing that's going to save us now.'' Captain Washburn has made a delightful gift for the non sequitor. He understands Columbus and is sympathetic. ''(Columbus) did not produce, and that was the bottom line. He was a maverick, an adventurer; he was not a follower of the party line. Come to think of it -- not to compare myself with Columbus -- some of those adjectives kind of fit me.'' Mr. McPhee obviously agrees, and a few pages later quotes rather a nice Washburnism (the captain speaking from the bridge) ''I would rather be here for the worst that could be here than over there (on land) for the best that could be there.''
 I would be happy to read a whole book about Captain Washburn and cannot think of a better man than Mr. McPhee to write it. Unfortunately, the captain is somewhat incidental to Mr. McPhee's purpose in describing the state of the merchant marine, he writes about the ill-assorted cargo, about stowaways, piracy and flags of convenience. It is all wonderfully set out, but Mr. McPhee makes it clear that the boat and its crew will soon be museum pieces.
 ''Russia is going to have five thousand merchant ships in ten years,'' the captain says, ''And we are going to have none.'' A crewman says, ''We can't compete with countries that pay sailors one dollar a day and feed them fish heads and rice.'' The enjoyment of reading this book is dampened by its lugubrious message: these people are more endangered as a species than the whales and green sea turtles they are among.
 Mr. McPhee is often praised for his economy of phrase and description. Certainly there is a patented McPhee similie, unusual and animal (and it probably helps to be wearing L.L. Bean clothes when you're reading it, like the men ''who fanned out around the office door like fish at the mouth of a tributary stream,'' or the ship that had its end open ''like the mouth of a sucker,'' or ''bick backhoes that look like thunder lizards.'' This is writing that might send some readers searching for an illustrated volume of natural history. There is no question that Mr. McPhee knows what he is talking abouot, but beyond that there can be few writers today -- I think Edward Hoagland and Peter Matthiessen are two exceptions -- who would use the phrase ''graceful as an allligator'' with the certainty that they had hit the nail on the head.
 Ecoomy is a virtue in magazine writing. In a book it can seem like meagerness and insufficiency. These chapters all appeared as articles in The New Yorker. What is it about that magazine? It seems to do with ink and paper what morticians do with formaldehyde. When New Yorker articles and short stories are reprinted in book form I always get a sniff of the clean inky smell of the magazine and can sense its smooth paper, and I hold the book differently, as though I were afraid I would be gouged by a loose staple. Mr. McPhee's writing -- and John Updike's and the writing of so many of us (I speak as a sometime contributor) -- is very often whiffy in this way. This is not a recent phenomenon. The writing of Dickens, Henry James and Conan Doyle also has a fusty, magazine aroma, which is like an unsmoothable wrinkle on a book page. Am I alone in having noticed this, with my exquisite sense of smell?
 I would have preferred ''Looking for a Ship'' to sprawl more; I could have had more of the captain and more of the crew -- Mr. McPhee visited them at home but gives us only the merest glimpses of their family lives. That business about Mr. McPhee's looking at the snowcapped peaks while the crew was drinking and misbehaving and -- who knows? -- using the Christian Science Reading Room; had he concieved this piece as a book, I think he would have seen the necessity of including such boisterous scenes. What looks like prudence and humility could be journalistic economy. Mr. McPhee has written thumping big books, and he has reprinted shorter articles between covers. This is an example of the latter. I wanted more. That might sound like criticism. I mean it as praise. 
COOLING OFF IN THE TROPICS
 All through the summer, everybody in New York and its perisphere had been living in the sort of climate that seals the skin and pops veins in the head: They waded in humidity...By comparison with New York, Panama was cool. The canal, creeping through the forest, was cool. The evening we left Panama, the temperature in the North Pacific was in the seventies. The weather was almost unnerving. As soon as (we) crossed the equator, you heard people say, ''It's winter now'' -- a technicality that is not persuasive there at the latitude of Borneo...We entered the Gulf of Guayaquil. Just the sound of that name -- Guayaquil -- spelled coffee and chocolate to me, spelled mangoes, bananas, guavas, and heat. At four that afternoon, though, when the temperature in New York City was eighty-nine, the temperature in the Gulf of Guayaqul was seventy-five. I finally understood where the tropics are, why the nights of the iguana are on Forty-Seventh street, and Broadway steams with rain.

HEADLINE: INSURERS REDUCING MALPRACTICE FEES FOR DOCTORS IN U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
After rising sharply for more than a decade, medical malpractice insurance premiums are now declining in many states around the country.
Premiums are showing declines of 5 percent to 35 percent as states have set limits on malpractice lawsuits and as doctors, faced with the possibility of damage claims in the millions of dollars, have apparently become more careful.
Some specialists, like anesthesiologists, have adopted standards of patient care requiring new safeguards, and many doctor-owned insurance companies are holding seminars on avoiding medical malpractice.
The Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company of New York, which is owned by doctors in the state and is the second biggest writer of malpractice insurance in the nation, has just reduced rates by an average of 5 percent.
 
Causes of Decline
''That's the first time our rates have gone down since the company was founded in 1975,'' said Donald J. Fager, vice president of the company. 
Another insurer, the St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, the largest source of malpractice insurance in the United States, is reducing premiums in 22 of the 42 states where it writes policies for doctors. Beth M. Hamel, a spokeswoman for the company, which insures 30,000 doctors, said the cuts ranged from 6 percent to 25 percent.
Consumers could benefit from such reductions if doctors passed along the savings in the form of lower charges or, more likely, smaller increases in fees.
Experts list several reasons for the decline in malpractice premiums. Lawsuits have prompted doctors to act aggressively to prevent injuries, the experts say, and doctors are ordering many more tests in an abundance of caution known as defensive medicine. In addition, some are limiting the number of patients they see or supervise.
 
Increased Monitoring
Such practices appear to be reducing malpractice claims, but they also tend to increase the cost of health care paid by patients' insurers or government programs.
Research by the American Society of Anesthesiologists suggests that the proper use of new monitoring devices, to measure the level of oxygen in the blood, could have prevented death or serious injury in nearly one-third of the cases where anesthesiologists were accused of malpractice. In cases where the injury was deemed preventable, the patient recovered an average of $494,000 by filing a malpractice claim.
Under a standard that took effect this January, the society requires its members to use certain monitoring devices. Many insurers have recognized such efforts by reducing premiums for anesthesiologists.
Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, said 55 percent to 60 percent of doctors in private practice were now insured by doctor-owned companies. The 43 doctor-owned companies generally do not seek to make a profit and use any profits that might be earned to reduce doctors' premiums.
The doctor-owned companies systematically review claims to identify the most frequent causes of lawsuits, like brain damage to infants or the failure to diagnose breast cancer in women, and they teach doctors how to minimize the risk of such errors.
Some of the doctor-owned companies say they have reduced the number of successful claims by showing doctors how to improve ''communication skills,'' how to elicit more information from patients and how to keep better medical records, so they can defend their performance in court. ''A misfiled lab report can be disastrous,'' said Adam P. Wilczek, vice president of the Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange of New Jersey, a doctor-owned company.
 
New State Laws
About half the states have adopted laws limiting the amount or type of damages that can be recovered in malpractice lawsuits. Such laws often restrict damages for pain and suffering. Some states permit arbitration or require the screening of claims by an administrative tribunal before lawsuits can be tried in court.
Some states have also passed laws to penalize patients who file frivolous claims. Taken together, the changes seem to have made lawyers more selective in the cases they file on behalf of patients.
Michael Maher of Orlando, Fla., president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which has 65,000 members, said doctors deserved credit for adopting guidelines and standards to reduce injuries to patients. But he said, ''Doctors are responding to the fact that they are the subject of lawsuits for negligence, and there is a great deal left to be done in encouraging quality care.''
Hospitals, state government agencies and the Federal Government are also making more systematic efforts to identify doctors with a history of malpractice. On Sept. 1, the United States Public Health Service established a national computer file to keep track of doctors who are successfully sued for malpractice or are disciplined for incompetence or improper conduct. #32% Cut M Mai As a result of such actions, malpractice insurance premiums have declined dramatically in some states. In Kansas, the premiums were cut by an average of 25 percent, effective July 1 of this year. In Pennsylvania, the insurance company owned by the state medical society reduced malpractice insurance premiums twice this year, by 6.7 percent on Jan. 1 and by a further 15 percent on July 1. In Minnesota, rates for a major underwriter dropped 15 percent on July 1.
Over the last 15 months, insurance companies have reduced malpractice premiums by an average of 10 percent in Colorado, 23 percent in Georgia and 32 percent in Maine.
From 1982 to 1988, premiums rose nationally by an average of more than 18 percent a year, according to the American Medical Association. But in the last few years, insurers say, the number and frequency of malpractice claims have declined, so they can reduce premiums because they built up enough reserves to pay claims and other expenses.
Dr. T. Glenn Williams, an orthopedic surgeon in Albany, Ga., whose annual premium dropped from $60,000 last year to slightly more than $50,000 this year, said patients would benefit because ''we won't have to raise our prices as much'' in the future.
Mark S. Freeland, an economist at the Federal Department of Health and Human Services, said there was ''a small but perceptible decline in the rate of increase in physician fees'' from January 1989 to February 1990. But he said doctors' fees had begun creeping upward again and were still rising 50 percent faster than the Consumer Price Index for all items.
For a typical obstetrician-gynecologist in Pennsylvania, the malpractice premium has dropped more than $6,000. It was $31,125 last year and is now $24,654. For an obstetrician-gynecologist in Kansas, the reduction has been even more substantial, to $49,815 from $66,643.
 
Premium Falls to $120,000
For a neurosurgeon in Nassau County, L.I., the premium charged by the doctor-owned company dropped to $120,000 in July, from $126,000. For an orthopedic surgeon in Albany, the rate dropped to $39,324, from $45,389.
Gail E. Tverberg, an actuary with the Tillinghast unit of Towers Perrin, a management consulting concern, said that while the average size of malpractice claims continued to increase, partly because of inflation, the frequency of claims was less than projected in the mid-1980's. Thus, she said, it turned out that many insurers set their premiums higher than needed.
''Competition has brought those rates back down to match the underlying costs,'' she said. ''That is why we've seen rates drifting downward.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. Gave Iraq Little Reason Not to Mount Kuwait Assault

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO with MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
In the two weeks before Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, the Bush Administration on the advice of Arab leaders gave President Saddam Hussein little reason to fear a forceful American response if his troops invaded the country.
The Administration's message to Baghdad, articulated in public statements in Washington by senior policy makers and delivered directly to Mr. Hussein by the United States Ambassador, April C. Glaspie, was this: The United States was concerned about Iraq's military buildup on its border with Kuwait, but did not intend to take sides in what it perceived as a no-win border dispute between Arab neighbors.
In a meeting with Mr. Hussein in Baghdad on July 25, eight days before the invasion, Ms. Glaspie urged the Iraqi leader to settle his differences with Kuwait peacefully but added, ''We have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait,'' according to an Iraqi document described as a transcript of their conversation.
 
Details of U.S. Diplomacy
Portions of the document, prepared in Arabic by the Iraqi Government, were translated and broadcast by ABC News on Sept. 11 and were the basis of accounts by The Washington Post and The Guardian of London. The State Department declined to confirm the accuracy of the document, but officials did not dispute Ms. Glaspie's essential message. 
As those and other details of the Administration's diplomacy have unfolded in recent weeks, its handling of Iraq before the invasion has begun to draw strong criticism in Congress, even among those who generally support the Administration's military action in the Persian Gulf. Some lawmakers have asserted that the Administration conveyed a sense of indifference to Baghdad's threats.
Interviews with dozens of Administration officials, lawmakers and independent experts and a review of public statements and the Iraqi document show that instead of sending Mr. Hussein blunt messages through public and private statements that an invasion would be unacceptable, the State Department prepared equivocal statements for the Administration about American commitments to Kuwait.
 
Arab Assurances on Invasion
The American strategy, carried out primarily by the State Department but approved by the White House, was based on the assumption that Iraq would not invade and occupy Kuwait. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who assured the Bush Administration that Mr. Hussein would not invade, argued that the best way to resolve an inter-Arab squabble was for the United States to avoid inflammatory words and actions.
Some senior Administration officials said the strategy was also rooted in the view that Washington - and most of the Arab world - probably could live with a limited invasion of Kuwait, in which Iraqi forces seized bits of Kuwaiti territory to gain concessions.
''We were reluctant to draw a line in the sand,'' a senior Administration official said. ''I can't see the American public supporting the deployment of troops over a dispute over 20 miles of desert territory and it is not clear that the local countries would have supported that kind of commitment. The basic principle is not to make threats you can't deliver on. That was one reason there was a certain degree of hedging on what was said.''
 
Effect of a Harder Line
Even in the days before the invasion, there was a consensus inside the Administration and among outside experts that Mr. Hussein would not invade despite largely correct intelligence assessments of the military buildup on the ground.
''There would have been a lot of fluttering if there had been a partial invasion,'' said an Administration official. ''The crucial factor in determining the American response was not the reality but the extent of the invasion.''
It is not clear that taking a harder line would have made a difference in Baghdad's decision to take Kuwait, and some Administration officials argue that if they had they would now be accused of pushing Mr. Hussein toward extreme actions.
As the Administration's policy toward Iraq before the invasion has come under criticism in Congress, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a group of experts who report to President Bush on intelligence issues, has also begun a post-mortem on the handling of the crisis.
 
Flawed Policy on Baghdad
The Administration was following what President Bush acknowledged last week was a flawed policy toward Iraq, a policy built on the premise that the best way to handle Mr. Hussein and moderate his behavior was through improving relations with Baghdad. That assessment presumed that Iran and Iraq, both exhausted by their eight-year border war, would focus on domestic reconstruction, not foreign adventurism.
As a result, the Bush Administration failed to calibrate its policy to take into account a string of belligerent statements and actions by Mr. Hussein in recent months, including the execution of a British journalist and a threat to use chemical weapons against Israel.
''We were essentially operating without a policy,'' said a senior Administration official. ''The crisis came in a bit of a vaccum, at a time when everyone was focusing on German reunification.''
In the days before the invasion, Administration officials sent mixed signals about the American commitment to Kuwait's defense.
 
Speaking With One Voice
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, for example, was quoted as telling journalists at a press breakfast on July 19 that the American commitment made during the Iran-Iraq War to come to Kuwait's defense if it were attacked was still valid. The same point was also made by Paul Wolfowitz, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, at a private luncheon with Arab ambassadors. But Pete Williams, Mr. Cheney's chief spokesman, later tried to steer journalists away from the Secretary's remarks, adding that Mr. Cheney had been quoted with ''some degree of liberty.''
From that moment on, there was an orchestrated Administration campaign to speak with one voice, and speak quietly.
On July 24, when Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, was asked whether the United States had any commitment to defend Kuwait, she said, ''We do not have any defense treaties with Kuwait, and there are no special defense or security commitments to Kuwait.''
Asked whether the United States would help Kuwait if it were attacked, she replied, ''We also remain strongly committed to supporting the individual and collective self-defense of our friends in the gulf with whom we have a deep and longstanding ties,'' a statement that some Kuwaiti officials said privately was too weak.
 
Bush's Forceful Tone
Two days before the invasion, John H. Kelly, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, essentially repeated the same message in Congressional testimony.
Even after the invasion, there was unease in some quarters in the State Department over Mr. Bush's tough public stance. On Aug. 6, when President Bush clearly committed the United States to roll back Iraq's conquest of Kuwait, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d expressed reservations about the wisdom of the forceful tone of Mr. Bush remarks, according to Administration officials.
On Tuesday, at a hearing before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, Representative Lee H. Hamilton sharply chided Mr. Kelly for not taking a tougher stance against Iraq in his testimony before the invasion.
''You left the impression that it was the policy of the United States not to come to the defense of Kuwait,'' said Mr. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat. ''I asked you if there was a U.S. commitment to come to Kuwait's defense if it was attacked. Your response over and over again was we have no defense-treaty relationship with any gulf country.''
 
Policy Guidelines Followed
Bush Administration officials assert that Kuwait never asked for American troops or sought to join in joint military exercises with American forces.
Mr. Cheney told a breakfast group on Capitol Hill on Thursday that ''the fact was, there was literally nothing we could do until we could get access to that part of the world, and the attitude of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states has been consistently that they didn't want U.S. forces on the ground over there.''
On July 25, a week before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Ms. Glaspie was quickly summoned to Mr. Hussein's office in Baghdad, and she faithfully followed conciliatory policy guidelines sent to her from the State Department.
In their conversation, Mr. Hussein described an American conspiracy against him since the end of his war with Iraq, and warned the United States not to oppose his goal of getting economic concessions from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, according to the document described as the official Iraqi transcript, which ABC News made available to the New York Times. Miss Tutwiler said Friday that the State Department would not reveal the contents of a diplomatic exchange.
 
'We Too Can Harm You'
According to the Iraqi document, Mr. Hussein also suggested that he would use terrorism to curb any effort by the United States to try to stop him from achieving his goals.
''We too can harm you,'' he said according to the document, adding, ''We cannot come all the way to the United States but individual Arabs may reach you.''
But at another point in the document, he characterized the feud with his neighbors as an inter-Arab dispute, adding that the solution ''must be found within an Arab framework and through direct bilateral negotiations.''
Ambassador Glaspie stuck to the State Department line that President Bush wanted good relations with Iraq. Citing concern about Iraq's large troop buildup on the border and threatening remarks by Mr. Hussein in a number of his statements, she said that she had received instructions from Washington ''to ask you, in the spirit of friendship - not in the spirit of confrontation -regarding your intentions.''
In a long reply, Mr. Hussein said he and the Kuwaiti leadership had agreed to negotiate their differences. ''But if we are unable to find a solution,'' he said, ''then it will be natural that Iraq will not accept death.''
Some officials say they are convinced that Iraq had already made a decision to invade when President Hussein met the American Ambassador and that Mr. Hussein's talk of a possible peaceful resolution was an effort to deceive Washington.
''To suggest that we are to blame for all of this and we lulled them into thinking they could have Kuwait is really terrible,'' a senior official said. ''But we should have had a stiffer tone. It is unlikely to have made a difference, but it might have made a difference.''

HEADLINE: On Street, Rinfret Is a Renaissance Man of Sorts

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
His gubernatorial campaign has been in disarray the last week, but in some ways Pierre A. Rinfret's public image has not suffered. On the streets of Brooklyn and Queens he is still most commonly thought of not as a political neophyte, not as a maverick underdog, but as a French artist.
That is the finding of a thoroughly unscientific survey in which 40 residents of the two boroughs were asked if they had heard of Mr. Rinfret. Twenty-five percent correctly identified him as the Republican candidate for governor, while 30 percent said he was an artist - a modern French painter, in most minds, although some classified him as a sculptor, and one man cited his work during the Renaissance. 
Mr. Rinfret was also identified as a perfume, a movie star, a drug dealer, a fashion designer, an advocate for the homeless, a chef, a television journalist, the French Ambassador, a correction officer and a goalie for the New York Rangers.
''Is he missing?'' asked Anthony Guerra, a 56-year-old retired cabdriver in Ridgewood, Queens, as he looked at a picture of Mr. Rinfret that was provided to help jog his memory. ''Nope, never seen him.'' Name-Recognition Problem Mr. Rinfret's name-recognition problem was documented in a far more reliable poll taken September 10 and 11 by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. In the telephone poll of 821 registered voters, which had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the Democratic candidate, was recognized by 99.7 percent of the voters, and Mr. Rinfret was recognized by 62 percent.
After that poll was taken, Mr. Rinfret's campaign troubles received extensive publicity. On Wednesday he threatened to drop out unless the Republican Party gave more money to the campaign. Party officials then accused him of refusing to spend most of the $540,000 of his own money he had contributed to the campaign.
But all the publicity did not seem to affect his image among most of those interviewed on Friday, the day Mr. Rinfret vowed to stay in the race but denounced virtually every leading Republican in the state. Even in Ridgewood and Middle Village, Queens, where Republican candidates usually do relatively well, most residents surveyed did not know who he was.
''He's an artist,'' said Gep Truglio, 63, a retired bank guard in Ridgewood who called himself a Democrat.
''No,'' said Mr. Truglio's 62-year-old wife, Josephine, a Republican, ''he's a news commentator.''
''He's a French cook,'' said Mr. Truglio. ''He gives seminars.''
''No, he's on the news,'' Mrs. Truglio insisted. ''He's a world traveler.''
Shown Mr. Rinfret's picture, Mr. Truglio said, ''He's a French singer in Las Vegas.''
''He's an airline pilot,'' Mrs. Truglio suggested.
A middle-aged man walking near them along Fresh Pond Road called out, ''A drug dealer - yeah, that's who he is. All kinds of drugs.''
 
'He Looks Polish to Me'
''I would guess some type of French abstract artist,'' said Pete Vigliotti, a 31-year-old building maintenance worker from Ridgewood.
In Bill's Restaurant at 7324 Metropolitan Avenue in Middle Village, none of the six customers could identify Mr. Rinfret. Nor could any of the seven men sitting at Walter's Super-Cut Unisex hair salon at 1268 Myrtle Avenue in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, but one man did guess that Mr. Rinfret was a politician.
''He looks Polish to me,'' said the owner of the salon, Walter Heredia.
Eddie Mahe, a consultant to the Rinfret campaign, said that he was not surprised at the survey's results.
 
Less Television Coverage
''It's clearly true - we do not have name I.D. in the city,'' he said. ''It reflects the fact that we haven't had the money to buy millions of dollars worth of television time, and that television news has just started to decide the governor's race is important. We've had some coverage upstate, but not much in the city.''
Mr. Mahe laughed when he heard of Mr. Rinfret's artistic reputation. ''Well, he's French-Canadian, so at least they're half right about his nationality,'' Mr. Mahe said. ''But as far as I know, he's not an artist.''
A separate survey in Manhattan found a higher level of name recognition for Mr. Rinfret, although the finding might have biased by the location of the 14 interviews. They took place on the sidewalk outside Mr. Rinfret's home on Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side.
 
His Doormen Know Him
Eight people, including two doormen at his building, correctly identified Mr. Rinfret.
''Yes, I've heard of him - the artist,'' said another Upper East Sider, a middle-aged woman rushing down Fifth Avenue in an aerobic walk.
''I've known him for years,'' said Charles Werner, 80, who correctly identified Mr. Rinfret as an economist. ''I knew him when I worked in the investment world, where he did very well. He's an unusual person and he has talent. He's very outspoken and very creative. I think he'd make a fine governor.''
Mr. Werner paused and looked uncertain. ''Wait, was I right there? What is it he's running for again?''

HEADLINE: NEW YORK WANTS CLEANEST AIR ACT

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
New York City officials, faced with continuing violations of Federal smog and carbon monoxide standards, are pressing for adoption of the strongest anti-pollution measures Congress is considering as it tries to agree on amendments to the Clean Air Act.
The 142 House and 7 Senate conferees met all summer in Washington to resolve differences between the revisions to the act that were passed by each house this spring. The 20-year-old Clean Air Act has not been revised since 1977.
Both bills would require major changes by businesses, particularly in the most polluted cities like New York, which will ultimately cost everyone more money. The Bush Administration estimated recently that the total economic cost would be at least $35 billion a year. 
Congressional conferees have reached the part of the 700-page bill that addresses motor vehicles, the source of much of New York City's air pollution. Decisions in the next few days about tailpipe-emission controls and clean-burning fuels will heavily influence when and if New Yorkers will be able to breathe healthy air.
 
Expensive Ozone Control
The conferees have already agreed to the House version of provisions to reduce smog from industrial sources. The House bill, supported by New York officials because it requires greater regulation of industrial sources, allows the city 17 more years to attain the Federal ozone standard.
The industrial-smog provisions would have far-reaching effects in the New York area. Even small businesses like dry cleaners and bakeries would have to install expensive ozone-control devices. Vehicle-control measures like car-pooling and high-occupancy vehicle lanes would most likely have to be ordered in an effort to reduce or slow the growth of traffic.
Ozone, the primary component of smog, is formed when hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen mix in the atmosphere in sunlight. Almost half the hydrocarbon emissions in New York come from mobile sources like cars and trucks; the rest come from sources like industrial plants, gasoline stations and paints and hairspray. Ninety percent of carbon monoxide emissions come from motor vehicles.
In recent letters to members of the New York State Congressional delegation and influential Senators and Representatives, Mayor David N. Dinkins and the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner, Albert F. Appleton, said they sought the strongest possible Federal air pollution program, especially for motor vehicles.
 
Fought by Auto and Oil Concerns
''We need a tough, comprehensive mobile-source program with the strictest standards for tailpipe emissions,'' Mr. Appleton wrote. ''We need aggressive alternative fuel vehicles by bus operators, fleet operators and taxis, and mandatory use of reformulated gasoline and oxygenated fuel.''
But New York is unlikely to get all that it wants in the motor vehicle and fuels section of the clean-air bill. For one thing, it has asked for measures that are not in either bill. And the automobile and oil industries have fought hard in the House and Senate to limit what they will have to do to comply with the act. Congressional staff members said last week that those industries were pressing conferees to further weaken the provisions, particularly rules for reformulated gasoline and clean-fuel vehicles for fleets.
Both issues are important to New York. Widespread use of specially blended gasoline, which produces emissions that cause less buildup in the ozone layer, could give the city 20 percent of the reductions it needs to meet Federal smog standards without a big increase in the cost of fuel, environmental groups say.
 
Dinkins Pledges Cleaner Fleets
Irrespective of Federal mandates, the Dinkins administration has committed itself to buying more vehicles for city fleets that run on cleaner-burning fuels like natural gas. In general, the city views fleets - groups of private or government vehicles that can be centrally fueled - as important to air quality because they represent a high percentage of midtown traffic. But conferees are discussing limiting the categories of vehicles, like heavy-duty trucks, that would be required to convert to cleaner-burning fuels, Congressional staff members said.
Also, the House bill calls for a pilot program in California, where pollution is most severe, mandating the sale of thousands of individually owned cars that run on cleaner-burning fuels. New York has asked to join the program.
There are doubts about the conferees' ability to complete discussions before adjournment, scheduled for early October, but there is a chance they will return for a session after the November elections.
Besides motor vehicles and fuels, the conferees still have to deal with the contentious issues of hazardous air emissions and acid rain. It took them the entire summer to get this far, in part because the crisis in the Middle East and the nation's budget problems are dominating legislators' attention.
But powerful legislators like Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, say they want a bill this year. Mr. Dingell, who has helped block clean-air legislation in past years, said in Washington last week that he was ''strongly committed'' to a House-Senate accord as soon as possible.
Environmentalists have said the Senate bill has stronger rules on motor vehicle emissions and the House measure is tougher on urban smog.

HEADLINE: 8 Arrested in Boycott of Brooklyn Store

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
One day after Mayor David N. Dinkins called for a peaceful resolution of the eight-month boycott of two Korean-owned stores in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, scores of shoppers returned to the stores, but eight protesters were arrested for violating the court order that mandated they stay at least 50 feet from them.
The protesters vowed yesterday to continue the boycott until the Family Red Apple and Church Fruits and Vegetables on Church Avenue were shut down.
''We are here to close Church Fruits and Red Apple until every merchant learns to respect their customers,'' said Sabine Albert, a leader of the Flatbush Frontline Collective, a group that was organized around the black-led boycott. She was later arrested by the police for disorderly conduct. 
But despite cries of ''Boycott!'' that were hurled at them, a stream of customers flowed through the steady rain past the demonstrators and shopped at both stores. Many said they had been afraid to cross the picket lines in past months but were stirred to action by Mayor Dinkins's decision to shop at the stores on Friday.
 
'We Are All Immigrants'
''It is time for this foolishness to finish,'' said Patricia Quow, who lives in the neighborhood and said she had avoided the Family Red Apple because of the jeers and taunts of the demonstrators. ''This country owes everybody a living; we are all immigrants.''
About 50 demonstrators from a rally in support of the boycott gathered near the stores about 2 P.M. yesterday, carrying placards and posters of Malcolm X. A shoving match erupted when the police tried to keep the protesters behind the yellow line on the sidewalk that marked the 50-foot distance that the court had decreed the protesters had to maintain.
Six men and two women were arrested when they crossed the line. They were charged with disorderly conduct, bringing to 13 the number of protesters arrested since the police began enforcing the court order this week. They were taken for booking to a special processing unit set up nearby, where they were issued desk-appearance tickets and told not to rejoin the protest.
One man who was arrested, Guisner Etienne, was charged with assaulting a police officer. The police said the officer had suffered a sprained wrist in a scuffle with Mr. Etienne as he arrested him.
''The issue here is an issue of the political economy of the city,'' Malcolm Amorali, a protester, said to those who remained after the arrests. ''The police are not here to protect us; they are here to defend their own interests.''
 
Protesters Deride Dinkins
Two of the arrested protesters rejoined the picket line. ''It's a moral issue,'' one of them, Holly Volny, said. ''We are right and they are wrong.'' His remarks were presaged earlier in the day, when a handful of protesters stood behind barricades, angered by what they saw as the Mayor's decision to take sides in the conflict.
''Nothing can stop us!'' one protester shouted. ''We ain't going to listen to Uncle Tom Dinkins.''
One protester who declined to give his name pointed with scorn to the 100 police officers who lined the sidewalks outside both stores. ''David Dinkins has come with the state to violate our constitutional rights,'' he said. A police spokesman, Raymond O'Donnell, said a total of 400 officers were assigned to the detail that patrols the area.
The protests began last January after Giselaine Felissaint, a Haitian-American woman, said she was assaulted by an employee of the Family Red Apple. She said the worker then sought refuge across the street at Church Fruits and Vegetables. The Family Red Apple's owner has said that the woman became unruly after refusing to pay the full price of her groceries.
The employee, Pong Ok Jang, has been charged with assault, and Mrs. Felissaint has filed a $6 million civil suit against the owner of the Family Red Apple Yesterday, the protesters remained firm, and that worried one city official who has been trying to mediate the dispute. ''There are limits to what government can do to resolve a situation that has become this polarized,'' said the official, David Scott, chief of staff for the City Human Rights Commission. ''I don't think that anybody believes any single action by the Mayor could end it.''
Mr. Scott, whose agency has been talking with all sides, said the standoff had worsened. Aside from those who want to close the stores, he said, others want to see Ms. Felissaint's case resolved before ending the boycott, and still others will not be satisfied until the city begins addressing issues of economic opportunity for disadvantaged residents.
''Clearly, there are numerous positions on this and numerous objectives being sought,'' Mr. Scott said, ''and some are probably more valid than others.''
Bong Jae Jang, the owner of the Family Red Apple, said he was heartened by the number of customers coming to his store. He said that almost 400 people came on Friday, spending nearly $1,500. By the time the store closed at 8 o'clock last night, more than 250 others had come to spend their money at the formica counter across the aisle from a ''peace bench,'' a brown park bench Mr. Bong installed as a gesture of friendship to what he called ''my Church Avenue neighbors.'' More than 300 people shopped at Church Fruits and Vegetables.
Mr. Bong estimated that he had lost $100,000 in business since the protest began. He examined the corroded, dusty cans of tropical juices and worm-infested boxes of flour and added that the cost of those and other spoiled perishables will drive up his losses.
But he said his spirits were buoyed by the shoppers who followed in the Mayor's footsteps.
Mr. Bong, who is from a village 50 miles from the 38th Parallel in Korea, said he did not fear for his own safety, but was concerned about the pickets' refusal to negotiate. ''We want to talk with these people,'' he said. ''The Mayor tried, but these people won't learn.''
While the protesters vowed to continue their boycott, Mr. Bong made a vow of his own. ''I'm not worried about money. I can always make money,'' he said. ''But these people are killing my dream. But I will follow my dream. I don't want to be rich. I just want to follow my dream.''

HEADLINE: Has Dole Found a Way Out of the Budget Impasse?

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Congressional budget negotiators, taking a break from their formal deliberations until Sunday evening, spent today trying to decide whether Senator Bob Dole of Kansas had found a way out of the current impasse with his proposal to sever capital gains tax cuts from a deficit reduction package.
The proposal, advanced this week by Mr. Dole, the Senate Republican leader, is an elaborate legislative gambit that would require negotiators to produce two budget packages that would be voted on separately but whose fates would be linked. Supporters say it could be a stroke of genius, giving rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties a little of what they want while forcing them to swallow a lot of what they do not want.
For those Republicans who have never been as keen to cut the capital gains rate as President Bush is, the Dole proposal may also provide a face-saving way to set aside that issue and free Congress for a vote on a real budget deal. If the strategy sounds complicated, that is no accident. 
 
Master of Confusion
Mr. Dole, a former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is a master of creative confusion, and his tactics, though not without risk, have often produced brilliant legislative victories. The idea here is to give each side an incentive to make both packages succeed, while simultaneously increasing the cost of failure.
The strategy is based on one he employed in 1986, as Senate majority leader, to link sanctions against South Africa with military aid for the rebel forces in Nicaragua. He engineered a double victory, getting the contra aid that President Ronald Reagan wanted while getting Republicans on the popular side of the South Africa issue despite Mr. Reagan's opposition to the sanctions.
Under Mr. Dole's proposal, one budget package would include unpopular spending cuts and tax increases totaling $50 billion in 1991 and $500 billion over five years. That would be voted on first.
The second package would combine the capital gains tax cut, extension of a dozen popular tax breaks due to expire at the end of this year, other revenue-losing measures and spending initiatives like a child-care program. The catch is that the second package, which would cost at least $60 billion if both parties were to get all their current wishes, would have to be financed with other tax increases or spending cuts.
 
Problem: Finding the Money
If the second package failed, Mr. Dole's proposal stipulates that the first would go down as well. But Mr. Dole's supporters argue that having passed the first package, lawmakers would have enough momentum to come together quickly on the second one, and would be reluctant to undo what both sides could bill as a historic budget deal.
The Kansas Senator has taken some heat in his own party, particularly from House Republicans who see him abandoning the party's commitment to a reduction in the tax rate on capital gains, or profits on the sale of assets, and other tax measures they say would stimulate the economy.
And even lawmakers who find Mr. Dole's proposal intriguing are hard pressed to come up with ways to pay for the measures that would be included in his second package. They note that many of the spending cuts or revenue increases that would be needed have already been tapped as part of the initial deficit-cutting package.
 
The Tough Options
One potential source of revenue would be corporate tax increases. In the proposals Democrats and Republicans have exchanged in the last several weeks of budget negotiations, corporations have been largely spared.
Other options might be deeper spending cuts in programs like Medicare, Medicaid and farm subsidies or increases in tax rates for individuals. So far Democrats have rejected the first option, and Republicans have deemed the second one unacceptable. The question for both sides is whether any of those options becomes more attractive if they are attached to a package of popular measures than they are now as solutions for deficit reduction.
''You're likely to end up having the same fight on the House and Senate floor that you are having right now at the negotiating table,'' said one Republican aide who has been involved in the bargaining. ''You have to ask yourself whether there isn't a simpler way.''
But from Mr. Dole's point of view, an open floor fight over the second package could have political advantages. Concerned that Republican support for the capital gains tax cut is allowing Democrats to portray his party as the champion of the wealthy, Mr. Dole is looking for a way to defuse the issue and call attention to Democratic demands for spending increases.
At a time when the only alternative seems to be deep automatic spending cuts that could cripple essential services across the country, Mr. Dole's strategy carries risks for both parties as they jockey for advantage. But he is wagering that at best the dual package will produce some combination of what everybody wants, while at worst it will leave the stalemated budget negotiators exactly where they are now.

HEADLINE: Bottom Line: Perception;
Budget Deal Might Not Do Much at First, But Economists Agree It's Worth Making

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
At a news conference with out-of-town reporters last week, President Bush said an agreement with Congress to reduce the Federal deficit was ''the best antidote to further economic slowdown.''
But a wide range of economists, from those who say the Federal deficit is a critical problem to those who think its dangers have been overstated, agree that a budget deal would do little to help the country weather the current economic slump and could even worsen the situation for a time.
''The budget deficit didn't cause the recession, and fixing the deficit isn't going to cure it,'' said John H. Makin, director of fiscal policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.
Mr. Makin and most of the other economists say that cutting the deficit now is in the country's long-term interest and that the President and Congress should not abandon their negotiations just because the economy is shaky. But many say the immediate effect of raising taxes and cutting Government spending would be to slow the economy further. 
 
The Long Term and the Short
The Federal Reserve, they say, could be expected to lower interest rates in response to a serious plan to reduce the deficit. But they observe that changes in interest rates generally take six to nine months to work their way through the economy, while tax and spending changes are felt at once.
''There is no way that raising taxes or cutting spending is not going to be contractionary,'' said Benjamin M. Friedman, a Harvard economist whose book ''Day of Reckoning'' (Random House, 1988) is widely cited in support of the view that large deficits pose grave dangers. ''It does little good for people like me who believe strongly in a budget deal to say otherwise.''
Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities on Wall Street, expressed the prevailing view. ''The primary reason for reducing the deficit,'' he said, ''is not to influence the direction of the economy in the short run. We want lower deficits to slow the growth in debt and to increase long-term economic potential.''
 
The Sticking Points
Administration officials and Congressional leaders have been working since spring on a plan to cut the deficit in the Government's $1.2 trillion budget by $50 billion in the next fiscal year and by a total of $500 billion over the next five years. The deficit is now estimated at $250 billion.
Beginning two weekends ago, they met for 10 days at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland without resolving their differences. This week, a smaller group of the Bush Administration's three chief economic policy makers and the five top Congressional leaders met for four days without staff in a back room at the Capitol and still failed to reach an agreement. They plan to resume their talks Sunday evening.
Unless an accord is reached or the law is changed, across-the-board spending cuts of more than 30 percent in most Government programs would automatically take effect with the start of the 1991 fiscal year on Oct. 1. Economists say the economy would soon collapse under the strain of such large, indiscriminate spending reductions.
The main sticking point has been over President Bush's insistence on a capital gains tax cut, and the Democrats' determination to impose higher taxes on the wealthy. There is also significant disagreement on how to apportion spending reductions. Is This a Recession? Economists disagree over whether the economy is actually in a recession, is likely to enter one soon or will narrowly avoid one. The official definition of a recession is a decline in the gross national product for six months in a row, which has not occurred.
Blue Chip Economic Indicators, the monthly survey of 50 prominent economists, found this month that 25 thought a recession had started or would start this year, and that 8 expected a recession next year.
Even those others who do not see a recession at hand are forecasting a period of slow growth in which many parts of the country will feel a serious pinch. So whether a recession actually occurs is a matter of definition; economists all agree that the the economy is now weak.
Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Gerald R. Ford, said the deficit ''does not tip the economy from one quarter to another.'' But he added that it should be reduced for two reasons.
''First, the effect of deficit reduction on long-term economic growth, while small, is worthwhile,'' he said. ''Second, the deficit gets in the way of all kinds of other decisions, whenever we have to decide whether to help Poland or fight drugs or whatever.''
In ''Day of Reckoning,'' Mr. Friedman wrote that failure to lower the deficit would mean ''a lower standard of living for individual Americans and reduced American influence and importance in the world.''
 
The Interest Slice of the Pie
Other economists observed that as long as the deficit remained high, the country would have to spend a larger and larger share of its resources to make interest payments to its creditors. The General Accounting Office, the Government's chief auditing agency, noted in a report last week that interest payments were rising so fast that at the current rate they would become the largest single item in the general fund of the budget by 1992, larger than military expenditures or Medicare payments.
It is widely agreed that the country would be better off if the money were spent on education, rebuilding roads and bridges, improving the environment or countless other productive endeavors.
Most of the economists interviewed said that although raising taxes and cutting spending might worsen a recession slightly for a few months, it would be worthwhile if the financial markets perceived that the politicians were serious about reducing the deficit and making it stick.
Mr. Makin, one of the economists who has never been terribly concerned about the size of the deficit, said such a perception would lead to lower long-term bond rates. That, in turn, would allow the Federal Reserve to relax short-term rates without fear of more inflation. People and companies would be encouraged to borrow and spend more, stimulating the economy.
But that process could take months, perhaps even a year, before the effect was felt. And given the record, many economists are skeptical that the markets will trust the politicians not to change their minds.
For years, said Mr. Stein, the precise deficit-reduction targets of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law have been met by raising the ceiling or using phony accounting, and he finds it difficult to believe that the politicians have found religion all of a sudden.
''The feeling that confidence is going to be greatly restored has no basis in fact,'' he said. ''Betting on restoring confidence is chimera.''

HEADLINE: Year Later, St. Croix Is Coming Back, And Trying to Bring Tourists With It

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHRISTIANSTED, V.I., Sept. 21

 BODY:
A year ago this week, Isabelle M. Pence boarded a plane on St. Croix as she and hundreds of others fled in a scene of frenzy that she likens to the evacuation of Saigon. Carrying what little they could salvage, they left frightened and hungry from an island lost to a hurricane that hit like a wrecker's ball.
Today Mrs. Pence is in the midst of rebuilding her three-bedroom house. On St. Croix, where Hurricane Hugo damaged 90 percent of the buildings and left an estimated 22,500 people homeless, hammers are pounding and residents, including returnees like Mrs. Pence, express optimism.
''The bottom line for me is that I can't live any other place than St. Croix,'' said Mrs. Pence, a 67-year-old New Jersey native who came here as a tourist and moved in 27 years ago. 
Hugo raged through St. Croix on the night and morning of Sept. 17 and 18 on its way from the Caribbean up the East Coast. Losses in the three United States Virgin Islands, which also include St. Thomas and St. John, surpassed $1.5 billion, though only a handful of deaths were reported on St. Croix.
 
Trauma of Uncontrolled Looting
But St. Croix has more to recover from than damage to buildings, trees and utility poles. By daybreak after the storm struck, when water, power and all communication were lost, looters filled the streets and emptied the shops.
President Bush sent 1,100 Army troops to restore order, plus 80 Federal agents to take virtual command of the law-enforcement operations.
But long after the civil disturbances were quelled and the rebuilding of the island was under way, St. Croix officials worried that the tourists who are vital to the economy would be scared away indefinitely by the vivid news coverage of the looting.
 
Winter Will Tell Results
The coming winter will tell much about the recovery of St. Croix's image. Last winter's tourist season was all but lost anyway, because so few hotels were habitable.
The Virgin Islands government will spend $7 million in advertising this season, much of it meant to fight the notion that St. Croix is devastated and unsafe, said Betty Sperber, president of the St. Croix Hotel and Tourism Association.
Tourism, which pumps $700 million into the economy of the three islands every year, accounting for two-thirds of all income, was down by more than 40 percent in the first half of the year in St. Croix.
Airport arrivals, down 15.3 percent in the first seven months of the year, were up 9.8 percent in July compared with last year, according to the Department of Economic Development, although some of that increase may have been because of cut-rate fares and other aggressive promotions.
 
Temporary Pier for Ships
Cruise ships, which brought about 8,000 visitors a month, have been unable to dock because of the destroyed Frederiksted pier, but ships have scheduled 32 port calls this season, beginning next month, at a temporary pier. Last winter 120 port calls were planned before Hugo wiped them out.
The number of hotel rooms occupied during the first six months of the year fell by 53 percent from the same period last year, but at present there are 850 rooms as against 1,800 before the storm.
If Mrs. Pence felt compelled to come back, other residents did not. The Virgin Islands Department of Health estimates that a quarter of St. Croix's population of 55,000 left the island in the wake of the storm, although the exact number who stayed away is unclear.
As for services on the island, electrical and telephone service were fully restored earlier this year. The foliage is back and most stores and hotels have reopened. Schools, the hospital and public buildings are functioning in various stages of repair, or in temporary quarters, and a construction boom has helped offset the economic effects of the tourism slump.
Cruzans, as the island's residents are known, recognize that a full comeback is years away. On the streets, a section of a movie theater's corrugated metal roof still sits in a parking lot; the top half of a stadium's light pole still dangles upside down. Thousands of residents live in emergency mobile homes and modular units while others still inhabit the shells of former homes.
 
Problems Collection Insurance
About 700 homeowners and 500 businesses were unable to collect insurance after two insurers went out of business. The St. Croix government is now putting together a financing plan to honor $52 million in unpaid claims through a bond issue.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency and other Federal agencies have spent $610.1 million on recovery efforts, most of it for St. Croix, the most populated of the islands. Among the biggest projects yet to be completed are the reconstruction of St. Croix Hospital and the replacement of a 10-million-gallon water tank.
The emergency agency has also approved a $90 million loan for the Virgin Islands government to compensate for the drop in tax revenue.
In Christiansted's historic district, a vendor sits alone by his produce and housewares stand under a tarpaulin, waiting for construction workers to complete the roof in the once-bustling marketplace.
''The tarpaulin leaks when it rains,'' said the vendor, Montgomery (Beeman) Siom, 64, who has been in the business for 25 years. ''The sun burns. I lose a lot to spoilage.''
In Grove Place near Frederiksted, in the western part of the island, a family of six lives in what used to be their utility shed, awaiting a loan to repair their roofless house.
''Any time my house is finished I'll feel like my life is back to normal,'' said the mother, Eulali Francis, 55.
 
Trying to Undersand Looters
Most people on the island condemn the looting that followed the hurricane, but they have sought to understand it. They say many looters were panicked by the damage and chaos of the storm and grabbed food and other items because they feared shortages. Others, the residents acknowledge, were tempted by the absence of overwhelmed local law-enforcement officers. In any case, they say, the disturbances were distorted and sensationalized by reporters.
Although the looting was widespread, said David Nissman, chief Assistant United States Attorney for St. Croix, limited resources meant there could be only 20 prosecutions. There were 15 convictions, he said, including a bank vice president and a restaurant owner. Two police officers, accused of having joined the looting, were acquitted.
St. Croix is 80 percent black, but most businesses are run by whites, so the looting was originally perceived as having racial overtones. But Mr. Nissman said racial hostility was not a factor, nor was the need of the looters, While some looters stole food and emergency items, he noted, the majority went for items like shoes, appliances, electronic goods, even lawn mowers.
 
'People Are Kinder Now'
After having been ransacked, the Sunny Isle shopping center, the island's largest, opened up last May. Store managers said they are willing to forget, or at least to try.
''People are kinder now,'' said Robert E. Fitzgerald, general manager of Woolworth's, the island's only department store. ''They don't mess up the store as much. I may be naive but I think they feel remorse. I don't think it would happen again.''
People's Drugstore now sports security gates for its front doors, ''our weak spot,'' said the manager, Gary Schumacher, who found more than 100 people inside the store the day after the storm. He said a few later offered to pay for what they took.
''You just block it out,'' he said. But he added: ''There are one or two faces that stick. They come into the store and your stomach turns.''
On the hills overlooking Christiansted, Mrs. Pence has already cleaned out her home of most damaged belongings, including books and porcelains. Mrs. Pence, a founding member of the St. Croix animal shelter, is now accompanied only by Maggie, her 8-year-old mutt. Benji, her other dog, had to be put to sleep after being hit by a falling beam the night the three raced to a closet for safety.
 
Objects Are Less Important
''One of the things the storm did to us is that we all feel material things aren't as important as we once did,'' she said. ''I'll never collect anything again. It's going to be a different lifestyle.''
In a village of 400 federally supplied mobile homes near the airport, Aubrey Liburd, 44, his wife and three children have just been reunited.After the storm, the family's wrecked apartment was looted and they have spent most of the past years with friends and relatives.
''Hugo has caused people to see the good in people and the bad in people,'' Mr. Liburd said. ''You found out who your friends were.''
Gov. Alexander A. Farrelly will find out the degree of dissatisfaction with his performance during the disaster when he comes up for re-election this November. He is widely criticized as having failed to prepare for the storm adequately and for his reluctance to send for Federal troops to establish order.
 
Island Response Is Defended
The National Guard Bureau dismissed Adj. Gen. Robert Moorehead, commander in the Virgin Islands, for lack of leadership after Hugo.
''Given no communication, a total population of victims, we had a pretty damn good response,'' said Lieut. Gov. Derek M. Hodge, who is running on Mr. Farrelly's slate.
Last week, Cruzans commemorated the anniversary of the disaster with religious services and parties. Hugo, they said, has also brought money to those flocking to the construction trade from in and outside the island, as evidenced by a higher number of automobile and satellite dishes.
''People are optimistic that the island is getting a lot better,'' said a bar owner, Richi Black.
A similar assessment came from the Federal emergency agency's coordinator in the territory, Steven B. Singer, who said St. Croix would be better prepared for another Hugo. Telephone lines are now underground, for example, and the power distribution system has been decentralized.
''They have the perverse benefit of having experienced probably the worst,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Atlanta Seeks to Deliver City It Sold to Olympics

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 22

 BODY:
The bid for the Olympic Games was one part Rhett and Scarlett and one part the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., both marketed with the entrepreneurial zeal that has been Atlanta's most consistent thread since its founding as a lonely railroad junction in 1842.
The euphoria has not abated since the announcement on Tuesday that Atlanta had been chosen over Athens as the site of the 1996 Summer Olympics. And as much as it was a source of enormous pride, the announcement has also highlighted both the constancy and the startling change in the South's most important city.
It was this contradictory blending of the Old South and the new that had veterans of the civil rights movement using imagery from the Civil War era to summarize Atlanta's victory. 
''After Sherman burned the city down, we rose back, and it seems like every 20 or 30 years, there is another great push, another great boom in Atlanta,'' said Representative John Lewis, a longtime civil rights leader. ''I see this as part of that continuum.'' Living Up to Its Image Some analysts say the estimate that Atlanta will reap $3.48 billion from the 1996 games is wildly inflated. They note that the organizers still must build $418 million of stadiums and buildings and raise $1.16 billion to stage the games.
But the Olympics are almost certain to mean an incalculable boost in international stature and an extended economic stimulant that will help the city through what looks like its first major downturn in 15 years.
Less certain is whether Atlanta will be able to live up to the idealized picture of racial and social harmony it sold not only to the International Olympic Committee but also to itself.
''What the Olympic Committee saw is what Atlanta is trying to be, not what it is,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference based in Atlanta. ''What Atlanta is saying is not that we've arrived, but that we are working like the dickens to go where we know we must go.''
 
A Century of Boosterism
If the thought of Atlanta as the site of an event of such international proportions seemed a bit startling to outsiders, it was not without precedent.
Most often cited for comparison is the Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895, where amid much ballyhoo a reborn Atlanta staked its claim as the capital of the South, promoting the idea that a New South had put the Civil War behind it.
Since then, Atlanta's leaders have worked together to expand the economic frontiers, billing the city at various times as ''Gate City of the South,'' ''Capital of the New South,'' ''A City Too Busy to Hate,'' ''Black Mecca'' and ''The World's Next Great City,''
''This will transform the city's skyline,'' said former Gov. George Busbee, chairman of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. ''When I was on the BBC in 1975, they didn't know if Atlanta was closer to California or Florida. After the Olympics no one will ever ask where Atlanta is.'' When Atlanta began its campaign for the 1996 games in 1988, some members of the International Olympic Committee confused it with Atlantic City.
 
Silence From Doubters
As in its earlier days, when a tight-knit business community dictated the city's economic future, Atlanta benefited from unity. While Toronto's bid, for example, was hurt by questions of whether the games would be the best use of local resources, any doubters in Atlanta stayed largely quiet.
Anita Beaty, co-director of the Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless, said homeless advocates thought it would be a major political risk to question the bid publicly.
''You could certainly say there was some fear of reprisal,'' Ms. Beaty said. ''It's hard to say too much now. The city is just hysterical about this.''
But if the links to the past are clear, the breaks from it are as startling. Most telling is the Southern city proudly trumpeting its civil rights heritage and interracial harmony, while cities like New York, Boston or Washington are torn by racial division.
Former Mayor Andrew Young, one of the main architects of the plan to snare the Olympics, recalled the words of a selection committee member: ''It was by the grace of God and your racial harmony that you all won this bid.'' As such, the bid was a remarkable statement not just about Atlanta but about the entire South.
''It's significant this international event will come to the Deep South, where 25 years ago it wouldn't have been conceivable,'' Mr. Lowery said. ''I don't know another city that is as committed to the kind of creative interdependence that Atlanta is committed to.''
Local leaders promised that the spirit of the bid would permeate the organizing of the games.
''Let us dedicate ourselves to the Olympic effort of bringing along those in our city who are poor and those who are in need,'' said Mayor Maynard Jackson as he returned from Tokyo. ''We want our city to be a better city, not just a richer city.''
 
Cracks in the Facade
Atlanta's racial picture is hardly as rosy as that presented to the International Olympic Committee. Atlanta, which is 70 percent black within its city limits, remains largely segregated residentially. Whites have largely fled the public schools for private ones, the city had the nation's highest crime rate last year and the 1980 census ranked Atlanta with Newark with the most residents living in poverty. Even some business leaders admit the city's prosperity has largely bypassed poor blacks.
Dan Sweat, the longtime head of Central Atlanta Progress, a powerful downtown business group, said many of the city's major economic projects had hurt the poor, often by displacing them for development, ''not deliberately, but we have done it.'' He said it was critical the Olympic effort not repeat that history, adding, ''This time I am going to be on the side of the poor.''
Still, if there was some soul searching this week, more common was the sort of hyperbole Mayor Jackson expressed when he got off the plane from Tokyo and announced: ''This truly is a miracle city. We are in a new orbit. Our lives will never, ever be the same.''

HEADLINE: Group of Seven Presses to Keep Interest Rates Up

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Economic policy makers from the United States and its main industrial allies agreed today that the best response to the oil-price shock would be to keep a lid on inflation and refrain from making hasty interest-rate cuts.
The finance ministers and central bank directors of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations said in a communique that they did not expect their economies to fall into recession next year, even though oil prices have risen 50 percent since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, threatening to fuel inflation and to slow growth. The officials from the Group of Seven - the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada - gathered here for their first meeting since the Persian Gulf crisis began. 
The Canadian Finance Minister, Michael Wilson, told reporters after seven hours of talks that the group agreed that controlling inflation now would prevent greater problems in the future.
''If we don't get on top of inflationary pressures now the difficulties will be far more severe in the future,'' Mr. Wilson said. He said the the Group of Seven recognized that higher oil prices posed the risk of steep inflation and of recession. A tight grip on interest rates and government budgets means higher prices at the gas pump and a loss of purchasing power by consumers.
But policy makers from the major nations appear to believe that the world economy is better placed to weather the latest oil price shock than it was during the 1970's.
''We are heading toward a third round of higher oil prices in a much better position than in the previous two,'' said Karl Otto Pohl, the president of West Germany's central bank.
Industrial countries are more efficient in their use of energy, inflation is lower and oil prices have not risen as much as they did during the first two oil shocks.
During the oil shocks of the 1970's, industrial nations tried to cushion their economies by cutting interest rates and increasing government spending. That led to a new burst of inflation. ''The lessons we learned in 1973 and '74 ought not be forgotten,'' said John Major, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer. ''You simply do not accommodate inflationary pressures.''
But the Group of Seven prescription of tight budgets and high interest rates is likely to be broad enough to allow the United States to cut interest rates.
Currency rates, which have often bedeviled the Group of Seven in the past, are likely to pose little problem this time around. The dollar is sinking, but no one, including the United States, seems particularly worried.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Jordan's Monarch Appeals On TV to American Public

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 22

 BODY:
In an address to the American people, King Hussein of Jordan pleaded tonight for understanding of his country's increasingly difficult position in the Persian Gulf crisis but repeated his call for the removal of all American troops from the Middle East.
''I will never admit defeat because that would mean taking the easy way out,'' King Hussein said, indicating that he would not change camps and and stop supporting Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. Still, the King added, ''The hurt is there from those who don't know the facts.''
The King's half-hour address, transmitted live by Cable News Network to the United States, came as his country's position grew more desperate amid reports from Jordanian and Saudi officials that Saudi Arabia had expelled 20 Jordanian diplomats in apparent anger over Jordan's continued support for Saddam Hussein. 
''Saudi authorities told our embassy today that these people were no longer welcome to stay,'' a senior Jordanian official said, echoing reports from the Saudi capital. Asked about the reported expulsions of Jordanians this evening, King Hussein said he had heard nothing about them and that he believed the report was ''a fabrication.''
 
Saudi Situation Worsens
Whether the envoys were expelled or not, Jordan's relationship with Saudi Arabia has grown steadily worse in the last few days. On Wednesday, the Saudi Government informed Jordan only six hours in advance that it was cutting off all oil shipments. Jordan had depended on Saudi Arabia for half its oil needs.
That led to an emergency meeting of the Jordanian Cabinet today, and a senior minister said gas rationing might have to begin soon.
Saudi Arabia is now refusing to accept most Jordanian exports as well. In an interview on Thursday, the King's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, said: ''They are opening our trucks and dumping our vegetables over the side of the road. I've kept mum about this before now because I don't want to run afoul of other disagreements with the Saudis.''
Saudi Arabia was Jordan's third-largest trading partner, behind Iraq and Kuwait. With those three markets closed, Jordanian officials say their economy is headed for ruin.
 
Arguing Jordan's Case
Still, King Hussein was unyielding this evening as he argued Jordan's, and in some cases Iraq's, case before the American people.
As he has from the beginning, the King said that he did not support Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and added that ''despite its close relationship with Iraq, Jordan had no prior knowledge of or involvement in'' Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. And he noted that Jordan still recognizes the Kuwaiti Government. Its embassy is still open here.
Even so, the King explained at some length in his address and in a question-and-answer session on CNN, the world should not so quickly dismiss Saddam Hussein's claim to Kuwait. As the King described the situation, history lends support to Iraq's case.
He offered an emotional argument for the withdrawal of American forces from the gulf.
''We strongly feel that the presence of United States forces on the land of the state which is the custodian of the two holiest shrines of Islam must be terminated within the shortest possible period of time,'' he said, ''lest it result in incalculably grave consequences for Arabs and Muslims the world over for generations to come.''
He was referring to Mecca and Medina in southwestern Saudia Arabia, several hundred miles from the nearest concentrations of American forces.
The King's address was also delivered in a letter this weekend to every member of the United States Congress, Jordanian officials said. The Jordanian clearly was appealing for understanding as an economic noose begins to tighten around this country.
Prince Hassan is planning a trip to Washington next week and has said that he want to testify before a Congressional committee.
''Jordan is considered to be in a war zone,'' the King said tonight, ''and is practically under a state of seige.'' ---- Saudis Ask Envoys to Leave NICOSIA, Cyprus, Sept. 22 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said today that it had asked certain Governments to withdraw their diplomats because the envoys had sought to undermine the kingdom's security.
A Foreign Ministry statement issued by the official Saudi press agency, monitored here by the BBC, did not name the countries whose diplomats were asked to leave or provide numbers on the envoys.
But Saudi officials who spoke on the condition that they not be identified said earlier in the day that Riyadh had told Iraq, Yemen and Jordan to reduce their embassy staffs to no more than three diplomats. One official said the request had been issued 10 days ago.
Officials in Sana, the Yemeni capital, said that Riyadh had ordered out 30 Yemeni diplomats and 20 support staff. In Amman, officials said 20 Jordanian diplomats had been expelled.
King Hussein of Jordan denied the reports that 20 Jordanian diplomats had been asked to leave.
The Saudi Foreign Ministry statement cited ''flagrant infractions'' by foreign diplomats that ''undermine the security of the kingdom and its safety.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Excerpts From Iraqi Document on Meeting With U.S. Envoy

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
On July 25, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq summoned the United States Ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, to his office in the last high-level contact between the two Governments before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Here are excerpts from a document described by Iraqi Government officials as a transcript of the meeting, which also included the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. A copy was provided to The New York Times by ABC News, which translated it from the Arabic. The State Department has declined to comment on its accuracy.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: I have summoned you today to hold comprehensive political discussions with you. This is a message to President Bush.
You know that we did not have relations with the U.S. until 1984 and you know the circumstances and reasons which caused them to be severed. The decision to establish relations with the U.S. were taken in 1980 during the two months prior to the war between us and Iran. 
When the war started, and to avoid misinterpretation, we postponed the establishment of relations hoping that the war would end soon.
But because the war lasted for a long time, and to emphasize the fact that we are a nonaligned country, it was important to re-establish relations with the U.S. And we choose to do this in 1984.
It is natural to say that the U.S. is not like Britain, for example, with the latter's historic relations with Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq. In addition, there were no relations between Iraq and the U.S. between 1967 and 1984. One can conclude it would be difficult for the U.S. to have a full understanding of many matters in Iraq. When relations were re-established we hoped for a better understanding and for better cooperation because we too do not understand the background of many American decisions.
We dealt with each other during the war and we had dealings on various levels. The most important of those levels were with the foreign ministers.
 
U.S.-Iraq Rifts
 We had hoped for a better common understanding and a better chance of cooperation to benefit both our peoples and the rest of the Arab nations.
But these better relations have suffered from various rifts. The worst of these was in 1986, only two years after establishing relations, with what was known as Irangate, which happened during the year that Iran occupied the Fao peninsula.
It was natural then to say that old relations and complexity of interests could absorb many mistakes. But when interests are limited and relations are not that old, then there isn't a deep understanding and mistakes could leave a negative effect. Sometimes the effect of an error can be larger than the error itself.
Despite all of that, we accepted the apology, via his envoy, of the American President regarding Irangate, and we wiped the slate clean. And we shouldn't unearth the past except when new events remind us that old mistakes were not just a matter of coincidence.
Our suspicions increased after we liberated the Fao peninsula. The media began to involve itself in our politics. And our suspicions began to surface anew, because we began to question whether the U.S. felt uneasy with the outcome of the war when we liberated our land.
It was clear to us that certain parties in the United States - and I don't say the President himself - but certain parties who had links with the intelligence community and with the State Department - and I don't say the Secretary of State himself - I say that these parties did not like the fact that we liberated our land. Some parties began to prepare studies entitled, ''Who will succeed Saddam Hussein?'' They began to contact gulf states to make them fear Iraq, to persuade them not to give Iraq economic aid. And we have evidence of these activities.
 
Iraqi Policy on Oil
 Iraq came out of the war burdened with $40 billion debts, excluding the aid given by Arab states, some of whom consider that too to be a debt although they knew - and you knew too - that without Iraq they would not have had these sums and the future of the region would have been entirely different.
We began to face the policy of the drop in the price of oil. Then we saw the United States, which always talks of democracy but which has no time for the other point of view. Then the media campaign against Saddam Hussein was started by the official American media. The United States thought that the situation in Iraq was like Poland, Romania or Czechoslovakia. We were disturbed by this campaign but we were not disturbed too much because we had hoped that, in a few months, those who are decision makers in America would have a chance to find the facts and see whether this media campaign had had any effect on the lives of Iraqis. We had hoped that soon the American authorities would make the correct decision regarding their relations with Iraq. Those with good relations can sometinmes afford to disagree.
But when planned and deliberate policy forces the price of oil down without good commercial reasons, then that means another war against Iraq. Because military war kills people by bleeding them, and economic war kills their humanity by depriving them of their chance to have a good standard of living. As you know, we gave rivers of blood in a war that lasted eight years, but we did not lose our humanity. Iraqis have a right to live proudly. We do not accept that anyone could injure Iraqi pride or the Iraqi right to have high standards of living.
Kuwait and the U.A.E. were at the front of this policy aimed at lowering Iraq's position and depriving its people of higher economic standards. And you know that our relations with the Emirates and Kuwait had been good. On top of all that, while we were busy at war, the state of Kuwait began to expand at the expense of our territory.
You may say this is propaganda, but I would direct you to one document, the Military Patrol Line, which is the borderline endorsed by the Arab League in 1961 for military patrols not to cross the Iraq-Kuwait border.
But go and look for youselves. You will see the Kuwaiti border patrols, the Kuwaiti farms, the Kuwaiti oil installations - all built as closely as possible to this line to establish that land as Kuwaiti territory.
 
Conflicting Interests
 Since then, the Kuwaiti Government has been stable while the Iraqi Government has undergone many changes. Even after 1968 and for 10 years afterwards, we were too busy with our own problems. First in the north then the 1973 war, and other problems. Then came the war with Iran which started 10 years ago.
We believe that the United States must understand that people who live in luxury and economic security can reach an understanding with the United States on what are legitimate joint interests. But the starved and the economically deprived cannot reach the same understanding.
We do not accept threats from anyone because we do not threaten anyone. But we say clearly that we hope that the U.S. will not entertain too many illusions and will seek new friends rather than increase the number of its enemies.
I have read the American statements speaking of friends in the area. Of course, it is the right of everyone to choose their friends. We can have no objections. But you know you are not the ones who protected your friends during the war with Iran. I assure you, had the Iranians overrun the region, the American troops would not have stopped them, except by the use of nuclear weapons.
I do not belittle you. But I hold this view by looking at the geography and nature of American society into account. Yours is a society which cannot accept 10,000 dead in one battle.
You know that Iran agreed to the cease-fire not because the United States had bombed one of the oil platforms after the liberation of the Fao. Is this Iraq's reward for its role in securing the stability of the region and for protecting it from an unknown flood?
 
Protecting the Oil Flow
 So what can it mean when America says it will now protect its friends? It can only mean prejudice against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the U.A.E. and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights.
I say to you clearly that Iraq's rights, which are mentioned in the memorandum, we will take one by one. That might not happen now or after a month or after one year, but we will take it all. We are not the kind of people who will relinguish their rights. There is no historic right, or legitimacy, or need, for the U.A.E. and Kuwait to deprive us of our rights. If they are needy, we too are needy.
The United States must have a better understanding of the situation and declare who it wants to have relations with and who its enemies are. But it should not make enemies simply because others have different points of view regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict.
We clearly understand America's statement that it wants an easy flow of oil. We understand America saying that it seeks friendship with the states in the region, and to encourage their joint interests. But we cannot understand the attempt to encourage some parties to harm Iraq's interests.
The United States wants to secure the flow of oil. This is understandable and known. But it must not deploy methods which the United States says it disapproves of - flexing muscles and pressure.
If you use pressure, we will deploy pressure and force. We know that you can harm us although we do not threaten you. But we too can harm you. Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size. We cannot come all the way to you in the United States, but individual Arabs may reach you.
 
War and Friendship
 You can come to Iraq with aircraft and missiles but do not push us to the point where we cease to care. And when we feel that you want to injure our pride and take away the Iraqis' chance of a high standard of living, then we will cease to care and death will be the choice for us. Then we would not care if you fired 100 missiles for each missile we fired. Because without pride life would have no value.
It is not reasonable to ask our people to bleed rivers of blood for eight years then to tell them, ''Now you have to accept aggression from Kuwait, the U.A.E. or from the U.S. or from Israel.' ''
We do not put all these countries in the same boat. First, we are hurt and upset that such disagreement is taking place between us and Kuwait and the U.A.E. The solution must be found within an Arab framework and through direct bilateral relations. We do not place America among the enemies. We place it where we want our friends to be and we try to be friends. But repeated American statements last year made it apparent that America did not regard us as friends. Well the Americans are free.
When we seek friendship we want pride, liberty and our right to choose.
We want to deal according to our status as we deal with the others according to their statues.
We consider the others' interests while we look after our own. And we expect the others to consider our interests while they are dealing with their own. What does it mean when the Zionist war minister is summoned to the United States now? What do they mean, these fiery statements coming out of Israel during the past few days and the talk of war being expected now more than at any other time?
I do not believe that anyone would lose by making friends with Iraq. In my opinion, the American President has not made mistakes regarding the Arabs, although his decision to freeze dialogue with the P.L.O. was wrong. But it appears that this decision was made to appease the Zionist lobby or as a piece of strategy to cool the Zionist anger, before trying again. I hope that our latter conclusion is the correct one. But we will carry on saying it was the wrong decision.
You are appeasing the usurper in so many ways - economically, politically and militarily as well as in the media. When will the time come when, for every three appeasements to the usurper, you praise the Arabs just once?
APRIL GLASPIE: I thank you, Mr. President, and it is a great pleasure for a diplomat to meet and talk directly with the President. I clearly understand your message. We studied history at school. They taught us to say freedom or death. I think you know well that we as a people have our experience with the colonialists.
Mr. President, you mentioned many things during this meeting which I cannot comment on on behalf of my Government. But with your permission, I will comment on two points. You spoke of friendship and I believe it was clear from the letters sent by our President to you on the occasion of your National Day that he emphasizes -- HUSSEIN: He was kind and his expressions met with our regard and respect.
 
Directive on Relations
 GLASPIE: As you know, he directed the United States Administration to reject the suggestion of implementing trade sanctions.
HUSSEIN: There is nothing left for us to buy from America. Only wheat. Because every time we want to buy something, they say it is forbidden. I am afraid that one day you will say, ''You are going to make gunpowder out of wheat.''
GLASPIE: I have a direct instruction from the President to seek better relations with Iraq.
HUSSEIN: But how? We too have this desire. But matters are running contrary to this desire.
GLASPIE: This is less likely to happen the more we talk. For example, you mentioned the issue of the article published by the American Information Agency and that was sad. And a formal apology was presented.
HUSSEIN: Your stance is generous. We are Arabs. It is enough for us that someone says, ''I am sorry, I made a mistake.'' Then we carry on. But the media campaign continued. And it is full of stories. If the stories were true, no one would get upset. But we understand from its continuation that there is a determination.
GLASPIE: I saw the Diane Sawyer program on ABC. And what happened in that program was cheap and unjust. And this is a real picture of what happens in the American media - even to American politicians themselves. These are the methods the Western media employs. I am pleased that you add your voice to the diplomats who stand up to the media. Because your appearance in the media, even for five minutes, would help us to make the American people understand Iraq. This would increase mutual understanding. If the American President had control of the media, his job would be much easier.
Mr. President, not only do I want to say that President Bush wanted better and deeper relations with Iraq, but he also wants an Iraqi contribution to peace and prosperity in the Middle East. President Bush is an intelligent man. He is not going to declare an economic war against Iraq.
You are right. It is true what you say that we do not want higher prices for oil. But I would ask you to examine the possibility of not charging too high a price for oil.
HUSSEIN: We do not want too high prices for oil. And I remind you that in 1974 I gave Tariq Aziz the idea for an article he wrote which criticized the policy of keeping oil prices high. It was the first Arab article which expressed this view.
 
Shifting Price of Oil
 TARIQ AZIZ: Our policy in OPEC opposes sudden jumps in oil prices.
 HUSSEIN: Twenty-five dollars a barrel is not a high price.
 GLASPIE: We have many Americans who would like to see the price go above $25 because they come from oil-producing states.
HUSSEIN: The price at one stage had dropped to $12 a barrel and a reduction in the modest Iraqi budget of $6 billion to $7 billion is a disaster.
GLASPIE: I think I understand this. I have lived here for years. I admire your extraordinary efforts to rebuild your country. I know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait.
I was in the American Embassy in Kuwait during the late 60's. The instruction we had during this period was that we should express no opinion on this issue and that the issue is not associated with America. James Baker has directed our official spokesmen to emphasize this instruction. We hope you can solve this problem using any suitable methods via Klibi or via President Mubarak. All that we hope is that these issues are solved quickly. With regard to all of this, can I ask you to see how the issue appears to us?
My assessment after 25 years' service in this area is that your objective must have strong backing from your Arab brothers. I now speak of oil. But you, Mr. President, have fought through a horrific and painful war. Frankly, we can only see that you have deployed massive troops in the south. Normally that would not be any of our business. But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned. And for this reason, I received an instruction to ask you, in the spirit of friendship - not in the spirit of confrontation - regarding your intentions.
I simply describe the concern of my Government. And I do not mean that the situation is a simple situation. But our concern is a simple one.
HUSSEIN: We do not ask people not to be concerned when peace is at issue. This is a noble human feeling which we all feel. It is natural for you as a superpower to be concerned. But what we ask is not to express your concern in a way that would make an aggressor believe that he is getting support for his aggression.
We want to find a just solution which will give us our rights but not deprive others of their rights. But at the same time, we want the others to know that our patience is running out regarding their action, which is harming even the milk our children drink, and the pensions of the widow who lost her husband during the war, and the pensions of the orphans who lost their parents.
As a country, we have the right to prosper. We lost so many opportunities, and the others should value the Iraqi role in their protection. Event this Iraqi [the President points to the interpreter] feels bitter like all other Iraqis. We are not aggressors but we do not accept aggression either. We sent them envoys and handwritten letters. We tried everything. We asked the Servant of the Two Shrines - King Fahd - to hold a four-member summit, but he suggested a meeting between the Oil Ministers. We agreed. And as you know, the meeting took place in Jidda. They reached an agreement which did not express what we wanted, but we agreed.
Only two days after the meeting, the Kuwaiti Oil Minister made a statement that contradicted the agreement. We also discussed the issue during the Baghdad summit. I told the Arab Kings and Presidents that some brothers are fighting an economic war against us. And that not all wars use weapons and we regard this kind of war as a military action against us. Because if the capability of our army is lowered then, if Iran renewed the war, it could achieve goals which it could not achieve before. And if we lowered the standard of our defenses, then this could encourage Israel to attack us. I said that before the Arab Kings and Presidents. Only I did not mention Kuwait and U.A.E. by name, because they were my guests.
Before this, I had sent them envoys reminding them that our war had included their defense. Therefore the aid they gave us should not be regarded as a debt. We did no more than the United States would have done against someone who attacked its interests.
I talked about the same thing with a number of other Arab states. I explained the situation to brother King Fahd a few times, by sending envoys and on the telephone. I talked with brother King Hussein and with Sheik Zaid after the conclusion of the summit. I walked with the Sheik to the plane when he was leaving Mosul. He told me, ''Just wait until I get home.'' But after he had reached his destination, the statements that came from there were very bad - not from him, but from his Minister of Oil.
Also after the Jidda agreement, we received some intelligence that they were talking of sticking to the agreement for two months only. Then they would change their policy. Now tell us, if the American President found himself in this situation, what would he do? I said it was very difficult for me to talk about these issues in public. But we must tell the Iraqi people who face economic difficulties who was responsible for that.
 
Talks With Mubarak
 GLASPIE: I spent four beautiful years in Egypt.
 HUSSEIN: The Egyptian people are kind and good and ancient. The oil people are supposed to help the Egyptian people, but they are mean beyond belief. It is painful to admit it, but some of them are disliked by Arabs because of their greed.
GLASPIE: Mr. President, it would be helpful if you could give us an assessment of the effort made by your Arab brothers and whether they have achieved anything.
HUSSEIN:. On this subject, we agreed with President Mubarak that the Prime Minister of Kuwait would meet with the deputy chairman of the Revolution Command Council in Saudi Arabia, because the Saudis initiated contact with us, aided by President Mubarak's efforts. He just telephoned me a short while ago to say the Kuwaitis have agreed to that suggestion. GLASPIE: Congratulations. HUSSEIN: A protocol meeting will be held in Saudi Arabia. Then the meeting will be transferred to Baghdad for deeper discussion directly between Kuwait and Iraq. We hope we will reach some result. We hope that the long-term view and the real interests will overcome Kuwaiti greed.
GLASPIE: May I ask you when you expect Sheik Saad to come to Baghdad?
HUSSEIN: I suppose it would be on Saturday or Monday at the latest. I told brother Mubarak that the agreement should be in Baghdad Saturday or Sunday. You know that brother Mubarak's visits have always been a good omen.
GLASPIE: This is good news. Congratulations.
Brother President Mubarak told me they were scared. They said troops were only 20 kilometers north of the Arab League line. I said to him that regardless of what is there, whether they are police, border guards or army, and regardless of how many are there, and what they are doing, assure the Kuwaitis and give them our word that we are not going to do anything until we meet with them. When we meet and when we see that there is hope, then nothing will happen. But if we are unable to find a solution, then it will be natural that Iraq will not accept death, even though wisdom is above everything else. There you have good news. AZIZ: This is a journalistic exclusive. GLASPIE: I am planning to go to the United States next Monday. I hope I will meet with President Bush in Washington next week. I thought to postpone my trip because of the difficulties we are facing. But now I will fly on Monday.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 30, 1990, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, excerpts last Sunday from a document described by the Iraqi Government as a transcript of a meeting between President Saddam Hussein and the United States Ambassador to Iraq misattributed some remarks. The following remarks should have been attributed to President Hussein, not to Ambassador April C. Glaspie:
Brother President Mubarak told me they were scared. They said troops were only 20 kilometers north of the Arab League line. I said to him that regardless of what is there, whether they are police, border guards or army, and regardless of how many are there, and what they are doing, assure the Kuwaitis and give them our word that we are not going to do anything until we meet with them. When we meet and when we see that there is hope, then nothing will happen. But if we are unable to find a solution, then it will be natural that Iraq will not accept death, even though wisdom is above everything else. There you have good news.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Israel Has a Unique Deal for U.S. Aid

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Sometime before Oct. 30, the Treasury will write a check to Israel for $1.2 billion. The money, almost half of the $3 billion in economic and military aid that the United States gives Israel every year, will be quietly deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and immediately start earning interest at about 8 percent.
The remaining $1.8 billion goes to the Pentagon, and a trust fund that pays for McDonnell Douglas F-15's, General Dynamics Stinger missiles, Hughes Aircraft TOW antitank missiles, FMC Bradley fighting vehicles and other goods that Israel buys from American military contractors.
This system, used only for Israel, opens the spigots for millions of dollars of interest, in effect, added aid that does not go through the appropriations process. But it is only one way military assistance to Jerusalem is different from arms transactions with Saudi Arabia, Egypt or any of the other countries playing a central role in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
 
Balance of Power
The arrangements with Israel have attracted attention during the gulf crisis. Israel has asked the Administration for additional military aid this year to help it maintain its traditional military edge in the Middle East, especially with the planned sales of $21 billion in American arms to Saudi Arabia.
The Saudis will pay cash for any arms they buy. But when Israel buys F-15's, McDonnell Douglas bills the Israeli trust fund, financed by American tax dollars, at the Pentagon.
Egypt receives somewhat less American aid than Israel - $815 million in economic support and $1.3 billion of military assistance - but Egypt, a developing country with a far lower living standard than Israel, gets much less in actual cash and none of it up front. So Cairo has less freedom to maneuver than Jerusalem.
It was as a reward for its cooperation in the gulf crisis that President Bush announced new aid for Egypt with his recent proposal to forgive $6.7 billion of Egyptian debt.
But that initiative is running into trouble among members of both parties in Congress, who see it prompting a wave of similar requests from other countries, including Israel and Poland, and worsening already serious American budget problems.
 
Favors Built In
Lawmakers and their aides said the special favors for Israel that have been built into foreign assistance laws are in recognition of the close strategic and political ties of the two democracies.
An Administration official called the assistance ''an integral part of efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East.''
Robert J. Kurz, a guest scholar and foreign aid specialist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy research group, noted: ''In terms of the scope of our aid program, the differences are marginal, but they are important to the Israelis. That they are embodied in law reflects the strong bipartisan support commanded by Israel in Congress.''
The interest that Israel can now earn on its $1.2 billion Economic Support Fund from the United States grows out of an an initiative in the mid-1980's by Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, and Senator Bob Kasten Jr., Republican of Wisconsin.
Pinhas Dror, Israel's Minister of Economic Affairs, said the interest accumulated at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York totaled $76.7 million last year.
Israel is free to use the cash as it sees fit. Mr. Dror's accounts, which were submitted in a letter to the State Department's Bureau for Asia and the Near East, showed that the bulk of the fund - nearly $1 billion - went to payments of interest and principle on military debts to the United States.
 
Other Uses for the Money
The money was also used for grain purchases and transport, debt repayments to the World Bank, procurements by Israel's Ministry of Health, and loan repayments to the Agency for International Development, the foreign aid branch of the State Department.
Congress has effectively insured Israel against the aid-cutoff threats that have confronted Egypt in recent years - another factor in the President's decision to wipe out Egypt's debt. Under the 1975 Brooke-Alexander amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, countries in arrears more than a year on military and economic loans lose all American aid, except food assistance.
To help Israel avoid this possible trap, Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, got Congress to state as a matter of policy in 1984 that Israel's economic assistance every year will be at least as much as its annual payments to the United States.
Egypt has no such assurances. It has had to come up with about $750 million in interest and amortization on its American debt and has always been just at the edge of the Brooke-Alexander deadline.
Israel's Economic Support Fund cash from the United States more than covers the $1 billion of interest and amortization that it still has to pay on $4.5 billion of debt to the United States.

HEADLINE: SOME BOAT PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNED

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Vietnam, Britain and the United Nations refugee commission have reached an agreement on the repatriation of Vietnamese boat people from camps in Hong Kong.
Officials representing Hanoi, London, Hong Kong and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees initialed a statement late Friday that laid out steps in the new program.
The statement said the goal of the program was to send back those Vietnamese ''who, while not volunteering to return to Vietnam, are nevertheless not opposed to repatriation.'' 
The agreement, initialed at the end of three days of talks in Hanoi, gives the United Nations commission an important role in insuring that there is no coercion. The commission has said that it will not endorse forcible repatriation.
 
'Significant Step' Seen
A British spokesman said today that the agreement marked a significant step toward resolving the situation of the Vietnamese boat people.
''It opens up the possibility of increasing the rate of returns'' of Vietnamese from Hong Kong, he said.
The agreement covers only Hong Kong. The British crown colony is holding in camps an estimated 54,000 people who are seeking asylum. Most do not qualify as refugees under international criteria and are ineligible for resettlement in the West.
There are also thousands of Vietnamese in camps in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
Under the new agreement, the United Nations commission will submit to the Vietnamese Government lists of people to be repatriated from Hong Kong. Hanoi will then have one month to confirm the lists and authorize the people's return.
 
Vietnam Has Reacted Cautiously
Hanoi, which is trying to break out of its political and economic isolation, has been reluctant to take part in any program considered inhumane.
It came under heavy criticism from the United States when it allowed Britain to send back 51 boat people from Hong Kong in December 1989. The members of the group were awakened and taken to the airport in the middle of the night.
The British spokesman said the agreement had been initialed by Deputy Foreign Secretary Vu Khoan of Vietnam; Ambassador Emrys Davies of Britain; Sergio Vieira de Mello, the aide in official of the United Nations High Commissioner's office in Geneva with responsibility for Asia, and Alistair Asprey, Hong Kong's Secretary for Security.
Under a United Nations voluntary return program begun in March 1989, 4,361 boat people have returned to Vietnam. But countries playing host to the boat people said that program was moving too slowly.

HEADLINE: U.S. Diplomats Return in Force to Nicaragua

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Sept. 22

 BODY:
On the southern edge of Managua, workers are readying an office building for a tenant that is determined to change the neighborhood.
The building is one of the city's biggest. The reported rent, $1 million for three years, is the highest anybody here can remember. And the tenant would have been unthinkable a year ago: the United States Government. 
After a decade of little more than a token American presence here, United States diplomats and other official personnel have begun to return to Nicaragua in numbers unseen since relations between the two countries collapsed with the start of the guerrilla effort by the United States-backed contras.
Welcomed by the country's new, pro-American Government and kept busy with $300 million in American aid this year alone, the United States diplomatic mission here has increased abruptly from a low of 8 members last December to more than 60 diplomats and development officials today.
The influx has been overseen by Harry W. Shlaudeman, a veteran Foreign Service officer who was called out of retirement by President Bush to become the first American Ambassador here since Richard W. Melton and seven other embassy diplomats were expelled in July 1988.
''There's been a tremendous change from the embattled atmosphere of the past,'' said Stedman D. Howard, the new embassy spokesman. ''There's also the sense of starting all over.''
 
Envoys Were Harassed
In a decade as representatives of a superpower that was essentially at war with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista Government, American diplomats here were followed, restricted to specified areas, ridiculed in official newspapers and broadcasts, and menaced by mobs.
But the embassy's isolation here was outstripped only by the scant attention it was paid by its own Government through most of the war. Having defined Nicaraguan politics as part of a broader East-West conflict, diplomats say, neither the Reagan Administration nor the Bush Administration placed much store in their beleaguered outpost.
With the election in February of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, whose candidacy received strong American support, the embassy's status changed overnight.
But Nicaraguan politicians say the rapid resurgence in the official American presence here has been tempered by caution about appearing to dominate Mrs. Chamorro's fledgling Government, or recalling America's ubiquitous influence over the former dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
The embassy's political activities focus almost exclusively on the small circle of advisers surrounding Mrs. Chamorro.
The embassy's principal message, other foreign diplomats say, has been that Nicaragua's economy must be revived if the new President is to have any hope of long-term political survival. And they say that after Washington's apparent 10-year preference for confronting Sandinista influence through military means, economic emphasis seems to have become the cutting edge of the American approach.

Course in Korean Draws 80 Students On Its First Day

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
After eight years of student lobbying, Yale College has begun offering a course in Korean language study, and the response has been overwhelming.
The administration had predicted that 40 students might take the course, elementary Korean, but more than 80 undergraduates attended the first day, cramming into a room meant for a much smaller number. Most students in the class are Korean-Americans, interested in ''learning the language of their ancestors,'' said Prof. Samuel Martin, director of the program. 
''Yale was the first place where I saw a lot of Korean faces, and that raised my ethnic consciousness,'' said Christopher Park, a junior majoring in molecular biophysics and biochemistry. ''A lot of people at Yale ask questions about how Korean they are or how American they are. Studying the language is a way to get a greater understanding of who we are and where we come from.''
Although final figures are not in, the course appears more popular than both courses in Japanese and Chinese, the two longstanding language offerings in the East Asian Studies department. Each year, about 20 undergraduates begin studying Japanese and about 50 take first-year Chinese.
 
Two Sections Added
The course's unexpected popularity left Professor Martin scrambling to find instructors for two additional sections, including a class for advanced beginners.
Korean-American Students at Yale, a group representing an estimated 200 Korean-American undergraduates, led the eight-year effort to introduce Korean to the curriculum.
''When I applied to Yale, I had no idea that it didn't have Korean,'' Mr. Park, of San Antonio, said. ''When I found out, I thought, 'Why do we need to have Swahili and Serbo-Croatian when we don't offer Korean?' ''
Some first-year students have Korean-speaking parents and can understand conversations in the language. But most have no reading or writing ability in Korean, Professor Martin said.
 
Program Expected to Grow
Professor Martin predicts that the program will grow. For several years in the late 1940's and early 1950's, the Federal Government sponsored Korean-language classes at Yale, attended by State Department employees, missionaries, military personnel and a few graduate students. The Government stopped financing for the class about the time of the Korean War, and Yale phased out the program, Professor Martin said.
Now, undergraduate interest is rising, he added, because of the large number of Korean-Americans at Yale, the longstanding foreign language requirement and Korea's emergence as an economic power.
''As people become more conscious of what's going on in the world, the name Korea will be more widely recognized,'' said John S. Lee, a junior majoring in economics and political science from Fairbanks, Alaska. ''Also, there is a lot of economic potential for business people in Korea, so it makes sense for them to know the language.''
Although the East Asian studies department will include an intermediate language course in Korean next year, a tight budget will prevent Yale from expanding Korean studies into other disciplines, Professor Martin said.
Some members of the Korean studies task force believe money is not the main issue. During their years of lobbying the administration, students were often told that ''Korea isn't an important enough country to study,'' said Yun Won Cho, a former leader of the task force.
''It reaches a point where it's ridiculous,'' said Ms. Cho, a senior from Whippany, N.J. In her four years as a history major, she said, she found only one class on Korean history, and it was last offered two years ago.
''It's not as if Yale doesn't have the money,'' she said, ''or as if the scholars aren't out there to recruit.''

HEADLINE: Campus Life: Harvard;
Athletes Invoke Muse To Fight a Stereotype

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
''Most people have misconceptions about us jocks, with our tiny brains and our sweaty socks,'' proclaimed halfback Mike Agrillo, pacing before the statue of John Harvard in the college's Yard last weekend.
Reciting his poem, ''Jocks Are People, Too,'' to 70 listeners, he continued:
 
We sweat and grunt and drink much beer,
So what exactly does everyone fear?
We're not brain-dead, our souls are alive.
What other poet can run the 40 in under 4 point 5?
For as it is, our hearts are blue,
But ladies please know that jocks are people, too.
With this poetry recital, Mr. Agrillo, a government major from Bethpage, L.I., and four other self-described ''poet-athletes,'' all freshmen, started a new Harvard organization called ''Athletes for the Cultural Development of the Community.'' The group, clad in neckties, sunglasses, sandals and togas, played rock music on a tape player and led cheers between each piece of the half-hour event, which ended at 11 P.M. 
 
'Serious, Yet Informal'
The master of ceremonies, Mike Betsy, a football offensive guard from Park Ridge, N.J., began the recitations with a statement of the organization's purpose: ''To give all students a chance to enjoy original and attributed works in a serious, yet informal, setting.''
Guido Giordano, a soccer goalie from Glendale, Calif., who intends to major in biochemistry, read Shakespeare's sonnet ''Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day?'' while kneeling and clasping the hand of a young woman who had volunteered from the audience.
Then, still on bended knee, with arms outstretched, Mr. Betsy followed with his own version of the sonnet:
 
I would compare thee to a summer's day,
But when dusk comes, its beauty goes away;
Your beauty lasts the whole day through.
I would compare thee to the dew-covered grass
Where lovers frolic and lovers pass,
But when winter comes it freezes tight,
Yet the fire in your eyes still blazes bright.
I would compare thee to the blue sky above
Where couples gaze and fall in love,
But when stern clouds come it turns to gray,
While your beauty never fades away.
''I put what Shakespeare was trying to say in layman's terms -something 'even a jock could understand,' as they say,'' said Mr. Betsy. He said the group planned to hold semimonthly recitations.
 
'Sensitive Intellectuals'
Much of their subject matter - in the words of Phil Kelley, a football split-end from Foxboro, Mass. - concerns ''love and portraying athletes as sensitive intellectuals.'' Mr. Kelley, who plans to major in economics, read his own poems, including ''If I Could Just Moor in Thy Harbor Tonight'' and ''Ode to the Big Toe on My Right Foot.''
Derek Maguire, a hockey defenseman from Randolph, N.J., who will major in engineering, acted out ''The Red Wheelbarrow'' by William Carlos Williams.
''Derek's spontaneous recital of the poem among his friends was the spark that set the fire going, so to speak,'' Mr. Betsy said later. ''Maguire is really shy. He had the poem memorized from high school. When he first recited it to us, we knew we had to get him to recite it to everyone.''
Mr. Betsy, who plans a biochemistry major and pre-med studies, concluded the event with a serenade-style ''Ode to Shelley,'' delivered not to the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, but to Shelley McDonough, a first-year student from Rockland, Mass., in the audience.
 
Oh Shelley
My love for you is as eternal as the stars in the sky,
Or so I wish.
But alas, I must see through the guise and know
That all things must come to pass.
Oh Shelley my love for you is like a ripened fruit on the vine.
It is a beautiful sight to gaze upon from afar,
Yet once picked, time becomes precious.
For though the fruit of love is sweet,
We are always left with the pits.
But if pits are treated with love and affection,
They can blossom into Mother Nature's perfection,
And our tree can bear the thing
That only my lovely Shelley can bring.
 
'A Haven for Athletes'
''The group has since received half a dozen unsolicited poems from other poet-athletes for us to read at the next session,'' Mr. Betsy said. ''We've become a haven for athletes who were previously afraid to let their literary talents show.''
He compared the discrimination suffered by athletes to that suffered by ''those people considered too academic or intellectual.'' Their interests are represented by the Harvard Society of Nerds and Geeks, founded last year by Jeremy Kahn, a senior from New York City.
Mr. Kahn, who is also the president of the Society of Nerds and Geeks (SONG), said of the new group: ''It's a wonderful idea. I've been on the wrestling team for a couple of years - sort of J.V. - and would be interested to know when these poetry recitals are held. I'm a little curious at the extent of discrimination that athletes have experienced and would actually be willing to have some sort of dialogue between SONG and this group.''
Mr. Betsy said: ''I never felt discrimination as an athlete before, but when I got to Harvard, I found I was looked down upon for playing a sport. I wasn't going to quit my sport, so I figured I'd better change the image before the school year officially got under way.''

HEADLINE: THE NEW TRIBALISM;
Changing Demographics

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Richard Bernstein described the aptly named new tribalism, but didn't explain why it is occurring. It is occurring because minority racial and ethnic groups represent an increasing share of our population. As recently as 1960, 9 out of 10 Americans were white. But by the end of this decade non-Hispanic whites will account for fewer than three in four Americans and only 68 percent of the population under 35.
According to Census Bureau estimates, non-Hispanic white males now account for just 37 percent of our population, and that share will continue to decrease. What Mr. Bernstein perceives as a ''cult of otherness'' is really the recognition among ''others,'' i.e., other than white male, that their groups have become large enough in terms of numbers and economic power to stop defining themselves in terms established by what they perceive as ''other.''
I expect a good 20 years of pushing and shoving, both literal and metaphorical, until we adjust to the new realities of racial, ethnic and gender power.

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
The Laurels Are Appropriate, but Is the Sponsor?

BYLINE: By Jennifer Dunning

 BODY:
The Bessie Awards ceremony is an annual gathering of the clan, created by Dance Theater Workshop seven years ago to honor outstanding experimentalist performers, choreographers, designers and composers. This year it became a circling of wagons, as troubling questions about the sponsorship of the Bessies were raised by the resignation of the ceremony's two hosts just before the Sept. 12 event.
Dance is still seen as a comparatively marginal art in the United States. Most marginal of all is the kind of ''downtown'' experimentalist dance and performance art produced by Dance Theater Workshop and Performance Space 122, both leading dance organizations in Manhattan, though the work represents some of the most interesting and innovative being done in the city today. It is to this part of the dance spectrum that the Bessies have brought some much-needed, validating glamour. 
Part of the appeal surrounding the ceremony, which took place this year at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's handsome opera house, lies in the fact that two of its major sponsors are Philip Morris, which provided $6,000 worth of printing services and a last-minute $10,000 challenge grant when it seemed that money woes might sink the event, and Morgan Guaranty Trust, which gave backing for the prizes themselves, also called New York Dance and Performance Awards. Both companies are longtime supporters of the Bessies, which are named after Bessie Schonberg, chairwoman emeritus of the dance department at Sarah Lawrence College and a noted teacher. Philip Morris also contributes general operating support to Dance Theater Workshop.
But therein lay the peril. Philip Morris has been a major contributor to the election campaigns of Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina, who has been a leader in the fight to restrict the National Endowment for the Arts. It has also contributed a five-year grant of $200,000 to the planned Jesse Helms Citizenship Center in Monroe, N. C. Philip Morris's partial sponsorship of the Bessies was the reason that Karen Finley, a performance artist who was recently denied an N.E.A. grant, resigned as host of the ceremony. The other host, Danitra Vance, subsequently resigned for the same reason. Though no reason was given for the denial of grants to Ms. Finley and three other applicants, it is widely believed that the awards were withdrawn because the sexual content of the artists' work was considered to be obscene by Senator Helms and other conservative politicians. Moreover, the Senator's increasingly strong attacks against homosexuals have been especially painful to a professional community that has traditionally offered an unjudgmental haven to gay men and lesbians, and to an art that has been so devastated by AIDS.
''My feeling at this point is that we are engaged in a war of symbols with the right wing,'' said C. Carr, a writer for The Village Voice and a member of the 23-member awards committee, in a press conference at Dance Theater Workshop last month. ''To me, accepting money from Philip Morris becomes a symbolic act. Because of the current climate, everything becomes politicized. My hope has been that the Bessies could proceed without Philip Morris's money.''
At the award ceremony, an excerpt from ''Meanwhile,'' written and performed by Paul Zaloom, used zany props to represent all the participants in the predicament. And Ms. Finley and Ms. Vance's statements have been free of the prescriptive, morally superior tone that has characterized the discourse of some other Helms opponents. Ms. Finley, who has contributed the $1,500 from her 1990 Bessie Award to the campaign of Harvey Gantt, Senator Helms's challenger in the North Carolina race, said simply that she had felt physically ill when she received her invitation to the Bessies and saw Philip Morris's name displayed as a sponsor.
But, to paraphrase a gay-rights slogan, Philip Morris is everywhere. Ms. Finley herself performed this summer in the Serious Fun festival at Lincoln Center and again last week at the Joyce Theater. Both institutions receive support from Philip Morris, which this year has given $15 million to arts enterprises ranging from American Ballet Theater to the Franklin Furnace, an embattled SoHo experimental arts center committed to presenting controversial material. And at the recent Senate hearings on the future of the Endowment, one of the most impassioned and informed calls for continuing the Endowment came from Karen Brosius, manager of cultural affairs at Philip Morris.
But in addition to Senator Helms, Philip Morris continues to support several other outspoken enemies of the Endowment, although it has also given money to more liberal politicians sympathetic to the industries in which it does business. When asked why Philip Morris had not also donated money to the campaign of Mr. Gantt, the first black mayor of Charlotte, a company spokesman said that the corporation does not contribute to more than one candidate in a race.
''Senator Helms has been extremely supportive,'' Guy L. Smith 4th, vice president of corporate affairs at Philip Morris, said in a recent conversation. ''And he is in a position to be of help to us, because of his seniority and his willingness to use parliamentary procedures to his - and our industry's - advantage.''
The best art is seldom pragmatic. And Dance Theater Workshop and its director, David White, have long been among the most idealistic advocates for dance and dancers. Mr. White has made extraordinary - and successful - efforts to improve the living conditions and morale of those in dance who are among the most needy, and he has worked hard to get national recognition for work that has often received scant attention from the public and the media. Dance Theater Workshop is clearly endangered by dwindling financial support. The dance world cannot afford to lose instititutions like it - or the kinds of public discourse it has inspired.
It certainly would have been possible to hold this year's Bessie ceremony in Tompkins Square Park, as was suggested, to avoid accepting money from Philip Morris. But a good deal of the point of the event would have been lost. Dance institutions could also scrutinize the policies of corporations that give them money more carefully, though it might be hard to find completely ''untainted'' support. And the reality is that the arts have become more dependent on private support, particularly because grants for dance have not increased over the past five years and because donations from the private sector are shrinking in the current economic climate.
''By merely switching the emphasis of the perception, the burden of the problem shifts,'' the composer Stuart Diamond recently wrote. ''If Karen Finley did host the Bessie Awards and happily acknowledged the support of Philip Morris at the Joyce Theater, then it can be argued that Philip Morris generously supports artists who produce works that are deemed 'obscene and pornographic' by the National Endowment for the Arts. Then it becomes Jesse Helms's problem. Why is the Helms museum accepting contributions from a corporation that supports such 'lewd and dangerous' artists? It's all in the language.'' And that is one of the sagest comments on the Bessies issue.

At 100, Carnegie Is Still the Place to Get To

BYLINE: By DONAL HENAHAN

 BODY:
As Carnegie Hall prepares to open its centennial season Wednesday night, there may be no better moment to toast not only the health of the dowager queen of American concert halls but the durable values she typifies. Carnegie was designed according to an ancient and honorable esthetic that increasingly shows signs of returning to fashion: it is primarily a place to listen to specific kinds of music (classical is the inexact but useful word) in a civilized atmosphere. By design and in practice a hall best suited for symphony orchestras, it survives and thrives as a rebuke to the all-purpose auditoriums that sprang up all across America a generation ago and that still disfigure the musical landscape.
A couple of decades ago it all appeared so simple. Our symphony halls and opera houses, like the musical institutions they housed, were done for. Their counterparts in past centuries, we were reminded, had bowed to historical imperatives and disappeared or changed almost beyond recognition. Why should the 20th century be any different? 
It was not really a chilling prospect for most of us that the American concert hall would in time be one with Nineveh and Tyre. Probably no one but antiquarians, after all, would think it useful to mourn the loss of the Athenian agora, the Roman arena or the Esterhaza music room - gathering places that helped define the societies that produced them but whose time is long and irretrievably past. Churches, which gave birth to concert halls, do survive in some recognizable form. But churches too are all but finished as creative music centers: they can hardly pretend to be the artistic force they were in Palestrina's or Bach's time, or even in Bruckner's.
But change rarely comes fast enough for those who yearn for apocalypse now. Pierre Boulez, annoyed that the world was taking its time about embracing his music and adopting the drastic esthetic changes that he and fellow avant-gardists espoused, once suggested blowing up all the major opera houses as the best solution to the problem. Other advanced thinkers of the time predicted that artists of the future would not be caught dead in a traditionally configured concert hall, but would be out in the streets improvising happenings for the art-hungry masses. Amplification, video and other technical wonders were already making this expansion of the tribal village possible. One particularly visionary composer dramatized his alienation from the traditional concert venues by performing his electronic works under water in a swimming pool.
More temperately, Leonard Bernstein, stepping down as music director of the New York Philharmonic, pondered in print whether the symphony orchestra - a creature born in the 18th century and surviving in the 20th like an appendix - could have any future. Faced with that somber question from a distinguished valedictorian, the concerned reader logically had to question whether there continued to be a need for the buildings that housed these cultural anachronisms. Not likely. Obviously, rethinking was in order. And so, reflecting a social outlook increasingly receptive to Gordian-knot solutions, cultural movers and shakers all across the nation went into action. In New York, the shabby but historic old Metropolitan Opera House was torn down and replaced in the mid-60's by a glassy faced Xanadu at Lincoln Center. Carnegie Hall itself was reprieved from death row in the 1960 only through the last-minute efforts of Isaac Stern and a few other doughty and appalled citizens, with results that most sensible people now applaud but that at the time were far from certain.
With lemminglike determination, cities of every size and cultural condition also began to abandon their old but viable halls and theaters in favor of erecting performing arts centers in apparent response to the Lincoln Center model. The central feature of these complexes was usually a bleakly utilitarian auditorium capable of seating half the town. Meant to suit a variety of performance types, it typically satisfied none. The ideal architect of the period, it seemed, was one who could design an acoustically dead hall for symphony audiences in which 5,000 or 10,000 pop-music customers also could be comfortably accommodated and a ballet dancer's toes were clearly visible from all seats. Civic planners and politicians, as the joke went, were in the grip of an edifice complex.
Inevitably, as it now seems, a few thoughtful community leaders began to react against this frenzy for piling up concrete and marble in the name of the arts. Unsuspected or forgotten qualities began to be discovered in time-worn music halls and theaters. In Chicago the monumental Auditorium Theater, the work of Frank Lloyd Wright's student Louis Sullivan, was painstakingly restored after decades of lying in ruin. (During World War II, its main floor had served as a bowling alley for servicemen.) Ornate movie houses, abandoned in the wake of the television revolution, were rescued from the wreckers and remodeled for orchestras and other performance organizations. The Detroit Symphony's 71-year-old Orchestra Hall, abandoned for half a century and saved from destruction only in 1970, was restored just the other day to its original appearance and function. St. Louis, long in need of a home for its orchestra, refurbished a handsome old movie palace and renamed it Powell Symphony Hall. The same strategy was followed in New Orleans and elsewhere.
Although not as commercially attractive as the real-estate-driven arts centers, the restored halls projected a sense of classical dignity and continuity that the grander projects could not hope to match. Even with the acoustical changes that resulted from its recent remodeling, for example, Carnegie remains a more satisfying place to experience music than any other hall in New York. Granted, it has lost some of its legendary aura, no longer challenging in that respect America's acoustical paragon, Symphony Hall in Boston. (Boston so far has resisted the urge to renovate its 90-year-old hall, possibly with Carnegie's vexing experience in mind, but the pressures to do so are sure to increase.) With such preserved treasures as Symphony Hall and Carnegie as models, an almost outmoded artistic esthetic has slipped back into fashion: specific spaces for specific musical purposes. Symphony orchestras, architects and acoustical engineers have been persuaded, need to play in their own humanly scaled music rooms that deliver traditionally rich and resonant sounds, not the hard-edged tones of simulated hi-fi.
Reversing the megalomanic trend of the arts-complex period, new halls are now being conceived with these and other hopeful visions in mind. The Minnesota Orchestra built a particularly successful single-purpose hall for itself in Minneapolis. The Philadelphia Orchestra has one in the works to replace the historic but acoustically dry Academy of Music. Dallas, with its visually plain but aurally gracious Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, provides an especially instructive and heartening example of how some designers are approaching the problem: the I. M. Pei structure, for which Russell Johnson was the acoustician, can be adjusted for various performance requirements, chiefly by regulating the volume of hidden sound chambers that ring the hall. In fact, built-in tuning devices, a much-ridiculed feature of New York's Philharmonic Hall at its infamous opening in 1962 (remember those adjustable ''clouds'' of the original design?) might be the sound wave of the future in concert hall technology.
Is it important or necessary that America's concert halls continue to exist into the 21st century or beyond? That will be for implacable history to decide. For a congeries of social, economic and - yes, occasionally artistic - reasons, both the concert hall and the symphony orchestra that traditionally has been its most prestigious occupant proliferated and prospered in this country as nowhere else in the world. For a century, the hall designed for serious music has been a certification of civic status. Any American city that pretends to national significance must have at least one and New York is no exception.
Of late, New York's daily sins have tended to command the spotlight, but time is short and art is long. The city still can point to an unrivaled history of musical virtue, which this season's celebration of the Carnegie century should put into sharp focus.

HEADLINE: TV VIEW;
Our War the Way It Was

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman

 BODY:
Its theme - the clash of countrymen, of brothers - resounds through world myth. The battles were terrible, the casualties beyond imagining. Its heroes live more vividly in national and regional memory than the Founders themselves. The root cause stirred profound beliefs, and the nation continues to struggle with the consequences. What wonder that the Civil War has never lost its hold on the American imagination or that it should attract the imagination of Ken Burns, who with his ambitious television series, ''The Civil War,'' takes his place as the most accomplished documentary maker of his generation.
The 11-hour series, which begins the PBS prime-time season tonight at 8 and continues through Thursday, is so rich in conception and so rewarding in execution that it almost redeems the promise of the medium. Mr. Burns and his associates have translated the materials of history into television drama of an epic order.
Every episode takes us deep into the old photographs of young men in blue or gray uniforms, in formal poses or horsing around; they become moving pictures. Unforgettable photographs of the faces and bodies of slaves pound home the war's moral dimension. Their eyes stare us down. As the camera drifts over battlefields, we hear, distantly, the sounds of war. Scenes of carnage, some through the lens of Mathew Brady, give way to landscapes that seem timeless yet inimitably American. 
Much of the series' magic lies in its evocation of 19th-century America, through daguerrotypes, newspaper headlines, recruiting posters and, most affectingly, the words of those who fought the war and those who bore its terrible price. There is Abraham Lincoln, of course, the hero among heroes, whose direct, inspiring prose makes one ashamed of what passes as public discourse in our own time. And there are the powerful statements of Frederick Douglass; the sensitive reporting of Mary Chesnut, following the conflict from South Carolina; the somewhat aloof observations of the New York diarist George Templeton Strong, and the simpler, deeply touching reflections of soldiers like the Union man Elisha Hunt Rhodes and the Confederate trooper Sam Watkins, and their wives and parents.
The voices (you will probably recognize some of them, notably Jason Robards as Grant, Julie Harris as Mary Chesnut, Morgan Freeman as Douglass and George Plimpton as the sophisticated Strong) are a sampling of America, North, South and West. They stir the same collective memories as the familiar tunes ''Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and ''Dixie,'' of course, and the spirituals that are always in the air. The famous battles - Fredericksburg and Vicksburg, Chancellorsville, Chickamauga and Chattanooga, the Wilderness and Gettysburg - are clearly and dramatically laid out with the help of well-designed maps. Attempts at re-creation are sensibly shunned.
Mr. Burns allows individuals to tell the story wherever possible. Tonight's episode, for example, begins with Wilmer McLean, a Virginian who moved from his farm on the battlefield at Bull Run to Appomattox to get out of harm's way and who ''could rightfully say, 'the war began in my front yard and ended in my front parlor,' '' and concludes with a heartfelt letter to his wife from Sullivan Ballou, a Northern soldier who soon after fell at Bull Run. The series is filled with the poetry of people who had no pretentions to being poets.
The pace of the series is like that of the war itself: leisurely, sometimes lyric passages are suddenly shattered by the commotion of battles fought in 10,000 places along what is described as a 1,000-mile front. The narrative, principally by the biographer Geoffrey C. Ward, is uncommonly well written ('' 'I can do it all,' McClellan said, but he did nothing''), and delivered in a blessedly straightforward way by the historian David McCullough.
Mr. Burns offers no radical interpretations either of the course or causes of the war; his list of consultants is too large and imposing (C. Vann Woodward, Eric Foner, James McPherson) to admit to a personal view. The on-screen historians are less impressive, but Shelby Foote, the Southern writer who serves as a sort of cracker-barrel commentator, delivers colorful anecdotes with down-home finesse.
The emphasis on slavery, over the other economic, political and social divisions of North and South, is in accord with the sensibilities of our own time, as is the attention given to the role played by black soldiers. The series does not court controversy: the Southern officers are credited with courage and dash, the abolitionists with moral strength. Challenges to some of the assumptions and interpretations here can be expected; but the consensual approach is a natural one for television and should make the series a welcome resource in classrooms north and south.
Tonight's episode, ''The Cause,'' begins with an eventful introduction: the consequences of the invention of the cotton gin; the publication of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''; the Dred Scott decision, with its message that a black man had no rights that a white man was bound to respect; Lincoln's ''house divided'' speeches; the fighting over ''bloody Kansas''; John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry; the secession of several Southern states. And it goes on to cover 1861, the first year of the war, from the fall of Fort Sumter to the Confederate victory at the first Battle of Bull Run, where Gen. Thomas Jonathan Jackson became forever known as Stonewall.
''The Cause'' reminds us of the tenuous nature of the United States a century after the Revolution, when sectional allegiances, particularly in the South, were so powerful that Robert E. Lee, although he opposed secession, refused an offer to lead the Union forces and chose instead to serve his state of Virginia. Most of the fighters on both sides, many of them in their teens and looking like children in the photographs, had never been far from home. In a later episode, Mr. Foote, noting that the men of a single town would be likely to serve together, remarks that after a battle like Antietam, some towns might be left without young men.
By the end of the year, the enthusiasm with which the war was greeted (though not by Lincoln or by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, who prophesied early that it would not be as short or as painless as many believed, and would go on to prove the point on his march through Georgia and South Carolina) was settling into a realization of its terrible cost.
Mr. Burns owes a big debt to his team of researchers - one of the few jobs for which he does not cite himself on the long list of credits - who have come up with the elements that sustain these 11 hours. He repays them by treating the photographs and journals with the respect and sensitivity they deserve. His control of the material is masterly. The result, which tonight occupies the time usually reserved for Masterpiece Theater, comes much closer than most of that popular series' offerings to meriting the title.
 
AND ALREADY ON VIDEO
 Usually the video release of a TV documentary postdates its broadcast, but Ken Burns's 11-hour ''Civil War'' is an exception. The first tapes have been available since February, and now the entire nine-cassette series is ready for release. But you won't find the videos in stores; they can only be ordered by mail.
''The Civil War'' comes in two separate sets. The first set is for the home viewer and is issued by Time-Life Video. The tapes are $24.99 each.
A second offering comes from PBS Video, a division of the Public Broadcasting Service. This set is intended for institutions - schools, libraries, museums and the like - and with it comes an index that lists all the names and events mentioned in the series and tells where each can be found on the tapes. A time-line chart and other materials are included. The set is $350 until Oct. 30 and $450 thereafter.
The PBS cassettes can be ordered through an 800 number given on the broadcast. Callers interested in the other set will be directed to Time-Life. - Peter M. Nichols

Big Trouble for the Pound

 BODY:
The British pound dropped sharply last week, hit hard by disappointment over the dimming prospects of a quick entry into the European Monetary System. Joining the system would make the pound, notoriously volatile, more stable and therefore more attractive to investors. Karl Otto Pohl, president of the German Bundesbank, knocked the pound down first on Wednesday when he indicated that Britain's inflation rate was too far above the European average to permit the pound to be tied to the Deutsche mark. And on Friday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the country's inflation rate, heading toward 10 percent, was still too high for immediate entry. The two blows took the pound down more than seven cents against the dollar between Wednesday and Friday's close.

No (Painless) Cure for the Budget Deficit

BYLINE: By HENRY KAUFMAN; Henry Kaufman is president of Henry Kaufman & Company Inc., a money management and economic and financial consulting firm.

 BODY:
The United States has a huge structural budget deficit and there is no painless way to undo it. The pain could have been less if the difficult choices had been made at a more favorable time, when economic growth was more robust. That chance was missed. But doing nothing will not eliminate the pain. It will merely postpone and compound the economic and financial costs. 
There are three reasons why a serious effort to reduce the deficit must now go forward:
First, without deficit reduction, we will not be able to free up the resources to meet the challenges of the 1990's. America will become a reduced economic power, unable to generate the business investment required to keep pace with faster productivity growth in other industrial countries. It will also be unable to deal with serious domestic economic and social shortcomings - a crumbling infrastructure, a deteriorating educational system and a dangerous concentration of poverty and lawlessness in our great cities.
Second, without deficit reduction, our ability to stabilize the business cycle will degenerate. Fiscal policy must be restored as a viable policy option. Huge structural deficits essentially bar the use of fiscal stimulus to counter recessionary tendencies. Thus, the task of rekindling economic expansion falls entirely on the Federal Reserve; but its flexibility to provide monetary stimulus is severely constricted. Large budget deficits prolong our dependence on foreign financing. The Fed is then forced to maintain financial conditions that keep American interest rates competitive with foreign rates, which are already higher in most cases.
Third, without a budget compromise, Gramm-Rudman may have to be put into effect. That is no way to run a government. It would compel essentially arbitrary cuts without regard to the resulting damage.
There is no way we can grow out of the budget deficit entrapment. Assuming we could was one of the main policy failures of the 1980's. Now, a recession and a slow economic recovery could produce a budget deficit in excess of $500 billion in two to three years. Getting back to a correct budgetary track would be virtually impossible.
At the same time, the painless path described by quite a few who favor deficit reductions is also dubious. These advocates assert that deficit reductions would reassure long-term investors, hasten declines in American interest rates, lower the dollar and free up financial resources for the private sector. The happy result, they claim, would be a quick stimulant for housing, commercial construction, business investment and exports.
The notion that lower interest rates could produce a speedy offset to budgetary restraint is becoming conventional wisdom but is questionable. It assumes that reductions in Government borrowing will allow the private sector to borrow more. Under normal circumstances this would be true. But now, it is not necessarily so because many in the private sector are already heavily leveraged. Only a huge drop in interest rates could accomplish such a switch to private sector borrowing. But even then an improved financial structure for banks and corporations, an important prerequisite for sustainable economic growth, would not be in place.
There is no painless way out. We need to raise taxes. Taxpayers should make additional contributions according to their capacity. The poor don't have the capacity. The burden will have to fall on middle- and upper-income taxpayers. The Middle East crisis should not deflect efforts to reduce defense expenditures, cap and reduce poorly controlled civilian expenditures and install an effective energy program, which should yield a modest amount of revenue at the start.

Secrets of a Cosmic Cosmetician

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Anita L. Roddick, co-founder and chief executive of Body Shop International - the fast-growing natural-cosmetics franchiser based in Britain - has been thinking about xylophones.
''There's a long, narrow corridor at our production center,'' she said, ''and I noticed something the other day: What do people do when they walk down a corridor like that? They trail their hands, or a pencil, along the sides. We need to build some sort of musical instrument into the wall so employees can make music.''
Not exactly a conventional management notion. But then the 48-year-old chief executive, who ''forged her thinking in the 60's,'' according to a company fact sheet, has pretty much defied convention since she and her husband, Gordon T. Roddick, started up Body Shop in 1976 in the belief that products that ''cleanse, polish and protect'' skin and hair are in harmony with the environment. 
Ms. Roddick regularly treks to remote regions of Nepal and Brazil in search of natural oils, muds and methods. And her company has become well known for promoting certain values. Its 320 stores in 37 countries, including 22 in the United States, exhibit posters decrying medical tests on animals. Customers carry home purchases in recycled bags. Delivery trucks are emblazoned with messages about the sanctity of the Brazilian rain forest or the importance of education and human rights.
Given this, it is not surprising that Body Shop follows an unorthodox credo in managing its 1,700 employees and hundreds of franchisees. In job applicants, enthusiasm, empathy and creativity count more than degrees or credentials, managers say. There is an environmental resources department to monitor Body Shop's ecological impact - to make sure, for example, that the company doesn't deplete natural resources in the Brazilian rain forest and that it recycles as much as possible. The company gives workers a paid half-day off each week for community work and requires franchisers to do the same. There is a charter of corporate values, written by employees.
''Work should be a playground, an inspiration, an esthetic thing, not a Monday-to-Friday sort of death,'' is how Ms. Roddick put it. Hence the xylophone. And even some management experts argue that the 60's-style credo has built a foundation for the 90's.
''The competitive advantage is now moving toward people,'' said Keith Bradley, director of the business performance group at the London School of Economics. Given the demographic dip in the working population, he said, ''getting good people is hard, and Anita Roddick is saying, in her way, that she creates an atmosphere that makes it a fun place to come and work.''
The environmental ethic also creates a corporate culture that helps motivate employees. ''The best companies have belief systems highly consistent with the way they treat customers and employees,'' said Robin W.T. Buchanan, a London-based vice president of Bain & Company, the Boston consulting firm. ''That way, employees truly believe what they're selling.''
Of course, there are fundamentals in place that allow the management credo to work. Mr. Bradley said day-to-day management is systematic and well thought out. Expectations are clearly communicated to employees in a company handbook.
But the real test of the company's style may come if an economic slowdown forces Body Shop to cut back. For the last five years, profits at the public, $156 million company have grown at double-digit levels. ''Anita Roddick appears to be a great manager, but she will have truly demonstrated that when she faces the really tough times that all businesses face,'' Mr. Buchanan said.
The Roddicks have had no formal business training and previously ran a small but successful hotel business. They are ''a team,'' Mr. Bradley said, with the charismatic Ms. Roddick out front and Mr. Roddick working behind the scenes.
Franchising has allowed the Body Shop to stay small and entrepreneurial. ''Entrepreneurial franchisers have a great opportunity because franchisees will be doing some communicating for them,'' said Mr. Buchanan. ''But then your challenge is to become an effective communicator to your franchisees.'' To that end, the company offers extensive training for franchisees and employees, including management courses using video simulations and computer games.
The bottom line, Mr. Bradley said, is that Ms. Roddick ''realizes that know-how and peoples' interactions with customers are important assets.''
 
'LIKE BEING STRUCK BY LIGHTNING'
To find franchisees, Anita Roddick courts ''people who normally wouldn't want to run a franchise'' and puts them through a drill that could hardly be called orthodox.
Helen Mills, who owned an insurance brokerage in Washington, met Ms. Roddick last year and now, with partners, runs four Body Shop franchises in the Washington area. The hiring process was startling. ''I learned a lot about corporate culture and management priorities as an insurance broker, and I've never sat through conversations like the ones I've had with Anita,'' said Ms. Mills. They ''talked about about everything: motherhood, the environment, the homeless issue - nothing to do with cosmetics.'' Even the application form is unusual, she said: ''It has to be handwritten, and it asks what countries you've visited, and what books you've read, even how you would like to die.'' There were interviews at Body Shop's American headquarters, training sessions, even a trip to the Roddick home at Christmas.
Meeting Ms. Roddick and applying for a franchise was ''like being struck by lightning,'' she concluded.

Wall Street's Latest Diversification Strategy: Down on the Farm

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
With opulent office towers desperate for tenants and several big-city developers choking on debt, some major investors are heading for the country. Wall Street is discovering the heartland, where reliable returns often flow from the open fields.
The scene was set in 1982-87, as farmland prices tumbled in the worst recession agriculture had faced in 50 years. Farmers who had expanded during the 1970's boom confronted excess capacity and soaring interest rates. Foreclosures rose to a postwar high, exports fell sharply, agricultural banks failed at a rate not seen since the Great Depression and, in the mid-1980's, the Government had to bail out the Farm Credit System.
Now, the farm belt has largely recovered. There are fewer farms, but larger ones and debt levels are way down. Banks and other lenders have sold a great deal of their foreclosed land. Farmland began its price rebound in 1987, and by last year, prices were up at least 10 percent from their 1986 lows. Thus the interest on the part of institutional investors looking to diversify their portfolios. 
''If you look at farmland over the last 30 years or so you see annual returns of about 10 percent,'' said Kenneth J. Binkley, a senior vice president of Equitable Agri-Business Inc. Treasury bills have returned about 5 percent annually since 1960, corporate bonds about 7 percent and commercial real estate about 9 percent. Stocks returned about 12 percent, but with greater risks and volatility than farmland.
 
Pension Funds
Lured by Low Risk And Steady Returns
Several of the country's largest pension funds are beginning to invest in farmland because it offers long-term holders relatively low risk along with fairly steady returns and capital appreciation.
Financial institutions have established several funds to help investors add agricultural real estate to their portfolios. Among these vehicles are the Equitable Agricultural Property Funds, set up in January by Equitable Agri-Business, an Atlanta-based subsidiary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. Equitable Agri-Business has about $2.2 billion invested, mostly through mortgages, in 12,000 farms and ranches. The new fund has raised about $25 million for equity investments in farms this year and expects to reach $100 million by next year. The Prudential Insurance Company, Batterymarch Financial and Morgan Stanley Asset Management are among the other investors in farmland.
Their stakes in agriculture so far are tiny compared with the billions pension funds invest annually. But investment managers say that as institutions become more familiar with farm investing, they will devote large sums to it, lifting prices.
Morgan Stanley says its investments are already ''substantial,'' but will not say how much. The firm has diversified by geography and crops, with properties in corn, cotton, rice, soybeans and citrus. ''We think total return to farmland should be in the range of 10 to 17 percent a year,'' said an executive there, who asked not to be identified. ''Farmland is up 15 to 25 percent since it hit the bottom in the 1980's.''
Wider investment in farms is barred by law in several farm states - including Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma and the Dakotas - that prohibit corporate ownership and aim to keep farms in the hands of American families. Even so, investors say there is no shortage of opportunities. ''The rules are a restriction, but then you can still buy outside of those states,'' said Mr. Binkley. ''There are still a lot of other states you can buy in, like California, Texas, Indiana, Illinois and Florida.''
Well over half of American farmland is still owned by individual farmers, but the largest, most technologically advanced farmers are dominant. Of the country's 2.27 million farms, the 14 percent, or about 317,000, that have sales of more than $100,000 account for 75 percent of all farm sales, about 61 percent of Government farm subsidies and 86 percent of net farm income, according to 1987 Agriculture Department figures. The smallest 1.63 million farms, or 72 percent, have annual sales of less than $40,000 each, accounting for a mere 10 percent of all farm sales.
 
Recovery in the 90's
Prices Are Reviving As Debt Levels Fall
A revival in farm prices is well under way. Earlier this year, the Department of Agriculture reported that prices had risen to an average of $693 an acre in January - up 4 percent in 1989, although still well below the 1982 record of $823. Despite the disappointments of the 1980's, then, sophisticated investors are being tempted by the promise of long-term performance. To realize the returns from operating income as well as higher land values, Mr. Binkley said, institutions need skilled farm management.
Many investors consider farmland an attractive hedge against inflation for both income and appreciation. During the agricultural boom of the 1970's, the jump in farm values often outstripped inflation. Impressive returns fired the hopes of farmers who borrowed heavily to buy farmland going into the 1980's, raising prices. Economists say the farm crisis of that decade left agricultural credit tighter, probably keeping farmland from going up as fast as the inflation rate.
''Farmland will be a reasonable investment in the 90's but I don't think it will ever perform the way it did in the 70's,'' said Mark Drabenstott, an economist and assistant vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
Economists expect the farm recovery to strengthen and continue. Exports continue to rise this year and farm production is recovering after two years of drought. Last year real farm income climbed to about $38 billion, surpassing the 1987 high of $37.2 billion. Farm debt has been falling and now stands at about $135.9 billion, down from the 1983 high of $192 billion - making agriculture one of the first areas of the economy to become less leveraged.
 
Agricultural Politics
What of Exports, And Subsidies?
The recovery in farmland prices has by no means been even. Over the past two years, for example, prices have risen much more in the grain belt than in Southwestern states like Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. There, prices depend substantially on the energy business, because oil and gas companies are big land buyers. California prices never fell as low as those in many Midwestern states, so the rise has been somewhat less dramatic. The ranch states of South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana have seen some of the steepest price rises because cattle have become very profitable and ranchers have been willing to pay a premium for more space.
Not all is sunny on the farm. Small, family-owned farms will continue to be squeezed out of business. Over the short term, even the larger farmers, and investors, remain susceptible to overproduction, lower commodity prices, curtailed export markets and cutbacks in Government subsidies. The levels of subsidies and exports depend a great deal on the latest round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations, taking place in Uruguay.
But institutional investors are willing to make long-term bets that as agriculture rebounds, so will their holdings. As the executive from Morgan Stanley said, ''The farmer is about to go out and buy more land, which is positive for land prices.''
 
LITTLE TO FEAR FROM THE R.T.C.
Investors in farmland can expect more sales by banks, insurance companies and the Farm Credit System than by the Resolution Trust Corporation.
The R.T.C.'s plans to unload real estate worth hundreds of billions that belonged to savings and loans have caused some property owners to ask whether the market will be flooded, and values depressed. But real estate professionals say the sales of the portion comprising raw land will have little effect in most states. Most of the R.T.C.'s farmland is low quality, located in Southwestern states like Texas and Oklahoma. Much of it was slated for development. The R.T.C. holds almost no top-grade acreage in states like Kansas or California.
''What they really have is the marginal stuff,'' said Kenneth J. Binkley, a senior vice president of Equitable Agri-Business Inc. ''They have very little of the stuff that would affect farm prices if they sold it.''
The R.T.C.'s holdings as of April 30 included 87 parcels of agricultural land ranging from a few acres to several hundred, with an appraised value of only $59.6 million. The agency is also seeking to sell 97 parcels of ranch land, appraised at $71.2 million.
Mr. Binkley and others worry more about the remaining foreclosed farmland - half a million acres, by Morgan Stanley's estimate - that banks and insurance companies will sell in the next few years. Another half a million acres held by the Farm Credit System will also be up for sale. Compared with these holdings, said an investment manager at Morgan Stanley who oversees agricultural investments, ''The R.T.C. is not even a factor.''

HEADLINE: Pony Up $95 Million? Sure, for a Baseball Team

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
Judging by the numbers, winning one of the two National League baseball expansion franchises that will start playing in 1993 would not seem terribly attractive. The league is demanding an entrance fee of $95 million from each new team, up dramatically from the $7 million the American League charged for franchises in Seattle and Toronto during baseball's last expansion in 1977. The additional start-up costs will run at least another $25 million. It will be years before the new teams turn an operating profit.
But owning a baseball team is only partly a financial endeavor. In a nation full of people whose love of the game far exceeds the batting and fielding capabilities they exhibited in their youth, the idea of buying into the major leagues is often the next best thing to being on the field. That explains why more than two dozen groups of prospective owners, representing 10 cities, from Tampa-St. Petersburg to Buffalo and points west, are trooping into New York this month to make their pitches to the league, which will announce its selections next September.
''I'm doing this primarily out of love,'' said Martin Stone, an investor leading a group that wants to organize a team for Phoenix. ''I've had a love affair with baseball since I was old enough to walk.'' 
That is not to say that Mr. Stone or other prospective owners can afford to ignore the financial risks, or that they are oblivious to the potential rewards. The $95 million franchise fee is more than any established baseball team has sold for, except the $100 million commanded by the New York Mets in 1986, just after they won the World Series. The San Diego Padres were sold earlier this year for $75 million and the Seattle Mariners went last year for $77 million.
For a $95 million-plus investment in a new franchise to make financial sense, team values will have to continue increasing as they have over the past decade. The price tag for teams has been rising sharply as the sport's popularity has surged, with television contracts more lucrative than ever. The Mets brought only $21 million in 1980. The New York Yankees, bought by George Steinbrenner's group for $10 million in 1973, are probably worth well over $200 million now, baseball executives said.
But it is unclear whether franchise values can continue to increase so sharply. Even if they do, it could be a long time before a team in a small or medium-sized city could expect to recoup the $125 million or so it will cost to establish the franchise and get it running. ''This is a real financial gamble,'' said Stephen S. Kurtz, an accountant in Denver who is advising a prospective ownership group there.
Moreover, though no precise figures are released, few major league teams have strong operating earnings. Fortune Magazine recently estimated that the Oakland Athletics, the current World Series champions, made less than $1 million last year on revenues of more than $50 million. (For the Athletics, as for most teams, the picture is somewhat brighter when measured by cash flow, which excludes noncash charges like depreciation that are deducted from earnings.) The only teams believed to make consistently healthy profits are the Yankees, who have an extremely lucrative local cable and broadcast television contract, and the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are generally credited with having the strongest and most experienced front office in baseball.
The biggest source of revenue for most teams is television. All teams share equally in the national network and cable contracts, currently held by CBS Sports and ESPN, with each of the 26 clubs now receiving about $13.5 million a year. In addition, each team negotiates its own local broadcast and cable rights, which vary widely. The Yankees take in more than $40 million a year from their local contract; a team in a medium-sized city is likely to get less than $5 million.
Gate receipts also vary, depending on attendance and ticket prices. A team drawing 2 million fans a year, or about 25,000 per home game, generates average net gate revenues of about $14 million, after accounting for the share for the visiting team. Teams also take in several million a year in revenues from concessions, royalties and the sale of advertising space inside their stadiums.
A typical team might therefore have revenues of $35 million to $40 million, of which probably half goes to player salaries. Most of the rest is eaten up by administrative, overhead and marketing costs.
For expansion teams, operating losses are inevitable for at least a year or two. For the first season, the league has decided, the new franchises will not share the league's national television revenue, depriving them of what would be their biggest source of funds.
At the same time, the teams will assume heavy payrolls, for the players they pick up in a draft of major and minor leaguers, for other personnel and for their own systems of minor league teams. And while most of the cities vying for a franchise profess to have hordes of fans so hungry for baseball that they will gladly sit through the losing seasons expansion teams historically record, attendance levels are hard to project.
''For an expansion team, there's a great deal of learning by doing, both on the field and in the front office,'' said Gerald W. Scully, an economist at the Heritage Foundation in Washington and author of ''The Business of Major League Baseball.''
Potential owners say they are well aware of the financial realities. Still, they are lining up for a chance to own a team, scrambling to put their groups together and coordinating their efforts with state and local officials.
The groups are striving to convince current National League owners that they are well-financed and savvy business executives who can maximize revenues and keep costs manageable in an era when player pay is soaring. The league is also looking for evidence of dedicated fans and local political support, and assurances that a new team will have a stadium. Most important might be an element beyond the prospective owners' control: the size of their television markets.
Current team owners have moved slowly to add new franchises, at least in the eyes of some prospective owners and politicians from baseball-hungry states. Indeed, the current round of expansion got under way only after a group of United States Senators hinted that they might hold hearings into whether baseball should continue to enjoy its exemption from antitrust rules. There is very little financial incentive for current owners to add teams, since they would have to split the television among more franchises.
Baseball executives and some would-be owners say the leading sites for the new teams are Tampa-St. Petersburg (the nation's 14th-largest television market, according to the Arbitron ratings service), Denver (19th), Phoenix (20th) and Buffalo (38th).
They add that one of the new teams will almost certainly be in Florida, with the Tampa Bay area the most likely possibility, although Orlando (25th) and Miami (16th) are also in the running. The conventional wisdom is that the other team will be in the West, with Denver and Phoenix running even. Buffalo remains a long shot. Other cities making presentations include Washington; Charlotte, N.C.; Nashville, and Sacramento, Calif.
The prospective ownership groups are all headed by wealthy business executives, investors or lawyers, many with experience owning or running other professional teams. They are often backed by companies with high profiles in the region. Indeed, because of the high costs of winning and operating a franchise, and because the league wants to insure that the new teams will be financially stable, most of the groups have a dozen or more partners.
In Buffalo, the group is headed by Robert Rich Jr., chief executive of Rich Products, a food-processing company, and owner of the Buffalo Bisons Triple-A team, the franchise with the highest attendance in the minor leagues. In Phoenix, Mr. Stone, who built a conglomerate called Monogram Industries during the 1960's and sold it in 1982, already owns the Triple-A Phoenix Firebirds.
One of Denver's wealthiest citizens, John Dikeou, led the group there until he withdrew this summer to tend his troubled real estate empire. Now the Denver group is headed by business executives and lawyers from out of town, with the financial backing of local businesses like the Rocky Mountain News and the Adolph Coors Company. There are three competing ownership groups in Tampa-St. Petersburg - one headed by Frank Morsani, a car dealer, another by Ken Harrelson, a former major league player, and the third by S. Joel Schur, owner of the Class A St. Petersburg Cardinals.
For the cities themselves, the benefits of winning a team include additional jobs and revenues, from both the team and its stadium, for everyone from hot dog vendors to advertising executives. A study in Denver determined that a team would bring as many as 1,000 new jobs and as much as $140 million annually to the local economy. But money and jobs alone do not explain why the baseball campaigns enjoy such earnest support. For the contending cities, a baseball franchise promises the civic pride that comes with being designated ''major league.''
 
DENVER FANS HEAD FOR HOME
Winning a baseball team is not easy. Just ask the fans in Denver, who have been organizing since 1984, when the major leagues first started discussing expansion. Despite years of preparation and strong popular and political support, Denver's campaign has nearly crashed twice since June, when the National League issued specific guidelines for prospective owners and set a schedule for choosing the winners.
The first big hurdle in Denver this summer was a regional vote to impose additional taxes to build a stadium. The league has said it prefers that expansion sites have a baseball-only, outdoor, natural grass stadium, and Denver needed to be able to raise at least $100 million to build one. With the Colorado economy still recovering from the oil slump and a national recession looming, raising the sales tax one-tenth of 1 percent was a hard sell. At one point, the tax proposal was trailing 2-to-1 in the polls. It took a heavy advertising campaign by baseball proponents, to get it passed on Aug. 14 with 54 percent of the vote.
Then the city had to cope with the withdrawal of John Dikeou, whose real estate empire needed attention. That left Denver without an ownership group less than two months before the Sept. 1 deadline for franchise applications. Several prominent supporters of the baseball effort, including Gov. Roy Romer, immediately began scrambling to find new investors. Within a few weeks, they brought together a group headed by Steve Ehrhart, a lawyer from Memphis who had once helped run the now-defunct United States Football League.
As with groups in other cities, there is little public information about the Denver group's financial strength.
But Mr. Ehrhart and his associates say the Denver region has proven that it will support a professional sports franchise. Their prime exhibit: the Denver Broncos. Like the Broncos in football, a baseball team might draw fans from as far away as New Mexico, Wyoming and Nebraska. Likewise, they argue, a Denver team's television market would encompass the entire Rocky Mountain region. There is currently no major league team between Kansas City and California.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Prospecting for the Market Bottom

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Barton Biggs, chief global strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, is tired of advising clients to stay away from the world's stock markets. ''It is not an inspiring message and repeating it gets endlessly boring,'' he said.
So in a recent report, Mr. Biggs gave his advice in two paragraphs - stay away - and then took the suggestion of some of his friends and turned the rest of his analysis into a travelogue: an account of how he had spent his summer vacation in Switzerland (Geneva and Zermatt) and climbing Mount Borah in Idaho.
There probably has been no more artful response to the relentless decline in world stock markets, which began before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last month and has accelerated since. 
There seems to be nothing but bad news for the tumbling markets. Oil prices are now in the $33-a-barrel range, $8 higher than the $25 level many analysts expected immediately after the Aug. 2 invasion. Inflation worries are increasing. The likelihood of higher interest rates is growing. A recession is more possible here and in Britain and analysts see signs of slowdowns in European economies.
Uncertainty may be the worst poison. News bulletins send the markets up and down. But after each little rally, the Mideast crisis drags on and the markets move down another notch.
Last week, major stock markets around the world - except in the United States - fell to new lows for the year. That came after three weeks of hovering just above the previous lows, which were reached on Aug. 23.
In Germany, where the soaring cost of unification is also depressing the market, the fall in the DAX index of 30 shares has now wiped out all the gains since the Berlin Wall began to come down Nov. 9. The DAX fell to 1,446.57 on Friday, 16.39 points below the level the index was at when the wall's demise sparked hope for the future of Eastern Europe and set off rallies in many markets on the Continent. From its high on March 30, the DAX is now down 26.8 percent.
In Japan, the Nikkei index of 225 leading stocks is down 39 percent for the year. It closed at a new 1990 low of 23,602.98 on Thursday and then bounced up 174.85 on Friday, one of only three foreign markets to rally a little after touching record lows last week. Just since the Iraqi invasion, the Tokyo market has dropped 23 percent.
In France, the CAC-40 index is down 23 percent since last year and 28 percent from its 1990 high. It reached its 1990 low of 1,540.60 on Thursday and then inched up 2.93 points Friday.
In Britain, the FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks is down 16.4 percent after hitting a low of 2,016.9 on Thursday and then popping up 8.6 points Friday.
The list goes on. New 1990 lows were also set last week in Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand.
These slumps have come on generally low volume. Investors have either sold their stock and are not ready to take a chance on getting back in or didn't sell and are just holding on for the long term.
The declines have been painful not only for investors but also for analysts. Near the end of August, some analysts thought that the bottom might have been reached in many stock markets and said that brave investors could find good values. UBS Phillips & Drew in London, which made such a recommendation, has now changed its mind, backing off from a cautious buy to a sell.
''I wouldn't buy for the bank's account now,'' said Walter Seipp, chairman of Commerzbank A.G., Germany's third-largest bank and a major holder of German stocks. ''I don't think the stock market in Germany or elsewhere will recover until we see the end of the Iraqi crisis.''
For his part, Morgan Stanley's Mr. Biggs says the problem runs deeper. ''I don't really think it is the Mideast,'' he said. ''That is not what is plaguing the market. The markets are being plagued by a worldwide liquidity crunch, with interest rates going up. This is just the unfolding of the bear market.''
Mr. Biggs's only positive message is that the markets may reach bottom by mid-October. But that's a hunch, not a forecast.

HEADLINE: Carl Hahn's East German Homecoming

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WOLFSBURG, West Germany

 BODY:
Wednesday will be one of the biggest days in Carl Hahn's life.
On that day, the 64-year-old chairman of Volkswagen A.G., Europe's largest auto maker, will join Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany in laying the cornerstone of a $1.9 billion assembly plant Volkswagen is building in Mosel, East Germany.
It will be a big day for Mr. Kohl, the political unifier of the two Germanys, because the plant is by far the single largest West German investment planned for East Germany. But it will be even bigger for Mr. Hahn, the hard-nosed, down-to-earth manager who is increasingly seen as the Germanys' foremost economic unifier.
For him, the day will be fraught with emotion. He grew up near the site of the new plant and once worked as an apprentice in a nearby auto plant. He fled from East to West after World War II to escape the Communists, and has always vowed someday to help rebuild East Germany and its painfully obsolete auto plants. Now he has his chance. ''I felt very sad that nothing had been done to these plants in 45 years,'' he said. ''When you look at these old automobile factories, you see something beyond human expectation, and you see dedicated, hard-working people there.'' 
His steel-blue eyes took on a riveting intensity as he discussed his vision to help East Germany's car industry recapture its former greatness. Under Communism, ''East Germans had to wait 15 years for a car that was below human dignity,'' he said in a tone bordering on anger, referring to the waiting list to buy the underpowered, pollution-spewing Trabant.
Mr. Hahn says the 250,000 cars the Mosel plant will produce each year by 1995 are a key part of Volkswagen's strategy to stretch its lead in Europe and boost its 3-million-car-a-year output to 4 million by the mid-1990's. Since taking the helm at Volkswagen in 1982, Mr. Hahn has jazzed up its models, strengthened its position in Europe and more than restored its financial health; it had record earnings and revenues last year. With its $39 billion in sales last year, Volkswagen is West Germany's - and will be a united Germany's - second-largest company after Daimler-Benz, the auto, truck and aircraft group.
 
Rebuilding East Germany
 As Oct. 3, the official unification date, approaches, Mr. Hahn is spearheading the massive effort by West Germany's mighty industrialists to rebuild East Germany's economy and extend their reach eastward.
Daimler-Benz plans to spend $600 million to modernize East Germany's biggest truck factory. Siemens A.G., West Germany's No. 1 electronics company, will invest more than $625 million to employ 25,000 people in telecommunications, computers and other fields. Deutsche Bank, the West German banking giant, plans to spend more than $500 million to establish 250 branches in East Germany.
Mr. Hahn has traveled across Europe to urge other companies to help rebuild East Germany's economy. He has played such a pivotal role in the country's transformation that many East Germans used to say, half-joking, that the city the Communists had renamed Karl Marx Stadt -where Mr. Hahn was born and where Volkswagen plans to expand a factory to build 1,500 engines a day - should be renamed Carl Hahn Stadt. (That city has reverted to its original name, Chemnitz.) But even as Mr. Hahn basks in the spotlight, there are growing worries about cracks in the Volkswagen empire, with its 260,000 workers, the Audi luxury car group and SEAT, the Spanish auto maker:
* After five record years, car sales in Europe are expected to fall this year. Fiat, Peugeot and Volvo have announced plans to idle or lay off thousands of workers, though Volkswagen has no such plans.
* In the United States, Volkswagen's sales slipped to 154,000 cars last year, compared with 570,000 in 1970, when VW was synonymous with imports and Japanese cars were still the butt of jokes. With Japanese competition fierce and the mark strong, Volkswagen is finding it far tougher than expected to claw its way back in a land that loved the Beetle.
* In Europe, Volkswagen may soon face an all-out assault from Japan's efficient car makers. Toyota and Honda are building assembly plants in Britain to join Nissan there. And the European Community's plan for a barrier-free market could end quotas on Japanese cars, spelling more trouble for European auto makers.
''If they haven't learned any lessons from the United States, the Japanese are going to clean their clocks in Europe,'' said George Peterson, president of Auto Pacific, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm.
At the moment, however, Mr. Hahn is concentrating on East Germany. Even there, though, his grand designs could run into problems. The 6,500 workers planned for the Mosel plant will need huge amounts of retraining because they will be hired from the nearby Trabant plant, a soot-covered relic. Workers there rely on antiquated techniques; they often use hand wrenches and push car frames along the assembly line by hand. And with growing fears of overcapacity in Europe's auto industry, there is no guarantee that there will be a market for the plant's small Golfs and Polos.
 
Pressure From Bonn
 Some industry analysts question whether Mr. Hahn's plunge into East Germany has been swayed too much by emotion and other factors. ''VW is under a lot of pressure from the Government to contribute in East Germany,'' said Karl Ludvigsen, an auto analyst who runs a London-based consulting firm. ''Sometimes I think their activity there is more political than business.''
Mr. Hahn, whose father was sales director of a prewar auto maker in Chemnitz, said Volkswagen's East German strategy, involving a total of $3 billion in investment, makes perfect business sense.
''I don't think it is a risky investment for a company that is short of capacity,'' he said. Last year Volkswagen edged Fiat by a fraction of a percent to capture the lead in auto sales in Europe, its fifth straight year as No. 1. But this year, with West Germany's economy booming, Volkswagen is far out front in sales and cannot keep up with demand.
''We figure that there are 16 million East Germans and that they will buy 750,000 new cars a year,'' said Mr. Hahn, who expects to capture at least a one-third of that market.
Volkswagen has a 33 percent share of West Germany's car market, and Mr. Hahn says its strength in moderate-priced cars should win it an even larger share in poorer East Germany. He also sees opportunities in the rest of Eastern Europe.
As one example of his many activities to help the East, he hosted a meeting 10 days ago that brought together government officials and executives from Eastern and Western Europe. France's Prime Minister and Czechoslovakia's Finance Minister were there, as was the Vice President of the Russian Republic.
One thing is clear. No longer is Wolfsburg, Volkswagen's home 10 miles from the East German border, considered the Western world's industrial outpost along the hostile Communist border. ''Today this has become the center of Europe and the center of Germany,'' Mr. Hahn said.
 
The American Front
 Volkswagen executives deny that they are preoccupied with Eastern Europe. They say they have a second priority: North America.
Mr. Hahn says Volkswagen needs to make itself a force again in the United States, where it has a 1.6 percent market share, if it is to be a truly global concern. Also, learning to survive in the world's toughest auto market should force Volkswagen to sharpen its competitiveness in styling, costs and sturdiness. ''If we don't survive in the U.S., we might have problems in the rest of the world, too,'' said Ulrich Seiffert, the member of Volkwagen's managing board responsible for North America.
In 1978, Volkswagen opened the first foreign-owned auto plant in the United States. Ten years later, it closed the money-losing factory in New Stanton, Pa., which was running at 40 percent of capacity because consumers rejected the Rabbit in favor of snappier, cheaper Japanese cars.
Volkswagen sales also got clobbered when dozens of lawsuits were filed five years ago alleging that a problem with unintended acceleration in Audis had caused accidents. The allegations were never proved, but Audi's American sales plunged to 21,300 last year from 74,000 in 1985. ''What we had was the unintended acceleration of American lawyers,'' said Mr. Hahn, who headed Volkswagen's American operations from 1959 to 1964.
Mr. Hahn had been a favorite to become chairman two decades ago, but when he fell out of favor, he left to become chairman of Continental Gummi-Werke A.G., the tire company. When Volkswagen stalled badly in 1982, the supervisory board turned to him to take over and rev up the company.
This year could be a turning point for Volkswagen's American efforts: after five years of declining, sales through August are up 2.7 percent.
''It is very hard to get the attention of the market when you don't have enough market share,'' said Mr. Hahn. ''We have to do a lot of work. We cannot do this overnight.''
 
Pushing the Passat
 In addition to its Golf and Jetta, Volkswagen is pushing its new mid-sized Passat, so hot in Europe that there is an eight-month waiting list. In the United States, however, the Passat has caught on slowly because of such tough competition as the Honda Accord. To spur sales, Volkswagen has started a campaign in which buyers can return Passats, no strings attached, for three months after purchase.
Audi's American sales are up 6 percent so far this year, partly as a result of a generously priced leasing program as well as a three-year warranty program on purchases, in which Audi says all buyers have to tend to is gas and insurance.
Analysts say that for Volkswagen to score a breakthrough in the United States it must do more of what the Japanese do: Keep costs down, come out with models more frequently and keep American consumers in mind. Thomas F. O'Grady, president of Integrated Automotive Resources of Wayne, Pa., said the problem is that ''up to now Volkswagen has thought that what works in Germany should work in the United States.'' Chastened executives say they are modernizing models more often and paying closer attention to American tastes. For example, Volkswagen opened a design studio in Los Angeles, the epicenter of American trends.
Volkswagen's problems with Japanese competition in the United States could well be a prologue for the future battle in Europe. Nissan, Toyota and Honda will soon increase production capacity in Europe by 800,000 cars a year, while European demand is expected to fall to 13 million cars this year, down 3 percent from last year's record. In addition, in removing international trade barriers, the European Community plans to end national quotas on Japanese cars. West Germany has no quotas, but France limits the Japanese to 3 percent of the market and Italy to less than 1 percent.
These developments could turn Europe's auto market into a battlefield. But Volkswagen, many analysts say, is in the best position among European car makers to defend itself. The Japanese have far less penetration in Germany than in any other European country without quotas, which partly reflects Volkswagen's competitiveness. In addition, Volkswagen relies far less on its domestic market than Renault, Peugeot and Fiat, which dominate their protected markets.
''Volkswagen has the broadest base of the European producers, and it has had a very strong marketing drive the past two or three years,'' said Adrian Brundrett, a Frankfurt-based analyst with the Bank of Liechtenstein. ''It has a very strong position going into the 1990's.''
Despite Volkswagen's robust position, Mr. Hahn says the European Community should impose a Community-wide quota on Japanese imports for several years after 1992 to allow Europe's car makers to become more competitive before the Japanese enter in full force. Japanese auto makers now have 11 percent of the European market. Everyone expected French and Italian car makers to take such a protectionist stand, but when Mr. Hahn, a leading figure from a non-protectionist country, joined them, that was key to swaying Brussels to push for a transition period of five years or more.
''When our Japanese competitors were restructuring their auto industry to be fit for competition with the best, they opened the door only when they were ready,'' he said, ''Why shouldn't Europe do a little of the same thing?'' He said European auto makers were preparing for a barrier-free market and Europeans, not Japanese, should get the first benefits.
 
The Threat From Japan
 ''If the Japanese move quickly into a market that has been blocked, they would cause an enormous drop in European production,'' he said. ''I think we should cushion this in an intelligent way, in a more intelligent way than was done in the U.S.''
Volkswagen's not-so-secret weapon in combating Japanese advances in Europe is its purchase of 75 percent of SEAT from the Spanish Government in 1986. SEAT workers earn less than half what Volkswagen's West German workers earn - and about the same as British workers at the Japanese plants.
Volkswagen has already expanded SEAT's annual production from 350,000 cars to 500,000. About one-fourth of the SEAT-made cars are Volkswagen Golfs, while the rest are sporty, but small SEAT cars: Ibiza, Marbella and Malaga. Volkswagen is now building a 300,000-car-a-year plant outside Barcelona to make a larger SEAT car, the Toledo.
Volkswagen is looking increasingly to Mexico, where its Puebla plant, the nation's largest, will produce 200,000 cars this year, quadruple the level of two years ago. The plant ships Golfs and Jettas to the United States.
In contrast, Volkswagen's joint venture with Ford in Brazil and Argentina has stumbled badly because of those nations' economic maladies.
Volkswagen also hopes to expand by courting Skoda, the respected Czechoslovak auto maker, which makes 200,000 cars a year. VW also is planning a joint venture to produce 150,000 cars a year in China.
Mr. Hahn has sought to cut Volkswagen's annual costs by $600 million, with the goal of an 8 percent pretax return on profits. Despite last year's record earnings of $630 million, Volkswagen's pretax return was 5 percent, below his goal and the levels of most European auto makers.
That could be one of the few goals Mr. Hahn fails to achieve. His retirement is scheduled for the end of next year, but in Wolfsburg many people are asking whether this vigorous man, so committed to helping East Germany and Eastern Europe, won't be tempted to stay on as chairman to carry out his plans in the East.
''There is a temptation, but it is not my intention,'' he said. ''I am very optimistic that the world doesn't depend on me.''
 
IT PARKS ITSELF?
If you hate parking, Volkswagen may have your car: It parks itself.
In a demonstration, the driver pulled an experimental Futura up to a parking space too small for mere mortals even to consider. She turned off the ignition, pushed a button and got out.
Laser sensors measured the distance of the cars in front and back, while supersonic sensors scanned the curb. The car selected one of several possible maneuvers.
It then eased forward, stopped, the wheels turned automatically and it rolled back. It went forward again, back, and finally straightened out, aided by the ability of all four wheels to turn.
The Futura was three inches from the curb, and equidistant from cars in front and back. It can actually park in places just eight inches longer than itself - with no need to worry about snagging a bumper or smashing a tail light.
Winfried Bernhardt, a senior Volkswagen researcher, said the company does not yet know how expensive automatic parking will be. The system would not be available in mass-produced cars for many years.
So for now don't count on it to help you pass your next driving test.
 
SAXONY GEARS UP FOR A RENAISSANCE
Before World War II, the Saxony region, in what is now East Germany, was famous for producing stylish and powerful cars like Horch, Audi, Wanderer and DKW.
But after the war, Saxony's fame reversed. Its car industry became infamous for making the Trabant - an undersized, underpowered, homely cockroach compared with the peacocks of old.
The Trabant has not been updated since 1962, even though Trabant's engineers have developed 16 modern prototypes. ''The history of the East German car industry under Communism was one of de-creation,'' said Peter Kirchberg, a professor of transportation history at the Polytechnic University in Dresden. ''It's a history of the demoralization of engineers.''
Carl Hahn, Volkswagen's chairman, plans now to modernize the dilapidated Trabant factory in Zwickau. Moreover, Volkswagen is building a $1.9 billion factory in nearby Mosel to assemble 250,000 small Polos and Golfs a year. Next month, workers being trained at Mosel will begin assembling 50 Polos a day from kits, rising to 350 Polos a day next year. The plant will ultimately employ 6,500 workers.
Volkswagen also plans to build 1,500 engines a day at a factory in Chemnitz, and has set up a network of 450 dealers in East Germany. Mr. Hahn has persuaded several Western auto-parts companies to open factories in East Germany as well.
Volkswagen's trainees sound far less worried about the future than most East German workers. Take Holgar Kowalski, a former Trabant worker who is a trainee at Mosel: ''The new plant is better equipped and cleaner than the Trabant plant. It's more fun to work here. We're going to roll up our sleeves and get to work.''

THE ECONOMY
 
Banks Move in on Stocks
 
J.P. Morgan & Company has become the first bank since the Depression to win authority to sell and trade corporate stocks. The Federal Reserve's approval on Thursday was the largest breach in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which divorced commercial from investment banking. For the time being, Morgan and other banks that might win similar authority may have new products but few buyers. New stock issues are few, although spreads for underwriting them remain high, since finding investors can be harder than selling, say, Government bonds. With banks like Morgan flush with corporate clients, these margins are likely to narrow. And what about the dangers of letting the banks, few as strong as Morgan, play in stocks? Morgan himself sometimes put up his own money to support other banks and pull the nation out of panics. But banks without the Morgan name or backing might find themselves with opportunities they can't afford. 
 
 Inflation Worries Rise
 
An eight-tenths of 1 percent rise in consumer prices for August came as no shock after the disruption of oil supplies from the Persian Gulf. Economists were more alarmed by a five-tenths of 1 percent increase excluding energy and food. Even as the economy weakens, said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at First Boston, ''underlying inflation is moving up.'' The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, apparently read the numbers the same way, saying last week that he was not lowering interest rates in the face of rising inflation.
 
A Peach of a Marketing Plan
 
Atlanta rented mansions for receptions, boasted of being in the best television time zone, insisted that Los Angeles, site of the 1984 Olympics, is in a foreign country and taught every violinist in town to play ''Georgia on My Mind.'' Athens appealed to sentiment and whimpered about Atlanta's profligate $7 million campaign. And so the marketing organization masquerading as a Southern city won the right last week to host the centennial Olympics in 1996. With plans to spend $1.2 billion in private money, and reap $1.4 billion in return, the Olympics could have a more profitable few weeks than even Coca-Cola.
 
F.D.I.C. Sues Neil Bush
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Friday named Neil Bush, the President's son, as a defendant in a $200 million suit involving a failed savings and loan. The suit charges Mr. Bush and other former officials of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association with gross negligence. Mr. Bush, a former director, has denied any wrongdoing.
 
Another Jump for Oil Prices
 
Oil prices rose sharply last week amid shortages of higher-grade crude and fears of a Middle East war. The extra oil that several nations are pumping is heavier and higher in sulfur than the oil Iraq and Kuwait exported before last month's embargo. A barrel of crude for November delivery closed at $35.43, up $4.27 or 13.7 percent - the highest price in nine years.
 
No Payments Until January?
 
To move the merchandise, you have to offer terms. L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, proposed last week that the Government provide financing to purchasers of $50 billion in real estate and other assets from failed savings and loans.
 
Chase Tightens Its Belt
 
The Chase Manhattan Corporation announced on Friday that it will take a $1 billion charge, eliminate 5,000 jobs and cut its dividend in half. The charge includes $350 million for revamping and $650 million for bad loans, especially in commercial real estate.
 
In Brief
 
The nation's trade deficit rose in July to $9.33 billion, the second-highest monthly figure this year. Economists expect the deficit to remain near that range, with the rising cost of imported oil offsetting strong exports.
 
The subways, the traffic, the commotion and the bustle make it easy to get lost in the big city. New York City officials said last week that the Census Bureau failed to find 254,534 dwellings. We merely misplaced them, mistakenly listing their locations, responded the bureau.
 
The staid, century-old Financial Times confused with a screaming London tabloid? The Financial Times failed to win a temporary order last week to prevent The Evening Standard from printing its business section on paper of the same peach-colored paper.
 
The Federal Communications Commission gave providers of local telephone service more freedom to set access charges for long-distance carriers. Productivity incentives are meant to make the local providers more efficient. But the potential savings for consumers are unclear.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
An Important 'No' to Gorbachev
 
No sooner does President Mikhail S. Gorbachev make a move than one of his own top economic advisers calls it a mistake. On Monday, Mr. Gorbachev asked for a national referendum on legalizing the private ownership of land - a key premise of plans for creating free markets. Stanislav S. Shatalin, a prime author of these plans, dismissed a referendum as ''unworkable'' considering the urgency of economic change. ''If all progress was subject to a referendum,'' he said, ''we would all be still up in the trees throwing coconuts and stones at each other.'' He predicted that the referendum idea will soon fade; the President's proposal four months ago for a broader economic referendum was quickly scrapped.
 
Soviet Seat No Bargain
 
An independent Soviet press agency reported last week that the new Moscow Commodity Exchange is trying to sell seats for an improbable-sounding $162,000, or more than half the price of a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange plans to begin trading this Wednesday. The report is not quite as laughable as it seems. The Soviet Union has natural resources to match its vast geographic expanse. The Government's own commodity traders, at home and abroad, are known for being as wily and ruthless as those in the Chicago pits.
 
The Reichmanns Cash In
 
They snapped up New York office towers at the depth of the city's mid-1970's recession, then watched the value of their holdings multiply. Now, the three Reichmann brothers are, if not exactly bailing out, certainly opening the hatch. Olympia & York, their company, is offering to sell a 25 percent interest in most of its holdings in the United States. The Reichmanns are evidently not facing a financial crisis of Trumpian proportions. More likely, they want to reduce their risks and raise more cash for their huge Canary Wharf project in London, where the real estate market is also in decline. But after their losses from backing their fellow Toronto resident, Robert Campeau, the Reichmanns' reputation for savvy investing and flawless timing has suffered.
 
COMPANIES
 
A New Opus from Jobs
 
Steven P. Jobs returned to San Francisco's Symphony Hall last Tuesday to present his Op. 2 through Op. 5. Critics say the performance of his company, Next Inc., has improved since it introduced a slow, high-priced product - the black cube - in the same hall two years ago. His four new machines, faster and mostly less expensive, are likely to improve the company's sales. But they are probably coming too late for Mr. Jobs to repeat the success he enjoyed as the founder of Apple Computer.
 
Jail for Keating
 
Charles H. Keating, the former owner of Lincoln Savings and Loan, says the accusations against him come from ''malicious bureaucrats'' too dense to understand his deals. On Tuesday, charged with deceiving investors into buying high-risk bonds, he was led to jail in chains, with bail set at $5 million, beyond his reach. Many elderly depositors have said they were told the bonds were federally insured; now, they are worthless. In this case, the bureaucrats appear to have aided Mr. Keating. The California Department of Corporations approved the sale of the bonds through Lincoln branches.
 
G.M. Waltzes With Labor
 
Labor negotiations in the auto industry look less like wrestling than a waltz. The United Automobile Workers and the General Motors Corporation agreed on a tentative three-year contract Monday with scarcely a squawk or complaint. The union extended its old contract a few days rather than call a strike. The auto companies have headed into what used to be called the strike season with low inventories, confident that production will continue. The G.M. deal gives workers a 3 percent salary increase the first year, then two annual 3 percent payments, with enhanced job security. Analysts consider ratification likely by the end of this month. Ford, the healthiest of the Big Three, appears likely to accept the same terms as G.M. But a Chrysler spokesman says the company can't afford an ''outrageous pattern settlement.''
 
In Brief
 
An airline shrivels: Pan American World Airways announced plans to cut 2,500 jobs, 8.6 percent of its total, by next month.
 
Another airline turns its suppliers into bankers: Northwest Airlines received a $500 million loan from Airbus Industrie and General Electric after agreeing to buy 75 Airbus jets, equipped with engines from G.E.
 
Mortimer J. Zuckerman, a real estate developer, is said to be negotiating with the Sony Corporation to jointly develop the New York Coliseum site on Columbus Circle.

In Hard Times, Stay the Course in Equities

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
There is a substantial penalty for ill-timed panic in the stock market, warns Mark Stumpp, the director of research for PDI Strategies, a unit of the Prudential Insurance Company of America.
Stocks historically have outperformed both Treasury bills and inflation. But Mr. Stumpp calculated recently that, over the past 30 years, investors who switched from equities to Treasury bills for just 10 isolated months - the market's 10 best months, to be sure - lost virtually all the advantages of investing in equities for that entire period.
Dumping stocks might even have seemed sensible at the time, Mr. Stumpp pointed out. Four of the 10 bonanza months occurred during recessions; one encompassed the Cuban missile crisis. ''In fact, the top-10 performing months reads like a roll call of hard times,'' he said.
His strategy now? While he sees no reason to overweight a portfolio with equities, ''The collapse in stock prices over the past month has created opportunities, and we've put some cash to work.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The American Who Is Lobbying the World

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
As the Bush Administration strives to tighten the noose of United Nations sanctions around Saddam Hussein's neck, the man adjusting the rope has been doing his job with an appeal to high moral values and the lessons of history. For Thomas R. Pickering, America's representative to the United Nations, the world is engaged in the struggle it forgot to wage in the 1930's as it seeks to push Iraq's army out of occupied Kuwait.
His Security Council speeches are liberally sprinkled with references to the international community's appeasement of Hitler and the disaster that followed. He also likes to remind the world that the Security Council is merely doing what it is supposed to do - enforcing peace and international security, if half a century late. 
In the fishbowl that is the United Nations, Mr. Pickering's high moral stance is hardly out of place; this is, after all, intended to be a place where international cooperation can be realized. So his appeals to the ideal of collective security offer a compelling argument for maintaining the consensus that has allowed tough action against Iraq. Preserving that consensus has been his principal task since President Bush decided to work with the United Nations to force Saddam Hussein's invasion troops out of Kuwait.
Individual countries may have their private agendas in the gulf. But in justifying them they welcome Mr. Pickering's appeal to become advocates of international law and the rights of small nations.
Mr. Pickering's task of being point man for maintaining international unity has only been made possible, of course, by the historic changes in the Soviet Union, which have left Moscow no longer automatically siding with Washington's adversaries. The consensus has also been helped by the composition of the present Security Council, which is proving more responsive to American leadership than first expected.
Some 18 months ago, Western diplomats were dismayed at the prospect that Cuba, Romania and Yemen would join the Council this year. But the revolution in Eastern Europe transformed Romania into an ally, and while Yemen and Cuba try to protect Iraq, the Council's other third-world members - Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Zaire and Malaysia - have firmly supported sanctions.
 
Hard Times Ahead?
 But Mr. Pickering's most difficult moments probably still lie ahead. If sanctions do not bring about Iraq's withdrawal soon, the Administration may have to choose between using force or keeping American soldiers in the Saudi desert. If Washington chooses a military solution, Mr. Pickering's task will be to persuade the Security Council to authorize a war - provided, that is, that President Bush continues to work through the United Nations. If the President abandons the United Nations and goes it alone, Mr. Pickering will have to tell its members why.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Is There a Cheaper Way To Attack Rising Crime?

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Should firefighters wield guns as well as hoses, and garbage collectors carry nightsticks along with trash? Should private security patrols get city subsidies, and serious criminals be tried in special courts? Should the police stop and frisk dozens in sweeps, challenging civil liberties laws?
Those are among the questions that New York City officials are weighing - with varying degrees of seriousness - now that they have committed themselves to hiring thousands more police officers and to augmenting the rest of the criminal justice system to deal with the extra arrests.
The challenge is to make the whole stubborn, sprawling process not just bigger, but better.
Mayor David N. Dinkins, in an interview taped in Washington last week with John McLaughlin, the television political commentator, called crime in New York ''an emergency situation'' that ''calls for extreme measures.'' 
In theory, there should be enough prosecutors, probation officers and parole officers, enough judges and court officers, enough jail guards and jail cells, to handle the problems the police bring in off the streets every day. But virtually no one thinks there are - or that the system they are in works very well.
So if more officers are hired and more cells are built, but trial calendars are still clogged, dismissals of serious charges are still common, caseloads for probation workers are still too high, the gap between arrest and arraignment times is still too long and the likelihood of avoiding punishment is still high even for criminals who are caught, what will have changed?
Not much, even the city officials charged with changing things acknowledge. ''It will take a tremendous amount of will, determination and managerial skill,'' said the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, Milton Mollen. ''People are enormously resistant, and particularly institutions are enormously resistant to change.''
Just as experts disagree on what causes crime, so they differ - sometimes bitterly - over how best to combat it. Criminologists, like dentists, say the first strategy should ideally be prevention. With it, there would be fewer crimes and no need for so many system-jamming arrests.
Much of Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown's concept of community policing, in which officers are encouraged to get to know neighborhoods and take time to solve problems, is in this vein.
But senior city officials acknowledge that far more novel, even radical approaches have been raised, some of them the brainchildren of past and present officials. Each idea, however, raises a new potential problem.
For example, should firefighters, who spend less than 10 percent of their time fighting fires, be armed and sent to patrol neighborhoods between fires? Or at least drive around in their imposing trucks keeping an eye on things, instead of resting, cooking or cleaning firehouse equipment? Training would be a problem, and union resistance, both from the firefighters and the police, would undoubtedly be great.
''There is no substitute for professionally trained police officers to deliver professional police services to the city,'' Dennis Sheehan, a spokesman for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said yesterday. ''Everybody is tripping all over each other with these crazy ideas.''
Should the city support neighborhood crime patrols, offering $20,000 matching grants that would help them buy cars or hire private guards? Standards would have to be set, vigilantism could be a problem, and the money to qualify for the grants would probably be raised more often in middle-class neighborhoods than in high-crime ones.
Another idea is to beef up the Police Cadet Corps, under which college students work part-time for the department in exchange for scholarships. But the cadets, who work in gray and blue uniforms that are distinctly different from standard police dress, carry nothing more lethal than nightsticks, and officials said there would be an uproar if one was killed in the line of duty.
One option the city is seriously discussing is creating special ''major offense'' bureaus in the court system, where persistent offenders or people on trial for serious crimes would be specially tracked to prevent their cases from being dismissed for procedural problems, like the failure of a prosecutor to appear on time.
''The idea would be to have much tighter discipline in getting the cases through,'' said First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel. ''That requires the judges to be much tougher.''
Mr. Mollen, who was formerly the presiding justice of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, is to talk with senior judicial officials about this and other ideas this week.
And what about probation and parole, the great black holes of the system, out of the public mind except when, as often happens, someone on probation or parole is arrested for a horrifying crime? On any given day, 56,000 people are on probation in the city, and 75,000 pass through the system each year, more people than are in jail statewide.
More than 70 percent of those now on probation are felony offenders, up from 56 percent in 1984, according to Catherine M. Abate, the city's Commissioner of Probation. More than 60 percent are drug abusers and more than 50 percent are unemployed. Probation officials argue that more supervision, more employment and more counseling could make probation ''the most sensible long-term solution for reducing crime,'' Commissioner Abate recently told the City Council.
There remains the problem of how to pay, and who will do so. The state bears the cost of parole, of hiring judges and of building state prison cells, and subsidizes probation and, to a lesser degree, district attorneys. But the city must carry the bulk of the burden, from hiring police to building local jails and courtrooms.
With the city already facing a probable budget gap of well over $1 billion for the coming fiscal year, there are no quick fixes. But officials say they have no choice but to try.
''All the components play an important role,'' Mr. Mollen said. ''And unless we keep our mind focused on all the elements in the criminal justice chain, we're going to be in serious trouble.''

The Violent Debate Over Tribal Sovereignty

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
The standoff between some 20 heavily armed Mohawks and the Canadian Army has become the rallying point for many Indians across Canada and the United States who claim vast tracts of government land and who want to establish complete sovereignty over areas they control.
But the standoff is also evidence of a power struggle within Indian communities between well armed and well financed militants and traditional Indian leaders. Since the decision in 1973 by Indian militants at Wounded Knee, in South Dakota, to take up arms, many Indians have been debating how they should carry out their struggle for rights and land. This debate has resulted in armed clashes between opposing Indian groups, most recently on the St. Regis reservation in upstate New York and in Oka, Quebec, which is 18 miles west of Montreal. 
Among the stakes are the millions of dollars in profits from gambling operations and the illicit sales of tax-free gasoline and cigarettes, two primary sources of tribal income. More important is the question of how Indian communities will press forward with their extensive land and compensation claims, how they will move to develop their economies, and what future relations will be like with state and federal officials.
''We are trying to define ourselves and our future,'' said Doug George, editor of Akwesasne Notes, which is published on the St. Regis reservation. ''The route we take to develop our local economies is the most important issue we face. Now we have an option between the Mafia-style gambling operations that have corrupted much of our youth, and relying on the income we make working in the white community. Neither of these choices is beneficial to us and we must find some way out.''
In Oka, about 20 Indian militants and 30 women and children are holed up in a white clapboard building surrounded by coils of razor wire, soldiers in flak jackets and armored personnel carriers. Indian leaders and Canadian officials are trying for an agreement to end the crisis, which began with a shootout on July 11 between Indians and the Quebec provincial police. One police officer was killed in the encounter and 400 army troops moved in to occupy most of the area on Sept. 1.
The clash evolved from a dispute over 55 acres of pine forest, which local officials wanted for a golf course, into a fight by Indian leaders for sovereignty over all the land they claim and the right to control their economic and political destiny. Trying to mollify the Indian community, the Canadian Government bought the land and has offered it to the Mohawks. But the militants say this is no longer enough.
In the last 20 years many tribes have rescued themselves from cultural extinction, teaching their native tongues to their children and turning to tribal traditions for guidance. Federal welfare programs hoisted many Indians above the poverty line, although a disproportionate number still live in poverty. Unemployment runs as high as 40 percent on reservations in the United States, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. But education and health have improved, and tribes are displacing government agencies that administer Indian programs.
''We are going to close one of our agency offices on the Cherokee reservation next week,'' said Carl Shaw, a spokesman for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington. ''I expect that in the next few years we will be closing dozens more.'' The bureau has 84 agency offices and 12 area offices throughout the United States.
 
Playing Bingo
 Indians have also gone to the courts to get back or be compensated for land they contend was taken illegally from them. The 1.5 million Indians in the United States own about 54 million acres and are trying to regain or be compensated for millions more.
But efforts to increase land holdings have been accompanied by a loss of traditional means of economic support. Throughout the United States and Canada urban encroachment and pollution have all but obliterated hunting, fishing and farming. Reservation land, owned collectively, cannot be used as collateral for loans. And the gray area of sovereignty frightens many outside investors.
With so few alternatives, many tribes have turned to gambling. There are more than 100 bingo or gaming operations on the 310 tribes in the lower 48 states. Many of these organizations are establishing close links with the militant Indian underground and organized crime, Indian leaders contend.
Militant Mohawks, grouped around the Warrior Society, have built a multimillion-dollar business in gambling and smuggling tax-free gasoline and cigarettes on Mohawk reservations in the United States and Canada. The money has proved alluring to other Indians, especially the unemployed young. The militants have invested in high-powered weapons, such as AK-47 assault rifles, and have shown a willingness to use them. Thomas A. Constantine, the Superintendent of the New York State Police, said that the Warrior Society ''has more assault weapons than the entire New York State Police.''

As Problems Fester, Voters Send Pink Slips

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In growing numbers, Americans say they are fed up with politicians. They look around and see schools that don't teach, streets that aren't safe, doctors they can't afford. Then they look to Washington, or Sacramento or Albany or City Hall, and they see bickering and feuding and deadlock.
This gap between problems and performance is pushing the American electorate from apathy to anger. Last week the frustration boiled over at the polls in Massachusetts and Oklahoma, where voters dumped establishment political figures in favor of candidates who promised, as John R. Silber, the surprise Democratic gubernatorial nominee, put it, ''to take back your government.'' 
More of this lies ahead. There is talk of a populist rebellion, an idea consistent with the fact that so far the disenchantment is greatest in, but not limited to, the states where economic times are toughest.
The dark side of such rebellion is beginning to worry people. Both liberals and conservatives conjure images of political lynch mobs. Ann Lewis, a longtime Democratic party worker in Boston, said that after virtually every candidate affiliated with the current Massachusetts administration was repudiated last week, the mood was especially gloomy. ''I looked out my window,'' she said, and almost imagined seeing an angry mob with ''Michael Dukakis's head on a pike.''
Historically, an angry public turns to the party out of power to fix things. But on the basis of a recent public opinion survey he conducted for the Times Mirror Company, Andrew Kohut concluded that voters are losing faith in both parties.
''Things are so bad, let's fire everybody and start over again,'' Cathy Walsh, a Boston bank teller, said after voting in Tuesday's Massachusetts primary.
Ms. Walsh is expressing an exaggerated version of an anger that Americans are showing across the country and which is distinctly different from the anti-government fervor that fueled California's Proposition 13 tax revolt and swept Ronald Reagan into office. That was a rebellion against the liberal welfare state, and particularly the burden middle-class white people felt they were being asked to bear for it. But surveys show that a substantial majority of Americans now want more from government, not less - better schools, cleaner air, safer streets, less expensive health care. In some cases, they say they would accept tax increases to pay for these things.
But at the same time, people have lost faith in the ability of politicians to run things honestly and efficiently for them. Polls show that at least two-thirds of Americans think government is usually wasteful and that officials in Washington quickly lose touch with the people. They want the deficit reduced, but all they see on television are pictures of men in suits riding to an Air Force base in big cars. Nothing seems to get accomplished. In a piece of exquisite political perversity, Michael Dukakis apparently came close to defining a deep political need when he said the issue was competence. The issue is competence, although not in Mr. Dukakis's technocratic sense, as if government were just a big machine and the only trick is knowing the right lever to throw.
Kevin Phillips, the political analyst, sees a new populism on the rise. He argues that in the public eye, company presidents who take big salaries for themselves while jobs are exported are of a piece with politicians who raise their own pay but can't balance the nation's, or the state's, checkbook. Clearly, the anger and disenchantment is worse in places were the economy is more troubled, like Massachusetts and Oklahoma. But even in Washington state, where the economy remains strong, voters dumped the chief justice of the State Supreme Court and none of the professional politicians seemed to know why. But the upset winner, Charles Johnson, thought he knew. ''They wanted a new face on the bench,'' said Mr. Johnson, a little-known lawyer from Tacoma.
There are signs that a self-perpetuating cycle is developing. Americans do not believe in the politicians they elect and the politicians are terrified of the people who give them their jobs. ''We are simply afraid to make any difficult decisions,'' said Representative Ed Jenkins, Democrat of Georgia. ''We're afraid we'll make someone mad at us.''
Still, the rising mood of disenchantment does not mean that every officeholder will be summarily dumped. Incumbents often find that simply being in office gives them the power to stay there. Moreover, the Persian Gulf crisis has provided a powerful distraction from domestic discontents that often focus anger against politicians.
But there are signs that the voters are looking for ways to get the attention of even the most safely seated office holders. In Oklahoma, voters by 2 to 1 approved a measure to limit state legislators to a total of 12 years in office. James Browne, an attorney in Oklahoma City, said the new law ''means having citizen legislators in the Capitol rather than professional politicians.'' Silmilar measures will be on the California and Colorado ballots in November.
Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant, says he fears that the same anger that draws voters to such measures, which he supports, could feed something much scarier. ''What you're getting now is aggressive alienation, aggressive hostility at the system and the people in it,'' he said. ''At that point we have a different problem as a country. If you had someone who was truly a demagogue come along he or she would be very powerful. A George Wallace with class could sweep this country like wildfire.''

The Battle of the Columnists: Telling Leaders How to Think

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
In the earliest days of the Reagan Revolution, conservative activists frequently showed their disdain for the technocratic, bipartisan politics they believed prevailed in Washington by proclaiming ''Ideas matter!'' The ideological furor now roiling the conservative movement is reminding politicians and the press that idea-mongers matter too.
In recent weeks, conservative newspaper columnists, editorial pages and television commentators have been battling one another, hurling accusations of militarism and anti-Semitism at fellow members of their once-unified clan. Superficially, they are fighting over the extent of America's military commitment to the oil sheikdoms of the Middle East and to Israel. But their battle is really about the intellectual direction of the conservative movement and the Republican Party. The debate is being watched by conservatives who recall that issues like supply-side economics and the differences between totalitarian and authoritarian governments were fought in the columns before becoming Reagan Administration policy and the law of the land. 
''If politicians are to be able to decide what the electorate wants, they have to have the parameters of the debate communicated to them by the scriveners,'' said Jude Wanniski, an economics consultant who edits ''The Media Guide,'' an annual survey of the press.
Mr. Wanniski helped push the supply-side argument that large tax cuts would lead to sizeable revenue increases for the Federal Government when he was a member of the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. But he and others credit the syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak with making the theory respectable enough for mainstream Washington to accept.
 
Trickle-Down Punditry
 Generally, punditry does not directly result in new policy, but in a reshaping of the ''political framework'' in Washington that allows politicians to succeed and policy to be set, said Don Sipple, a Republican political consultant. He said that pundits in Washington helped Dianne Feinstein generate money and publicity for her California gubernatorial campaign by speculating on her attractiveness as a candidate on a national Democratic ticket. ''It's the old notion of trickle-down, and the byproduct is conventional wisdom,'' said Mr. Sipple, who is advising Ms. Feinstein's opponent, the Republican nominee for California Governor, Pete Wilson. ''It can be unnerving.''
Columnists and commentators have not wielded their powerful cudgels solely in conservative circles. Official Washington credits - or blames - The New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis with providing some of the glue that united opposition to Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. But in recent years, the conservative voices have had far more effect.
Conservatives have historically lacked powerful interest groups like trade unions and ethnic organizations to take their case directly to political leaders. The currents that influenced conservative thought - and the Republican Party - over the last two decades began flowing largely through neoconservative journals like The Public Interest and Commentary. Ronald Reagan's affection for two more traditional conservative publications, Human Events and The National Review, led many to seek access to him through the printed word.
The current conservative contretemps over America's military intervention in the Persian Gulf began as a match between two columnists who once worked as speech writers in the Nixon White House, William Safire of The New York Times and Patrick J. Buchanan of Tribune Media Services. Mr. Safire calls himself a ''geopolitical conservative'' and argues that ''the Republican Party is not going to go the route of a narrow conservative movement.'' Mr. Buchanan grudgingly accepts the appellation ''neo-isolationist'' and says, ''The old cold warriors, Catholics and others who saw Communism as evil and a threat against our country will go back to our familiar point of view - let's tend to our own affairs.''
The arguments grew more heated when other conservative columnists and editorial writers began questioning whether Mr. Buchanan, who was director of communications in the Reagan White House, was trafficking in anti-Semitism. In The Washington Times, Mona Charen, a syndicated columnist who worked under Mr. Buchanan as a communications aide in the Reagan Administration, complained that he blamed Israel for inciting the Bush Administration's intervention in the gulf and singled out American Jews as supporters of an American military response. Soon after, A. M. Rosenthal of The New York Times connected these opinions to past Buchanan columns that challenged the case against a man convicted of Nazi atrocities by an Israeli court.
Mr. Buchanan defended himself in his own Wednesday column and called Mr. Rosenthal's attack a ''contemptible attempt to stifle debate, especially on the issue of America's relations with Israel.''
Tony Snow, the editorial page editor of The Washington Times, which pays close attention to conservative affairs, attributes the bitterness over the Middle Eastern situation to a sense of ''ideological gridlock'' in the White House and the feeling that the future of conservatism is up for grabs. At stake are America's role in the post-cold war world, and the relative primacy of international and domestic issues in conservative and Republican politics.
''Many people see George Bush as part of a different era, of the time when the question was 'Are Communists good or bad?' '' he said. ''His view of social policy is noblesse oblige, not the entrepreneurial populism that's growing in the Republican Party. A lot of people are waiting for Bush to pass from the scene.''
 
Replaying the Past
 Some historians agree, and see the war among the pundits as replaying debates that preoccupied conservatives for much of this century. ''I think it's the right going back to its former policies,'' said John B. Judis, the author of a recent biography of William F. Buckley Jr. ''It's this combination of isolationism, with Israel figuring in there as an international cause about which Americans should be wary. Decades ago, the far right feared that there was an international Jewish conspiracy led by the Rothschilds and people like that. The parallels between the late 1940's and now are unmistakable.''
But today conservatives of both stripes have an effective new conduit for their ideas. ''The war between the interventionists and the neo-isolationists has moved to the weekend talk shows and the op-ed pages,'' said Mr. Buchanan. ''It is not only among journalists, like Buchanan and Safire, but between Brzezinski and Kissinger, and it moves onto shows like 'The Capital Gang,' 'Crossfire,' 'The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour,' David Brinkley's Sunday show and 'Nightline.' This is where the debate is played out. It is an unrecognized sea change in American politics.''

In the Democracy Of Nicaragua, Control Control Is Still From the Top

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua

 BODY:
When Violeta Barrios de Chamorro was elected President last February, Nicaragua appeared ready to trade a long tradition of authoritarian leadership for an exuberant, if chaotic, attempt at political pluralism.
But with each passing week, Nicaraguans are learning that the habit of rule from above dies hard. The new Government's pluralistic exterior has given way to the familiar image of a closed, even secretive group of leaders, pursuing its vision of Nicaragua's future with little attention - or even advance notice - to its allies and the public.
The transformation has been all the more remarkable because it has paired Mrs. Chamorro's closest personal adviser, her son-in-law Antonio Lacayo Oyanguren, with a principal leader of the still-powerful Sandinista front, Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, in an attempt to devise a working relationship far above the heads of the voters. 
That collaboration has not been enough to guarantee social peace, or produce the united front of business, labor and government that the new administration has called for to rebuild the country's shattered economy. But it has had a profound effect on the structure of power, leaving many Nicaraguans wondering what unspoken compromises the new Government has made with the Sandinistas, and carrying Nicaragua far from the kind of democratic process that put Mrs. Chamorro in office.
''You get the feeling that the whole country revolves around the private conversations of these two people,'' a European diplomat said, referring to Mr. Lacayo and General Ortega. ''No one really knows what they say to each other, or what they have already agreed. But their relationship defines the terms of every important event here.''
Formally, Mrs. Chamorro's election coalition was made up of people with a broad collection of ideological views, ranging from Communists to conservatives. But the political diversity was largely discarded even before her inauguration; the President-elect named a technocratic Cabinet whose most important members are a few personal aides led by Mr. Lacayo, her longtime chief strategist and plenipotentiary.
From the start of Mrs. Chamorro's campaign, Mr. Lacayo, an American-educated businessman who had worked successfully in partnership with the Sandinista Government, declared that the new President would seek no revenge against the former regime, but would instead work with it to forge a new national consensus. The Government has since pursued that goal with an independence and political generosity that have enraged many of Mrs. Chamorro's conservative supporters and bewildered even her strongest personal allies, who have begun to doubt that they have been told the full extent of the concessions to the Sandinista leadership.
In one-on-one transition talks with General Ortega last march, Mr. Lacayo, acting on behalf of Mrs. Chamorro, signed a controversial accord in which the newly elected officials agreed to leave undisturbed the Sandinista-dominated army and security forces in return for Sandinista commitments to allow an orderly change in government.
 
 Meeting Resistance
 Mr. Lacayo overcame conservative resistance to that trade-off by pledging publicly that no other pacts or protocols that would limit the Government's power had been reached in secret. But Government supporters, including the Bush Administration, were then outraged when Mrs. Chamorro, at Mr. Lacayo's urging, let General Ortega remain as her highest military officer in a further gesture toward national unity. Mr. Lacayo then tried to sell the gesture to skeptical leaders of Mrs. Chamorro's coalition.
''There were 50 people in the room when he told us about the decision,'' said a conservative politician. ''Forty-seven were against it, but the three votes won.''
To mollify opposition to her retention of General Ortega, Mrs. Chamorro announced that she would serve as Defense Minister and would exert strong control over the military. But the value of that pledge has now been thrust into doubt by the appearance of two new laws, formally published this month but dated before the elections. They strip the Defense Minister of most powers and make the army commander almost invulnerable to outside control.
Asked about the new laws, which were signed by former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra, Mrs. Chamorro said she knew nothing of them and dismissed them with what has become her habitual response to such questions: ''I am the one who gives the orders here.''
But Sandinista officials said the laws were fully discussed with Mr. Lacayo at the transition talks in March. And even diplomats who have strongly backed the new Government have begun to assume that the transition pact runs far deeper than the Government has admitted.
 
No Fear of Coups
 Conservatives argue that the Government does not have to make concessions to the Sandinista leadership out of fear of a coup, because even Sandinista officials admit that a military overthrow of the new President would bring near-unanimous international condemnation and perhaps American intervention.
Whatever Sandinista commitments the Government has won by its generous stance also appear to be sharply limited, given the drumbeat of Sandinista-led strikes and protests against the new regime. Those street actions, which often begin and end so abruptly as to seem choreographed, are increasingly interpreted by foreign analysts here less as genuine political events than as markers in a broader game between Mr. Lacayo and General Ortega.
The unusual partnership has been reinforced by its effective monopoly on Nicaragua's press, which is divided between two pro-Sandinista newspapers and La Prensa, the former opposition daily that is owned by Mrs. Chamorro's family and edited by Mr. Lacayo's wife.
But against a background of deepening economic crisis and public misery, the Government's reliance on high-level, closed-door deals has already taken a toll on its popular support. And with no one else to blame if it should fail, Mrs. Chamorro's small inner circle still faces the first requirement of even the most autocratic regime - that it achieve results.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Running the Gulf Coalition Is Tricky Business

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It would be hard to find another international military operation in which the raising and distribution of money has played so central a role as it has in the Persian Gulf crisis. Watching American officials traveling the globe in recent weeks collecting pledges of more than $20 billion to support the anti-Iraq coalition makes one wonder whether the United States has military allies in this affair or only limited financial partners.
Why have so many countries been more preoccupied with the movement of funds than the movement of troops to defend Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi forces that took over Kuwait? The broad answer, which Administration officials have been reluctant to articulate, is that deep down the United States understands that many of its partners are in the coalition only because of a coincidence of interests, not because they share a common sense of moral purpose. 
To be sure, the motivation of the Saudis, Kuwaitis and other gulf Arabs is obvious. Kuwait's independence is at stake and the others fear for their own survival. But the other leading members of the anti-Iraq coalition have joined for a grabbag of reasons, among them tribal feuds, desires to impress the American Congress and efforts to divert attention from their own misdeeds. Administration officials seem to understand that this is not the enduring cement of grand coalitions. They did not want to see these motives put to the test of sacrifice, and that is the main reason billions were raised to cushion four prominent front-line countries - Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Turkey -from feeling any financial pinch from the crisis.
 
No Victory Gardens
 While opinion polls show that the American people overwhelmingly support what President Bush has done, and are appalled by the actions of the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, Administration officials also fear that American taxpayers may not be committed enough to the anti-Baghdad operation to be ready to sacrifice for it, even if only in the form of higher taxes. Therefore, the officials feel that the public has to be cushioned from any financial sacrifice and the operation has to be presented as virtually cost-free. No victory gardens necessary, thank you. Such was the logic of the fund-raising trips of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
For now, though, the coincidence of interests that underlies the anti-Iraq coalition has come together at the United Nations to produce an international consensus that defies historical parallel, expressed in the form of six high-minded Security Council resolutions that place Iraq under sanctions and call for its unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. Statesmen and politicians around the world have been impressed by President Bush's achievement in forging this consensus in the United Nations. This week, as the General Assembly opens, the Security Council is near agreement on a resolution to ban passenger and cargo flights to and from Iraq and occupied Kuwait, except on approved humanitarian missions.
But the question now is: Has Washington obtained everything from the United Nations that it could hope for, and, having done so, might it become a prisoner of the very international coalition it has forged? That international coalition was based on the lowest common denominator of interests: to keep Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia and to demand its withdrawal from Kuwait. But since those objectives were agreed upon, many in Washington have come to believe they may be too modest. Many now argue that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, while a necessary condition for peace in the gulf, is not sufficient. Unless Iraq's military infrastructure, nuclear potential and chemical weapons plants are destroyed, the reasoning goes, President Hussein will still be able to intimidate his neighbors. For now, though, the ambitious objective of flattening Iraq appears to be very much outside the scope of the fragile international consensus.
And fragile that consensus is. An old saying in the Middle East -that all roads lead to the bazaar - comes to mind when one considers the many different interests that countries such as Syria, Turkey, Egypt and the Soviet Union have in this crisis. While the United States has sent troops from afar, infusing this situation with its traditional moralism in foreign policy, many of its partners see the confrontation as just business.
Consider Syria. The Government of President Hafez al-Assad, which in 1982 killed an estimated 20,000 of its own citizens to quell an uprising in Hama, could give even Saddam Hussein a lesson in brutality. Itamar Rabinovich, an Israeli authority on Damascus, said that for Syria the crisis ''is nothing less than manna from heaven.'' To begin with, Mr. Assad and President Hussein have been trying to kill each other for 15 years. Now Mr. Assad has a chance to finish off his Iraqi rival, and with American approval. More important, Syria, which was suffering from severe recession and inflation, can expect between $1 billion and $2 billion from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for sending troops to the gulf. And at a time when Syria had been isolated - particularly by Washington - for its reported involvement in the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland in 1988, President Assad found himself taking two friendly phone calls in a week from President Bush, inviting him to be a comrade in arms.
The end of the cold war raised questions in the West about Turkey's strategic value. The gulf crisis has let Turkey show NATO it still has a strategic role to play, and has let it show the European Community that it can provide a political and economic land bridge to the Middle East. Meanwhile, the Turks have been well compensated by Japan, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for shutting Iraq's pipeline in their country.
Egypt too is getting full payment for its losses, as well as an opportunity to get the West to help it triumph over its most serious competitor for Arab leadership - Iraq. The Arab League's headquarters have been returned to Cairo from Tunis and Egypt is even being invited to reassert itself in the Persian Gulf.
The gulf has been the traditional area for Egypt to project its power eastward, and for that reason the Saudis have always wanted to keep the Egyptians at arm's length. The Saudis well remember that the Egyptian rulers Mohammed Ali, in the 19th century, and Gamal Abdel Nasser, in the 1960's, made power plays for domination in the Arabian Peninsula. Never mind. The Egyptians now find that their military presence is being sought, and they can expect that when this crisis is over their surplus labor will be welcome in the gulf region as never before.
Moscow is also by no means innocent of hidden agendas. No doubt its cooperation with Washington has been the keystone in assembling the broad consensus. But it is clear that Soviet officials, while they want the United States Congress to give them full credit for being cooperative in the gulf, do not want full exposure there if things go bad. They have committed no troops, no ships and no money to the international endeavor. As one Administration official mused, ''The Soviets are perfectly positioned to share in the credit if things go well or hop off the train if the war option turns messy.'' The Russians may have grown weak, but they have not grown stupid.
Given this cocktail of motives and interests, the coalition against Iraq is by nature a fragile one that limits Washington's room for maneuver. This is partly because the consensus is based on achieving only the modest objective of forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait; it could easily collapse if pressed to do more than that. The coalition is also confining because, as anyone who has raised money will attest, the minute you accept money or a political endorsement you have to take the donor's opinions into account. America may have sent planes, tanks and marines to the gulf, but others have provided the funds or political cover for their use, which means they cannot be used at will.
Some might argue that this is precisely the meaning of, and a small price for, real collective security as envisioned by the United Nations' founders. George Bush, as a former United Nations delegate, clearly identifies with the organization's aspirations to collective security and he clearly relishes the role of managing partner of this global coalition.
But there is a tension between this role and America's role as superpower, and Washington still has not come to grips with it. While it wants the legitimacy and authority that come from being the managing partner of a noble international consensus, it also wants the freedom of action to pursue its global interests, even if that should lead to destroying Iraq's military potential.
That tension was evident last week when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had to fire the Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Michael J. Dugan, for openly speculating about bombing Baghdad. Such bellicosity may come naturally to the commander of the most powerful air force on earth, who is accustomed to planning to pursue his nation's global interests with whatever force is necessary. But expressing it publicly is something else - and was especially embarrassing for the President in this case because of the concerns about preserving an international consensus with still relatively limited objectives.

HEADLINE: No End of Lessons on Iraq

 BODY:
Two enormous miscalculations lie at the root of the Persian Gulf crisis. The most glaring was Saddam Hussein's rash assumption that the world would do little or nothing if Iraq devoured Kuwait. But his dirty deed owed something to the world's limp response to Iraq's previous use of poison gas, its grim human rights record and its voracious appetite for mass-killing weaponry. 
Rarely has a tyranny so amply advertised its malign intentions. Yet on the very eve of Iraq's conquest of Kuwait, State Department officials were pleading with Congress not to impose economic sanctions against Baghdad. A rising chorus in Congress now faults the Administration for its past blunders. But Washington was not alone. Something went fundamentally askew in many capitals, and it is worth asking why.
The first and most understandable explanation is Western and Arab fear of Iran. When Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, Saddam Hussein seemed a lesser threat than fanatic Islamic revolutionaries. Iraq's aggression went uncondemned by the U.N. Security Council. And when Iranian troops thrust into Iraqi territory, much of the world tilted toward Baghdad.
Weapons flowed to Iraq from France and the Soviet bloc. In 1982, the State Department removed Iraq from its list of countries supporting terrorism. There was no hard evidence that Iraq had changed its pro-terrorist policies. But Washington's action opened the way for $300 million in U.S.-guaranteed loans to purchase wheat and rice. In 1984, the U.S. resumed diplomatic relations with Baghdad, and began providing satellite intelligence to Saddam Hussein's generals.
The collaboration with Iraq survived the Iran-contra scandal. It persisted despite Iraq's 1987 rocket attack on the U.S.S. Stark, killing 37 of the crew. And it fostered a protectiveness about Iraq's transgressions. When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against Iran and later against his own Kurdish minority, the State Department voiced its disapproval - but brought no complaint to the United Nations. Nor did any other country.
In August 1988, the gulf war ended in a cease-fire. Yet the tilt to Iraq persisted. Baghdad had become the American farmer's best customer for rice, the eighth-largest buyer of wheat and second-biggest user of U.S. commodity credit guarantees. Burgeoning trade helps explain why the U.S. muted its protests when Saddam Hussein threatened to gas Israel, and even apologized for a Voice of America broadcast on the evils of police states.
Not all the blame falls on middle-level officials, whose job it is to cultivate better relations with difficult regimes. Nor is it seemly for Jeane Kirkpatrick to ascribe self-deception to a State Department weakness for Arab strongmen. The former United Nations envoy was herself a warm advocate of Argentina's strongmen prior to and during the Falklands war.
Responsibility for fixing the tone of U.S. relations with Iraq belongs at the top, with the President and his Secretary of State. Both erred in giving Saddam Hussein the benefit of doubt, and in believing that American leverage might restrain this tiger.
They have made amends, but it remains a shortcoming in this country's political culture that when blunders occur, nobody and everybody is responsible. By contrast, when Argentina invaded the Falklands, exposing serious miscalculations in British diplomacy, the Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, felt it a matter of honor to resign.
Different rules apply inside the beltway. But while no resignations are in order, the Bush Administration can still atone for its blunders by heeding the central lesson. There's no more dangerous game for a democracy than to wink at avowed and cherished principles in currying a tyrant's favor.

HEADLINE: What Britain Sowed, Iraq and U.S. Now Reap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Rules of the Game: Inertia and Force'' (Week in Review, Sept. 2), a geographic-historical graphic on the Arab world, you describe Iraq as ''awarded to Britain'' under a League of Nations mandate after World War I. It was the British who fashioned Iraq out of Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, three vilayets, or provinces of the Ottoman Empire. And what a poor design it turned out to be.
Sir Arnold Wilson, acting civil commissioner in Mesopotamia in 1917, summarized the British position: ''the idea of Iraq as an independent nation had scarcely taken shape, for the country lacked homogeneity, whether geographical, economic or racial . . . it was scarcely to be hoped that the vilayets of Basra and Baghdad could maintain their existence as an autonomous state without the revenue it was hoped might eventually be derived from the economic resources of the Mosul vilayet.'' 
The ''economic resources'' of Mosul were vast petroleum deposits in the region of Kirkuk. Unlike Basra and Baghdad, which were predominantly Arab provinces, Mosul was in Kurdish territory, as maps drawn by the Royal Geographic Society in 1910 clearly indicate. According to the Iraqi census of 1922-24, the population of the Mosul vilayet consisted of 494,007 Kurds and 166,941 Arabs. But fully anticipating control over the oil reserves under a League of Nations mandate, the British pressed for incorporation of the predominantly Kurdish province into what was to become a state dominated by Arabs. The British Government even imported a Hashemite sheik from the Arabian Peninsula to become king of the new Iraq.
Thus, the British set the stage for what was to become a chronic cycle of Kurdish uprisings and Arab repression. In the same way the British engineered the creation of Kuwait when it was discovered that beneath the sands at the tip of the province of Basra there lay a wealth of oil. Seen in this light, Saddam Hussein's annexation of Kuwait is a vastly inferior version of an earlier British model.
Now with Britain running close behind, the United States steps into the picture bringing to bear its full force of arms to keep an Arab despot from executing his own crude plot to control the oil in the region he still calls Basra. A centerpiece of the strategy of Britain and the United States is an embargo on food and medical supplies to the Iraqi people - although if Iraq is the dictatorship we all know it to be, the people of Iraq, Arabs and Kurds alike, are all its victims. What price oil, in whose name precious distinctions between democracies and dictatorships are continually eroded?

HEADLINE: In the Gulf, the Danger of a Diplomatic Solution . . .;
. . . And the Horrors of a Desert War

BYLINE: By James Webb; James Webb was Assistant Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan Administration.

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
President Bush has not only embarked on his own voyage into the Persian Gulf, that Bermuda Triangle of Presidencies. Unlike his two immediate predecessors, he has dragged more than a hundred thousand of our troops with him. And as the President struggles at home, our troops have been learning to cope with a sun that can melt electrical wiring, sand so fine that few filters can keep it out of gear boxes and a growing ennui that seeps through even the most careful monitoring of our press corps.
The debate over our role in the Persian Gulf crisis has focused on national, rather than specific military goals. The fundamental questions, upon which all others inevitably rest, have not been addressed. Why did we send such a huge contingent of ground troops in the first place? And under what conditions are we going to use them or bring them home? 
Answers are not forthcoming. Military officials intimate that the question would expose tactical options. Administration officials talk in vague terms: Defense Secretary Cheney is telling us to prepare for a commitment that may take years. Others have been quoted as saying we may be there for a decade. At the same time we are being reassured, amidst many loud calls to initiate a war with Iraq, that the U.S. military commitment is wholly defensive.
As one who opposed the Reagan Administration's overt tilt toward Iraq which caused the Persian Gulf problems in 1987 and 1988, I have no desire to give consolation to Saddam Hussein now that he is getting the attention he deserves. But if our experience since World War II tells us anything, it is that justifiable national goals are too frequently lost through unfocused and ineffective military policy. And the strongest likelihood is that our ground buildup in Saudi Arabia is the product not of conscious strategy, but of an initial overreaction that compounds itself with the arrival of every C-5 transport.
The Kuwaiti dilemma is not new. This is the third time since 1961 that Iraq has asserted, militarily, its claim to Kuwaiti territory. As such, positioning U.S. aviation units into Saudi Arabia with ground forces to defend them was appropriate as a short-term guarantee of Saudi sovereignty. But the huge buildup of forces began after it became clear that Iraq had no military designs on Saudi Arabia. And coupled with escalating rhetoric, it has created an intractable siege, with the survival of President Bush, as well as Saddam Hussein, hanging in the balance.
The U.S., whose interests in the region are far less than Kuwait's, Saudi Arabia's, Israel's, Europe's and Japan's, is carrying the overwhelming burden. True, others are involved in small scale - the Egyptians, who stand to benefit to the tune of at least $7 billion in forgiven debts, the Syrians, traditional enemies of Iraq, who are sending a few thousand soldiers, other Arab nations whose royal families are also threatened, European and other allies who are throwing in a ship or two here, and a military unit there. We appear to have traded the promise of greater economic help to the Soviets for Mikhail Gorbachev's rather noncommital statement of support.
And now we are out on the international hustings, asking for financial contributions for our effort. Mr. Bush hastens to assure us that this does not make our soldiers mercenaries, but anyone with a relative or loved one in Saudi Arabia will quickly argue that this is not a fair trade.
And what is the impact, strategically, of the introduction of all these ground forces? In grand sum, it can only be judged as negative.
Those who have called for massive, pre-emptive air strikes against Iraq must now contemplate the detriment of tens of thousands of American soldiers within range of Iraqi chemical weapons, as well as possible terrorist attacks from Iraq and now Iran.
Those who worry about the possibility of crisis in other parts of the world must recognize that a large percentage of American maneuver forces - including as much as half of the Marine Corps - are tied down in a waiting game in the desert.
Those who believe we should use these forces offensively should realize that this would galvanize the Arab world, invite chemical retaliation and an expansion of the hostilities, produce great numbers of casualties and encourage worldwide terrorism - in short, open up a Pandora's box. This is not to say that our soldiers and marines would not fight well. The Iraqi army is not a very good army; it is also war-weary. But it demonstrated against Iran the time-honored maxim that the armies of totalitarian nations are capable of absorbing huge losses - recall the 3.7 million German soldiers who died in World War II, and the million Communist soldiers who died in the Vietnam war.
The President should be aware that, while most Americans are laboring very hard to support him, a mood of cynicism is just beneath their veneer of respect. Many are claiming that the buildup is little more than a ''Pentagon budget drill,'' designed to preclude cutbacks of an Army searching for a mission as bases in NATO begin to disappear.
Others wonder about the predominance of Texans in the Administration, and the dual benefit that higher oil prices will bring to the Southwest: a more robust economy and the concomitant salvation of many S.& L.'s. Others, myself included, worry greatly about a military commitment that has taken on a momentum of its own - or perhaps a hidden strategy.
General Colin Powell is said to have advised the President that the U.S. should take this sort of military action or it would no longer be a superpower. This calls to mind the Suez Crisis of 1956, after Egyptian leader Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal. The British were reeling from a budget affected by the military costs of maintaining the Empire. The Suez Canal was vital for transporting oil. And Anthony Eden, the British Prime Minister who had great antipathy toward Nasser for his anti-British rhetoric, wanted him ''destroyed.''
Britain went forward, largely to preserve its place at the table of the great powers, drawing in the French and the Israelis. Their attack sputtered in the desert. The U.S., their banker, threatened to withhold support for the British pound if they did not cease their invasion. The Soviets moved into Hungary. And sure enough, when the dust settled, Britain was no longer a great power.
Too much is at risk, and too many questions remain for this buildup to continue without the Administration clarifying its direction. And if offensive action is in the cards, it should be taken only after the President receives a declaration of war from the Congress.

HEADLINE: Soothing Sand And Adobe Of Mazatlan

BYLINE: By William Brand; William Brand is a reporter and columnist for The Oakland Tribune.

 BODY:
From the air Mazatlan is an urban sprawl on the edge of a wide, green, coastal plain - dotted by isolated hills and bordered by the sea. Far to the east, the Sierra Madre range disappears into an almost constant cloud bank. To really get the feel of the place, though, come on the fast, overnight train from Nogales on the Arizona border. An hour or so before arrival in Mazatlan the train breaks out of a jungle of palms and banana trees onto a low cliff overlooking the sun-soaked Pacific. The tracks parallel the shore along miles of empty beaches, then the first big hotels flash past, and the train roars into town.
The weathered, seldom washed train station is a wild mixture of vendors selling huge, freshly squeezed glasses of orange juice, cold, spicy shrimp, their eyes and feelers still attached, and tamales, stuffed with grilled fish.
The air feels languid and humid after the overnight trip through the Sonoran Desert. Temperatures range into the 80's and 90's in summer, but the heat is tempered by the ocean breeze. After the rainy season begins in July, relative humidity rises sharply to as much as 85 percent. The fall is hurricane season. Winter and spring are dry with high temperatures in the 70's and 80's. 
Mazatlan, with a population of 380,000, has more than 10 miles of white sand beaches. They are safe and usually uncrowded, even though this is a busy port. There's a beach for every taste and time of day - from Olas Altas on the south, where crosscurrents smash together creating thundering waves favored by surfers around dawn, to lonely, shell-strewn Cerritos on the north - the perfect place to wander until sunset. And unlike Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta, most of Mazatlan's major beaches are untainted by pollution.
When one tires of surf and sand, there's a city to explore, including a charming historic section. Founded as a lookout post by Spanish soldiers in 1531, Mazatlan received its first visitors in modern times about 50 years ago. They came for some of the best deep-sea fishing in the world; these days, 6,000 marlin, sail and other billfish are caught here in an average year. Those early fishermen were captivated by the city's physical setting, the narrow streets and vistas of the old quarter.
By the 1940's, visitors were flooding the city. American film stars like John Wayne and Robert Mitchum were regulars: Mr. Wayne for the fishing, the food and the parties, Mr. Mitchum for lazy days on empty beaches and the parties, said John George, the American owner of Playa Mazatlan, a large hotel complex, and a friend of both men.
Today, Mazatlan draws a half-million tourists a year. At Carnaval and five weeks later during Easter week, the city is especially crowded. Hotel and dinner reservations are impossible. The beaches are wall-to-wall bodies. But the rest of the year, there's plenty of room and just enough to do to soothe even the most stressed-out visitor.
High on the list of activities is choosing a beach. Olas Altas, the southernmost and oldest tourist beach, is on a deep cove. It's a beach for sunning and surfing, not swimming. Crosscurrents cause waves to crash into waves, occasionally making swimming dangerous.
Heading north along the seaside promenade, in the shadow of Icebox Hill, Boulevard Olas Altas becomes Paseo Claussen. Fishermen and young men who dive for oysters beach their boats here. It's a place to buy fish at dawn, not to swim.
A mile and a half north the street widens, becomes Avenida del Mar and the hotels stretch to the horizon along a shallow bay three miles wide. Hotels here tend to be moderately priced. The beach is Playa Norte. The first portion of the beach, near the Fisherman's Monument at Avenida Gutierrez Najera, has fine, white sand and gentle surf, but a sewer outlet mars the water. A few blocks farther north, the sweep of the tide keeps pollution away. Waves often strike Playa Norte with full force, but the beach drops away slowly, allowing one to wade some distance before reaching deep water.
Playa Norte ends at a rocky promontory. Avenida del Mar narrows and becomes Avenida Cameron Sabalo. This is the Zona Dorada (Golden Zone), a crowded nest of high-rise hotels, glittering shops and informal restaurants. The two-mile-long, wide, curving stretch of beach has several names, beginning with Playa Cameron, then Gaviotas and finally Sabalo, which is the best place to swim, people watch and be seen. The surf is fairly gentle because three small, offshore islands blunt the force of the waves. Most of the best hotels are here, including El Cid, Camino Real, Inn at Mazatlan and Playa Mazatlan. There are parachute rides, diversions like sailboard rentals and a profusion of vendors selling items from all over the country: folk-art puppets, silver jewelry, brightly colored blankets.
The final three miles of beach - known as Cerritos - begin just over a lagoon from the Camino Real Hotel. Except for an occasional surfer, Cerritos is empty and is a good place to check for shells at low tide. There are several restaurants with tables under umbrella-like, thatched palapas at the northernmost end. But the food is unexceptional. Better to order an iced green coconut, drink the milk with a straw, then spoon out the soft, pulpy meat. Cerritos is accessible by cab or bus; look for ''Cerritos'' written on the windshield. You can also ride a pulmonia, a peppy little open-air jeep that costs less than a cab.
Mazatlan comes from a word meaning ''place of the deer'' in Nahuatl, the language of the area's pre-Columbian inhabitants. The city was founded by Spanish soldiers led by Nuno de Guzman, the most ruthless of the conquistadors. It became an important port in the 19th century as gold and silver flowed from mines in the mountains and agriculture developed nearby. Mazatlan was blockaded by American ships in 1847 during the Mexican War, known here as the American Invasion. It was blockaded again in 1864 during the Civil War by French ships, intent on creating a monarchy in Mexico for Maximilian.
Mazatlan has one slight claim to international fame: the city's historians say the second-ever aerial bombardment occurred here in 1914 during the Mexican revolution. (The first was in Tripoli.) According to Gilbert Limon, who heads the Mexican National Tourism office in Mazatlan, supporters of the insurgent Alvaro Obregon built a crude black powder bomb, took it aloft in a single-engine biplane. They intended to drop it on forces loyal to the despotic Mexican President Victoriano Huerta. ''The problem was the pilot became a little airsick and dropped it in the wrong place - on Icebox Hill,'' Mr. Limon said. ''It exploded, killing two people and wounding several others.'' Mazatlan today is much more than a beach. The historic section has maze-like streets, where the adobe walls of many houses date back 200 years. A walk through the area, which is east of Olas Altas Beach, can include a peek inside the former opera house, built in 1860, now Teatro Angela Peralta, named for the turn-of-the-century Mexican diva who died in Mazatlan. Long a ruin, it is being painstakingly restored. Massive doors, set between stone columns, lead through thick adobe walls into a marble-floored lobby with an ornate dome. The theater, on Plazuela Machado, the oldest plaza in town, is being redone as funds become available.
Cafe Pacifico at the other end of the tree-shaded block offers tapas and capuccino at outside tables.
There's a tiny regional museum in a restored colonial house three blocks down Calle Sixto Osuna. It's worth a short visit - as much to see the inside of an acient adobe building as to view the modest collection of pre-Columbian artifacts found recently around Mazatlan.
The seaside boulevard and promenade that follows the beaches to the edge of the city begins as Boulevard Olas Altas a half-block from the museum.
The city also has a small aquarium, Acuario Mazatlan, with an impressive display of live fish taken just offshore. Tanks full of pirannahs from Brazil are especially popular with children.
Shopping centers have arrived in Mazatlan, but thousands of residents still shop daily at the big, tin-roofed central market. Aisles are stuffed with an interesting mix of tropical fruits, fish, coffee beans and tourist trinkets. Out around the beaches, there are clusters of shops with fine leather goods and bright cotton designer fashions.
Choosing a place to stay is another of Mazatlan's charms. There's a wide variety, but even top hotels like El Cid Resort and the Camino Real are inexpensive by American standards, a maximum of $250 a day for a suite on the Pacific. Large, single rooms for two with an ocean view are about $170. There's plenty of ambiance at the budget end, too. The white-washed, three story La Siesta on Olas Altas is $14 a night for two - with the same dazzling ocean view.
By United States standards it's equally inexpensive to dine. Dinner for two at Casa de Tony and Senor Pepper's, two of Mazatlan's best restaurants, costs less than $45. At Cenaduria la Negra, a simple spot with elegant food, favored by the Mexican cookbook author Diana Kennedy, one person can dine well for $5. All have menus that capitalize on the fresh seafood readily available on their doorstep: at Tony's, perhaps seafood crepes and a shrimp shish kebab followed by owner Tony Valdez's Key lime pie. At Senor Pepper's, grilled spiny lobster is a specialty.
It's possible to never take a bite of seafood and eat well in Mazatlan, but it would be a mistake. Nowhere else in Mexico do cooks turn out excellent seafood dishes so consistently as they do in Mazatlan.
If a day on the beach hasn't stripped away urban cares, the sunset will usually do the trick. The appropriate drink is a margarita with or without tequila, or a brewed-in-Mazatlan Pacifico beer. The mood is magical. Waves crash into the sparking curve of beach as the afternoon wanes. Then, in an instant, it is sunset, lush and warm and tropical. The palms become fading silhouettes; the sun flows into the Pacific, and the sky flames molten red.
Some visitors collapse after sunset, others pursue the city's restaurants, and the more hardy dance until dawn at discos like Valentino's at Punto Sabalo and El Caracol at El Cid. But something almost every visitor does at least once is visit Senor Frog's on Avenida del Mar. The founders, Chuey Juarez and Carlos Anderson, now have copies in cities around the world, but there's no place like Senor Frog's: a crazy place with zany, irreverent waiters, license plates on the walls, loud music, huge margaritas, beer served in buckets of ice, tourists dancing on tables. The food is quite good, especially the ribs.
Those party-happy fishermen of 50 years ago would be amazed at how the city has grown, but they'd be at home at Frog's, content with the knowledge that Mazatlan's reputation as a place for a good time continues to hold true.

HEADLINE: Ireland for, Yes, the Food

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill; Molly O'Neill, a reporter on the Living-Style staff of The New York Times, writes frequently about food.

 BODY:
The people of Ireland regard the changes on the national table with the kind of self-satisfied wonder normally reserved for rainbows.
''We knew it was here all along,'' say the fishermen who trawl the pristine northerly Atlantic and the farmers who till the sloping countryside. Still, they are awed by the finesse that is nudging bland stews off the country's table. Ireland's natural larder has traditionally been turned out with a stubborn, peasant touch. But recently, as an increasing number of Irish chefs hone their skills in France, the country's cooking has moved toward a distinct cuisine.
''In Ireland, cooking was always a drudgery of making do with very little,'' said Patrick Foyle, who along with his sister Anne owns Rosleague Manor in Connemara. ''Only in the past few years with the stronger economy have Irish people had the time and money to appreciate the pleasure of cooking and eating well.'' Today, the restaurants that dot the countryside are beginning to garner cautious recommendations from guide books like Michelin and awards from Egon Ronay and to attract an audience that often brings a tradition of fine dining along with fat wallets. 
The dining revolution isn't over in Ireland. On the continuum that stretches from necessity to indulgence, Irish cooking is somewhere in the middle. To American tastes, fish and meat are frequently overcooked. Brine-cured smoked salmon seems to have set the national standard for salt. Cream, butter and roux are deployed with wholesale abandon. Yet the cooking in Irish restaurants today has the energy and altruism of a changing order. When a dish misses (an average of one out of four does) the diner can usually scrape off an overreaching sauce, push aside a mismatched accompaniment and still savor stunningly high quality fish or meat.
''The French are teaching us,'' said Mr. Foyle. The new lessons play against the bedrock of British cooking, and so sauces can be gravy-heavy. They can also soar. A perfectly whisked bearnaise does wonders for the deeply marbled salmon, satin blankets of saffron cream are perfect for the country's sweet thumb-sized mussels, the saltmarsh-grazed lamb couldn't be better roasted with garlic and thyme. Not long ago potatoes were simply boiled in their own wrinkled jackets. Today they are wafered into stylish gallettes and simmered fancifully en casserole.
After a recent 14-day, 26-restaurant tour of Ireland, from Connemara to Dublin, I can confirm the rumors: It's possible to eat well in the country today. It takes insight, patience with the foibles of a cuisine in the midst of change and a willingness to pay Manhattan prices for meals. Throughout the country, wine lists are heavy on red wine - specifically, clarets - and generally 25 percent more expensive than their American counterparts. But there's always a choice of good beer and stout. Service in the restaurants I visited was generally affable and attentive, but not polished.
By beginning in Connemara, the wind-torn jut of land between Lough Corrib and the Atlantic, the traveler encounters early Ireland, a land of savage beauty. Off-shore, black sole, brill, turbot, ray and lobster can all be taken. In brackish waters, crayfish are dense as bees around a hive. Trout and salmon run like unbroken silver ribbons in the streams. But many days are a relentless two-step of rain and fog, leaving boats docked and fish uncaught. Except for root vegetables and cabbage, vegetables are precious.
There is a folk saying in Connemara that every day has four seasons. The cooking, in response, is spontaneous and simple. The dining room at Rosleague Manor epitomizes the spirit of the region.
Flanked by a manicured lawn and gardens, Rosleague presides over mountains that roll from green into blue-green to gray toward Ballinakill Bay. Its ballroom-sized dining room is the sort of place where a sporting gentleman would preside: pumpkin-hued walls hung with landscapes, pictures of the hunt and antique plates that suggest generations in a rambling family home full of dried flowers and mismatched chintz.
On a warm, languid night, there is frothy iced cucumber and potato soup, or a mound of sweet crabmeat with lemony mayonnaise. Fillet of flounder might be poached, topped with tender lobster, glossed with a light vermouth cream sauce. On a cool, misty evening, the crab might be devilled and baked, the soup a pungent puree of lovage and potato, the lamb roasted with garlic, the ray browned in butter. Salads are a tumble of wild watercress, sorrel and lettuces from the Foyle's seven-acre farm. And the brown bread - the moist peasant-style whole-grain loaf leavened with soda and sour milk that is as dear to the Irish as the baguette is to the French - is dense and honest.
Patrick Foyle's fare is not culinary epiphany; it is simple food cooked in harmony with each day. And the same accord prevails in simpler restaurants of the area.
In Roundstone, a tiny fishing village overlooking Betragh Bay in Connemara, Beola is a tiny, subdued, peach-hued place, as close-packed as Grandma's living room set up for a dinner party. With garnishes whittled from cucumbers and radishes, all the dishes have an arty conceit. But the simpler ones - mussels baked under garlicky breadcrumbs, salmon with a slick of hollandaise and brill, lightly dusted with flour, pan-fried and served with tartar sauce - make a wonderful lunch or informal dinner.
Down the street at O'Dowd's, simplicity plays in a more traditional Irish key. The close-packed 14-seat dining room adjacent to the bar is an ageless Irish pub with its heavy wood tables and ambient aroma of stout and fried fish. And the heady, potato-thick chowder, pan-fried flounder, chips and steamed lobster are worth traveling for, at least for lunch at bargain prices. O'Dowd's is also the perfect setting in which to sample an Irish classic: oysters chased with a slug of Guinness. Oysters from these northerly waters have deeper, frilled shells and a briny, faintly copper taste that stands up to the deeply malty, bitter taste of the stout.
The breezes of early 20th-century British graciousness still waft near the top of Cashel Bay in Connemara where Cashel House Hotel serves Gallicized British fare - smoked salmon quiche and marinated mussels, salmon with hollandaise and herb-roasted chicken - in a cozy domain of chintz and leather, library tables and rattan. Cashel House is said to have been the favorite spot in Ireland of President Charles de Gaulle. That says a lot about how far Irish cooking has come in the last several decades: Cashel House is cozy, but my lunch was of the stodgy French school, circa 1950.
The premonitory winds of a more cosmopolitan cuisine whirl at the southern edge of the Connemara Peninsula at the Drimcong House, eight miles north of Galway City. Opened in 1984 by Gerry and Marie Calvin, the restaurant is two comfortable, though not particularly stylish, dining rooms on the first floor of an old manor house where traditional Irish dishes are carefully tempered with French technique and the occasional Far-Eastern touch. Mr. Calvin is a guru of the new Irish cooking, and his cerebral fare is sometimes stunning, sometimes not.
The menu reaches toward France with sweet lobster in old-fashioned Nantua sauce, a creamy, rosemary-scented sweetbread ragout and pan-fried duck and duck confit in a cassis-sweetened glaze. The kitchen veers toward Italy with slightly overcooked fettuccine drenched in a rich, satiny wild mushroom sauce. There is a Chinese pork and vegetable starter. Goat cheese baked in an overpowering armor of poppy and sesame seeds seemed like a refugee from California.
The best dishes stuck close to home: a starter of pan-fried slices of drisheen, the traditional blood pudding of County Cork, made with pork blood and oatmeal with a meaty, whisky-sweetened glaze and a warm salad of French lentils. The saltmarsh-grazed lamb - primarily raised to be exported to France - is roasted with shallots that add a honeylike sweetness to the herbacious meat. Pan-fried pigeon has a meaty, lovage-infused glaze. Trout is served with cider sauce and a sorrel mousse.
Driving south from Connemara, the coast smooths. Craggy meadow and mountain grass give way to rolling green hills, streams that rush with the passion of a just-melted glacier give way to placid kettle ponds. County Kerry is lush and civilized, its cooking tailored, cautiously stylish.
No one conjures the genre better than Matthew Darcy at Park Hotel in Kenmare on the hinge of the Ring of Kerry. He rolls pinwheels of fresh salmon and sole around threads of spinach and poaches them with a traditional dill cream sauce. Mussels are steamed in butter along with dainty julienned carrots and leeks. A leek and celery root soup is enriched with shavings of fresh local Stilton. Lamb is wrapped around an oyster and walnut stuffing, quail is stuffed with morels and served with a beetroot tartlette. Some of Mr. Darcy's combinations are daring; his cooking is some of the most confident and artful I tasted in Ireland.
His flawless technique and understated flavors are in elegant accord with the plush hotel dining room with its sparkling crystal chandeliers, silk-padded Louis XIV armchairs and exceptional service. Gothic silver candelabra flicker on the room's museum-quality antique sideboards and the windows open to a panorama of lake and hills.
Adjacent to the Park Hotel, the Lime Tree is a stone carriage house with a wood-beamed ceiling and homey gingham tablecloths. The chef and owner, Maura Foley, is credited with being among the first to apply modern French cooking techniques in her Irish kitchen. Dishes such as the timbale of smoked salmon, pan-fried salmon with sorrel sauce and the lightly breaded scallops with garlic butter, showcase her success. Others, like the pastry filled with creamed mussels and a mousseline of garlic and scallops baked under phyllo dough, are not as successful. Swimming in thick, creamy sauces, many dishes at the Lime Tree are too heavy for my taste.
Day trippers who navigate the curving drive between mountain and sea around the Ring of Kerry might just as well continue north to Dingle, a picturesque fishing hamlet where Doyle's Seafood Bar has garnered quite a reputation. With its flagstone floor and polished pine tables, the place is as cozy as a picture postcard and wildly popular with tourists. Mussels are dry in their cream sauce, squid lost in a tempuralike batter, but the smoked mackerel pate is a dream, lobster is perfectly steamed in sea water, trout delicious in a mushroom sauce.
Radiating east from Kerry, in Counties Cork, Tipperary, Wexford and Kilkenny, is the heart of Ireland's revitalized cheese industry. Fine restaurants all offer a selection, but most of the the well-wrought cheeses are best close to home. The premier cheese is Milleens, buttery, Munster-style. Cais Cleire Goats cheese is a tart, pleasantly chalky chevre, Cashel Blue a strong, buttery version of blue cheese. Two wonderful Camembert-style cheeses are the Cooleeney camembert and St. Killian. Mitchelstown Mature Cheddar is rich and sharp.
Some say this rich farmland in County Cork that rolls up from the southerly coast explains the excellent restaurants in the area. Others say it was Myrtle Allen. Twenty-six years ago at Ballymaloe, near Midleton in County Cork, the 18th-century manor house on the 350-acre farm that her husband owned and worked, Mrs. Allen began serving dinner.
''Irish people didn't go out to eat back then, no one would pay for food,'' she said. ''But mine was a wife's hobby, I didn't have to make much money, so I took chances.'' Back then, she took chances by serving several French dishes each night. Today, her 40-seat dining room is packed, the cooking school that she founded is always full and her homey cooking is that of an inspired grandmother with a generous heart and a self-taught French touch.
Her fresh pea and zucchini soup with mint, or the tart of local cheese and garden ratatouille pull the fashionable from Hollywood, New York and Paris as well as American and European families. Fish is remarkably fresh, whether it is turbot baked with lemon balm or black sole drizzled with watercress butter. The local Cloyne beef is well-marbled and perfectly aged. Duck and chicken have the full flavor and chew of barnyard birds.
Ballymaloe is such an idyll that it is hard to stray far from the farm. But Arbutus Lodge, a sedate, plush, Victorian dining room overlooking the city of Cork, serves some ambitious French food. Tourists, executives from the neighboring crystal and whisky companies and well-heeled locals claim the heavy armchairs at the well-spaced tables with their proper starched linens in the old-fashioned dining room. Char-grilled squid was delicious drizzled with herbed oil and roasted eggplant, the oysters were nicely matched with a tarragon-flecked, creamy cucumber sauce. Slivers of duck liver were irresistible astride waxy potatoes. Lobster was overcooked with its chive butter, and so was the brill with a pistachio sauce, but pigeon with garlic and ginger was a winner; lamb roasted with rosemary and thyme couldn't have been better.
Mrs. Allen jokes that, traditionally, the greatest distinction between cooking of the various regions is whether to add carrots to stew. North of Tipperary, she says, the answer is ''no''; south ''yes.'' Today, there are subtle differences in regional cooking.
Farther north, at the base of the rock of Cashel, the French cooking is homier at Chez Hans. In a thatched-roofed, Gothic church, the restaurant offered quenelles of turbot and rock oysters, tender chunks of lobster in a lemony butter sauce and a zuchinni mint soup that all elicited hosannas. Veal was overcooked and overpowered by its tarragon cream sauce, but the roast lamb with a port-sweetened glaze was delicious.
Early Ireland and the spontaneity of its cooking are alive in Connemara. The dairy industry (and tourism) whisper in the refined cooking of Kerry. The food of Cork celebrates both the county's bounty and the different cultures that have passed through it. In Dublin, the strong economy and a burgeoning fascination with dining out are bringing urbane fare to the table. As in the rest of the country, most dishes still reflect Ireland's past; brown bread is always on the table; smoked salmon, meaty Irish bacon and root vegetables are tucked somewhere on the menu. But the dining rooms have more style than in the countryside.
The three Dublin restaurants that everyone talks about are Le Coq Hardi, White's on the Green and Patrick Guilbaud.
Le Coq Hardi, a reclaimed Georgian town house on Pembroke Road, Dublin's Restaurant Row, is a respectable, old style French restaurant. Smoked fish is marbled with tomato, double cream and cheese and baked en cocotte, the beet root is diced in duckling broth, the bacon wrapped around a chicken breast stuffed with potatoes and mushrooms and baked in Irish whisky, the cabbage is slivered and braised and served under a brace of tender roasted quail.
White's on the Green, on the other hand, a flower-filled, white and green dining room, is polished, modern and forward-looking. Dishes such as the spiced beef with lovage and black currants, the soulful nettle soup, sea bass with braised leeks and noisettes of lamb sauteed with exotically spiced wild mushrooms turn Irish ingredients and notions into world-class dishes. Both the food and the stylish dining room have a confident sophistication fitting for a restaurant overlooking the winsome Stephen's Green.
Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud on James Place synthesizes solid French technique and Irish ingredients into state-of-the-art dishes. The airy, elegant white-walled atrium full of plants and Dublin's elite was my favorite in Ireland. I would consider making a special trip for the smoked salmon on crisp fried celeryroot cakes with horseradish cream and gamey pigeon served with a subtle almond mousse. Roast monkfish is delicious basted with honey and balsamic vinegar. Veal sweetbreads are enlivened with lemon and coriander.
And every dish cooked here seems to meld the innately generous heart of Ireland with the refined restraint of his cuisine. His combinations of flavors - lemon balm in the leek soup, chive and beetroot on the sauteed brill - celebrate the compelling, well-preserved naivete of Ireland, while introducing the cosmopolitan influences that the country has been slow to embrace.

HEADLINE: Wine;
Once Around the Bloc

BYLINE: BY Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
The wine bars in the lovely Old Town in Prague are far more notable for their beer. It doesn't matter, because Czechoslovak beer is great. But for a while, during a recent visit, it seemed as if the city's charms were not going to include anything vinous.
Then, at dinner one evening at the Inter-Continental Hotel, the waiter brought a wine list. Prague has many surprises for first-time visitors from the West and this was one of them: There were at least 30 different wines, from at least three Czechoslovak wine regions. 
Forget that all their names were in Czech or Slovak and thus totally incomprehensible to this linguistically backward traveler. Forget that the waiter was trained to push the house wine in about 10 languages. The truth was that the house wine, a riesling from Moravia, turned out to be quite good. And the prices were spectacularly low: $6 or so for the younger wines.
If Czechoslovakia, which is hardly world-renowned for its wines, can offer such a surprising assortment, imagine what we can expect in a few years from the rest of the emerging countries of Eastern Europe. The sale earlier this year of the vast collection of wines from the czars' cellars near Yalta was a hint of things to come.
In the darkest days of totalitarianism, the Soviet Union produced vast quantities of wine. Not long after the devastation of World War II, the Soviet leaders began to try to wean their people from vodka to wine by increasing the area under vines from a few hundred thousand acres to more than 3 million. Today, the Soviet Union is the second-largest producer of table wines after Spain, and the third in total wine production after Italy and France.
Not only do the Russians consume most of their own wine, they also import millions of gallons from other Eastern European countries, particularly Hungary. Hungary, in addition to what it ships off to its giant neighbor, has never stopped supplying the West with its precious Tokay and its robust Egri Bikaver (Bull's Blood). Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria - they are all wine countries and have been for a thousand years. Even in beer-drinking Czechoslovakia, per capita consumption of wine is higher than it is in the United States. And if most of the wines are of the quality of the house wine at the Inter-Continental Hotel, there should be a receptive audience for them in the West.
It will never be a large audience; heaven knows, we have all the wine we need. But wine fans are always looking for something new. The secret - actually, it's no secret at all - will be to upgrade the quality. While visiting Hungarian vineyards and wineries years ago, we were struck by the interest in the most advanced techniques. The newer wines, from state-of-the-art wineries around Lake Balaton, were well made but lacked character. If wine makers in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe try to copy Western wine styles, they are going to be disappointed in the Western response.
Now that economic as well as political barriers are down, Eastern European wine-making equipment is likely to be upgraded and vineyards replanted and quality should improve considerably. For wine fans in the West, it will mean learning a new vocabulary. They will be comparing the relative merits of Murfatlar and furmint as dessert wines, and consulting their dictionaries to decipher Czechoslovak, Bulgarian, Russian and Georgian labels.
For better or worse, Czechoslovakia has been heavily influenced by Germany over the centuries. So it isn't surprising that its white wines - and the best Czechoslovak wines are white - are influenced by the German and Austrian styles. Prague is at the same latitude as the Rheingau and the grapes are even the same: Rhine riesling, traminer and sylvaner for the whites, and blauer burgunder and portugieser for the reds. In Moravia, just north of the Danube, the main grape is the Austrian veltliner. Probably the most varied wines come from Yugoslavia, which, it has been noted, has its feet in the Balkans, its head in the Alps and leans toward Italy. The best wines come from Slovenia in the north, where the vine rows march up to the border of Italy's Friuli district. Riesling, sylvaner sauvignon and traminer are the best-known grapes - all of them white. They are often identified as Lutomer wines, after Ljutomer, a wine-making center. The wines on the Yugoslav side of the border are not as good as their Italian counterparts, but then the Slovenian wines come mostly from cooperatives and the Italian wines from proud, individual producers.
Bulgaria has managed to quietly become an excellent host for the best French grapes: cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and merlot. For most of its history, Bulgaria was dominated by Turkey and the Islamic laws prohibiting alcohol. That period came to an end barely a century ago, so Bulgaria's wine tradition is a relatively modern one. It will be fascinating, one day soon, to compare the best Bulgarian cabernets and chardonnays with those of the West.
In fact, we may see Bulgarian wines sooner rather than later. Bulgaria has always exported more than 70 percent of its wine, and the producers are happy to substitute Western-style labels for the traditional Cyrillic lettering. Less exotic, perhaps, but it's nice to have some idea of what you're drinking.

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber; Bruce Weber is an editor of this magazine.

 BODY:
Margaret Hetley, the head librarian at the Hunts Point branch of the New York Public Library in the South Bronx, is having a typical afternoon. It's quiet, subdued - a couple of men in leather jackets killing time, reading magazines at a corner table; a woman in a nurse's uniform perusing the library's community service guide; a young mother with an infant in a stroller browsing in the neatly kept stacks - until about 3:30 P.M., when the local schoolkids begin filing in.
Hetley, a slight, bespectacled woman in her 40's, wearing jeans and running shoes and the weary, amused, authoritative expression of librarians everywhere, is showing off the branch's well-used collection of 10,000 titles in Spanish - including computer texts and auto-repair manuals as well as volumes of Spanish and Latin American literature and the complete works of Agatha Christie - when the hectic part of her day begins. A pre-teen interrupts: Where are the books on George Washington? Then there's a query from a baffled youngster desperate for what he thinks is a math text. ''That sounds like computers,'' Hetley says. ''You don't know? Honeychild, it's your homework.'' 
During a brief respite, Hetley takes a visitor to the reading room on the second floor, noting that the roof leaks and, along the way, pointing out on the stairway the building's ''intercom'' system - a coffee can filled with washers, suspended on a rope, that is rattled to call employees to the phone. Upstairs, she stops in front of a computer to chat with the high-school student in charge of teaching younger children how to use it. But her attention is diverted again. ''Don't run,'' she calls out, adding with a sigh: ''This is a recording.''
The scene at Hunts Point is expressive of the mundane yet indispensable social role played by the whole of the New York Public Library system, one of the nation's grand institutions, encompassing four nonlending research libraries and 82 branches spread out over the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island. (Brooklyn and Queens have independent library systems.) ''It is entirely a service organization,'' says Andrew Heiskell, for the last decade the chairman of the board of trustees, and its dual mandate - to acquire and to provide - is both the library's strength and the bane of its existence. Its 46 million separate items - books, manuscripts, journals, recordings - constitute the second-largest collection, after the Library of Congress, in the United States. And its usership - from the city's students, for many of whom the branches function as their public-school libraries, to Ph.D. scholars; from lawyers and investment bankers, who take advantage of the library's vast stores of public records from around the world, to the homeless who find solace in its quietude and warmth; from reporters (who invaded the library's map room for street maps of Baghdad and Kuwait) to novelists like E. L. Doctorow and Toni Morrison - is wider and more diverse than that of any other like institution in the world.
But in an era of proliferating information, maintaining its breadth of services and depth of resources is an ever-escalating struggle. The New York Public Library is in much the same predicament as the yeoman-spirited Hetley; for all it has and for all it does, more is always in demand.
This is a particularly pivotal moment in N.Y.P.L. history. Having completed a $307 million fund-raising campaign last December, the culmination of a decade of rejuvenation, the library has rebounded famously from veritable ruin. The campaign provided for 200,000 items, acquired but inaccessible, to be catalogued and shelved. A huge conservation effort, to save crumbling volumes or, in the case of lost causes, to preserve what was in them on microfilm, was initiated. The library's showcase, the central research facility at 42d Street and Fifth Avenue, has been largely restored to its original Beaux Arts splendor. Behind it, underneath Bryant Park, a $20 million expansion will be ready next April - one of four new facilities scheduled to open next year. The resurgence among the city's corporate and private donors of library chic is the legacy, more or less, of Vartan Gregorian, who departed last spring after eight years as president of the institution to become president of Brown University.
But by now, with the exception of $30 million that bumped the library's endowment to $180 million, the campaign money is nearly spent, leaving the place - and its new president, the Rev. Timothy S. Healy - confronting cutbacks in vital city support and a budget that calls for $19 million in private donations for fiscal year 1991. ''We're broke,'' Andrew Heiskell says cheerfully. ''With a little more muscle than we had. We can arm-wrestle a bit with City Hall. But we're broke.''
Timothy Stafford Healy is a native New Yorker, a Jesuit who came to the library after 13 years as president of Georgetown University in Washington. Now president of an institution with more than 3,000 employees and a budget this year of $132 million, he defines his job this way: ''I am the library spokesman, its principal fund-raiser and administrative head. But once you've said that, you've got a whole lot of spaghetti on your plate.''
Indeed, since being named to succeed Gregorian in April 1989, Healy, now 67, has spent much of his time simply becoming familiar with the place. A big-bellied man with a large Irish face and an intellectual swagger, Healy is a man of appetites - a smoker, an appreciator of good talk, good Scotch, good writing, good jazz. He's combative, opinionated and political, though his brawny authoritativeness is well-tempered by an instinctive democratic tolerance and a fondness for aphorisms and sardonic humor. To describe the library's financial position these days, and his own role, he resorts to a wry, self-deprecating metaphor. ''You know the old New Yorker cartoon with the guy sitting watching a squirrel in a treadmill?'' he says. ''There are two women standing in the door, and one says to the other: 'We're now due for half an hour of gloomy philosophy.' I'm the squirrel.''
Healy is, nonetheless, enraptured by the library and is apt, at the slightest provocation, to extol its assets: the books in 3,000 languages and more than 2,000 subject areas (''They tell me there's even an elegant pornography collection,'' Healy says with a raised eyebrow); the 130,000 different periodicals; the rare volumes, manuscripts and letters in the Berg Collection of English and American Literature; the 400,000 maps. Or the employee he met for the first time in the men's room, a cataloguer. ''I said, 'What do you catalogue?' He said, 'Turkish, Farsi and Urdu.' That makes you feel illiterate,'' recalls Healy. About library employees in general, he's fond of saying that ''the library's greatest assets go home every night.''
People who know both Healy and the flamboyant, effusive Gregorian contrast them with relish. ''Gregorian is a bottle of champagne, Healy's a good Port'' is the prevailing metaphor within the library walls. Asked to find similarities, Heiskell, who hired them both, says, ''They both have big paunches,'' adding after a moment, ''though Greg got his here.''
Different men, different moments. When Gregorian took over in 1981, the library endowment was in danger of being dissipated completely within five years. His task was rescue, pure and simple. Healy, on the other hand, is charged with pushing the library forward, establishing a future that will accommodate the different needs of the branches and research libraries. Particularly crucial questions have been brought on by the computer age. For instance: How much to invest in data-base systems and software products? What revenue-producing information services can the library feasibly provide without compromising its stature as a free public institution? And where to find staff capable of handling technological services, particularly in an era when library-school enrollment is diminishing and higher-paying private libraries are attracting the most qualified graduates?
This past winter, seven different committees composed of library employees met to consider these and other issues, with the purpose of helping the board of trustees determine priorities for future financing. A consolidated report, due this fall, will ostensibly provide guidelines for the aims and dimensions of another campaign, scheduled to begin in 1993 and conclude in 1995, the library's centennial year. ''It's no exaggeration,'' says Jennifer Herring, the library's vice president for development, ''to say that we're trying to decide the kind of library we want to be in the next century.''
There are more extensive research collections in the world, and branch library systems are not uncommon, but no library of equivalent size is more accessible. Not only do its branches cater specifically to the city's children and generally to the needs of its diversely ethnic neighborhoods, but as a collective research facility -unlike, say, the Library of Congress, Harvard's Widener Library, Oxford's Bodleian or the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris - the New York Public Library has no favored constituency; with the exception of a few specialized collections that are limited to scholars, virtually anyone can get to virtually anything. ''Of all the great libraries in the world,'' Healy says, ''we're the only one that's truly public.''
For the purposes of library administration, this public is composed, in essence, of two groups - serious scholars and everyone else. The distinction is made nicely by Stephen C. Klein, the regional manager for six branches in lower Manhattan and head librarian at the Jefferson Market branch in Greenwich Village. ''Basically, when people come to a branch library, they want something to take home,'' Klein says. ''If you can satisfy that need, then, by and large, you've got a happy customer.''
Unlike the research libraries, the branches depend almost entirely on the beneficence of state and city governments for their operating costs. Earlier this year, the city announced a cut of $3.28 million in support for the branches for fiscal year 1991, and though lobbying by Healy and others has helped restore some of that, the branches have lost 8 percent of their city financing in the last three years. It now seems likely that a third of the branches will be unable to meet the stated goal of staying open five days a week.
Keeping the doors open is the key issue at the branches, whose connection to their communities is often intimate and fierce. At a meeting of the branch libraries council this spring, Dean Sheehan, the head librarian at the Riverside branch on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, reported that 1,000 letters of protest were received when notice was posted that the library would no longer be open on Saturdays. ''Outrage ruled the day from the moment the signs went up,'' Sheehan said. Certain statistics help explain the devotion of branch users: People checked out more than 10 million books last year. The branches ran upward of 26,000 public programs and classes - including lectures, discussion groups, musical and theatrical performances, adult literacy workshops and early childhood programs for toddlers, among others - that were attended by more than half a million people. In short, the branches represent as welcome an outreach organization as any in the city.
''One unsolved problem,'' Healy says, as if to prove the complexity of even mundane decisions in matters of service, ''is how deeply we go into videotapes. Obviously, classical videotapes are one thing - great old movies. But do we go with the Mutant Turtles, whatever the hell that is, 20 copies per branch?''
Of course, Healy's own concerns regarding the branches tend to be more grandiose. His first practical priority is the completion of a computer link, ''so you can walk into any branch and contact any book in the system via computer, find out if it's bought, if it's catalogued, if it's shelved and who has it.''
Healy is determined to keep the branches responsive to their specific communities, particularly as the ethnic makeup of neighborhoods evolves. ''There are linguistic shifts that are tactically necessary,'' he says. ''If a district has become 80 percent Puerto Rican, we can't have a branch that acts as though it's still 80 percent Italian.''
One specific constituency targeted for attention is the city's children. Indeed, Healy is unequivocal in saying that school-age children represent the most important single group the branches serve, and he has begun seeking ways to institutionalize cooperation between librarians and teachers. Nearly a third of the city's 634 elementary schools do not have their own staffed libraries. Partly to compensate for this lack, partly because libraries and schools are natural allies, Healy, who began his career teaching English and Latin at Fordham Prep in the Bronx, sounds off on the subject with some exasperation:
''You're a high-school teacher; you assign 'Catcher in the Rye,' '' he says, giving the example recounted to him by a librarian who didn't have the books to meet the students' demand. ''The librarian said to me, 'I had one hardback and two paperbound copies.' Well, that's like a drugstore saying, 'Sorry Mac, I'm out of aspirin.' We've got to have some sensible coordination.''
In an appeal supported by Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, Healy has received a $485,000 grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund to set up an experimental library orientation program in three school districts ''that would bring the teachers together with the librarians for planning sessions, bring all the kids, in grammar school and junior high, into the library and start making sure that every kid has a card and knows how to use it.''
Beyond that, Healy has also put forward the notion of opening branch libraries inside the school buildings. ''The problem is schools close at 3 o'clock and the building shuts down,'' he says. ''There have got to be schools where an independent access can be created, and we can run a children's library in the school, with our own librarians and our own books and us in charge of its hours. I'm quite sure that would work.''
A Donne Scholar with a doctorate in English literature from Oxford University, Healy has taught at Fordham University and, before going to Georgetown, served as vice chancellor for academic affairs at the City University of New York. Obviously, his background as a scholar informs his affection for his current place of employment, particularly the research libraries.
In terms of operation, the research libraries differ from the branches in that about 60 percent of their budget comes from private sources. The city owns the buildings and maintains them, but endowment income and gifts from donors supply the lion's share of the rest.
''The branches get all the fuss,'' Healy says, ''but they're essentially immortal. Whatever the city lets us have, it will never be without branch libraries. But the center, the heart of the library, is private and vulnerable.''
What is particularly at issue, he goes on, is the New York Public Library's role as a national resource for scholarship.
''Twenty-five years ago, if you wanted to do research in the social sciences or the humanities, 80 percent of what you needed was published in this country,'' Healy says. ''That's now down to 60 percent. More internationally significant stuff than ever is being published in foreign languages, and just at the point where the need is greatest for the future of American scholarship, hundreds of university and college libraries have stopped buying in Europe because it's too expensive. We could very easily get back to where we were in the 1890's, when if you wanted to do serious academic work you had to go abroad.''
With that in mind, Healy has lately begun traveling back to Washington to garner Federal support for what he views as ''a national service.'' He wants Congress to appropriate funds for a network of great libraries - ''five or six of us,'' he says - to purchase foreign books and periodicals, whose availability would then be shared. ''We're not talking about billions,'' Healy says. ''If to each of those libraries a grant of $2 million or $3 million a year were made by the Federal Government for foreign purchases, the libraries could then divvy themselves up. The California libraries would look to Asia, the East Coast libraries could look to Europe, the Southern libraries to Latin America.''
Earlier this year, the lobbying project had already taken root in Healy's mind; since then, events have conspired in his favor. With the Bush Administration's announced intention to support the nations of Eastern Europe in their recovery from years of cultural repression, Healy is now able to bring trade bait with him to Washington.
''We're one of the best Eastern Europe collections in the world,'' Healy says, ''and for 40 years we've been in touch with the great libraries behind the Iron Curtain. We know what they need. One of the things they have problems with is bibliographic knowledge - to know what's out there that they haven't got. The second thing they need is help in acquiring things that American libraries hold. For instance, we have all the Polish state documents that were destroyed during World War II. If you want to do serious history on the Polish Government, you're better off in New York than in Warsaw. That ought to be fixed.''
It isn't a deal Healy is offering, exactly. Indeed, he's telling the Feds they'll have to pay for the copying and transporting of library materials overseas. But Healy knows a trump card when he's holding one. ''I mean, the Government is doing it, and we're saying, 'Use us,' '' Healy says. ''I guess it is a political strategy. There are only three ways of making things happen - guns, dice and politics - and I prefer politics.''
Playing politics was certainly part of Healy's job description at Georgetown, which, under his stewardship, won generous appropriations from both the Federal and District of Columbia governments. In Healy's 13 years in Washington, the university endowment increased sixfold, to $225 million. And his lobbying experience was in the forefront of qualifications that appealed to Andrew Heiskell and the rest of the six-member search committee that selected him as library president.
Healy's Georgetown tenure was not without controversy, and one in particular has dogged him. In 1980 he refused to grant university recognition - and financing - to two gay student organizations, arguing that such recognition would amount to an endorsement, antithetical to Catholic tenet, of homosexuality.
A protracted court battle ensued, concluding in 1987 when the District of Columbia Court of Appeals upheld the student claim that the D.C. Human Rights Act of 1977 superseded Georgetown's right of religious exercise, and forced the university to provide the ''tangible benefits'' it offers to other student organizations.
The case was frequently cited after Healy was named to the library post, with opponents arguing that no man of the cloth should be charged with such a secular intellectual trust. The debate was carried out for weeks in the press; this newspaper, for one, ran opposing editorials.
''It bothers some people both ways: the Catholics who say you're wasting your time with a secular enterprise, and the other way around,'' Healy says. ''A plague on both their houses.''
More than a year into his tenure, the concerns that acquisitions of material running counter to church doctrine might be curtailed seem entirely hypothetical. Within the library, employees mostly shrug off this sort of speculation; the president simply doesn't make decisions about what the library acquires. (One department head did say that a few of her employees seemed worried at first, ''but only after reading the newspapers. Oddly enough, they tended to be the Catholics.'') And this spring, in a largely unreported transaction, the library acquired an archive from the International Gay Information Center Inc. - more than 100 boxes of materials documenting the gay rights movement in the United States over the last 40 years.
''It's an obvious thing for the library to collect,'' Healy says.
The matter of acquisitions - what to collect - is, of course, at the heart of any research library enterprise; the completeness and currency of collections is what draws scholars to them, and the capacity to serve the intellectual community is how the institution itself is measured. During the 1970's, a decade that, in general, represented the low point of N.Y.P.L. fortunes, the central research facility cut hours, cut service, cut upkeep on the building and cut cataloguing - but not acquisitions. As a result, the mammoth backlog is still being catalogued. ''And what we're discovering,'' Healy says, ''is that almost one-third of it is catalogued nowhere else in the U.S.''
Indeed, the four research facilities of the N.Y.P.L. constitute a resource that has few peers. The library's annex on West 43d Street maintains an archive of hundreds of newspapers published in the world since 1800 and a patents collection second only to the United States. patent office. The Performing Arts Research Center, located at Lincoln Center, holds the world's largest research collection devoted to dance as well as a mammoth music division, a recorded sound archive with nearly half a million recordings, and a collection of more than two million items chronicling the history of the theater and entertainment. In Harlem, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture holds five million items. And then there is the central research facility, whose size and variety tend to defy circumscription. Its divisions include general research, economic and public affairs, microforms, maps, Judaica, Slavonic and Baltic studies and United States History, local history and geneaology, and many other special collections.
But maintaining the stature of the collections is now at issue. Last winter, one of the library's planning committees was charged with determining priorities for future collecting, and as Natalie Seweryn, chief acquisitions librarian for the research libraries, puts it: ''Unfortunately, we decided we'd have to make some effort at streamlining.''
Seweryn oversees a staff of 125 selection officers, often scholars in their own right, who are responsible for library purchases in distinct subject areas. They are in touch with 70 vendors worldwide, commercial establishments in the business of supplying books to libraries. ''But bear in mind there are many learned societies, small publishing outfits, even individuals, that can't afford to do business with a vendor,'' Seweryn says. ''All sorts of groups whose titles never appear in general catalogues or bibliographies. So consequently you've got to make that kind of additional effort to find the material and get it into the library.''
Seweryn says her annual budget - currently about $8 million - has not kept pace either with rising book prices or with the increase in material available internationally. Another serious strain on acquisitions, she says, is the number of new information products that ''the library will have to consider acquiring if it doesn't want to be left behind.'' These include computerized, or ''on-line'' information services, of course, but also things like compact disks and video disks, which not only squeeze the book budget, but also create an added preservation burden. ''Nobody knows how long a C.D. is going to last or what you may have to do to preserve it,'' Seweryn says. ''Besides which, you need special equipment to play these things, and the manufacturers are constantly changing the hardware. So even if you manage to hold on to a disk for 50 years, how do you play it back if the equipment that was built to play it is no longer around?''
Already, in the main reading room, the library has the Oxford English Dictionary on line, as well as the Readers Guide to Periodical Literature, the Congressional Information Service, the Wilson Line Index and Catnyp, its own catalogue of acquisitions since 1972. (All previous acquisitions are catalogued on paper, in 800 bound volumes.) And the library does perform complex data-base searches for users who pay for the service.
''But the possibility of on-line searching is almost endless,'' Seweryn says, and that raises several other issues that the library will have to deal with. The vaster the library's on-line data base becomes, the less the library resembles, well, a library. Is the so-called library without walls a possibility, whole on-line collections made available to subscribers? Should encyclopedias be on line? Textbooks? Novels? Is there a distinction to be made between information gathering and reading?
Jennifer Herring, the development vice president, sees burgeoning technology as no less than a challenge to the library's fundamental mission: ''Can we afford to go heavily into on-line services and thus create an elite, privileged-information class among our users?'' she asks, rhetorically. ''We could spend every penny we have on technology, but then we'd be abandoning the book.
''Of course, as we agonize over these things, we're doing them.''
There is probably no better symbol of the New York Public Library's future than the Bryant Park stacks expansion, scheduled to open next spring, a grandiose, forward-looking, state-of-the art construction that will add as many complicated burdens to the library as it will relieve. Encompassing 118,000 square feet in two underground levels - only the first will be put to use right away; the subbasement will be shut until more space is needed, probably five years down the road - the expansion will double the capacity of the main research facility. To fill book requests from library users in a reasonable amount of time, orders will have to be faxed from upstairs.
Standing in the lower level, a vast, dank concrete chamber that right now resembles a parking garage more than a book repository, Paul Fasana, director of the research libraries, is rather gleefully contemplating the generous emptiness. ''We've been out of space in this building for 25 or 30 years,'' he says, his voice echoing slightly. But he also acknowledges how difficult and costly it will be to move in; estimates for the first round of moving expenses this fall have been as high as $700,000. And he's looking ahead as well to a mammoth reshuffling of library resources as collections are relocated and consolidated.
Fasana plans to use the new space to house the library's manuscript collection, currently in an annex on 10th Avenue; the original negatives for materials that have been microfilmed, and the older, less-requested books on the humanities and social sciences. Indeed, it is the long-range plan to turn the central facility into a gigantic storehouse of materials in those areas. ''When the Science and Business Library opens,'' Fasana says, ''we'll move the science and economics divisions there, which will free up more space in this building. We expect all this to allow growth space for up to 20 years.''
In fact, the Science and Business Library looms as an inevitability to library officials, though a location has yet to be chosen and financing is uncertain. The city has committed $10 million, and Healy plans to ask the state for a similar appropriation. There's talk of selling the annex, for which another $20 million might be realized. The rest - as much as $35 million - will have to be raised from private sources. ''I'd love to find some guy who's dreaming of having his name in relief over the door and raise it in one shot,'' Healy says. ''But I've never had that kind of luck. So we'll sell it off room by room. You know, 'Would you like the great reading room?' And if you're a real cheapskate, 'Would you like the men's room on the third floor?' ''
Perhaps the vastness of the library enterprise is best revealed by Healy's cheerful cynicism about his role as fund-raiser. As he speaks about finding money, donor by donor, project by project, he describes a Sisyphean chore, to which he brings a certain caginess. ''When this guy from Mitsubishi Estate, Takagi I think his name is, bought Rockefeller Center, we wrote him a letter and said 'Welcome.' I didn't think he'd get too many of those.''
The sums themselves are staggering; Healy estimates he has ''about $50 million in asks out'' for both general financing and specific uses. He mentions conservation, an ongoing expense, and the need to raise compensation for librarians whose annual salaries, after 20 years service, currently top out at less than $40,000. ''And we have to find a way to fund the branches that doesn't have a built-in conflict,'' he says, referring to the city's propensity to withdraw support when private financing is located. To that end, Healy has initiated, among other things, the ''adopt a branch'' program, which seeks individual New Yorkers to help refurbish individual branches by matching city grants of $500,000 to $1 million.
All of this is in advance of the next campaign, much of which will be devoted to augmenting the endowment. ''We've got to strengthen the base of this place,'' Healy says. ''It's $180 million now. If it were $300 million, we'd be talking about the library never running a deficit, but we'd still be basically immobile. If it were $500, there'd always be $10 million a year that you could use for expansion, renovation etc.'' He sighs. ''I'd love to make 300.''
Sitting at his desk in the enormous paneled office that overlooks Fifth Avenue, Healy finishes his recitation with a shrug and a smile. His Irish eyes crinkle into a tired squint, the expression of a man both proud of and daunted by his responsibility. He exhales cigarette smoke and considers a final query. What makes running the library different from running another institution of equivalent size and complexity? From his vantage, what makes the library singular?
''Well,'' he says with a laugh. ''Nobody hates us.''

The Scam Goes On

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques; Diana B. Henriques covers Wall Street for The Times.

 BODY:
DR. ENRICO S. MANGO, A LONG ISLAND ORTHOPEDIC surgeon, was growing suspicious of his stockbrokers at Wellshire Securities, a low-budget brokerage house based in New York City. During the spring of 1989, he had bought penny stocks - shares of companies too small to be listed on a stock exchange - recommended by a Wellshire broker and lost money on them. But that July, Dr. Mango bought again: 20,000 shares of Ventura, a fledgling leasing company based in Needham, Mass., at $2.50 a share.
After weeks of abbreviated phone calls, undelivered confirmation orders, vague answers and unfulfilled promises, Dr. Mango began to record his conversations with Wellshire brokers, including Edward D. Braverman. On Aug. 11, the surgeon taped the following exchange:
MANGO: So where do we stand then?
BRAVERMAN: Your 20,000 Ventura is trading at 3, and the stock is poised for its significant move. 
MANGO: Before . . . it was going on 3 1/4, and about a week ago I thought it was 3 1/2. Wasn't it up a bit before that?
BRAVERMAN: Yeah, it's been trading around, you know. [The broker explains that a lot of people had dumped the stock but Wellshire itself is still buying.] MANGO: When do you think that something is going to happen with it?
BRAVERMAN: I think we're going to get a move now. Right now, in fact, it's being listed on the Vancouver this evening. [Braverman mollifies Mango with the promise that the stock price will now be publicly reported.] From Monday on, you can look at the newspaper. . . .
But information about Ventura and its stock price would not make the newspapers until much later, not until the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Wellshire in March of this year. Ventura, it turned out, had not even applied for a listing on the Vancouver Stock Exchange. And its stock had in fact been quoted by another broker at a price as low as 25 cents a share in 1989 - if a buyer could be found. According to trading records assembled by the S.E.C., Wellshire constituted virtually the only market for Ventura shares and often failed to execute its customers' sell orders.
During its brief, wild run on Wall Street, Wellshire Securities had promoted stock in Environmental Landfills, a tiny company it portrayed as poised to cash in on the New York-area garbage crisis. It also touted an assortment of other penny stocks such as Greenleaf Capital, Nightwing Group, Diversified Foods and Treats Enterprises. But Wellshire's ride was cut short by regulators acting on evidence from Dr. Mango and other investors. The penny stock brokerage went out of business this spring after its license was revoked by the National Association of Securities Dealers, the industry's self-regulatory agency. Attorneys for Wellshire argued that the company should not have been held responsible for the actions of a few rogue brokers. Braverman could not be reached for comment on this article.
There are some legitimate penny stocks, and some professional money managers do trade profitably, if care-fully, in this market. But after a decade of abuses by the con artists who have permeated the business, the S.E.C. stepped in. The commission has taken direct aim at boiler rooms - those hives where high-pressure brokers wield telephones to tout speculative, sometimes fraudulent, unlisted shares to people who lack both the knowledge and the wealth required to dabble in such risky waters. Since the crackdown began in the third quarter of 1988, the S.E.C. calculates that, through July of this year, the number of companies selling penny stocks had declined from 348 to 285. The House of Representatives has already approved a bipartisan bill that would give the S.E.C. even greater power in regulating penny-stock brokers, and the proposal's backers hope to win the approval of the Senate in a conference committee session this month.
Meanwhile, warns Martin Kuperberg, associate regional administrator in the commission's New York office, the agency is broadening its enforcement efforts, which so far have been aimed chiefly at the owners and top executives of boiler rooms. ''You are going to start to see that these salesmen are not going to escape commission scrutiny,'' Kuperberg says. ''They have to know, when they are making $500 on a $1,200 trade, that something is out of whack. They are going to be held responsible.''
The state regulators are cracking down as well. Colorado, which had liberalized its securities laws in the early 80's - and found itself invaded by penny-stock brokers - recently tightened its regulations. ''Fraudulent telemarketing through penny-stock boiler rooms is a multibillion-dollar business,'' says Philip A. Feigin, Colorado's top securities regulator. The entire market cannot be eliminated, he believes, because of Washington's marked preference for deregulation. ''So,'' he says, ''you can just try to keep out the bad guys.'' It isn't easy. For all the hue and cry, many boiler-room denizens have remained nonchalant about the crackdown. Says one penny-stock promoter in the Los Angeles area, ''It's a speed bump. It slows you down a little, that's all.''
In theory, the penny-stock market is a sort of capitalistic incubator, a marketplace in which investors can help finance businesses that are too small, too speculative or too new to attract either venture capitalists or major Wall Street underwriters. There are approximately 15,000 public companies whose shares trade in this market. Some of them are legitimate, offering viable products or marketable services.
Of the 435 stocks that joined the NASDAQ over the past year, an estimated 46 percent were former penny stocks, says Enno Hobbing, a spokesman for the National Association of Securities Dealers in Washington. As examples of such graduates, Hobbing cites Datronic Rental, a computer-leasing company in Palatine, Ill.; Mid-Atlantic Medical Services in Rockville, Md., and North Coast Energy, a Bedford Heights, Ohio-based oil company.
Penny-stock brokers who are considered legitimate - such brokerage houses as Carr Securities or Herzog, Heine, Geduld in New York - deal with professional money-managers and knowledgeable, well-heeled customers for whom speculative investments may be suitable. These firms insist they would never attempt to push their wares on the uninitiated - and some of their top executives express profound contempt for those brokers who do. ''You know what the S.E.C. should do when it catches these guys?'' asks Walter Carucci, the president of Carr Securities. ''It should cut their hands off so they can't use the telephone anymore.''
THE TARGETS OF HIS anger, the houses that make cold calls to the sometimes gullible public, are a multifarious lot. At the dark edge of the spectrum are firms whose officers have been charged with criminal fraud. Best known of these is Blinder, Robinson & Company, the Englewood, Colo., firm that reigned as the largest penny-stock brokerage house in the country before the legal problems of its founder, Meyer Blinder, pushed it into bankruptcy this summer. Blinder denies the allegations against him and is awaiting trial.
Another well-known firm, the Stuart-James Company, in Denver, has frequently been disciplined in civil actions by regulators. Earlier this year, Stuart-James and three top executives paid a fine of more than $2 million to the N.A.S.D. to settle a disciplinary action charging improper sales tactics. The firm subsequently agreed that it would pull out of penny stocks and focus in the future on exchange-listed stocks.
Most penny-stock dealers, however, are obscure firms that open their doors, ply their trade for a year or so and then disband - only to reassemble elsewhere under a new name. Life in such firms is anything but glamorous, to judge from the sworn accounts of disillusioned brokers questioned by the S.E.C. regional office in New York.
Wellshire's New York operation, in a shabby downtown office building, consisted of a room packed with desks, telephones and about twenty brokers. There were two stock-quote machines, only one of which seemed to work. The closet was filled with telephone directories, gathered from around the country to facilitate the pursuit of customers. Price quotes for whatever stocks the company was pushing were scribbled on a blackboard. And filling the air was the tattoo of cold calls, delivered earnestly and insistently to anybody who would stay on the line.
Charles J. Marino, a former Wellshire broker who quit in disgust, said that a variety of cold-call scripts was available, but that the basic sequence of calls rarely changed: The first was introductory, the second was to determine how much money the prospect had and the third was the clincher, the insistent pitching of boiler-room products.
S.E.C. lawyers interviewing Brian Smith, another Wellshire broker, were curious: Where did he get the names and telephone numbers?
''Through Yellow Pages,'' Smith answered. ''I like calling up doctors or funeral directors. I also have Colgate alumni phone numbers.''
Others at Wellshire favored the owners of mom-and-pop stores or building contractors. Some sold penny stocks to their college classmates and former girlfriends.
One Wellshire broker testified that he made 200 to 300 cold calls a day. All the broker needed was a few investors willing to part with a few thousand dollars each. Brokers were entitled to pocket up to half the difference between the bid and asked price for Wellshire's favorite stocks.
What helps make penny-stock scam artists so difficult to police is that they mimic the mainstream world of Wall Street. They deal in stocks and bonds, options and warrants. They use the same glib jargon about ''hot growth'' and ''undervalued assets.'' They distribute impressive, plausible-sounding research reports and investment newsletters, just like the blue-chip firms.
So how can an investor distinguish between a fraudulent boiler-room pick like Goldcor, a now-defunct company that purported to extract gold from Costa Rican beach sand, and a struggling but legitimate company like, say, the Design Institute of America, an Ohio furniture manufacturer that last year moved to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange from the ''pink sheets,'' the paper price lists that circulate each day to penny-stock brokers. A company's prospectus may be gobbledygook to unsophisticated investors. And, since the S.E.C. requires the filing of the prospectus but does not verify the claims, there is no telling how much of the prospectus is fact, and how much is fraud. Moreover, eager boiler-room touts will encourage potential investors to get into a stock without waiting for a prospectus.
Profits are made, according to prosecutors, when the promoters and a few favored investors acquire a vast amount of nearly worthless shares, mark them up manyfold, and then sell them to the last link in the chain, the unwitting boiler-room customers. When those customers try to sell, they may find that their boiler-room brokerage house quotes them a much lower price, or fails to answer its phones, and that no other brokerage house will make a bid on the shares.
But investors keep buying because boiler-room operators have an uncanny ability to market the latest investment fads. In the high-inflation days of the late 70's, it was gold mines that were always about to hit pay dirt. These days, bioengineering, superconductivity, AIDS research and pollution are the buzzwords, with a recent boom in tiny oil stocks tied to the Iraqi conflict.
Joseph I. Goldstein, associate director of enforcement at the S.E.C., says that criminal promoters often create specious companies from whole cloth. ''But these schemes can't work,'' Goldstein says, ''if you can't find retail customers to buy these stocks.''
That's why the S.E.C. has made the ''cold-call rule'' the centerpiece of its recent crackdown. The provision, imposed in January of this year, applies to the sale of stocks that are not listed on an exchange, that have less than $2 million in assets and that trade for less than $5 a share. It requires penny-stock brokers to have customers fill out a document showing their income and investment objectives before any sales can be concluded. A customer's initial telephone transactions - the first three trades, so long as each involves a different stock - are not binding until they are confirmed by the customer in writing. The aim, says Goldstein, was to give investors time to change their minds about stocks they might have been pressured into buying.
The bill that has passed the House and is awaiting action by Senate conferees would also empower the S.E.C., for the first time, to discipline the promoters and consultants, often defrocked brokers, who align themselves informally with brokerages or with individual companies.
Consider Ramon D'Onofrio of Los Angeles. Since 1971, D'Onofrio has pleaded guilty to criminal securities violations and bankruptcy fraud, served a short stint in prison and been disciplined by the S.E.C. on several occasions. These days, D'Onofrio and his son, Mark, run United Atlantic Investments, a consulting firm whose clients include current and former pink-sheet companies such as Kinesis, PSN Communications and Exten Ventures. D'Onofrio failed to return calls seeking his comment.
The proposed bill would also focus on the investment vehicles known as blind pools, which invite the public to buy shares even though no specific business plan exists, other than to shop for acquisitions. In effect, the companies the pools acquire ''go public'' without having to make a formal filing with the S.E.C. The proposed bill places limitations on the use of any money the blind pools raise, until they tell shareholders exactly how the money would be used - and investors could then pull their money back.
The N.A.S.D., meanwhile, has introduced a new electronic penny-stock bulletin board that it hopes will be an improvement on the antediluvian pink sheets, which were once the only source of information on price.
PENNY-STOCK TRICKSTERS continue to give regulators a run for their money. As soon as the cold-call rules went into effect, issuers and brokers found ways to circumvent them, including reverse splits to lift the share price above the $5 threshold and mergers that would produce the required $2 million in assets.
The S.E.C. regulation on cold calls applied only to stocks that were not listed on an exchange. Voila, penny stock promoters flocked to the nation's regional stock exchanges, including those in Boston and Philadelphia.
Some exchanges proved only too willing to waive their none-too-strenuous standards. The tiny exchange in Spokane, Wash., actually boasts of having the lowest listing standards in the country; it requires only that a company have 250,000 public shares and 300 shareholders. (By contrast, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange has recently applied to the S.E.C. to raise its standards to accept only companies that have had at least $100,000 net income in three of the last four years or shareholders' equity of at least $500,000.) The Spokane Stock Exchange has been so welcoming to penny-stock companies that the S.E.C. has refused to exempt Spokane-listed stocks from its new rules. Other exchanges have been warned by the commission that any waivers will be closely monitored.
Regulators say they have heard of brokers who sell new customers odd lots of three blue-chip stocks in an attempt to satisfy the ''three-trade'' feature of the cold-call rule, and to establish the customer as a ''seasoned'' investor. ''Then they start pushing the junk,'' one Federal official says.
And by selling abroad, boiler rooms can usually find customers beyond the reach of Federal regulators. Several recently shut-down boiler rooms, including Wellshire, had set up European offices where American stocks were sold to foreign investors.
Such tactics have drawn the attention of overseas regulators. A few years ago, says Lawrence Iason, regional S.E.C. administrator in New York, the most common inquiry the S.E.C. got from foreign securities regulators involved insider trading. Now more than half the inquiries concern penny-stock fraud. Prosecutors and regulators acknowledge the difficulties of policing the international penny-stock market at a time when the concepts of market deregulation and globalization are all the rage.
According to Scott E. Stapf, a spokesman for the North American Securities Administrators Association, a watchdog group in Washington, the next step in the penny-stock shuffle is likely to be the touting of dubious overseas stocks to investors back in North America. ''The hopscotch used to be from Florida to Phoenix to Southern California,'' Stapf says. ''Now they are going offshore and calling home.'' Low international telephone rates make the offshore touting of penny stocks and other speculative investments viable. According to Stapf, expatriate penny-stock brokers are particularly attracted to countries such as Panama that have strict bank-secrecy laws. In addition, the S.E.C. and Interpol found that Costa Rica had become a haven for expatriate Canadian stock promoters, including Leonard C. Zrnic, who styled himself ''Count Saladash of Hungary.''
Wellshire Securities itself illustrates how intractable the boiler-room problem can be. Soon after Wellshire shut its doors, some members of its staff started a new branch of Salt Lake City-based L. M. Drew, formerly West Coast Securities, in a brownstone in the heart of Manhattan.
How should a prudent investor react when a badgering broker from an unfamiliar firm calls, someone touting a hot biotechnology stock or a handful of complicated Class C warrants for some new energy-exploration outfit? Probably the best advice comes from Goldstein of the S.E.C. task force. ''The investor who is best protected,'' he says, ''is the one who just hangs up.''

BUDAPEST
There are no gypsy violinists at the Forum Grill. In fact, there is not a hint of Hungarian folklore in this simple hotel restaurant. Perhaps that's one reason it is the choice of the high-powered businessmen who come to town to do deals.
The preferred times are breakfast and lunch. Unadorned wood tables, tucked behind potted plants, fill up with the likes of Peter Zwack, the Hungarian brandy-and-cordials distiller recently named Ambassador to Washington, and other high-ranking government officials.
Two years ago, the Grill - located on the ground floor of the Forum Hotel, on the Pest side of the Danube - added chicken seasoned in yogurt to its menu of sauce-laden Hungarian specialties. Fish is grilled, veal is roasted, vegetables are fresh - all of which can make a meal here positively light, an achievement regarded by residents and frequent visitors to Budapest as a scientific breakthrough.
Gabor Hidas, one of four maitres d'hotel who work in the Grill, sighs as he describes the appeal of the restaurant's non-Hungarian cuisine. ''We have to admit,'' he says mournfully, ''this French-style food is more popular.'' The varied and plentiful salad bar at the Grill is more successful with foreigners, waiters say, than with their Hungarian guests. The chef, Laszlo Gyorgy, continues to produce local dishes - chicken paprikash, goulash and stuffed cabbage among them.
Quick service, a Western notion that has been slow to catch on in many local restaurants, is a staple here. And the Grill is located only a few steps from the lobby of the hotel, which attracts foreign visitors such as Ronald S. Lauder, the billionaire heir to the cosmetics fortune and former Ambassador to Austria, who is a partner in an investment group in Eastern Europe. The hotel's concierge offers advice in English and, nearby, international businessmen spend hours huddled around coffee tables, spreading out prospectuses, tapping out future prospects for ''jay-vees'' (joint ventures) on their calculators.
Lunch for two at the Grill, with wine or beer, is about $30, tip not included. Dessert is best taken upstairs at the Forum's prize-winning Viennese Cafe, which serves lavish Viennese and Hungarian pastries and sweets, including a local chocolate-and-cream treat called somloi galuska.

TOKYO
Just about everything seems reversed when doing business in Japan, and lunch is no exception.
In New York, the essence of the power lunch is visibility: a window seat at the Four Seasons or a corner table at a private club. In Japan, the essence of the power lunch - like the essence of Japanese power itself - is invisibility. At Tokyo's most exclusive Japanese restaurants, any discussion taking place somewhere other than a private tatami room probably is not worth overhearing.
Not that you would hear much out of school. Like the companies themselves, Japanese restaurants tend to be informal extensions of ''business groups.'' Nissan's executives have a small circle of favorite restaurants into which Toyota executives would rarely wander. Politicians have their own hangouts, many of them exclusive ryotei, restaurants so discreet - particularly about who is eating with whom - that only those already known to the management can make a reservation. The result is that, if you are doing business with the Japanese, it is probably best to let the natives pick the restaurant.
But if you find yourself the host, a good place to show your refined taste in Nihon ryoori, as the Japanese call their own cooking, might be the Kamogawa restaurant. It is the favorite of an eclectic if well-moneyed crowd, from the executives of the giant Mitsui & Company trading house and of Japan's biggest domestic airline, All Nippon Airways, to the diplomats who guide Japan's increasingly assertive foreign policy from the nearby Foreign Ministry. ''Unless you run into someone at the front door,'' a diplomat said recently, as we watched a waitress slide open a shoji screen, ''you'll never really know who is here. But the walls are so thin, you might make out their laughter.''
From the outside, Kamogawa is thoroughly modern; it is located on the ground floor of the New Kasumigaseki Building, one of Tokyo's biggest office towers. But inside, it has the feel of ancient Edo: aged stone lanterns, green bamboo fences and stone pathways that glisten as though it has just rained.
All the seating is in private, minimalist tatami rooms, where the food is served by women in traditional kimonos. It might be a struggle to get your legs under the low tables, but most of Kamogawa's rooms mercifully have a pit cut into the tatami, increasing the probability that you will actually be able to walk after the meal is over.
Lunch comes in set menus, changed every week - usually a mix of vegetables and soups, perhaps some fish or shrimp tempura, and small dishes of sashimi. Like most traditional Japanese food, it is meant to be as much a feast for the eyes as for the stomach.
Kamogawa is within the bounds of a moderate expense account. The least pricey lunches, served in traditional bento boxes, run from about $30 a person; the multicourse meals start at $40 and run up to about $55 for a meal including a boiled sea bream head. Beer is usually the beverage of choice at lunch, sake not being conducive to a hard afternoon's work. And in keeping with Japanese custom, there is no tipping.
Lunch itself is rarely a time to conduct business: a tatami mat is no place to spread papers. Rather than a time to negotiate, the meal is viewed as an opportunity to build relationships.
On the way out, your guest will say ''gochisoo-sama deshita,'' which roughly translates to ''what a feast.'' There is no need to be flattered. Japanese tradition requires the comment, whether it is truthful or not.

NEW YORK
With cavernous, airline-terminal dimensions and sleek, masculine design, the Four Seasons has reigned for three decades as New York's premier power-lunch spot. It has done so by catering to the executive appetite for predictability and the chance to nod at other executives. In a 25,000-foot space, the architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (who designed the Seagram Building, in which the restaurant resides) and Philip Johnson (who designed the interior) created a public place that regulars have come to regard as their own private club. ''You know everybody,'' says Kenneth Lipper, an investment banker and a former New York Deputy Mayor. ''They're familiar faces.''
The faces on this day include real estate mogul Lewis Rudin; Vittorio C. Vellano, president of Fiat U.S.A.; Herbert J. Siegel, the head of Chris-Craft Industries. Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Primerica; S. I. New-house Jr., head of the Conde Nast publishing empire; Laurence A. Tisch, president of CBS, and Philip Johnson feast here almost daily.
Patrons dine on a seasonally changing menu that is sometimes tailored to the particular palate. Henry A. Kissinger, for instance, eats only low-calorie foods, without salt or butter, while Bill Blass has been known to order a hamburger. Executives usually favor the entrees, which, depending on the time of year, might include Maryland crab cakes, chicken pot pie or a skewer of shrimp and sausage. The Four Seasons's dark-paneled Grill Room gets the power lunch crowd (a typical meal, with wine, will cost about $60 per person), while the more elegant Pool Room is especially favored by business executives at night.
''Most have been coming here so long, I don't even have to tell them which table,'' says Julian Niccolini, the manager. Every morning, Niccolini scans newspapers to stay abreast of his clients and to watch for up-and-comers. How has the Four Seasons attracted some 6,000 house accounts? ''It's the ultrapersonalized service,'' Niccolini explains. ''I go up to clients, introduce myself and try to make friends. It's as simple as that.''

LONDON
BUSINESS BREAKFASTS, QUIP THE have no place in any truly civilized society. But the English do consent to the business lunch. The place where the high and mighty flock is the Savoy Grill in the elegant 101-year-old Savoy Hotel in the Strand, a 5- to 15-minute ride from Westminster, Fleet Street and the City, London's financial district. 
Everybody who is anybody - cabinet ministers, peers, business executives and the literati - can be found at the 33 tables in the Grill room. These include Denis Thatcher, the Prime Minister's husband; Nigel Lawson, her departed Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Norman Tebbit, former chairman of the Conservative Party. Diana Rigg, David Frost and Jeffrey Archer are some of the entertainers and scribes who have their own tables. You might also see financiers such as Sir James Goldsmith and Lord Rothschild plotting another multibillion-dollar takeover; media magnates Robert Maxwell, Rupert Murdoch and Lord Rothermere; advertising man Martin S. Sorrell, chairman of the WPP Group, and Lord King, the chairman of British Airways.
Angelo Maresca, the longtime Grill manager, will greet and seat you. The most desirable tables are next to the windows overlooking the courtyard, and those near the wall diagonally opposite the entrance. Those tables are the preserve of regulars, but if one has not been claimed, an ordinary mortal may get it. While no special dispensations are required for a nonregular to secure a reservation, a phone call at least three days in advance is advised.
The attraction of the Savoy Grill is undoubtedly that it is a place to be seen, not its decor. The tables are far apart, which affords privacy, and the yew-wood paneling, brass fixtures and green-velvet upholstery are pleasant enough. But as the Sunday Times of London put it: The Grill ''could be the first-class dining room in an ocean liner.'' Its one extraordinary item is a silver duck press that its first chef, Auguste Escoffier, used. (To order pressed wild duck, call one week in advance.) The staff is friendly and efficient, and will be pleased to point out where Sir Winston Churchill and Noel Coward presided.
Offerings are well-prepared, although a stale roll has been known to rear its head. There is a traditional English dish on the menu each day - a mixed grill or steak and kidney pie or roast beef with Yorkshire pudding - and such gourmet appetisers as pan-fried Burgundy snails with morels in an herb butter sauce.
There are also a variety of fish dishes for the health conscious, among them the cold-poached salmon and a fillet of halibut. Along the same lines, but more of a trangression: the smoked Scotch salmon with herb marinated prawns in ginger butter and the pan-fried chicken with wild mushrooms, pine kernels and bacon.
If something is not on the menu, you need but ask. Following a long tradition, David Sharland, the maitre chef de cuisine, prides himself on meeting special requests.
The price for a lunch with appetizer, main course, one of those artery-clogging English desserts dripping with cream, a medium-priced bottle of wine and coffee will run 50 to 60 a person, about
K, excluding tip.

HEADLINE: CONSULTING;
Assignment: 90 Days on the Polish Front

BYLINE: By Joseph W. Karoly; Joseph W. Karoly is a retired RCA Corporation executive who resides in Bryn Mawr, Pa.

 BODY:
THERE I SAT ON THE morning of Jan. 5 in a Polonez sedan headed south from Warsaw. At the age of 63, retired from RCA, I had offered my services as a volunteer consultant to businesses in foreign countries. Now I found myself about to meet with the management of my first client, Polkolor, a company I was expected to help restructure over the next three months.
My briefcase contained a Polish-English dictionary and a handful of papers that Polkolor had sent me. But I had given up trying to make any sense of the papers, including some basic cost data and an organizational chart. The data were sparse. The chart, on the other hand, was huge - 26 pages - and it showed that the company employed 5,200 workers who were supervised by 400 managers, each with his or her own decision-making authority. So there I was, unable to speak the language, unfamiliar with the operations of the company, on my way to bring order to an organization that I suspected, even then, was in a state of considerable disarray.
The adventure had started with a phone call in August of last year from Peter W. Moyer, an executive recruiter at the International Executive Service Corps in Stamford, Conn. ''We are negotiating with a color television picture-tube manufacturer in Poland whose needs match up with your background,'' he said. ''Are you interested in hearing more?'' 
Shortly before retiring in 1987 as president of an RCA subsidiary in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I had sent my resume to I.E.S.C., a nonprofit organization that sends retired American executives to provide expertise to companies in developing nations as well as Central and Eastern Europe. My career at RCA - which I had joined in 1950, straight out of Seton Hall University - had included various financial and operating positions both at home and abroad.
Since leaving RCA, I had spent most of my days improving my golf handicap. But the offer from I.E.S.C. - in effect, to be part of the economic revolution sweeping Eastern Europe - was a challenge I could not resist. My wife, Ruth, was also part of the package. Her project was to put together a manual about Poland to help familiarize future I.E.S.C. volunteers and their spouses with the culture. (The fact that Ruth happens to be of Polish descent made her enthusiastic, but was of little practical value; she did not know a word of the language.) The Polkolor facility, 12 miles from Warsaw on the outskirts of the town of Piaseczno, is a sprawling complex of more than 1.3 million square feet, consisting of two plants - a glass factory and a tube-assembly factory. Polkolor is a fully integrated operation: sand for glass goes in one end, and a finished tube comes out the other.
About 75 percent of the tubes are sold within the Eastern bloc. The remainder are marketed in the West, principally to West Germany, and must therefore meet stricter standards of quality. Since the currencies of most Eastern European countries have not been convertible until recently, Western equipment has been unavailable, and Polkolor and other Eastern bloc countries have had a virtual monopoly. Polkolor has thus been selling everything it produced - a situation that has led to an emphasis on quantity rather than quality for its Eastern customers.
Those problems, and a host of others, were very much on the mind of Polkolor's general director, Jerzy Piotrowski, a bearded, bespectacled, thickset man of 44 years, who was waiting for me in his office that morning. Piotrowski introduced me to the other key people with whom I would be working: Andrzej Szweryn, the slim, energetic manager of the company's foreign-trade office, who was refreshingly outspoken about the problems facing Polkolor; Tadeusz Han, a boyish-looking fellow who had recently been appointed chief engineer, and Ermina Buballo, an affable woman who was the manager of the financial planning and analysis group. Although everyone in this meeting was more or less fluent in English, Buballo was one of the few people in the 135-person financial department - where I would be spending so much of my time - who spoke the language.
For the next hour, Piotrowski and the others talked, and I took notes. I was pleasantly surprised at their clear articulation of the issues. Only later did I learn that Piotrowski, Han and Buballo are enrolled in the equivalent of an M.B.A. program at Warsaw University; their exposure has made them aware that there is a better way to do business, and that they do not have the know-how to go it alone.
POLKOLOR HAD STARTED life in the fall of 1975, when RCA and Corning Glass Works signed turnkey agreements with the Polish Government to develop the capability to produce picture tubes for color televisions. Ground was then broken for the glass factory and the tube-assembly plant, and soon after production started in July of 1979, Polkolor was turned over to the state to run. Now, as Poland begins the transition to a free-market economy, the company will have to undergo radical changes to operate in this new environment.
During my meeting at Polkolor that January morning, we agreed I would work on two projects: restructuring the organization, which had grown like a weed because of the full-employment philosophy of the Communist regime, and recommending ways to improve productivity. I soon gathered, however, that Piotrowski, Han and Buballo also wanted me to design a cost-accounting system to measure costs at each stage of the manufacturing process. Up went my anxiety level - I had not been involved with cost accounting since the 1950's. But I took on the task.
Over the next three months, I worked on all the assignments concurrently. Polkolor provided me with a car and driver, and they appeared each morning at my home away from home, the Forum Hotel, a 31-story concrete building faced with gold tile in downtown Warsaw. The company also paid my expenses, including food and laundry as well as lodging, and gave me a spacious office near the general director's with a complicated phone I could never understand, let alone work.
POLKOLOR WAS A COMPANY grappling with change on many fronts. Until 1989, the manufacturer had one production line, with the capacity to turn out some 550,000 22-inch picture tubes annually. Last year, a second line was added to make 14-inch and 20-inch tubes, increasing output to more than 650,000. Meanwhile, inflation in Poland was soaring - since the start of 1989, raw materials costs had risen about 600 percent - and Polkolor had no system in place to identify and measure the impact of such spiraling costs.
That became only too clear during my first week, when I started reviewing Polkolor's financial system. The company had a reasonably accurate method of accounting for the total costs of all its tubes. But without a cost-accounting system, there was no way to determine the unit cost of one tube size, let alone three sizes. Thus Piotrowski and his managers were unable to calculate - and, ultimately, control - their costs at each stage of the production process.
Digging down into my memory, I was able to dredge up the details of the cost-accounting system I had used at RCA. During the next few months, I set up a comparable system and wrote a rough draft of a 14-page operating manual, with a great deal of assistance from Ruth, who was pressed into service to edit and type the document. The final version, translated into Polish by Ermina Buballo, included instructions for establishing a standard cost and for moving materials from one cost center to another. I also taught Buballo, and she in turn trained the financial and operating managers, how to work with the system. It is scheduled to be in place by the end of this month.
Inevitably, I had my share offrustrations. Working with Buballo, for instance, proved difficult at first, partly because her basic discipline was engineering and her knowledge of accounting quite limited. But she was also a habitual truant. I soon found that Buballo was not the only one. Appointments were not always kept, and there was a casual attitude toward deadlines.
I kept my cool with Buballo until early February, and then we had a confrontation. ''I'm really here to help you,'' I said. ''If you want to take advantage of that, you'll have to be more cooperative.'' Immediately, the situation improved. In her defense, and that of the other employees at Polkolor, the lack of dedication may have been a result of the Communist system, which guaranteed every citizen a job without regard to performance. In addition, the information gap about management and financial systems turned out to be much wider than I had imagined. The concepts I was trying to introduce were undoubtedly difficult for the Poles to comprehend, particularly when some of the words and ideas had no Polish equivalents. When I said I wanted to review cash flow, for example, a woman from the treasurer's department came to me and said, ''We don't pay in cash a lot. We mainly use checks.''
It took an inordinately long time to get answers to questions, particularly about accounting. With Buballo as translator, I would ask the person responsible for materials accounting, ''How do you keep track of the withdrawal of raw materials to each cost center?'' Frequently, the response would be, ''I don't have an answer, but I'll get back to you.'' When the answer finally came, an hour or so later, it would usually trigger another question, and the whole process would be repeated. On a good day, two questions might be answered to everyone's satisfaction.
In order to set up a restructuring plan, I had to identify where staff reductions could be made without affecting ongoing operations. This was no small task: Poland had achieved its full-employment goals by creating jobs, and 20 to 30 percent overstaffing was a fact of industrial life. Over several weeks, I saw every manager and reviewed his or her responsibilities. In early March, I offered Piotrowski some ideas for trimming staff.
WHEN I TURNED MY attention to assessing productivity, I became a frequent visitor to the factory, with its block-long furnaces for glass bonding and its miles of aging conveyor belts. Although the organization charts indicated that 30 foremen were assigned for each of four shifts, I could find no more than three on the floor at any one time. Where were the others? In their offices, I was told, calculating operators' wages - a task more appropriate for the accounting department.
I soon learned why there was so little incentive for foremen to supervise production. Operators were paid by the piece, generally earning $100 to $135 a month; foremen made only about $90.
Quality control was another problem. Since Polkolor was in the enviable position of selling everything it made - 1989 revenues were about $140 million - the company was under extreme pressure to crank out product. On one visit, I saw three unsupervised operators processing cracked glass panels. I told Piotrowski, and he responded by closing down all of the foremen's offices, thereby forcing them out onto the factory floor.
When I finished my manufacturing review, I made 10 specific recommendations, including the establishment of a preventive-maintenance program. At Polkolor, basic equipment was operated until it broke down; only then were repairs made. In addition, there was no centralized production planning, which led to frequent component shortages and wreaked havoc with monthly production schedules.
To address the issue of quality control, I suggested that foremen be paid more than operators and that operators, who would now be paid by the hour, participate in an incentive plan for achieving production quotas and quality standards. Such a plan has since been put into effect. The entire production team can now receive monthly bonuses ranging from 1 percent to 15 percent of their pay. Piotrowski reports that the tubes' quality has begun to improve across the board.
On paper, Polkolor was profitable, but reliable figures were sparse. The company issued only two financial reports. A monthly 14-line profit-and-loss statement was sent to Polkolor's bank as well as to the Government's Institute for Statistics. In addition, an annual balance sheet, audited by an accountant from the Treasury Department, was submitted to the bank.
Polkolor's managers needed more data to make effective day-to-day decisions, so I designed a series of internal forms to break out additional information: a profit-and-loss statement more fully identifying the major elements of cost; manufacturing cost-center reports highlighting the standard and actual costs of production and the company's variance against the standard, and tracking reports on expenses.
AT POLKOLOR, I FOUND AN active curiosity about the differences between the American and Polish systems, and a receptive climate for the changes I proposed. Yet, looking beyond this company, it seems to me that Poland has, at best, only a vague idea of what is required to shift gears. The Communist system had a cocoon effect, providing employment and subsidizing food and housing. Now the cocoon is gone: subsidies have been slashed and almost all food prices allowed to rise to market levels. In the process, unemployment has risen from almost zero to about 6 percent.
The pinch is about to be felt at Polkolor, too. In August I learned that Piotrowski, having weighed my suggestions for downsizing, is planning to dismiss some 500 employees, primarily engineers and middle managers - assuming he can get the necessary approval from the company's two unions, Solidarity and the Trade Union of Polkolor Employees.
At Polkolor, and throughout Poland, what traumas will be triggered by rising unemployment? How fast can overstaffing be addressed? And how long will it take before workers come to view their jobs not as their right, but as their responsibility? Poland wants to take a cold shower in capitalism, but the period of adjustment could last 10 years.
The country seems to be pinning much of its economic hopes on the recently enacted State Enterprise Privatization Act. Under the program, most state-run companies will be able to register to incorporate with the Ministry of Privatization. The Government will then become the corporation's sole shareholder and will sell its stock to Polish citizens. Given the undercapitalized state of Polish industry and the average worker's modest income, the plan could be in for some trouble.
The joint venture appears to be a better bet and may well become the major means to privatization. During my stay, Polkolor entered into discussions with a major Western European tube manufacturer, and I was asked to participate.
Right now, there are two main stumbling blocks to any joint venture in Poland. The first is the difficulty of assessing the economic benefits for a prospective partner because, at most Polish companies, financial data is scarce. The second is the existence of an Employees Council at every company. This elected body, whose 20 or so members represent all levels of the company, must approve the venture. (Employees Councils also have the authority to recommend dismissal of the chief executive.) Once a company goes private or is transformed into a joint venture, however, the legal requirement for an Employees Council disappears. Thus, slowly but surely, this vestige of the old regime is likely to vanish.
My assignment in Poland was more challenging and rewarding than I could have imagined. In some small way, I helped a company see the benefits of a free-enterprise system and provided some of the tools to enable it to participate. Polkolor has invited me to return later this year to review the company's progress. That may not happen, however, if the joint-venture discussions succeed, because Polkolor will then have full-time free-market expertise. And I will have to find another way to take part in the great adventure shaping up in Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: And Now, Can Bob Crandall Have It All?

BYLINE: By L.J. DAVIS; L. J. Davis, a frequent contributor to this magazine, writes on business from New York.

 BODY:
His lean, wiry body encased in camouflage fatigues, a bandanna around his forehead and a toy plastic rifle in hand, Robert L. Crandall burst onto the huge video screen. In his film debut at the 1987 meeting in Fort Worth, the American Airlines chief appeared as Crando, the terror of the competition, the unstoppable killing machine of the airline wars.
The Rambo guise eloquently reflected both Crandall's macho business style and his vaunting ambition: Not only would American become the dominant domestic air carrier, a position it actually attained the following year when it surpassed United Airlines in revenue passenger miles, but it was destined to become the world's premier airline. American was going global. These days, American executives are reluctant to discuss the tape, much less show it. Crando, the feeling seems to be, was going a little too far, even for somebody as notoriously hard-driving as their leader. ''My friends call me Mr. Crandall,'' he is fond of saying. ''My enemies call me Fang.'' 
In fact, in keeping with another piece of the Rambo personna, the chairman is widely perceived as the tough good guy in an industry fallen prey to financial sharpshooters. Last month, the most conspicuous of those sharpshooters, Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Continental Airlines Holdings, cashed out of his debt-ridden empire, leaving Crandall as the surviving giant of post-1978 airline deregulation. His creative leadership and relatively peaceful means of expansion, aided by a fair measure of luck, has made AMR Corporation the nation's strongest and richest airline holding company, and American the second-largest airline in the world after Aeroflot.
During the last decade of unfettered competition, the TK-billion dollar domestic industry been consolidated into nine major carriers. American, with earnings of $455 million on $10.5 billion revenues last year, holds 17 percent of the market. Now Crandall has committed $20.9 billion to a campaign of worldwide dimensions, as he mounts simultaneous invasions of the European, Pacific and Latin American markets. ''He's made a determination that his airline is going be the cost-effective worldwide carrier,'' says Karen Firestone, manager of the airline portfolio for Fidelity Insurance Group. ''Although it can't fly everywhere now, eventually it will.'' But starting early this year, it began to appear that not all events were breaking in American's favor, as they had done for so long. Just as American moved into the most costly phase of its expansion, the price of jet fuel started rising and passenger revenues began to slide, as Crandall puts it, ''into the tank.'' AMR posted a startling $19.3 million loss in the first quarter, its first loss in more than two years. In the first six months, the company earned $109.9 million, a 61 percent decline over the same period a year earlier. During the summer, American's contract negotiations with its pilots' union were marked by rising hostility. And in August, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait plunged oil markets, hence jet fuel-markets, into unpredictable confusion.
Moreover, the company may have made a pair of wrong bets on its aircraft orders, creating overcapacity on some of its domestic routes and a shortage of wide-bodied, long-range planes on some of the international routes it had boldly seized. Within the industry, there was considerable doubt about the siting of at least one of American's new domestic hubs and some reservations about Crandall's declared strategy of flying overseas from inland cities in the United States to inland destinations abroad.
Yet his ability to turn on a dime is legendary, as is his intense frugality. (He once saved American $40,000 a year by eliminating a single olive from the airline's salads.) Last month, both qualities were on prominent display when the airline announced cost-cutting measures designed to pare $100 million a year from operating expenses.
Ironically, for a man who made his mark with deregulation, Crandall was at the outset one of its most vocal foes. ''I had far too little faith in the marketplace,'' he says. ''I did not anticipate properly all of the things that would happen, including all the unpleasant and difficult things we were going to have to do to survive.''
The American Airlines that Crandall joined in April 1973 had long thrived under the system of benevolent government regulation legislated by Congress 35 years earlier to rescue an industry shattered by cutthroat competition. Treated like public utilities, interstate airlines were licensed by the Civil Aeronautics Board, which had authority over domestic routes and fares. Overseas operations were mainly determined through bilateral negotiations between the State Department and foreign governments.
Under the 30-year leadership of a taciturn, decisive Texan, C. R. (for Cyrus Rowlett) Smith, American had become an innovative and efficient transportation company. Smith was instrumental in the development of the Douglas DC-3, one of the most enduring and profitable commercial airplanes of all time, and he also shrewdly promoted American's image as the businessman's airline. ''It dawned on C. R. very early that your business traveler was your biggest customer because he was a repeat traveler,'' recalls Willis R. Player, a former public relations executive at American and Pan Am. But in a shortsighted moment, Smith, a former auditor who was concerned about straining his resources during the postwar economic slump, sold the company's small but promising trans-Atlantic subsidiary, American Overseas Airlines, to Pan Am in 1951. He thus effectively abandoned American's foothold in the international market shortly before it began to boom.
But Smith did not lack vision in another fast-growing sphere - technology. Finding himself seated next to an I.B.M. salesman on a flight in the spring of 1953, he turned the conversation to American's mounting problems with its reservation system. The salesman assured him that I.B.M. could devise a computerized solution, and Smith committed $40 million to develop the system. Called SABRE (for Semi-Automated Business Research Environment), it gave American an important edge for the better part of a decade.
After Smith retired in 1968 to become Secretary of Commerce in Lyndon Johnson's Administration, American began to drift toward disaster. Resources were diverted from the business market to the even more cyclical resort market; millions were spent on creating an irrational hotel chain; and, oversupplied with new Boeing 747's, the company found itself flying nearly empty jumbo jets during the recession of the early 70's.
''This,'' Bob Crandall recalls, ''was a troubled company, a very troubled company.''
Born in Westerly, R.I., in December 1935, Crandall had, by his own description, ''a highly mobile youth.'' The son of an insurance executive who died in his 50's from emphysema, Bob Crandall attended 14 schools in 12 years before graduating from high school in Barrington, R.I. The school yearbook declared him the most ambitious member of his class, and the most affectionate. He married his high school sweetheart, Margaret Jan Schmults, in 1957; today they have three children and two grandchildren.
After graduating from the University of Rhode Island that same year with a major in insurance and finance, Crandall did a hitch in the Army, took his M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in 1960 and held a series of jobs in finance at Eastman Kodak, Hallmark Cards and T.W.A. In 1972, after he was passed over for the post of chief financial officer at T.W.A., he left for a brief tour at Bloomingdale's, then joined American as senior vice president for finance.
Crandall was bright, but he was not universally popular, especially among the other young executives he began to pass on his way up. He would acquire a number of highly descriptive nicknames, ''Darth Vader'' being one of the more printable. Intensely focused and short-tempered, with thick, dark, pomaded hair in a cut straight out of the 1950's, he drives himself as hard as he drives others. Famous within American are his weekly Monday meetings with his top executives, usually convened at noon, at which he rigorously and often profanely examines the company's strategies and options.
Crandall is an extraordinarily quick study - a quality that led Casey to appoint him head of the marketing department, despite his lack of experience in that area. Back then, he had another asset that was to play a vital role in his success: he was one of the few top airline executives with a hands-on knowledge of computers and the uses to which they could be put. He had acquired this expertise as head of data processing at T.W.A., where he deployed a computerized reservation system with a new generation of machines that surpassed SABRE's original technology.
''In the mid-to-late 70'S, the airline business had changed radically,'' says Crandall. The advent of the jet aircraft in the 1950's had ushered in the era of mass travel. Forced to deal with much larger volumes of passengers than ever before, airlines became dependent on travel agents to facilitate their work. The travel agents, in turn, begged for automation. Crandall proposed the creation of a computer system that would be jointly owned by the airlines, but American's competitors rejected it.
Max D. Hopper, senior vice president, information systems, and his team redesigned SABRE so that it offered the travel agents features American's competitors lacked, including worldwide flight, hotel and rental car information and a built-in accounting system. As of this year, SABRE terminals can be found on the desks of 37 percent of the 24,000 automated travel agencies in the United States.
In the spring of 1977, with SABRE in place, American was the first major carrier to introduce heavily discounted tickets, called SuperSavers, to counter the bargain fares offered by such upstarts as Frank Lorenzo's Texas International. And four years later, again thanks to SABRE, American was able to introduce the industry's first frequent-flier program. This widely imitated innovation did much to solve airline marketers' persistent dilemma - how to instill brand loyalty. And, like the systems owned by a handful of competitors, SABRE was almost impossible to duplicate; rival airlines with no data bases of their own are compelled to rent time or buy into a major system.
In fact, there have been persistent allegations by consumer watchdog groups that the airlines are somehow using their data bases, and especially the computerized central registry kept by Airline Tariff Publishing, to signal fare changes to each other. A Justice Department inquiry has been launched. It is not Crandall's first brush with the Justice Department.
In 1982, Crandall, for two years American's president and chief operating officer, had a telephone conversation with Howard D. Putnam, chairman of Braniff International, whose dying Dallas-based airline was damaging American's business with radical fare cuts. ''Raise your goddamn fares 20 percent,'' said Crandall. ''I'll raise mine the next morning.'' Putnam secretly recorded the conversation. The Justice Department wanted to banish Crandall from the airline business for two years but settled for his promise never to repeat his indiscretion.
Seated in his spacious corner office, Crandall discusses the latest price-fixing allegations with the patient scorn of a man confronted with willful ignorance. ''No airline can ever afford to charge a different price than another airline,'' he says. ''In this business, we all sell one another's products. So we have to know what the other guy is charging, or we can't sell his product for him.'' In any event, the prices of all the airlines can be seen on their monitors, says Crandall. ''There's no signaling involved. We just watch the other guy's prices.''
Because SABRE constantly monitored every seat on every airplane in American's fleet, the company was able to practice ''yield management,'' a key weapon for survival in a deregulated environment of ceaselessly changing fares. SABRE enabled American to fine-tune the mix of passengers on a single flight to realize the maximum return for each seat.
''It's not enough to just fill up the seats on an airplane,'' says George W. James, president of Airline Economics Inc., a Washington-based consulting firm. ''The high-discount carriers like People Express, Continental, and more recently Eastern, tried that. But even flying full, they only generated yields of about 8 cents per mile.'' American, by contrast, generates an average yield of 12 cents against an industry average last year of 12.4 cents per mile.
When Crandall assumed the presidency in July 1980, he became the chief operating officer of an airline with an aging fleet of planes and an obsolete route system. The carrier also faced astronomical fuel prices in the months following O.P.E.C.'s second oil shock, while its fares were being undercut by the new economy airlines.
''American doesn't have a clue as to what it wants to do now that we have deregulation,'' an executive with a regional competitor was quoted as saying. ''They just have a bunch of planes they fly around.'' In 1980, the airline managed to lose $76 million on revenues of $3.8 billion.
Some of American's solutions came under the heading of simple housekeeping. The airline sold off the hotel chain and moved corporate headquarters from Manhattan to the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. Meanwhile, a total restructuring was begun. For starters, American radically revised its routes, adopting the hub-and-spoke system that became the hallmark of deregulation. Passengers from a variety of outlying cities were channeled into a clearinghouse airport where they could change planes to continue their journeys, ideally on the same airline that had brought them there in the first place. Although the arrangement was sometimes maddeningly confusing to the customer, it was far more efficient at filling up aircraft than the old point-to-point system.
American established mega-hubs at Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago. The airline went on to spend $3 billion to build other hubs in Nashville, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and - to serve the Caribbean -in San Juan, P.R. American ended the decade by constructing a sixth and a seventh hub at Miami and at San Jose, Calif.
Next came the realignment of the fleet. Completing a program to rid the company of its overly large 747's, and winnowing out an earlier generation of smaller jets, American set out to acquire some brand-new aircraft. As luck would have it, McDonnell Douglas made an excellent twin jet, the Super 80. Introduced in 1977, the plane, which carried up to 155 passengers, was between 30 percent and 40 percent cheaper to operate than a 727. But Douglas had failed to develop a market for its new plane, which presented cash-poor American with a golden opportunity. The airline arranged to lease 20 Super 80's from Douglas for what was called a ''test drive'': if American found the planes unsatisfactory at any time, it could return them on 30 days' notice and pay a penalty of less than $2 million per plane. Hence, without going into debt, and with a minimum outlay of cash as well as significant tax benefits, American obtained the use of some brand-new planes. The company liked the Super 80's so well that it eventually acquired 193 of them.
But the Super 80 by itself was not going to solve Crandall's equipment problems. By 1984, with more than $1.2 billion in cash on hand, the company went shopping in the expectation it could buy some planes at a substantial discount. In 1988, the year American posted record profits of $476.8 million, it was reported that the company was paying only about $36 million apiece for the 50 economical, twin-engine Boeing 757's it had on firm order - 20 percent off the sticker price.
To survive in the deregulated environment, it was essential to match the cut-rate competition. Labor is the principal cost for any airline; at American, it accounted for 37 percent of operating expenses in 1983.
Like other large, troubled, formerly regulated airlines, American had tried to tackle the problem by laying off employees - some 6,500 in all, including 450 pilots. Further choices appeared to be bleak. Either American could go to its heavily unionized work force and beg for wage concessions, as United and Eastern had done. Or the company could follow the route blazed by Frank Lorenzo at Continental and break the back of the union by plunging the airline into bankruptcy, whereupon an entire new labor force could be hired at dramatically lower rates.
Instead, Crandall proposed building what amounted to a new, low-cost airline inside American, but without the dirty terminals and planes, surly employees and scheduling problems that plagued his cut-rate competitors. Crandall's method, though not entirely novel, was widely hailed as the ''two-tier'' wage system. Existing employees, the so-called A track, received a higher wage than the newcomers on the B track. ''We went to the unions and said, 'If you will agree with us to let us hire new people at market rates, we will double the size of the airline, and everyone will move up fast.'
* ''
Crandall, touring the company to make his case in person, promised his employees that they would not lose their current wages and benefits, and he went even further: he promised them lifetime employment and a profit-sharing agreement. By a narrow margin, the unions agreed. Over the next six years, labor costs fell to 34 percent of operating expenses. Crandall had bought himself nearly a decade of labor peace.
From a strategic point of view, however, American had shut itself out from acquiring a major competitor. Crandall repeatedly declared that he didn't want another company's airplanes and labor contracts. In fact, he had few choices: the bargain with his unions virtually prohibited him from taking on thousands of new employees, whose salaries would be higher than the wages paid to his B-track employees.
There were some conspicuous exceptions to Crandall's refusal to grow by purchase. In 1984, he established the American Eagle system, a network of seven independent commuter airlines operating under the American banner and serving New York City, Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago, Nashville, San Juan and Los Angeles. The purpose was to improve the ''feed'' to American's hubs.
American eventually bought five of the seven lines. Last year, Eagle carried six million passengers, and 56 percent continued to their destinations on American Airlines.
Crandall had been smart and aggressive, a man legendary for his 12- and 18-hour days, but he had also been lucky. As the 1980's waned, fully 30 percent of the airlines, as measured by revenue passenger miles, were sick or dying - and therefore unable to show much fight when he chose to invade their territory and steal their customers.
As for the stronger airlines, Delta is extremely well managed and is a serious competitor. Northwest, a potential powerhouse with an excellent Far Eastern route system, has been preoccupied in the aftermath of a leveraged buyout that extinguished its profitability. United, American's hereditary enemy, has been virtually paralyzed since 1987 by internal turmoil and raids on its stock.
With his domestic operations thriving, and his hub system providing an abundant flow of passengers, Crandall was ready to transform American into an international carrier, pursuing his business customers as they, in turn, pursued their new global strategies. ''Airline margins are higher internationally because of the average trip length,'' says Robert J. Joedicke, a senior airline expert at Lehman Brothers. ''It costs as much to fly from Dallas to Paris as it does to fly from Dallas to Chicago because once you get up there, all you do is burn fuel, and this brings down unit costs.''
American was a very late arrival on the international scene. C. R. Smith's retreat from the overseas market 30 years before had left American owning no routes originating in the traditional gateway cities, such as New York or Los Angeles.
Deregulation may have given airline operators the freedom to fly wherever they chose domestically, but international landing rights are still negotiated on a government-to-government basis.The American Government has long obliged the airlines of its allies with access to major cities while getting little in return for United States carriers. Furthermore, routes are now awarded to a specific airline and cannot be automatically transferred by purchase. For example, although American bought T.W.A.'s Chicago-London route last year, it did not receive T.W.A.'s right to land at Heathrow. Instead, the British Government offered Gatwick, a less desirable location with a single runway.
And so Crandall adopted a strategy that seemed to make a virtue of necessity: American would fly to secondary cities in Europe from inland hubs in the United States. ''Instead of funneling everybody into New York and putting them on a 747,'' says Crandall, ''we can bring them to Chicago and fly them on a smaller 767, which means we can offer daily service. With us, people don't have to fly to a central location in Europe. Instead of London, they can fly to Manchester.''
The secondary destinations avoided the infuriating congestion of the gateway airports, and the smaller planes enabled American to offer the greater frequency of service the traveling public wants. ''There's an old airline expression, you don't build a church for Easter,'' says Joedicke. ''You want to keep your planes full, and a 747 is empty a lot of the year.''
To some analysts, American's strategy was, at best, a temporary expedient. ''You can't keep flying inland routes to inland routes and do it forever and make money,'' says Fidelity's Karen Firestone. Last year, American pulled out of Geneva, Hamburg and Stuttgart and scrapped its New York-to-Lyons service.
It was clear that, whatever the cost, Crandall and his team were anxious to establish a credible trans-Atlantic presence by 1992 before a protectionist window slammed shut on the European airline market.
Crandall, seldom a man to do anything by half measures, determined to make American nothing less than the dominant United States flag carrier. He staked his bid, not on price, but on service - a field in which the Europeans have long excelled. ''You can't save your way to prosperity,'' says Crandall, when asked about the $24,000 hand-stitched leather and sheepskin seats installed in business and first class on overseas flights, the individual V.C.R.'s in first class and the lobster fajitas on the menu.
There is evidence that the strategy has met with initial success; last year American took 5.5 percent of the trans-Atlantic passenger business, in a hotly contested field where 20 airlines share 87 percent of the market.
But in the burgeoning market, American operates under a particularly galling handicap: in 1986 archrival United walked off with Pan Am's lucrative Pacific routes for $715 million. ''The deal was done in the dark of night,''says Donald J. Carty, American's executive vice president for finance. ''Pan Am did not auction those routes off. We all kick ourselves that we didn't ask Pan Am about them earlier.''
It was an omission that came back to haunt American this past summer when an administrative law judge recommended that the Department of Transportation award the coveted Chicago-Tokyo route to United. American's vigorous bid was found lacking on the grounds that it had no connecting flights in Asia. ''That was a critical route for us,'' says William J. Burhop, American's vice president for government affairs.
Last December, American paid a grand total of $423 million for a bankrupt Eastern's Latin American routes, and began a lavish campaign to advertise its service to 20 cities in 15 countries. In this case, American's determination to turn global, from a standing start, left the company with a serious shortage of the wide-bodied, long-range aircraft that were essential to the strategy. In order to open South America, new routes to Helsinki, Warsaw and Barcelona had to be delayed.
The shortage was not limited to South America and Europe. Delivery of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, the three-engine wide-body intended to be the workhorse of American's Oriental routes, is months late. For very long-distance travel, American had only two 747 SP's.
And in the United States, according to some analysts, American had made an even more basic misjudgement. Despite the immense investment, the Nashville and Raleigh-Durham hubs had failed to live up to their potential, and the Super 80 was simply too large a plane for the market.
Over the last year, American has not escaped the travails that afflict the rest of the industry. In October 1989, in the waning days of the takeover era, Donald Trump, the New York real-estate developer and casino operator, made an unsolicited, bid of $120 a share for American Airlines. Unlike United's management, which was in disarray following a second assault by the New York-based raiders, Coniston Partners, Crandall maintained an outward calm.
''It was very difficult for Mr. Trump to credibly make the argument that he was going to run the airline better,'' Crandall says. When United's attempted buyout came apart, it took the airline junk-bond market with it, and Trump withdrew his bid for American to confront his own massive debts. ''It was some skill and some luck,'' says Crandall, assessing his effort. ''Like most of life.''
Meanwhile, the B-track pilots, who now constituted 57 percent of the union's membership, were exhibiting a growing militance. They wanted the two-wage system abolished. ''They're kids in the sense that they want new toys,'' says Lehman Brothers' Joedicke. ''And those toys are the airplanes Crandall buys. But at the same time, they want money. That leaves them a choice between a rock and a hard place.'' As of the end of August, the two sides remained far apart. ''In seven years, Crandall has replaced the plant in his office and gotten his teeth fixed, but nothing else has changed,'' says Capt. Fred R. Vogel, an American pilot and president of the union. ''This settlement isn't going to cost him one bag of gold, it's going to cost him two bags of gold.''
To which Crandall responds: ''Airlines can't take strikes. They run out of money in six or seven months. If the employees won't accept reality, we'll stop making investments. We'll stop growing and prospering, and they will have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.''
The turmoil caused by the Middle Eastern crisis predictably drove jet fuel prices - an airline's highest expense after labor - into the stratosphere. In a desperate move to retain market share, the weakest carriers, such as T.W.A. and Pan Am, cut ticket prices. Together with the economic downturn, the price war threw the industry into disarray.
Analysts have placed three airlines - Pan Am, T.W. A. and Eastern -on the critical list. With a $500 million cash hoard and an A-minus credit rating, American appears to be well positioned to ride out the storm. And if Crandall's luck holds, he might even be able to gather some considerable treasure from the wrecks of other airlines.

OILING THE SKIDS UNDER THE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
When President Saddam Hussein made his grab for Middle Eastern hegemony, the world's stock markets tumbled. Traders remembered the oil droughts of the 1970's, when skyrocketing petroleum prices caused economic dislocations around the globe. With the prospect of a recurrence, Wall Street turned to its economic pundits, whose skills are never so much in demand as when the future seems most unpredictable. 
At Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, for example, Edward J. Campbell, senior economist, concluded near the end of August that a rise in oil prices need not be a disaster, although costly oil could cause economic ''stagnation, even negative growth,'' later this year.
At the end of July, when refiners' crude oil acquisition costs averaged $18 a barrel, he forecast a real economic growth rate of 2 percent to 2.4 percent for 1990-91. When oil surged, he factored three prices into the forecast. The economy could absorb a $5-a-barrel rise to $23 fairly well. But at a projected $28 a barrel, Campbell foresaw ''zero-growth - not recession.''
Were oil to reach $33 a barrel, he said, there could well be negative growth in both the third and fourth quarters, the classic definition of recession. Continuing high prices for gasoline could also send the economy into recession, he said, even if crude prices retreated. At the same time inflation would climb. But Campbell's economic model found that, even with prices at $33 a barrel, the economy would pull out of recession in 1991.
As the accompanying chart indicates, the rebound from a $15 price surge would seem to be stronger than with a $5 or $10 increase. His explanation: ''economists' arithmetic.'' It simply reflects the fact that, because the G.N.P. sinks further in the $15 scenario, the 1991 recovery yields a greater percentage increase.
Among the reasons for Campbell's relatively sanguine forecast: The increases in oil prices as of the end of August were proportionately smaller than in previous crises - closer to 50 percent, rather than the 100 percent that occurred in 1979 and the 300 percent in 1973 - and there were greater oil inventories on hand. He also expects that in the event of a recession, the Federal Reserve would ease credit to help the economy recover. That would also improve the prospects for long-term bonds and thus spur investment.
Other seers were more bearish. ''The shock of higher oil prices seems likely to be the final straw that tips the U.S. economy into recession,'' a report from Salomon Brothers said. ''We expect real gross national product to decline by 1 percent annualized over the next three quarters, reviving modestly in the second half of 1991.'' As a result, the firm said, it had lowered its sights for the market and significantly pared its list of recommended stocks. But it also noted, ''It is fruitless to hang a financial market forecast on political and emotional factors.''

RIVER OF TRAPS
A Village Life.
By William deBuys and Alex Harris.
Illustrated. 238 pp. Albuquerque:
University of New Mexico Press. $19.95.
My favorite Georgia O'Keeffe legend tells of a magazine writer who landed on the artist's doorstep in Taos, N.M., declaring, ''I've come all the way from New York to see you!'' O'Keeffe replied, ''Well, this is the front.'' She turned. ''And this is the back. Now you've seen me.'' She strode to her studio and slammed the door. 
Nowadays, cow skulls over the mantel are enjoying their 15 minutes of fame and visitors are welcome to besiege Taos, but astute tourists might suspect the real northern New Mexico is somewhere behind a slammed door, lurking with its lip curled. They are right. Any who wish to know it can skip the galleries full of pink howling coyotes, stay home and read an exceptional documentary book, ''River of Traps.''
The story is framed by the photographer Alex Harris and the writer William deBuys, who, with Mr. deBuys's wife, the painter Anne deBuys, fled the moral flatlands that ''years of Nixon and Vietnam'' had rendered unsympathetic for a New Mexican mountain village so remote that ''even the barbed wire in the fence gates seemed to creak in the old-fashioned, backwoods Spanish that was spoken there.'' They bought a ramshackle farm and spent the next decade learning to live up to its demands.
In the story's center stands their neighbor, Jacobo Romero, who seems picturesque but in fact is about as cute as Georgia O'Keeffe. The book opens on old Jacobo shoeing his horse by a dusty road, mumbling greetings to the recreational vehicles that roll past, completing a quaint tableau. The greeting he quietly offers in Spanish is not printable here.
Jacobo, who also speaks an inventive form of English, is the village's oral historian extraordinaire and Democratic Party chairman (he gives each voter a dollar and a beer). He takes his young neighbors under his wing, showing them the arcane art of irrigating their fields from acequias, the community canals. Water rights, more precious than money, are shared on a timetable, and repeatedly Jacobo admonishes William and Alex to watch their water closely. When they follow his advice they discover in the dead of night that Jacobo, whose orchard lies upstream, is stealing water from them. They close his water gate and never mention it.
Jacobo calls them ''the gringos,'' sometimes affectionately and sometimes, they observe, with the sound of an epitaph: ''Here lies Bill deBuys, gringo. He always had more ideas than sense.'' Meanwhile, the author pecks at his typewriter, feeling rather guilty for producing nothing more useful than words. And Alex ''bore a camera seemingly attached to his anatomy, like a large goiter. It was a bad habit, but not a dangerous one, and people forgave him for it.'' Preoccupied with art and farm work, the gringos listen to Jacobo's tales of seven decades in the mountains, but won't understand for many years that his stories are parables, that Jacobo is what they came looking for.
Because it was assembled after the fact, their portrait of him has a pleasantly jumpy, associative structure, like human memory, and is blessedly free of the self-consciousness of a premeditated ''memoir.'' Instead, it brims with gifts of language and vision: an old barn's ''resistance to collapse appeared less structural than metaphysical.'' The writer's horse has ''a roman nose, feet as big as frying pans, and a lower lip like a bicycle tire. Bareback, its withers would threaten your genetic future.'' The poetry of the text is matched by Mr. Harris's photographs, which are emotionally lean and visually rich. Jacobo in his collapsing barn, striped by light, looks aristocratic; telling a story inside the steamed windows of a truck cab, he betrays the claustrophobia of crippled old age.
Slowly Jacobo wins us over. Near the end he describes his bootlegging days. He was crooked, he admits, but not any more. The gringos suggest he may still be a little crooked: ''Maybe you know that ladron who used to steal the water.''
'' 'IHijole!' He covers his grin with a thick hand. 'If I find that son of a bitchy I gonna hit 'em with the shovel!' ''
The greatest surprise in ''River of Traps'' is that it is not, finally, a portrait of one old man with arthritis-splayed fingers and remarkable memories, nor is it simply ''a village life,'' as the subtitle modestly purports. It's an account of a unique American circumstance. The Hispanos of northern New Mexico have held their lonely frontier for more than three centuries - longer than it's been claimed by the United States or Mexico. For most of that time their economy was precapitalist. Jacobo's generation weighs neither goods nor lives against cash. He seems insane when he irrigates in the rain, or when he cuts the tractor-inaccessible corners of his hayfield by hand, with a scythe, though that effort costs him more in pain than the hay is worth. He strives for a visible perfection in his land, without keeping accounts, the way others of us might seek it in our families. For the old ones, the value of the land and its products is similarly unmeasurable.
''River of Traps'' is a timely book, for it reveals some of the genuine underpinnings of the much-popularized Santa Fe Style: an economy of natural materials with nothing wasted, an esthetic that embraces the land with reverence. Long after pink coyotes have come and gone through the living rooms of Manhattan, men like Jacobo will be cutting perfect fields of hay in the mountains that capitalism forgot.
 
A REALLY HOT TAMALE
 At the end of the summer his uncle paid him his wages: three silver dollars, the most money he had ever touched that belonged to him. Juan de Dios had left for El Valle a week or two earlier, and so his uncle put him on the train at Antonito alone. It was a relief to leave his uncle and a moment of triumph to set out on his first solitary journey.
''I remember there were many people at the depot, selling tamales, carne seca, any kind of food. Everybody was pushing and calling. And the train made a lot of noise too. ''I get on the train and lean out the window. There is a man right there on the siding, and he say, 'You better buy some tamales so you don't go hungry.' Then the train start to pull out. So I say, 'Bueno, dame dos tamales.' And the train is moving now so he has to run a little to keep up. But he hands me the tamales and I take them. And he say, 'Five cents.'
''And now the train is almost to the end of the depot, and I don't give him nothing. The man curse me. He shake his fist and shout. But I just smile, and I take a bite of that tamale.'' Closing his eyes, Jacobo licked his lips. ''That was a good tamale,'' he said. ''I don't think I ever have another any better. But I was a bad boy. I was a little crooked in those days.''
From ''River of Traps.''

CROSSBLOODS
Bone Courts, Bingo, and Other Reports.
By Gerald Vizenor.
Illustrated. 322 pp. Minneapolis:
University of Minnesota Press.
Cloth, $35; Paper, $14.95.
Gerald Vizenor's ''Crossbloods: Bone Courts, Bingo, and Other Reports'' is, as the title suggests, an eclectic collection of essays and articles written over the last two decades by this prolific author, whose subject matter is Native American life and culture. Mr. Vizenor, a mixed-blood member of the Minnesota Chippewa tribe, has been a reporter and editorial writer for The Minneapolis Tribune and now teaches literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He has also written two novels, ''Bearheart: The Heirship Chronicles'' and ''Griever: An American Monkey King in China,'' the latter of which won an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation in 1988; beautiful new paperback editions of these books are being published by the University of Minnesota Press along with this new collection. 
This is a collection of picked-up pieces. The introduction and the first set of essays, ''Crossblood Survivance,'' are free-flowing polemics that touch on the major issues confronting Native Americans in the United States. ''Crossbloods,'' he says, ''are a postmodern tribal bloodline'' of part-Indian, part-white individuals, and their economic survival has become interwoven with the development of high-stakes gambling on reservations; the redefinition of treaties and land allotments; fishing and hunting rights; new concepts of entrepreneurship, and other concerns. Bingo, which generates an estimated $3 million to $4 million a year on one reservation alone, is both boon and bane. On the one hand there is all that money; on the other, there are all the problems of gambling and the strong feeling in some corners that bingo runs counter to any sense of tribal heritage.
The longest sustained narrative is the story of Thomas White Hawk, who murdered a jeweler in Vermillion, S.D., in March 1967. This section, ''Capital Punishment,'' shows Mr. Vizenor's true skill as a reporter as he recounts the crime, the trial and the aftermath in magazine articles he wrote in 1968 and 1970. It would have been better still if there had also been a more complete update on Mr. White Hawk (whose sentence was commuted) and the community of Vermillion.
In fact, the entire second half of the book, composed mainly of short newspaper articles written in the early 70's about tribal matters, would have benefited from current news or updates, especially on the issues of education, the phenomenon of ''stolen children'' (children who are placed in foster care and adoptive homes in white society), the movement back to the reservation, ideas of natural tribal rights and the American Indian Bank, which was established in Washington almost 20 years ago.
Mr. Vizenor's intriguing essay ''Bone Courts: The Natural Rights of Tribal Bones'' confronts the issue of the hundreds of thousands of tribal bones that now reside in museums and research institutions. He proposes a ''Bone Court,'' in which the bones would be ''mediators and narrators'' and have the legal right to be represented. He quotes Walter Echo-Hawk, an attorney for the Native American Rights Fund, who said, ''If you desecrate a white grave, you wind up sitting in prison. But desecrate an Indian grave, and you get a Ph.D.'' Mr. Vizenor doesn't offer a way to implement his very moral plan, but his essay is a telling glimpse at a huge injustice.
This collection is confusing at first, because Mr. Vizenor spans so many years on such an array of issues (even using completely different prose styles - from reportorial to academic), but he does offer an unvarnished view of aspects of contemporary tribal culture. ''Thirty years ago,'' he notes, ''it was not uncommon to read about tribal people as if they were somnolent cultural artifacts or uncivilized pagans living on wilderness reservations.'' ''Crossbloods,'' scattered as it may be, is another step toward rectifying that notion.

THE JAPANESE POWER GAME
What It Means for America.
By William J. Holstein.
339 pp. New York:
Charles Scribner's Sons. $22.95.
One of the sorriest consequences of America's emotional debate about Japan's place in the world has been the polarization of all commentators into two camps: the Japan-bashers and the Japan apologists. This pernicious division applies a political test to all discussion. Criticism of Japan is dismissed as racism and defense of Japan as unpatriotic. 
William J. Holstein, an associate editor at Business Week, tries to steer between these extremes in his thoughtful analysis of how Japanese society works and what the United States response should be. Certainly he is tough on Japan, and occasionally simplistic; probably, many Japanese will dismiss him as a basher. But his book, ''The Japanese Power Game,'' and particularly his recommendations on how the United States could better compete against Japan, is more subtle than that.
Mr. Holstein argues, along with a growing band of analysts, that Japan's economy and society work by fundamentally different rules than those that operate in the United States, and that it is folly to believe the Japanese will move toward an American model, or even wish to do so. He foresees a Japan that continues to grow stronger economically and more influential in the world, with the flexibility to avoid problems that have hobbled growth in other postindustrial societies.
But he fears that Japan will use this power not to champion the principle of democracy that the United States claims has driven its foreign policy, but to pursue its own brand of economic self-interest. Therefore, he urges the United States to stop clinging to a near-religious belief in free trade and adopt, in his words, a kind of ''economic patriotism'' that will allow it both to compete effectively with Japan and to remain an ally.
Mr. Holstein raises a number of vital issues, and discusses them with a complexity and calmness that are often missing from the debate. To this reader, the strongest chapters are those on the American response to Japan. He rightly emphasizes the fact that Japan and the United States are going to have to get used to the idea that they are rivals as well as allies, and need to proceed without emotion or name-calling.
He also suggests that Americans should copy Japan's pragmatic use of any economic tool that works. Rather than recoil from the idea of an industrial policy as tantamount to socialist state planning, he argues, the United States should recognize that it already has a de facto industrial policy forged from tax laws, antitrust laws and the like.
Mr. Holstein is also sensible when discussing Japanese investment in the United States. He notes Japanese companies' abysmal records in hiring or promoting women and minority workers. In many cases, Japanese investment has not meant that American workers learn new technologies or American suppliers get new jobs. But he argues against any widespread ban or excessive regulation of Japanese investment. Instead, he says, Washington can examine which investments help our economy and which may harm it.
Some of his arguments are not persuasive. He wants Americans to buy American products, but his own tale of sticking with an American car that gave him years of repair problems appears to push that idea to absurd extremes. Buying shoddy American goods lets American manufacturers off the hook.
I would also have welcomed more extensive discussion of one of the central problems clouding the current debate: how to prompt Americans to take Japan's competitive threat seriously without prompting racism and hysteria. Mr. Holstein dismisses the fear of such reactions, often cited by those who are condemned as Japan apologists, as exaggerated. But one has only to look at the explosion that greeted Mitsubishi's purchase of Rockefeller Center or Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures. Headlines like ''Japan Invades Hollywood'' show how quickly emotions can spiral out of control.
In outlining his case for why the United States should not merely cede economic dominance to Japan, Mr. Holstein argues that power, not principles of fairness, dominates Japanese life. And, he says, parochialism, not internationalism, governs Japanese relations with the rest of the world. Change comes infinitesimally, if at all.
To illustrate his claims, Mr. Holstein outlines the lamentable fate of the powerless in Japan, particularly ethnic minorities such as Koreans and the group known as burakumin (untouchables). He correctly describes the barriers that continue to obstruct women's advancement in politics and business. His superb, exhaustive treatment of the recent Recruit stock-trading and bribery scandal illustrates how politics and business are intertwined in Japan, and shows why the scandal did not prompt far-reaching political or social change.
Yet I found his vision of a country in which raw power wins the day too simplistic. In Japanese society, power is tempered by continual compromise and a shrewd sense of how far to push. Japan's ruling party has stayed in power for decades because it knows how to adapt just enough to keep a majority of the voters content. And Japan has changed dramatically in the past, when the Japanese have deemed it in their own interests.
Over all, however, this is a valuable and provocative contribution to a highly charged debate. One hopes that its relatively calm voice will not be lost in the shouting.

Drivers on the Move To Find a '91 Team

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO

 BODY:
By the end of this week, there should be a solution to the puzzle of which Indy-car driver will be driving for what team in 1991.
The key figures are Danny Sullivan, who left the Penske team last week, and Teo Fabi, who along with teammate John Andretti was put out of work when Porsche dropped its Indy-car program last week.
These moves were rumored for several weeks, so the drivers have had time to work on finding teams for 1991.
Going into today's race at Elkhart Lake, Wis., one scenario was that Sullivan would sign with Patrick Racing, which runs the Alfa-Romeo engine, and Fabi would sign with Jim Hall's new team. But Sullivan could wind up with Hall, and Fabi might return to formula one. 
 
Search Sendoff
Sullivan's job search was set off by Pennzoil's decision to return to sponsoring Hall after eight years as Rick Mears's sponsor at Penske.
''We felt like we could get better exposure for Pennzoil with Jim Hall,'' said James L. Pate, president and chief executive officer of Pennzoil.
''There's no question about the fact that Penske has been very successful,'' Pate said last week. ''In fact, so successful that he and his organization, I think, get a lot of visibility, and, frankly, distract a little bit from the sponsors.''
Hall, who has been out of Indy-car racing eight years, won the Indianapolis 500 as a car owner in 1978 and 1980.
''We have identified two or three prospects who we're talking to right now, and they would be drivers who are up in the top 10 in Indy-car drivers,'' Pate said. That would certainly include Sullivan and Fabi.
''He's told you more than I would, but that's correct,'' Hall said when told of Pate's statements.
 
Father and Son
Hall, who will use a Lola-Chevrolet, will be joined by his son, Jim Hall 2d, who runs a karting school in Oxnard, Calif. Larry Curry will be team manager and Franz Weis, who rebuilds Chevy engines for other Championship Auto Racing Teams entrants, also will be part of the team.
Sullivan was the odd man out at Penske because Mears was more established with the team and Emerson Fittipaldi, who joined the team last year, is still under contract.
Another driver who could be walking next year is Roberto Guerrero, who has driven for Alfa the last two seasons.
''We're shopping right now,'' said Paul Brian, an Alfa spokesman. ''Roberto has not been told at this point that he will not be hired for next year.''
If Guerrero were dumped, it would be unfortunate particulary because it would come just as the team was moving into the top 10 after switching to a Lola chassis. Guerrero did most of the development work for the team in the days when its March chassis tended to lose important pieces at high speed.
''We're still talking with Sullivan,'' Brian said late last week. ''We're very close with him, as a matter of fact.'' Although Alfa was said to prefer an Italian driver, it doesn't look to be Fabi. ''Fabi talked with us last week and said he had to know by Friday, or it was no,'' Brian said, referring to Sept. 14. ''So the answer was no.'' Brian said the team was also talking to the Englishman Martin Brundle, a sports-car and formula one driver.
But Tom Blattler, a spokesman for Miller, the team's sponsor, made the future sound encouraging for Guerrero. ''Miller wants Roberto Guerrero,'' Blattler said. ''And we haven't been notified that they're changing.''
Sullivan's Penske car used to be sponsored by Miller, so he has worked with the company.
 
Other Job Hunters
Drivers aren't the only people seeking work. Derrick Walker, the general manager of Porsche's team, said he was trying to keep his employees working next year after the West German automaker's announcement last week that it was dropping Indy cars to concentrate on its new formula one engine.
''I'm desperately trying to put together some sponsorship to keep the team going,'' Walker said last week.
Given the weakening economy and the fact that most corporate sponsorship budgets for 1991 were sealed long ago, the prospects look dim. Engines would also be a problem for Walker. Chevrolet has added three CART teams for 1991, and wouldn't seem likely to now add Walker's team. That would leave either the uncompetitive Cosworth or Judd engines.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Land-Use Review;
New Charter Procedure Gets Its First Test

BYLINE: By Alan S. Oser

 BODY:
Five years ago Peter Schorr made a tactical mistake at a New York City Board of Estimate hearing. Assured by a clerk that the board would adjourn before it reached his request to demap a paper street in the College Point section of Queens, he left the chamber prematurely.
At 2 A.M. the matter came up. The only speaker was an opponent, trying to upset Mr. Schorr's plan to build six two-family houses on a 35,000-square-foot lot that included the unbuilt street, now a well-worn footpath. The City Planning Commission was in favor of the demapping. But Community Board 7 in College Point opposed it. The Board of Estimate voted against the proposal.
Now the 34-year-old developer, the son of a partner in Schorr Development Corporation, which is building town houses on College Point's East River waterfront in a development called Riverview, is back with his proposal in a new forum. His is the first land-use matter to arrive before the City Council under the new ''Borough President's appeal'' procedure of the revised City Charter. 
One case will prove nothing. But in the longer term the handling of this new procedure by the Borough Presidents and the Council may well determine whether it is the Achilles heel of Charter revision. When Charter revisers debated it last year they called it the ''triple no.'' Critics warned that it would weaken the Department of City Planning and leave parochial interests with too much power to thwart the use or reuse of private land for residential and commercial growth.
At the very least, it seems likely to cause many property owners to hold back in the pursuit of land-development plans. A strong market may awaken interest despite any institutional constraints, but in a weak or uncertain one, the new hurdles are likely to have an additional inhibitory effect.
Under the Charter revision, certain types of land-use actions go automatically to the City Council once they are acted on by the City Planning Commission. These are text or map changes in the city's zoning law, changes in urban renewal plans and all comprehensive land-use proposals.
But the revised Charter does more than provide for Council decisions on these essentially legislative matters. If a community board and then the Borough President vote ''no'' on a specific street mapping or demapping proposal, or an application for a special permit under the zoning law, and the City Planning Commission votes in favor if it, the Borough President can appeal for a City Council review. The appeal is spoken of as the third ''no.''
There is a separate but complementary procedure called the City Council call-up, by which a majority vote by the City Council can bring any land-use matter before the Council for a review.
The Charter revisers disagreed about how widely these procedures would be used or how significant their mere existence would be. The number of cases to have reached the stage so far in which a Council call-up is possible is 15, Council aides say. So far none has been called up. Peter F. Vallone, the Queens Democrat who is the Council Speaker, has issued a memo urging Council members to use the procedure with restraint.
But Borough Presidents may come to feel that the use, or threat of use, of the appeal may strengthen their role in influencing property owners' land-use planning.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, wrote to Manhattan's community boards earlier this year advising them to vote ''no, unless . . .'' on land-use applications that come before them, rather than vote yes with reservations, a customary approach in the past. That would preserve her right of appeal to the Council if the Planning Commission voted ''yes.''
Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens was the chief advocate of the Borough President's appeal system before the commission on Charter revision. Robert F. Wagner Jr., a former chairman of the City Planning Commission, is known to have been influential in persuading the Charter Revision Commission to accept it as a means of winning majority support for the new land-use review system in the revised Charter. The Mayor has a veto power, but the Council is now the final body for legislative review.
In the College Point case, the newly constituted 13-member City Planning Commission voted unanimously in favor of the demapping after the two ''no's.'' At the time of the vote, the Queens Borough President's appointee to the commission, Joel Miele, was not present.
Deputy Borough President Peter Magnani and Fred Gross, director of planning and development in the Borough President's office, appeared before the zoning, planning and land-use subcommittee of the Council's Land Use Committee to argue against the demapping. The subcommittee is chaired by Councilman Robert J. Dryfoos, Democrat of Manhattan.
The Queens officials say that demapping a 60-foot road would effectively cut off the best public access to city-owned land along the waterfront. They call for a ''comprehensive waterfront plan'' before the road is demapped. The Planning Commission's position is that the demapping would not affect the city's waterfront planning in northern Queens.
The Borough President also says that the demapping would leave some privately owned lots with no legal access. Josephine Mercurio, chairwoman of the Community Board 7 subcommittee that studied the issue, said that the area has suffered from overbuilding. ''We don't have enough schools, or bus service, or a hospital or a clinic,'' she said. ''We don't even have a movie theater.''
Mr. Schorr assembled four plots for his site in the shape of a T with a long stem. The stem would remain as an undeveloped land amid private houses. The tip, which back up to Schorr Development's offices, would be built with six houses along the demapped Sixth Avenue from 129th Street to 131st Street. A pedestrian strip would be preserved for access to the water, 300 feet away.
Since the mid-80's, Schorr Development has built 300 town houses at Riverview at College Point, the Villas of Riverview and Silverpointe Estate. On part of its 40-acre tract it plans to build 200 more units. Currently, the Enclave at Riverview has 56 town-house units priced from $190,000 to $230,000 on the market.
Mr. Schorr, whose father and uncles are principals in Schorr Development, says he has pursued his Silverpoint Commons plan independent of his relatives in his first real-estate venture. He has worked as a manager of the construction company that built the Schorr Development projects.
The Charter gives the City Council 50 days to act on a land-use matter. It can accept, reject or modify a plan on recommendation of the Land Use Committee. If it wants to modify a proposal, the plan goes back to the City Planning Commission for to determine whether a new land-use review is required. If it is, the commission could launch the entire land-use review all over again. But the commission can also send the plan back to the Council for a direct vote without the modification.
The Land Use Committee has a professional staff of 27, led by Gail Benjamin, former director of the Division of Environmental Impact in the Department of Environmental Protection. It briefs Council members after making site inspections and keeps in touch with staff people in the Department of City Planning.
In the short term, it may not be heavily tested. Because of a slow market and hesitancy about the new procedures, the application pipeline is light. The Board of Estimate, before it went out of business in August, completed action on several major development proposals.
In the long term, the best test may be the volume of actions filed, compared with the volume filed in past years. A significant slippage would suggest that the Charter revision has had a chilling effect on development.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Grand Central Terminal;
A New Look at a 1910 Proposal for Using Air Rights

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
Directly over the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal - sanctum sanctorum of historic preservation in New York - an office tower has been proposed that would rise 22 stories and might contain 1 million square feet of space.
The proposal was made in 1910 and the architects were Warren & Wetmore, principal designers of the landmark terminal itself.
Although this project was long ago left unbuilt, it has been dusted off more than once during the contentious, litigious, extremely drawn out battle (22 years and counting) over Grand Central Terminal's air rights.
And it may be resurrected again, if the Penn Central Corporation is frustrated in other efforts to dispose of the unused development rights, which range from about 1.6 million to 1.9 million square feet.
Penn Central, the Cincinnati-based corporate successor to the New York Central Railroad, owns the terminal and its air rights. In the late 60's, it proposed two skyscrapers over the terminal, one with 55 stories, the other with 59. Both were designed by Marcel Breuer and both were rejected by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. 
The ensuing legal battle ended when the United States Supreme Court upheld the landmarks law in 1978 against Penn Central's claim, among other things, that the designation was an unconstitutional taking.
Now, First Boston and the developer G. Ware Travelstead of Manhattan have a contract to buy 1.5 million square feet of air rights from Penn Central. They wish to use 800,000 square feet of those rights to build a 1.45-million-square-foot, 74-story skyscraper at 383 Madison Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets.
That proposal has been rejected by the City Planning Commission, not only because of the skyscraper's extraordinary density but also because city planners do not believe that the chain of ownership necessary for the air-rights transfer exists in this case. The developers have sued the city.
Meanwhile, the City Planning Department has proposed a special Grand Central subdistrict that would expand the number of sites around the terminal eligible for its air rights.
Into this tangle has stepped the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which leases the terminal from Penn Central for use by the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
The M.T.A. is trying to figure out a way to accommodate First Boston and Mr. Travelstead, at least to some degree. The authority wants to have clear title to the terminal before it embarks on about 75 percent of its $400 million master renovation plan. Therefore, it is eager to see the property shed of some value, to help reduce the eventual purchase price or condemnation award.
The M.T.A. has also assembled a potential receiving site through its recent purchase of Nos. 341 and 345 Madison Avenue. Together with the authority's headquarters building, No. 347, these constitute the whole avenue blockfront from 44th to 45th Streets.
Something else may happen, however, if the air rights revert to Penn Central.
''We are willing to work with the M.T.A., the city and others to explore options for Penn Central to realize the value of its transferable development rights,'' said Robert W. Olson, senior vice president of the corporation. ''However, if none of those prove viable and if, in fact, the development rights turn out not to be transferable, then we believe Penn Central would be entitled, as a matter of law, to build over the terminal.''
That is where the Warren & Wetmore scheme comes in. ''Those renderings serve as a model,'' Mr. Olson said, ''or as a starting point, certainly.''
''I don't think we would ever propose a building of the type that was proposed in 1968 and 1969,'' Mr. Olson said. ''We would be looking at something more of the Beaux-Arts style, more consistent with the exterior facade of the terminal.''
Where Breuer designed stark, modernist slabs that seemed to crush the terminal beneath them, Warren & Wetmore placed the tower well back from the terminal's 42d Street facade and gave it an enormous mansard roof and monumental columns, in keeping with the architecture below.
Readers of The New York Times saw renderings of this tower in March 1910, three years before Grand Central opened.
''The railroad company is missing no opportunities,'' The Times said 80 years ago. ''It realizes the future value of the air space above this building. In order to utilize this air space when the time is ripe, the columns and beams which are being put in the station now in course of construction are of sufficient strength to carry an additional structure which will tower 22 stories above the roof of the new station.''
The landmarks commission kept the door open for a future a proposal, as the Supreme Court noted: ''Nothing the commission has said or done suggests an intention to prohibit any construction above the terminal. The commission's report emphasized that whether any construction would be allowed depended upon whether the proposed addition 'would harmonize in scale, material and character with the Terminal.' ''
Laurie Beckelman, the current chairwoman of the commission, said: ''It depends on what the addition is. Is it compatible? Is it contextual? How does it relate to the individual landmark? Perhaps there is a time when something could be built.''
Kent L. Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society, which has been a leader in the preservation of Grand Central, said that ''if the railroad wants to present a plan to build another tower over the terminal, it would have to be treated very seriously.''
But both he and Ms. Beckelman described as much more promising the efforts by planners to devise a strategy for dispersing the air rights on the basis of pedestrian circulation, rather than ownership patterns.
From 41st to 48th Streets, Madison to Lexington Avenues, would be a core in which receiving sites would be entitled to a floor-area ratio of 21.6, meaning that a 43,000-square-foot parcel (like 383 Madison Avenue) could accommodate a building of 930,000 square feet. On the west side of Madison Avenue and the east side of Lexington Avenue, between 41st and 46th Streets, receiving sites would be entitled to an F.A.R. of 16. Many blocks in this area are already highly developed with postwar skyscrapers, recently renovated towers or extremely dense buildings from the 20's.
Theoretically, all of Penn Central's air rights could be exhausted under the subdistrict proposal. But the plan is far from reality. It would have to go through review by the Community Board, Planning Commission and City Council.
If all other efforts fail to resolve the case, it is not entirely clear whether it would be liable to return to the Supreme Court. Preservationists argue that the case is closed. To quote from the 1978 decision:
''On this record, we conclude that the application of New York City's Landmarks Law has not effected a 'taking' of appellant's property. The restrictions imposed are substantially related to the promotion of the general welfare and not only permit reasonable beneficial use of the landmark but also afford appellants opportunities further to enhance not only the terminal site proper but also other properties'' - through transferable development rights.
But there is also this footnote: ''The city conceded at oral argument that if appellants can demonstrate . . . in the future that circumstances have so changed that the terminal ceases to be 'economically viable,' appellants may obtain relief.''
Frederick S. Harris, the director of real estate for the M.T.A., noted that ''with the complexion of the court having changed, we might very well see a reversal.''
However, Mr. Barwick said he was optimistic that the matter would not return to the high court. And in any event, he said, ''the city should not be responding to the specter of a probably impractical building, drawn with who knows what level of enthusiasm by a long deceased architect.''

HEADLINE: Focus: Restrictive Growth;
A California Town Finds Mixed Results

BYLINE: By Andree Brooks

DATELINE: OJAI, CALIF.

 BODY:
Under the shade of giant cypress and elm trees near this Southern California town's main shopping arcade, workers are busy transforming a neo-Spanish convent into 10 tiny ''satellite'' offices that are expected to be ready next month .
Conceived by Jim Exon, an agent for jazz and rock musicians, and Frank DiLeo, Michael Jackson's former manager, the project is designed to serve a growing number of people - including the two developers themselves - who have chosen to live full-time in this tranquil community. Mr. Exon and Mr. DiLeo moved a few years ago from Los Angeles to this region of farms and horse breeders at the base of the foothills of the Topa Topa mountains.
By operating a couple of days each week out of the 12- by 14-foot offices, tenants can avoid commuting through the increasingly dense traffic to their main offices some 85 miles to the south in Los Angeles.
The furnished offices here will be rented - no leases have been signed yet - for about $600 a month, with the option of auxiliary services such as word processing, bookkeeping, fax and copying machines. Some tenants may use the satellite offices full-time. 
Possibly more than any other project under way in this 4.5-square-mile residential outpost of 7,900 people, the satellite office epitomizes the sort of development possible under a policy of restrictive growth. That policy was put in place, town officials recall, a decade ago, when the state proposed a super highway through the valley and projections were that Ojai's population would increase more than threefold, from 6,000 to 20,000, within 10 years.
Ojai's restrictive growth policy was written into the town's zoning code in 1979 and then mirrored in the larger 90-square-mile Ojai Valley area through the lobbying of environmental groups like Citizens to Preserve the Ojai. At first it virtually halted residential and commercial expansion, and it also killed the super highway.
That soon prompted a landowners' long-term commitment to raising avocados and oranges in the valley on property that might otherwise have been set aside for tract houses, said Gale Ragland, president of Topa Topa Realtors. This policy turned the valley into a desirable place for a weekend home.
In the community of Ojai itself the ''growth management'' policy, as it is now known, permits only 12 new one-family houses and four multifamily units each year, with a few ''granny flats'' allowed under special exemption. Commercial expansion is considered case by case. Mr. Exon succeeded because he was converting an existing 5,000-square-foot structure rather than putting up a new building. The impact was minimal, said Bill Price, the town planner.
The 20-year-old St. Thomas Aquinas Convent had housed 10 nuns, administrative offices and a chapel. When there was only one nun left, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles decided to sell. Mr. Exon bought the 1-acre corner property for $465,000 in August. About $200,000 will be spent on renovations.
While protecting this Shangri-La (the area was, in fact, used in 1937 to film scenes of Shangri-La for the Frank Capra movie ''Lost Horizons'') and fulfilling the environmental imperatives upon which it was based, the growth-management policy has also had other effects.
The lack of large cluster or multifamily developments has sharply limited the number of new medium-priced homes. This is now keeping the less affluent and the young adult children of current residents out of the valley.
''If we could build $250,000 homes for young couples we would be taking numbers and putting people in line,'' said Jim Miller, a local contractor. That figure is considered a reasonable price for Southern California.
The policy has also left the town sprinkled with empty lots and ''land for sale'' signs in seemingly desirable locations. Critics of the policy consider these a blight. One business leader, who preferred that his name not be used, said he is afraid that eventually a land owner with deep pockets will break the current iron collar on growth and cause more runaway development than might have occurred had a more liberal approach been adopted.
''Better we do something ourselves than leave it to the Supreme Court,'' he said.
The policy prevented diversified job growth or the sort of road building that might have raised values to the same extent as in more accessible communities along the coastline. Although housing prices in Ojai increased in the mid-80's, they lag about 30 percent behind prices for similar properties in other desirable nearby areas, according to brokers.
Al Kutcher, a dentist, and his wife, Frances, moved in August into a new 5,000-square-foot, four-bedroom contemporary home in Ojai. It has a pool, tennis court, three-car garage and an unobstructed view of the mountains.
Several weeks earlier they had sold their former home in Pacific Palisades, a fashionable area of Los Angeles, for nearly twice what they paid in Ojai, although they declined to disclose prices. Their new house is in a neighborhood where most homes cost more than $1 million.
''You still get more house and land for your money in Ojai,'' said Dr. Kutcher, who has consolidated his Los Angeles practice into three long days each week. And it's a ''very spiritual place,'' he added, alluding to Ojai's long-standing appeal as a haven for mystics and psychics. Many old-timers complain that all this has recently made Ojai a bit too attractive to people from higher-priced coastal towns who are now eager to cash in and create even larger - some say indecently sized - country places of 5,000 to 7,000 square feet with big-sky vistas. This is possible because the policy does not restrict house size, only the number of new houses that can be built each year.
This attraction, in turn, has encouraged builders to concentrate their limited development opportunities almost solely on million-dollar properties.
But since the Ojai market now depends heavily on buyers of luxury homes, and most of these need to sell a home elsewhere first, it is making sales difficult.
Sales volume has declined by 35 percent since the start of 1990, according to Larry Wilde, co-owner of the Coldwell Banker office in Ojai, with 350 residences on the market, double the number prevailing for most of 1988.
Prices have declined about 10 percent since the height of the market in 1988. A Spanish-style house on two acres with four bedrooms and three baths that might have sold in 1988 for $750,000 would now fetch about $685,000. That glut has been further aggravated by the restrictions on commercial growth, which narrowed Ojai's economic base. Thus, as soon as the area's primary employer, the oil industry in the nearby city of Ventura, started to relocate or lay off employees about six months ago, the weakening of the market became even more apparent.
Sellers are hoping the losses will be made up by the increasing number of people who talk of the valley as perfect for retirement or as a full-time retreat for people who can work in part from satellite offices. That might continue to hold Ojai's growth in check and allow this particular Shangri-La to endure a bit longer.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
CITIES and the people who live in them did not find much to cheer about in the preliminary figures released recently by the United States Bureau of the Census. Around the nation, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and nearly every other big city lost a lot of their population. Detroit fell below a million, about half what it was in the 1950's.
Closer to home, New Jersey's most urban county, Essex, dropped to 749,000 and was edged in total population by suburban Bergen County. Newark continued to hemorrhage, spilling more than 20 percent of its population, one of the biggest losses in the nation, and falling below 300,000 for the first time since the turn of the century. 
Census figures translate directly into state and Federal assistance dollars: the more people, the more money. So city officials view every dip in the census figures with alarm. The picture was bleak for Trenton, Camden, East Orange, Hoboken and just about every other major New Jersey city but one: Elizabeth.
Between 1980 and 1990, according to the Census Bureau's early count, Elizabeth actually grew, increasing to 108,637 from 106,201.
Granted that 2,436 people amount to a modest increase in a city the size of Elizabeth. But considering the state of cities today, that 2 percent rise represents a significant departure from several frustrating decades of urban retrenchment in New Jersey. And it offers a new view on the future of cities.
Analysts say Elizabeth picked up that increase without benefit of any large-scale new residential projects over the last decade. Rather, the old seaport city enjoyed an unusually successful and complete census count made possible by the same political, demographic and physical characteristics that have enabled Elizabeth to stay the course while other cities have foundered.
What sets Elizabeth most apart from other cities is its stability. It is a rare model of continuity in these instantly updated times. Thomas G. Dunn has been mayor since 1964. Downtown Elizabeth looks pretty much as it did 30 years ago because the city never went in much for urban renewal, pedestrian malls and other planning fads.
When the Singer Sewing Machine Company closed its big plant and other factories shut down, Elizabeth did not try to jump on the office space bandwagon with most other New Jersey municipalities. The city kept its middle-class sights on jobs of brawn rather than brain. The Singer complex became an industrial park.
Elizabeth builds warehouses, not atriums. It focuses on fixing up solid old houses instead of tearing them down to build flimsy new ones, and is sometimes called the aluminum siding capital of New Jersey. Trucks and trains not BMW's still course through Elizabeth's streets. In short, Elizabeth did not forget that it was a city. And, based on the census figures, neither did the city's residents, those who on a typical September afternoon fill the sidewalks on Broad Street or put the finishing touches to a new coat of paint on a Tudor-style single-family house in the Elmora section.
''What it boils down to after all the hoopla,'' said Neil De Haan, director of Elizabeth's Department of Community Development, ''is livability.''
That is not to suggest that Elizabeth has managed to solve all the problems that plague its larger sister to the north, Newark. Elizabethport, the tough section of town on the city's Arthur Kill waterfront, still looks battered and bruised. The downtown movie theaters have fled. Some areas around the train station look as bad as the worst parts of Newark and Camden.
But in the main Elizabeth remains solid, perhaps surprisingly so considering that it has always been a working-class town that never could afford the best of anything. James W. Hughes, a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University, believes that Elizabeth stands out from the rest of New Jersey's cities because it remained essentially a low-rise community, a city with lawns and two-family houses too small to attract speculators.The owners lived in them and kept an eye on who went in and out.
Mr. Hughes attributes Elizabeth's good fortunes to its political stability, its comparatively human scale and its stodgy character that kept it from chasing grand urban renewal schemes that tore the heart out of many other cities.
He also points out that Elizabeth came out of the census a winner because it took the census count far more seriously than did other cities.
Elizabeth officials started working on the census months before the census takers showed up. Eleanor G. Tevnan, a member of the Community Development staff, was relieved of her normal duties and assigned to coordinate census activities full-time from March till the day earlier this month when the city returned its local review forms to the Census Bureau.
Elizabeth built on its natural advantages as a compact, low-rise city. Most of its housing units are single-family houses or small two-family dwellings. Even its public housing projects, which rarely exceed five floors, seem less intimidating to enumerators than the big projects in other cities.
Still, Elizabeth worked to make sure the enumerators knew their way around the city. Office space for the census takers was set up in two locations, and they were well briefed on the city's neighborhoods. A local bank sponsored a wine and cheese gathering for community groups and the clergy at the Cedars restaurant on North Avenue in March to lay out the importance of cooperating with the census takers.
As the census itself drew closer, a decorated van wiggled through the streets blaring lambada music and repeating a recorded message, in Spanish and English, saying that it is very important to be counted.
Elizabeth built on its natural advantages over larger cities. The city did not stop after the census was actually taken on April 1. When preliminary figures were released last month and sent to each of the state's 567 municipalities, many local officials were unable to find the time to check their accuracy or file a documented challenge.
Elizabeth, even though it was sitting comfortably with a 2 percent increase and a solid lock on fourth place among New Jersey's 10 largest municipalities, established a special census task force to comb tax and zoning records and go back out on the streets to follow up the Census Bureau's count.
The team came back with proof that the census missed 1,321 housing units all together and had undercounted the number of people living in several hundred additional residences.
In all, the city claimed an additional 10,000 people, which would bring the 1990 population to 118,000, give or take a few hundred, and add to Elizabeth's reputation as New Jersey's most stable city.

HEADLINE: Bus Garage To Incinerator: An Itinerary For Russians

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
THE day's agenda - visiting a bus garage and sewer treatment plant in Yonkers and a garbage incinerator in Peekskill - would not have thrilled most visitors to Westchester County. But for a delegation of 14 mayors from the Soviet Union who were spending two weeks in the United States, it was close to perfect.
Propelled by the economic reforms of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika program, which seeks to restructure the central-command economy of Communism and move the nation into the free market, the mayors were here for a crash course in capitalism.
They came not from places like Moscow or Leningrad, but from Krasnodar, an agricultural center near the Black Sea, from Chelyabinsk and Tyumen in Siberia and from Magnitogorsk on the eastern slope of the Ural Mountains.
As tourists, they visited New York City, Pittsburgh and Washington. But their technical research was done in places like Newark, Yonkers and Canton and Wooster, Ohio. 
When they arrived in Westchester earlier this month, on the last full day of their trip, the mayors showed that they had done their homework. Some of their questions were pointed; others subtle. For example, they sought to learn how profits were determined when the government hired a private company to operate a public service like the county bus system, the airport or the Peekskill incinerator.
They wanted to know why the private sector was able to operate more economically than the public sector when in both instances the majority of employees were unionized. The answer, essentially, was that it was much more difficult to remove unsuitable government employees, who also have Civil Service protection, than to shed private employees.
 
How Long It Takes to Dismiss an Employee
One of the mayors' hosts in Westchester, former County Executive Alfred B. DelBello, told them: ''A private company can fire an employee if he doesn't perform or if he does something wrong, while in the government, even if he does something wrong, it takes two years to get him out of the government. The result is a loss of efficiency and a less productive work force.''
The Deputy County Executive, Roger Biagi, said, ''The motive for cost-containment is greater in the private sector, where they chase the buck, than in the public sector.'' The mayors evidently had no problem understanding the phrase, ''chase the buck,'' but one asked, ''What about defense contractors?''
The scene was a conference room at Liberty Lines, the bus company that has been operating the county system for two decades - ever since, as the company president, Arthur Bernacchia, put it - ''We were able to demonstrate that we could provide the service for 30 to 50 percent less than governments had done.''
The question about defense contractors and the high cost of military hardware led to a brief but spirited exchange about monopolies.
Edward Dubrovsky, who immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union in 1980 and who runs a trading company in Brooklyn, served as translator. Mr. Dubrovsky, who also works as a consultant on East-West trade, planned the itinerary for the trip and traveled with the group.
 
The Importance of Watching
A mayor asked if Westchester County might not be vulnerable to similar abuse in dealing with Liberty. ''Yes,'' Mr. Biagi said, ''if we didn't watch them.'' Another mayor fired a comment at Mr. Dubrovsky, who directed it to Mr. Biagi, in English. ''But the U.S. Government is watching the defense contractors, too.'' Mr. Biagi said Westchester's scrutiny was more effective. The next question brought laughter. ''You think you are a better government?''
Mr. Biagi replied: ''Yes, and I'll tell you why. We have a five-year contract with Liberty and we watch very carefully. If we are not satisfied in the fourth year, we start a process of finding someone else.'' He also spoke of the bus service as a ''manageable scale of operations.''
Mr. Dubrovsky explained that, ''The issue is very important for Russia, because now there are only Government companies.'' ''If they privatize them, where is the protection?'' he asked. The question was drowned out in a chorus of replies.
 
'You Must Have Competition'
''You must have competition, such as you don't have in the defense system,'' Mr. DelBello said. But is there not design competition, one mayor asked. ''Yes, but after that there's no competition,'' Mr. DelBello said. ''Once they decide on an F-16, for example, the product is made by only one company. If the government spends $10 billion and a company hasn't completed its contract, the government is either out $10 billion or it's got to give the company more money to complete it.''
Mr. Dubrovsky's observation was blunt: ''So there's no difference. Private or government, there's still abuse.'' The daylong exchanges began at the trash-to-energy plant at Charles Point in Peekskill, a spit of land jutting into the Hudson River that now includes an industrial park. It is owned and operated by Wheelabrator Technologies of Hampton, N.H., and is one of 14 such plants in the United States.
 
Soviet Envy in Peekskill
The Soviet delegation was envious of the system, which turns most of the county's household garbage into electricity, at the rate of 60 megawatts per hour - enough to supply 40,000 homes. For agreeing that the plant could be built within its borders, the City of Peekskill collects about $4 million a year from Wheelabrator. It shares the money with two school districts, and residents also receive small discounts on their electric bills.
The plant's general manager, Bob Hensel, stood before a lighted diagram that demonstrated how 2,250 tons of garbage arrived each day in 150 to 200 trucks, 90 of them huge tractor-trailers from five county-operated and two commercial carter-operated transfer stations.
The trash is dumped into an 8,000-ton pit. From there enormous grapples that hold 3,000 pounds dump the trash into three boilers where it begins the conversion to steam and, finally, electricity.
One boiler is taken out of service for maintenance for 5 to 10 days every 16 weeks. Mr. Hensel said the longest period of unscheduled maintenance was 48 hours. The residue from the incinerator consists of metals - ''about 13,000 tons a year,'' Mr. Hensel said - which are sold to scrap dealers, and ash, which is buried.
 
What About Rodents?
Mikail S. Karakai, the Mayor of Krasnodar - his full title is chairman of the executive committee of the Krasnodar City Council of Peoples Deputies - said that in his city, which has a population of 600,000, ''garbage is taken to an area and kept there.'' His description of the area made clear that it was a landfill similar to that used by Westchester until 1984, when the Peekskill plant opened.
Landfills represent a growing problem for major Soviet cities because appropriate space for them is dwindling. Mr. Hensel was asked how he handled the problem of rodents. He said there was no rodent problem because the garbage was delivered to transfer stations or to the Peekskill plant the same day it was collected from households.
Mayor Karakai, a power plant engineer by training, wanted to know how residents reacted to the plant, how close it was to private homes and how plant officials dealt with complaints about it. ''It is now the first time we are asking people, 'What is your opinion?' '' he said.
''I can see we must first assure our people it is safe, then build it,'' he said. ''We can do it only after much explanation.''
Mayor Karakai thought for a moment and then sought to place the entire trip into a wider perspective. ''We have to use this knowledge,'' he said, ''to lift the level of our cities, and our people.''
 
Farms and Firefighters
Mr. Dubrovsky's itinerary, which included cities roughly the size of those represented by the Soviet visitors, was concentrated in Ohio. There, the visitors were taken through steel mills, including one now owned by the workers, to farms, wildlife centers, hospitals, shops, city halls, and police and fire departments.
''They were shown how a volunteer fire department works,'' Mr. Dubrovsky said, noting that no such system operates as efficiently in the Soviet Union. ''They timed an alarm; it took three minutes for the volunteers to get to the firehouse and drive the trucks out, and a few more minutes to get there.''
The firefighters ''burned two automobiles as part of the demonstration,'' he said, ''and they demonstrated a tool to get people out of a car.''
The Soviet visitors ''were impressed with everything, but especially with the quality and quantity of food in the stores,'' Mr. Dubrovbsky said.
Mayor Karakai, who speaks English, drove with Mr. DelBello from one site to another on the Westchester tour. ''He could not say enough nice things about the openness of American people and the nation's highways,'' Mr. Delbello said later.
Mr. Dubrovsky said the most unforgettable moment for some was a high school football game in Canton. ''Your local football is a big event,'' he said, ''a celebration, with every citizen, everybody, at the stadium - the bands, the music, the cheerleaders - it's a joy.''
 
A Theft in Manhattan
But there were also some sour moments. The group's van was broken into in Manhattan, and some money, gifts and passports were stolen. ''We went to the Sixth Precinct, another experience, and learned that such crimes are so common it was hard to get anybody to listen,'' Mr. Dubrovsky said.
''But the people,'' he went on. ''After so many years of brainwashing in the Soviet Union these city officials come over here and discover that Americans don't think about war with Russia after all. They would invite us to their homes, and they want to visit the Soviet cities.
''Even when they didn't know it was a Soviet delegation, when our van got lost, they would say 'follow me' and lead us in the right direction.''
On their final night in the United States, Mr. Dubrovsky took his charges to the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn where many Russian immigrants have settled, and to the Odessa Restaurant there.
''That was like being home,'' he said. ''Russian songs, Russian food, Russian everything.'' The next morning they were on their way home, in some cases to street protests, food and tobacco shortages and the political uncertainties they had left only two weeks earlier.

HEADLINE: When Mothers And Infants Are Addicts

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: VALHALLA

 BODY:
A WOMAN from White Plains was nearing the time to deliver her child when doctors monitoring her condition at the Westchester County Medical Center here noticed a sudden drop in the fetal heart rate and performed an emergency Caesarean section.
Baby Alexis, now 17 days old, is doing well, considering that she was born addicted to crack, the deadly cocaine derivative. She breathes normally and no longer suffers from diarrhea and vomiting. She has stopped screaming through the night, calmed by Peragoric, a mixture of alcohol and opium, and by tight swaddling, which soothes her constant tremors.
Alexis is one of a growing number of crack-addicted infants being cared for at the Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Medical Center. Opened eight years ago to provide the latest in medical advances to high-risk babies born in the Hudson Valley region, the neonatal center has become a new battleground in the war against drug addiction. 
Doctors at the center fighting to save these babies have taken on an unexpected and formidable group of opponents: the mothers themselves. Many crack-addicted women, doctors say, are deliberately using a combination of lethal drugs to spontaneously abort an unwanted fetus. The mothers are frequently successful, but when they are not, their addicted babies end up in the neonatal center.
Some of these women leave the Medical Center alone, abandoning their newborns to the county's already overburdened foster-care system. But a growing number are being persuaded to keep and care for their addicted infants and to try to kick their own habit with the help of Dr. Stephen Piazza, assistant neonatalogist and director of the center's Follow-Up Clinic for Substance-Abused Infants.
''I believe in what I am doing,'' Dr. Piazza said. He encourages mothers to enter separate programs to treat their own addiction. ''I have a lot of success stories, where mothers are in 'detox' programs,'' he said, ''and others who come in wearing little chains that say 'I am nine months clean.' ''
 
'If Someone Will Work With Them, It Will Work'
Although a small percentage of his clients fail, and lose their children to the foster-care system, Dr. Piazza said: ''I have enough who are still taking care of their babies nine months down the line. I know if someone will work with them, it will work.''
For the last four years, Dr. Piazza's work has been supported by annual grants of $20,000 to $30,000 from the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. The grants allow him to run the Follow-Up Clinic, which was described by Dr. Harry S. Dweck, director of the neonatal unit and professor of pediatrics at New York Medical College, as the most important factor in keeping mother and child together.
Caring for an infant in the neonatal center costs $1,000 a day, Dr. Dweck said, and crack-addicted newborns remain in the unit from four days to two months.
Although he said he was concerned about the costs, Dr. Dweck added, ''Our function is not to police drug dealing, but to care for these kids - to make sure when they are born and when they are discharged, we have done what is necessary to allow them to live as normal a life as possible.''
Many of his patients, Dr. Piazza said, are prostitutes. ''They are selling their body to get crack, and they are so high they don't realize what they are doing,'' he said. ''Then they take extra doses to get rid of the kid.'' Other crack-addicted women, like Alexis's mother, want their babies, but are unable to stop taking drugs during their pregnancy, he said.
The neonatal center receives at least one crack-addicted newborn a day. Some were carried to term; others were born prematurely. When he first came to the Medical Center six years ago, Dr. Piazza said, he saw an average of one addicted infant each month. Now from three to eight of the 3o infants in the unit at any one time suffer from drug addiction, he said. Most experience withdrawal from the various drugs their mothers abused, which almost always include crack.
Few women realize the effect crack can have on their fetuses, Dr. Piazza said, adding that it is far more damaging than other drugs because it is a pure form of cocaine and once it enters the system of a fetus, it stays there.
If a pregnant woman takes as little as one hit of crack and never uses the drug again, Dr. Piazza said, her fetus can be damaged. Cocaine reaches the baby through the mother's placenta, where it is transformed into a fat-soluble substance too heavy to return through the placenta to the mother's body, he said. The placenta, in effect, becomes a one-way valve.
''The drug just comes in but it won't come out,'' Dr. Piazza said. ''It stays in the baby's system, constantly recirculating, and the infant keeps getting high, high, high.''
The effects can be numerous and long lasting. Infants usually withdraw from other drugs within 72 hours, but crack withdrawal does not usually begin until the baby is about eight weeks old. And the process can continue for two years.
''Crack babies sweat a lot even if they are not hot,'' Dr. Piazza said. ''They are foul smelling, and a mother will often tell me her baby sounds like he is snorting, like he always has a cold.''
The babies suffer from constant fine tremors and irritability, especially when stimulated by the sound of a telephone ringing, a radio or a light being turned on. ''I have mothers who say, 'Oh, Steve, my baby is so smart; at one month he is already standing up,' '' Dr. Piazza said. ''The truth is these infants are so stiff they cannot be bent.''
 
'It Makes You Angry'
While making his rounds one day, Dr. Dweck said, he saw a baby who was constantly in motion, even when sleeping. ''We couldn't get this kid to gain weight,'' he said. ''It makes you angry.''
Pregnant women who take drugs, Dr. Dweck said, are committing ''the most hostile act that can be done to the most passive victim.''
The problem crosses economic lines, Dr. Piazza said, adding that the mothers of more than half of the 77 infants he treated in the Follow-Up Clinic in one recent two-month period were middle-class women, some with college degrees. ''I have a couple of Wall Street stockbrokers, one veterinarian and two elementary school teachers,'' Dr. Piazza said. ''One woman comes in her Mercedes with a nanny to watch the child.'' Although those women can afford private care, they come to the clinic because few physicians in private practice want to deal with the problems of crack-addicted children, Dr. Piazza said. Doctors are unwilling to treat crack-addicted pregnant women, he said, because there is no antidote for the drug and they are concerned about the possible liability associated with the almost certain complications of pregnancy.
 
A New Program in White Plains
Four months ago, an outpatient program called ''Generations'' opened in White Plains. It offers a complete evaluation, counseling and treatment program for up to 15 addicted mothers and their infants. Thought to be the first such comprehensive program in the state, Generations is an attempt to help crack-addicted mothers and their infants survive and succeed together.
Women are referred to Generations by the Medical Center and by Child Protective Services, a division of the Westchester County Department of Social Services. They are told that completing the program, which takes a year to 18 months, is the only way to avoid having their children placed in the foster-care system.
One-third of the 30 women referred to the program are currently enrolled, said Ann-Marie Trotta, its director. ''These women don't want to lose their babies,'' Mrs. Trotta said, ''but they have a very, very hard time.''
Still, she is optimistic about the program's goals. ''We are the first group they have trusted enough to follow the treatment plan,'' she said. ''We have at least got these women to look at their addiction.''
 
A Difficult Task
Keeping women with a history of substance abuse together with their often-damaged children is a difficult task, medical experts and social service professionals agree, and they predict more crack-addicted infants will enter the foster-care system.
M. Annette Myers, the assistant commissioner with the Westchester County Department of Social Services, who oversees the foster-care program, said that of the 129 children under the age of 2 who entered the program during one recent 17-month period, 52 showed positive signs of crack or cocaine addiction. The results of the tests, done at the discretion of physicians, represent a ''guesstimate,'' she said, adding, ''I'm concerned about the cases we don't know about.''
Dr. Piazza is concerned about the future of the infants he sees. ''Crack babies are just entering school, and we really don't know what will happen to them,'' he said. ''We are sitting on a time bomb. We are waiting for the learning disabilities, we are waiting for the psychosocial problems and we are waiting to see how these parents react when their children don't perform well in school.''

UNIVERSITIES AND THE FUTURE OF AMERICA
By Derek Bok.
135 pp. Durham, N.C.:
Duke University Press. $14.95.
EARLY in ''Universities and the Future of America,'' Derek Bok, the president of Harvard University, poses two related questions: Are American universities doing enough to help the United States confront its domestic crises, like declining productivity, intractable poverty and rising rates of illiteracy? And is the academy doing all that it can to strengthen Americans' ethical awareness and sense of social responsibility? His answer to both questions is no. 
In these essays, originally delivered in 1988 as the Sanford Lectures at Duke University, Mr. Bok reflects on why this is so and offers some proposals for change. If universities are to address the root causes of declining productivity, he believes, they must rdirect their research and educational priorities. And if they are to produce socially engaged citizens, they must embrace moral education.
Since Woirld War II, American universities have put far more effort into developing semiconductors that into understanding the causes of homelessness. The reason, Mr. Bok says, is because outside resources like Federal grants and contracts are readily available for scientific research, and because science carries high prestige within the academy. There has been a good fit between what society has defined as critical to its prosperity and security and what academics have wanted to investigate. Yet Mr. Bok insists that universities, along with the foundations, corporations and Government agencies that fund them, must recognize that scientific research alone cannot make American business and industry more competitive.
Business schools could do more to enhance knowledge of selling abroad and of managing technology. They could insist that students learn foreign languages and acquire a familiarity with other cultures. Engineering faculties could strengthen programs in manufacturing and design rather than emphasizing the discovery of new products.
Mr. Bok also observes that the problems underlying our current social malaise do not generally attract much outside funding, or score high on any scale of academic prestige, and he says that if universities are to respond imaginatively to social needs, they must develop programs of instruction independent of what society chooses to pay for. Universities could allocate generous resources to their colleges of law, education, social work andpublic administration, for instance, to undertake research on social ills like poverty and adult illiteracy.
For a university president to call on the academy to match its goals to the needs of the larger community (or for higher education to respond affirmatively to such a call) is not unusual in our history. The United States has a particularly rich tradition in this regard, most notably in its land-grant and public urban universities. Mr. Bok's book links this progressive tradition with the complex realities of the postwar research university.
But questions arise. Take poverty research, for example. There has been a considerable amount of work on poverty. Too much of it has been ignored. Are additional initiatives called for, or do policy makers need to pay more attention to the findings already available?
Then, too, large-scale research can divert faculty and resources from core educational programs. At a time when many universities are finding it increasingly difficult, with the resources available to them, to provide the best possible educational opportunities to their students, should they bear the primary responsibility for research in such areas as economic productivity, which directly benefits business and industry?
The second reform Mr. Bok proposes in this book involves fostering student's moral development and sense of social responsibility through courses in applied ethics, programs. of community service, clear codes of conduct and high ethical standards for university decision making. Indeed, there are signs that this is already happening. New interest in community service and civic education is apparent on many campuses. REcent publicity about campus racial conflict has often obscured a more positive development: that college campuses are quite possibly themose diverse communities in the United States, and that many are making concerted efforts to create institutions and curriculums that respect and enhance the pluralism of American culture.
''Universities and the Future of America,'' although critical of higher education, exudes confidence in the universities' achievements and their potential - confidence that sets it apart from the spate of jeremiads that have appeared over the past few years. It is also timely. As the cold war ends, Mr. Bok's vision of socially relevant education and research ought to be taken seriously by raders both inside and outside the academy.

Renovation For '05 Theater

BYLINE: By JOHN A. TOWNES

 BODY:
 Several residents formed a nonprofit Save the Mahaiwe group and local officials created a special historic district, a move unanimously adopted by voters at the 1989 Town Meeting. Formal approval now is needed before the theater can be demolished or converted.
Then, this summer, Hoyts announced it had decided not to sell the theater. It had been making a profit and its operating costs were low because Hoyts owns the building, according to Morris Englander, chief executive officer of its American operations, based in Boston. 
The Mahaiwe opened in 1905 as an ornate, 750-seat vaudeville theater and it later became a movie house. It had deteriorated by the mid-70's, but has been gradually upgraded since then by its manager, Albert Schwartz. Since he restored the stage seven years ago, the theater has also been used for concerts, plays and other live productions.
Hoyts expects to spend $70,000 to $100,000 to repair the roof and heating system, paint the interior, install new carpeting, add about 200 seats and put in a mechanical "flying screen" to allow rapid changeover from movies to the stage.
Great Barrington is the largest Berkshire County town south of Pittsfield. It and the surrounding region attract vacation homeowners, tourists and new residents from large cities.
In the last decade, Railroad Street has changed from "a dingy side street into an upscale retail anchor" while Main Street has become more oriented to professional offices and retail uses, according to Richard MacDonald, sales manager at the local Apple Hill Realty. Although the economy has slowed, he added, "we're somewhat insulated from New England's problems by the proximity to New York dollars."
The Mahaiwe historic district was originally to have included the entire downtown area, but several property owners objected. Officials then narrowed the boundaries to a portion of the block around the theater, including the town hall and several nearby properties.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: CHARLES J. DUFFY;
Small Towns Have Big Problems, Too

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
CHARLES J. DUFFY is the executive director of the Council of Small Towns, an organization formed in the late 1970's to lobby for the interests of rural and suburban municipalities in Connecticut.
A native of Joplin, Mo., Mr. Duffy, 44 years old, graduated from Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, and in 1968 came to Connecticut to teach at Yale. He taught until 1973, when he became director of the Middlesex County Development Council. In 1975 he was appointed deputy director of what is now known as the State Department of Economic Development. He spent one year as Undersecretary of Employment and Training at the State Office of Policy and Management and in 1980 was appointed head of the Connecticut Retail Merchants Association.
In 1986 he left to become a lobbyist, and in 1987 formed his current company, Duffy-Stover, with Keith Stover as partner. That same year, he was appointed director of the council (a part-time job), the lobbying firm's most prominent client. The council has an annual budget of about $50,000, and about 70 of the state's 169 towns as members. 
In an interview at his office in Hartford, Mr. Duffy talked about the concerns of small towns. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
Q. With a three-way gubernatorial race this year and 38 percent of the vote considered enough for a victory, the candidates' strategy so far seems to focus on the major cities. Is there any concern that small towns will be overlooked in the rush to woo urban areas?
A. No, I don't think so, for a lot of reasons. One is the Democratic convention, because there was some competition there, which involved both candidates going out and speaking to a lot of people, including people from small towns, seeking support, so the small towns have already been heard. On the Republican side, the suburbs and smaller towns in many cases are controlled by Republican officials, and they make up the bulk of the Republican Party interests in the state.
Weicker, because of the nature of his independent campaign, has got to seek out everybody. So I don't think the campaign itself will have an effect on the big town versus small town interests. What will have an effect, is the state's general financial condition, and the problems that are going to have to be faced by whoever is elected. That is where the potential for problems exists with respect to small towns.
Q. What kind of problems?
A. One of the things that could affect them negatively in comparison with big towns is the adjustment of the formulas, like aid to education or town road aid. Sometimes when you have limited resources, this rich versus poor, small versus big, issue arises. But in Connecticut, small doesn't necessarily mean rich, and big doesn't necessarily mean poor.
We have a number of small, poor towns in Connecticut: Sterling and Voluntown, for instance. They've got very little tax base to draw on, and they are extremely vulnerable to recession. Back in 1975, when I started in economic development, those were towns that had 15 and 20 percent unemployment rates, and I think it's not inconceivable we could reach that point again in the next year and a half.
Q. Are small towns typically Republican, or Democratic?
A. Well, in the Hartford area, there's a trend in general to elect Republicans. Most of the councils have gone in the last couple of years from Democratic to Republican. But there are a lot of Democratic chief elected officials in small towns. One of the things I've found in small towns is the political party label doesn't mean much. It doesn't mean what it means in a statewide election. I live in Deep River, I'm a member of the Democratic Town Committee, and I have served as chairman of our Board of Education, and so on. But the Democratic Town Committee in Deep River is a very conservative group of people. And that is true in a lot of places. The party label really, for local politics, doesn't mean what it means in a statewide basis at all.
Q. William J. Cibes Jr. drew almost all his support at the Democratic convention from small towns yet won enough votes to force a primary that divided the party for two months. If they are conservative, why did they support such a liberal candidate?
A. Facing a $900 million budget deficit, if the state doesn't have the money, what is it going to do? It's going to cut the budget. And a major part of the budget is state aid to municipalities, particularly aid to local education, and most elected officials are concerned about that. They believe, like I believe, that every dollar reduction in state aid is a dollar increase in local property tax. My sense of the reason Bill got a lot of support from local officials is they liked what he was saying about tax reform. I think he was addressing that very directly and specifically. Plus, he had been doing a lot of road shows prior to getting into the race. He had been to a lot of the small-town Democratic Town Committees or local elected official meetings.
Q. Is that support going to force candidates to look again at small towns? Can small towns coalesce again around a particular candidate in the general election?
A. I don't think so. You've got small-town people like Doug Cutler, the First Selectman of Woodstock, supporting Lowell Weicker, you've got small-town officials supporting Bruce Morrison, you've got a number of them supporting John Rowland, strong local leaders like Bob Chatfield from Prospect. There are tons of different reasons for people to support different candidates.
Q. Is aid to small towns the major issue for small towns this year?
A. There's no question about it.
Q. Are there any others?
A. There are several, but all related. One of the other problems towns have is the things they are required to do, the mandates. Binding arbitration has been the lightning rod of state-mandated local government spending. There are lots of other examples: environmental protection, building officials, all kinds of things. I don't think it's so much the towns disagree with the need for spending in any particular area, but the thing they resent is the state saying they are going to take out of towns' hands the control over spending.
That's O.K. if the state increases its share, but if you look ahead and see that's not going to continue, you say: ''Well, you've got to un-mandate some things, you've got to give us more control. If we're going to raise our property taxes to pay for teacher salaries we want more control over the process.''
Q. Do small towns have different types of problems from large towns?
A. Certainly. About half the general assistance caseload in the state of Connecticut lives in Hartford. Hartford has an extraordinary problem with poor people. That's not a problem Deep River has, relatively. But the need to have the state pay for the reconstruction and repair and rehabilitation of highways is relatively more important to Deep River and Essex and northwestern Connecticut than it is to the city of Hartford.
Q. Are there problems where towns and cities get together?
A. Everybody has a problem with education costs. The state this year for the first time has not been able to meet its commitment, has been sliding back from the goal of paying half the cost of local education. Those are issues the big and small towns won't divide on. And there are regional issues, such as transportation problems, bus and rail, that face the Fairfield County towns, small and large.
Q. Do any towns belong to both COST and the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities?
A. Sure, as a matter of fact, John Blaschik, the First Selectman of East Haddam, is chairman of COST and on the board of CCM. George Hill, the Mayor of Mansfield, is on both boards.
Q. Then what's the reason for two organizations representing municipalities?
A. COST came together because the legislature wasn't paying attention to small town issues. The feeling was then we needed some organization that would pick four of five things each year and pound away on them. Two years ago we went back to the organization and said look, this organization has been around for 10 years: Do you want to change the purpose? Do you want to do more programs for members? The membership put together a committee to examine the organization and decide what it should be doing.
The decision was COST is important, and it should do more, which meant doubling the dues of the association. We got some new people in, and some people who had been critics have become very involved, both active and critical, moving the organization forward.
Q. Did you lose any towns because of the growth during the mid-1980s?
A. We didn't lose them because of that growth, and we didn't lose them when we raised the dues, but we did lose some this year because of their budget problems. They told us when they were laying off teachers they couldn't justify the dues.
Q. Are any of COST's accomplishments particularly noteworthy?
A. Some of our members say the organization was totally responsible for the fact the state funds local road projects, provides $30 million a year for that. Some of the rational conclusions to some of these housing issues have been attributable to COST, and I don't mean keeping things from happening. We were an integral part of the affordable housing appeals legislation. Another is the siting of ash landfills. When I first started with COST, the legislature had a proposal I thought was very unfavorable to towns, and we got together and generated the principles that were embodied in the law that passed in 1988.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
IRAQIS THREATEN TO ATTACK SAUDIS AND ISRAELIS IF NATION IS 'STRANGLED' BY EMBARGO

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 23

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq threatened today to attack oilfields in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and to use force against Israel if Iraq was ''strangled'' by the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations.
After meeting with Iraq's other top leaders in Baghdad, Mr. Hussein had a bellicose statement issued in the name of the Revolutionary Command Council that appeared to bring the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf a step closer, Western diplomats said.
In previous pronouncements since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Mr. Hussein has spoken of striking at Saudi oilfields and at Israel in response to any American attack on Iraq. This time he appeared to be saying that Iraq might mount a pre-emptive strike, though he did not say whether it could come through military or terrorist action.
 
Says It Will Prevail
Iraq also declared today that it was ready for any strike mounted by the United States, and that it would prevail in an ensuing conflict. 
But the statement, read over Baghdad radio and television, centered on the effect of the trade embargo that has cut off all but a small proportion of Iraq's trade, including food imports that had met more than 70 percent of the country's requirements. [Excerpts, page A12.] Blaming the United States for the sanctions, the Iraqi leaders said the penalties had been imposed ''in a way that exceeds all humanitarian limits'' and that was cruel even by the standards of those who ''believe in the law of the jungle''.
 
A Vow to Strangle 'the Cause'
''We will never allow anybody, whoever he may be, to strangle the people of Iraq without having himself strangled,'' the leaders warned. ''If we feel that the Iraqi people are being strangled, that there are some who will deal a sanguinary blow to it, we will strangle all those who are the cause of this.''
''The oil areas in Saudi Arabia and in other states of the region, all the oil installations, will be rendered incapable of responding to the needs of those who came to us as occupiers in order to usurp our sovereignty, dignity and wealth,'' the statement said.
It added, ''Israel will be affected in all actions that affect the owners of the homeland'' - meaning Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Hussein alluded to the possibility of pre-emptive strikes more than once. The statement said that anyone threatening Iraq should be warned that ''We will turn the whole area, including the oilfields, into flames,'' adding:
''Those who wish the flood to overtake the Iraqi people and the nation, and are planning for this, should remember well that the waves of the flood will overwhelm them before they overwhelm the Iraqi people.''
 
More Militant Tone
After a flurry of actions last month that seemed to be aimed at easing tensions, including the release of many foreign women and children among the 11,000 Westerners then trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, Mr. Hussein has turned lately to increasingly militant words and actions.
The statement today reinforced the impression that the 53-year-old Iraqi leader is implacably opposed to any compromise that would avert the threat of war between Iraq and the alliance massed against it. The United States, several Western European nations, Saudi Arabia and other countries have joined in confronting Iraq by stationing troops in Saudi Arabia and in the Persian Gulf.
An announcer in a dark suit read the statement on Baghdad television this evening. Before the statement was broadcast, Mr. Hussein was shown smiling broadly as he convened a joint meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council and top leaders of the governing Baath Party who authorized the statement. The 17 officials wore military-style uniforms and were seated at a rectangular conference table.
 
Location of Session Unknown
The report did not say where the meeting was held. Reports circulating recently in Baghdad have suggested that Mr. Hussein moves frequently from one site to another in a motorcade of identical Mercedes-Benzes.
In the tape shown on television, Mr. Hussein appeared to be reading a statement to the leaders, and the document issued later reflected the polemical style of his speeches. The statement described Iraq's occupation and decision to annex Kuwait as an Iraqi province as ''an eternal decision from which there can be no retreat under any circumstances or conditions.''
Those who have condemned Iraq and sent forces to confront it were described as ''poisonous wasps,'' ''evil-doers'' and ''back-stabbers.'' Even King Hussein of Jordan, who has sought to mediate between Baghdad and those demanding the country's withdrawal from Kuwait, was bluntly told that any search for a face-saving Iraqi exit was a waste of time.
The statement said that ''Arabs who are launching good offices'' served the ''tactics of the enemies and their supporters'' by implying that Iraq could be assuaged. Such efforts push aside the ''major issues'' raised by Iraq, Baghdad asserted, and substitute ''minor issues'' as part of a proposed settlement.
 
Jordan's Proposal
King Hussein of Jordan, who has argued for an ''Arab solution'' since the crisis began, recently proposed that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait be predicated on a pledge that territorial and other disputes be open to negotiation at a later stage.
But the Iraqi leaders said today in their statement that their ''prime objective'' remained ''the liberation of Palestine from the usurpation of the Zionist usurpers.'' Their remarks turned the clock back to a proposal put forward by Mr. Hussein on Aug. 12, just 10 days after the invasion, when he linked any Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait to an Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory.
The Iraqi statement reiterated Mr. Hussein's formula for a settlement, which calls for the withdrawal from the region of all ''foreign forces,'' including those sent by the United States, after which the issues raised by Iraq's takeover of Kuwait could be discussed among Arab nations.
''In order to avoid war, those concerned should withdraw their troops, forces and fleets as soon as possible,'' the statement said.
Baghdad had previously belittled the United Nations embargo. Food lines have been growing in the capital and in other Iraqi cities, and rations for bread, rice, cooking oil and other scarce foodstuffs declared in early September were halved within a week. But diplomats in Baghdad had believed that no food crisis would emerge for some time, possibly several months.
 
Diplomats Suspect Anxiety
But after the statement was released today, diplomats reached by telephone in the Jordanian capital said it appeared that Mr. Hussein might be more anxious about the embargo's effects than he had previously admitted.
One reason for the anxiety, the diplomats said, may be that the United Nations Security Council is expected to meet this week to approve a proposal to extend the trade sanctions to air shipments, which have been used to circumvent the sea blockade. [Asked today about Mr. Hussein's threat on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d did not respond directly, The Associated Press reported from Washington. But he noted that the Security Council planned to meet soon ''at the foreign minister level'' to consider ''possible steps.''] One hint of Baghdad's efforts to overcome the embargo came in a meeting today in the Iraqi capital between Mr. Hussein and a delegation from Tunisia, one of the Arab countries that has refused to condemn Iraq for its seizure of Kuwait.
After showing Mr. Hussein sitting on a sofa with the leader of the Tunisian delegation, the television announcer said the two men had discussed ''economic cooperation.''
In a step that may have serious implications for foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait who do not hold Government ration cards, Baghdad also announced that the Kuwaiti currency, the dinar, would immediately be abolished. An official decree said that people with Kuwaiti currency would have 48 hours beginning Monday to exchange their money for Iraqi dinars, on a one-for-one basis. That amounts to a two-thirds devaluation from the rate at which the Kuwaiti dinar was trading before the invasion.
To avoid starvation, tens of thousands of Arabs and Asians still trapped in Kuwait, as well as at least 370,000 others at refugee camps in and around Baghdad, have reportedly been buying food on the black market with Kuwaiti dinars.
Relief agencies have been seeking ways to get food supplies to the foreigners. But aside from an arrangement with India to funnel food to Indian nationals, relief shipments have been blocked by Baghdad's insistence that the supplies be distributed by Iraq. Western Governments say that restriction could result in the food being diverted to the Iraqi forces.
 
Iraq Apologizes to France
NICOSIA, Cyprus, Sept. 23 (AP) -Iraq unexpectedly apologized to France today for the raid on the French Ambassador's residence in Kuwait that set off a series of diplomatic expulsions and prompted President Francois Mitterrand to send troops to the gulf.
The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that an investigation showed that the Iraqi soldiers who entered the house did not realize that it was the residence of ''the former French Ambassador.'' Iraq has referred to ambassadors in Kuwait as former envoys since it ordered that embassies in the country be shut down.
Iraqi officials previously had denied any raid took place.
Four Frenchmen, including the military attache, were captured by the troops who forced their way into the Ambassador's residence. The attache was released later in the day.
The spokesman said the other three had been flown to Baghdad and were staying at the Melia-Mansur Hotel. ''No measures were taken against them except they were prevented from travel,'' he added.

It is 2 P.M. on the Cross-Bronx Expressway, and for thousands of cars inching toward the George Washington Bridge, the air is heavy with exhaust. Half a mile ahead, where the highway and the Henry Hudson Parkway feed into the bridge's seven westbound lanes, traffic is stopped.
As unlikely as this scene might appear at midday, it is repeated almost every hour on highways throughout the New York metropolitan region. As long-overdue repairs close lanes on dozens of bridges and highways, some of the worst traffic jams in recent years have become commonplace, making it a gamble to drive into New York or across the region.
But if traffic seems bad now, transportation officials say, it is likely to get worse - possibly much worse - in coming years as the widespread repairs continue. 
 
'It Will Get Worse'
''We're repairing everything at once, because they all need it,'' said Lucius J. Riccio, New York City's Transportation Commissioner. ''But it will get worse before it gets better. We'll be closing more lanes than opening ones in the next two or three years. And it will take at least 10 years to get the roads and bridges into a good state of repair.''
The work is under way seemingly all at once in the city, on Long Island, and in Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey in an effort to overcome decades of neglect. Its effect is crippling because the number of vehicles on the road has grown far faster than the population, and many highways were already jammed beyond capacity.
Transportation experts warn that the resulting delays are not only raising frustrations that are already high, but are also contributing to air pollution and to hundreds of millions of hours in lost productivity each year. The declining quality of transportation, they say, is making New York less attractive to businesses and casts an added cloud over the region's long-term economic well-being.
In the meantime, traffic jams have returned the driving experience in both city and suburbs to the excruciating stop-and-go of the pre-interstate era.
After a generation of little maintenance or expansion, many of the region's 75,000 miles of roads and 11,500 bridges are antiquated and deteriorating. Hundreds of repair projects have begun, including ones that have closed lanes on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the New England Thruway, Connecticut Turnpike, Cross-Westchester Expressway, and bridges including the Queensboro, Whitestone, Throgs Neck and George Washington.
Among other projects scheduled in the next few years are a $580 million reconstruction of the Gowanus and Brooklyn-Queens Expressways; a $1 billion effort to resuscitate the West Side Highway; $706 million for the Long Island Expressway, and a nearly $1 billion plan to repair all four East River bridges into Manhattan.
All told, about $10 billion will be spent in the region in the next five years, if current levels of Federal, state and local financing can be maintained. Nearly half of that will be spent in New York City.
 
Suburb-to-Suburb Commuting
But officials say that they have barely half the money needed just to maintain roads and mass transit, and that building new highways and bridges to ease automobile travel is virtually impossible.
Despite one of the nation's most extensive mass-transit networks and relatively slow population growth, traffic in the New York region increased substantially in the 1980's, largely because of more commuting from one suburb to another, rather than to and from New York City.
Nine million vehicles now travel 100 billion miles a year in the region. Those numbers are expected to grow by nearly half in the next 25 years, according to an estimate by the Bi-State Transportation Forum, which represents the six major transportation agencies in New York and New Jersey.
Meanwhile, mass-transit use has declined, and there is little political will to discourage driving through methods like higher gasoline taxes and tolls.
 
Little Maintenance Investment
''There are really two related traffic problems: infrastructure maintenance, which hasn't been done over the years as it should have been, and road capacity and congestion,'' said Franklin E. White, the New York State Transportation Commissioner.
Roads and bridges throughout the country have deteriorated because of a failure to invest in maintenance over the last 10 to 15 years. And in New York, many of the region's arteries are among the nation's oldest, and were not designed for the number of cars or the size of trucks that now use them. Potholes are endemic, and many highways have narrow lanes and lack shoulders. A single breakdown can cause a major traffic jam.
A recent report by the Bi-State Transportation Forum estimated that keeping the region's highway system in good repair over the next 25 years, with limited expansion, would cost $82 billion. But if current financing continues, only $35.7 billion will be available.
Federal, state and city budget problems, however, could reduce transportation spending. As for building more roads and bridges, officials say little is likely after the last 20 miles of Interstate 287 - from Montville, N.J., to Suffern, N.Y. - is completed in 1994.
 
No Room, So No Tunnels
Not only is there no money for new roads, they say, but acquiring land and rights-of-way in densely populated areas is nearly impossible, and new construction, in any case, would send the wrong message by encouraging driving.
''We won't build more vehicle tunnels into Manhattan, because there's no room for more vehicles in Manhattan,'' said Anthony J. Barber, the director of tunnels, bridges and terminals for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
While the road network appears frozen in place, the number of cars using it has grown drastically.
From 1981 to 1989, the number of cars registered in New York City alone rose to 2,035,000, from 1,471,000, and vehicle traffic in Manhattan increased by 18 percent. Every day, more than one million vehicles crowd into Manhattan. Most commuters across the East River are from Brooklyn and Queens, not, as many suppose, from New York suburbs.
 
Half Speed Limit Is Rare
Bridges undergoing repairs, like the George Washington and Queensboro, which carry 285,000 and 154,000 cars a day, respectively, are often so choked with traffic that roads for miles around are paralyzed.
Even on major highways, the volume of traffic is so great much of the day that cars rarely travel at even half the speed limit. On the Long Island Expressway in Queens, which is used by about 125,000 cars a day, city officials say the average afternoon speed is from 11 to 14 miles an hour.
''Even if our road system were in good repair, there still wouldn't be enough capacity,'' Mr. Barber said. ''All corridors between New York and New Jersey are already at or above capacity.''
Traffic is increasing fastest in the suburbs, where more and more people commute to jobs in other suburbs, rather than in New York City. Among the highways already jammed with such commuters are the Long Island Expressway in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, the Cross-Westchester Expressway from Port Chester to the Tappan Zee Bridge, the Connecticut Turnpike in Fairfield County and Route 1 in New Jersey between Trenton and New Brunswick.
Pat Kriss of South Salem, N.Y., who is typical of this new breed of commuter, has spent the last five years driving 80 miles a day between her home and her job in Bronxville, at opposite ends of Westchester County.
''On a good day, it takes 52 minutes one way, and on a bad one, three hours,'' she said.
That kind of commuting is spreading congestion further and further into the countryside, where there is little public transportation.
Other contributors to the congestion include the decline in mass-transit use, the growth of truck traffic and perennial problems like double parking in the city and delays at tollbooths.
Subway ridership hovered around one billion a year throughout the last decade, and fell by 3.4 percent in the first six months of this year. Bus ridership in New York City declined about 20 percent in the 1980's. After several years of growth, total ridership on the region's commuter railroads has fallen in the last few years.
 
If Just 5% Switched
Though more than 80 percent of commuters into New York City use mass transit, if just 5 percent more switched from cars to trains or buses, traffic would be significantly eased, said Mr. Riccio, the city's transportation commissioner.
Trucks, which handle more than 90 percent of the region's freight and account for about 7 percent of the vehicles traveling between New Jersey and New York City, are both a major cause and victim of traffic problems. Many of the area's older, narrower roads -with 10-foot- instead of 12-foot-wide lanes - cannot accommodate newer, larger trucks. Trucks' operating costs in New York are significantly higher than the national average, in large part because of traffic delays.
Tollbooths also cause delays that many experts say could be reduced.
''They are a medieval way of raising revenues,'' said Mark Kulewicz, a traffic engineer with the Automobile Club of New York. ''Just the normal delays to pay tolls at the Holland Tunnel or the Whitestone Bridge add up to about 100 hours a year for the average commuter.''
 
Patchwork Policy-Making
Many transportation officials say the costs of driving in congested areas should be increased to reduce traffic. Tolls and gasoline taxes, which are a fraction of those in most other countries, should be raised, and tax deductions for business-related parking expenses should be eliminated, they say.
Efforts to address the region's traffic problems - whether by repairing or building highways, encouraging mass transit, increasing rail-freight lines or discouraging driving - have been hampered by a lack of coordinated planning and policy-making among state and county governments and a host of independent agencies like the Port Authority.
There is a sense of urgency that if the region's traffic problems are not eased soon, it will pay a price in quality of life and economic competitiveness.
''If we can't keep people and goods moving,'' Mr. Barber said, ''the region strangles.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
After Silence, Japan's Army Pushes for Armed Gulf Role

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 23

 BODY:
After four decades of silence, Japan's military has openly split with some of the country's political leaders in a bitter debate over whether and how Japan should contribute forces to the Persian Gulf in what may become the military's first excursion abroad since World War II.
Because of its history as the moving force behind the rightist Government that plunged Japan into the invasions of China and Southeast Asia, and ultimately into a disastrous war against the United States, Japan's military has stayed out of virtually all political discourse since being reconstituted as the Self-Defense Forces in the 1950's.
 
'This May Be the Moment'
Since that time, the ''peace constitution'' written for Japan by the United States has been interpreted as barring the country's military forces from venturing beyond the Japanese archipelago, even as part of United Nations peacekeeping forces.
But the Iraq crisis, and demands from the United States, are driving many in the Japanese Government to put more at risk than just its money. Suddenly the country is facing the issue of whether Japan is psychologically or legally prepared to use military forces to protect its vast economic interests abroad, even in noncombat roles as part of a United Nations or international force. 
''This may be the most heated and emotional debate since the end of the war,'' said Masashi Nishihara, a professor at Japan's leading military college and an influential figure in the country's struggle to define a role that goes beyond that of economic superpower. ''It is a question that Japan has never faced squarely. But this may be the moment.''
The issue has taken on a particular urgency within the Government because it seems bound to come up later this week when Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu prepares to go the United States for a United Nations General Assembly session and a meeting with President Bush.
But just as the Prime Minister is leaving, his initial proposal - to create an unarmed, civilian ''United Nations cooperation force'' to provide behind-the-lines support to American and other forces in Saudi Arabia - has begun to collapse, under attack from opposition parties, the Japanese military establishment and even leaders of Mr. Kaifu's own party.
 
Socialists Are Opposed
The largest opposition party, the Japan Socialist Party, has never recognized the legitimacy of the Self-Defense Forces, contending that their existence is a violation of the Japanese Constitution.
The party has said it will oppose any effort to send Japanese abroad into a war zone, charging that Mr. Kaifu's ''peace cooperation team'' is simply a guise for sending military forces. Indeed, under Mr. Kaifu's original proposal many members of the team would be soldiers from the Self-Defense Forces, though the others would include police officers, firefighters and doctors. In theory, they would provide communications support, surveillance and medical treatment, but stay out of the front lines.
Because the Liberal Democrats lost control of the upper house of Parliament a year ago, the Socialists and smaller opposition groups could bottle up Mr. Kaifu's ''U.N. Cooperation Law'' for months.
Moreover, they could probably win popular support along the way. Polls show that more than 60 percent of the Japanese public opposes sending Japanese personnel to the Persian Gulf. Opposition is even higher among older Japanese, who blame the military for the chaos and ruin brought on by the war.
In conversations, many Japanese of all ages question whether the United States is being foolhardy or trigger-happy; many say they would prefer to pay more for oil than be pressed by Americans to send Japanese personnel to the gulf to protect sheikdoms.
But the bitterest criticism of Mr. Kaifu's proposal has come not from the left, or from the public, but from within the Liberal Democratic Party's own leadership. With support from the military establishment, many are arguing that Mr. Kaifu's unarmed force, without military training and discipline, would be ineffective and vulnerable to slaughter.
''It is nonsense,'' a senior officer in the Self-Defense Forces said a few days ago. ''We would be laughed at as a toy army. Frankly speaking, I think if I asked my troops to go under those conditions, many would refuse.''
 
No Longer on the Sidelines
Japan took up a similar issue once before, in 1987, when it was under pressure to send minesweepers to the gulf to rid the area of mines believed to have been planted by Iran. But the debate was far less intense, and in the end the minesweepers never left port.
Now the country fears that inaction could lead to international condemnation of Japan, which is heavily dependent on Middle East oil.
''What we are doing is wasting time,'' said Moto Shiina, a former member of Parliament and a leading defense expert. ''We have to identify our national interest in this post-cold-war era and make ourself available to our allies. The political structure, though, is not prepared to deal with it. At least not yet.'' What separates the current debate from past discussions about the scope of Japanese power is that this time the military is hardly sitting on the sidelines.
Technically, neither the uniformed officers nor the civilian heads of Japan's military have any role in debating defense policy. When Mr. Kaifu was first formulating a response to American demands for help, he pointedly kept the Defense Minister, Yozo Ishikawa, out of the meetings. But both the civilian bureaucracy and the uniformed services have deep ties to the Liberal Democratic Party, and already their efforts to head off Mr. Kaifu's hopes for a nonmilitary force are showing results.
The military has also been insisting that any personnel sent to the gulf carry sidearms, at the very least. ''It is a matter of definition,'' a senior officer in the Maritime Self-Defense Forces said. ''If you are carrying a pistol or a rifle, that is essentially unarmed. But to this country, unarmed means completely unarmed.''
The other day Mr. Ishikawa backed away from his earlier contention that Japan could do nothing, and publicly termed Mr. Kaifu's proposal a ''half-measure.'' He urged a reinterpretation of the law, which would not require parliamentary action.
On Saturday, Noboru Takeshita, the former Japanese Prime Minister and one of the governing party's most powerful figures, told reporters that the Government should push through a revision of the Self-Defense Law that would permit military personnel to be sent to the gulf, in uniform, as part of the multinational force.
Ichiro Ozawa, the secretary general of the party, split with Mr. Kaifu by arguing that it made more sense to revise Japan's Self-Defense Law and enable Japanese forces to take part in multinational peackeeping efforts rather than to draw up a new law.
That is exactly what Mr. Kaifu and Japan's Foreign Ministry have been trying to avoid for fear that any revisions of the Self-Defense Law would give Southeast Asia exactly what it is often looking for: evidence that Japan seeks a new regional role beyond its borders.
''Southeast Asian countries, which suffered during World War II, have shown a serious interest in this issue,'' warned Taro Nakayama, Japan's Foreign Minister. ''It is extremely important to draw up a flawless bill.''
Even in Japan there is an unspoken fear that someday the Japanese military could once again spin out of control, and that it is unwise to set a precedent for overseas ventures. It is a fear that some Japanese say the country must finally get over.
''What is the use of elections, of a democracy, if you do not think it will enable you to control the country's policy?'' Mr. Shiina asked.
The issue is ambiguous enough, however, that the one country with the biggest stake in the outcome - the United States - is remaining silent. The constitutional ban on offensive forces was formulated by Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur, who commanded the American occupation of Japan. Now it is the United States that, warily, is seeking greater help from Japan.
''It is something for the Japanese to decide,'' a senior American diplomat here said the other day. ''I can't imagine that if the United States took a position it would do anything than make things worse.''

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
With Its Huge Banks Weakening, Japan Cuts Lending to the World

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 23

 BODY:
At Japan's powerful banks, which in recent years have served as financiers to the world, profits are tumbling and a global investment spree is slowing.
The Persian Gulf crisis has hit the Tokyo financial markets hard, sending stock prices plummeting and interest rates climbing. The stock market, which also had a tumble several months ago, is now down 39 percent this year, making an already difficult time for the Japanese banks even grimmer. 
In the last decade, the seemingly limitless flow of Japanese capital has been vital for everything from financing the United States' yawning budget deficits to aiding developing nations. Japanese banks - 8 of the world's 10 largest - have been the principal intermediaries for this flood of money. Now they are tightening the spigots. Taizo Hashida, chairman of Japan's leading bankers' association and president of Fuji Bank, the third largest in Japan and the world, predicted last week that Japanese banks would put ''severe'' limits on their lending. Experts expect that to put upward pressure on interest rates in the United States and the developing world, The move comes as world monetary officials appear to be adjusting to an era of higher interest rates. Finance ministers gathering for meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington endorsed a strategy over the weekend to maintain tight monetary polices. [Page D1.] And in the United States, Federal Reserve Board officials are trying to freeze interest rates in view of the risk of recession. [Page D1.] The impact of the Japanese move is likely to be felt first overseas, where Japan's banks have marketed their services aggressively. The banks are likely to move away from high-volume, low-profit-margin businesses aimed at building market share, toward more profitable but potentially risky operations that rely on market savvy, in which they have little experience.
More than anything, the banks' problems demonstrate how dependent they had become on inflated Japanese stock prices to fuel their spectacular growth. The difficulties are also likely to make painfully clear how dependent the American capital markets have become on inflows of Japanese capital.
''The bubble period is over,'' said Yoh Kurosawa, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, a powerhouse here. ''We have to face reality.''
Because of the stock market's steep slide, banks are suddenly having trouble meeting new international standards for bank capital. Bankers here have begun suggesting that Japan may seek to postpone the deadline set for the new rules fully to take effect in March 1993. That is a potentially explosive issue.
The guidelines, enacted by the Bank for International Settlements, which is based in Switzerland and is a central bank for central banks, require commercial banks to maintain capital equal to 8 percent or more of their assets as a cushion against financial difficulties.
Just a year ago it appeared the booming Japanese banks would have no difficulties meeting the standard. Now they are facing the prospect of having to shrink to make the minimum or paying steep rates for the fresh capital they need to grow.
In Japan, unlike in America, banks are allowed to build up huge stock portfolios by acquiring up to 5 percent of industrial and other concerns. They can also count 45 percent of the value of those stocks as capital.
 
Shrinking Capital Levels
When the Tokyo market was soaring, the banks' capital received a fillip. But when the market fell sharply, their capital levels shrank. And with stock prices sliding, the Japanese banks are also no longer able to raise capital by issuing shares as they had before; in the previous two years, they raised more than $60 billion in capital by selling securities.
Making matters worse, about half the profits earned by Japanese banks in recent years came not from lending money, but from selling some of the shares held in their swollen stock portfolios.
''In the late 1980's, it was like the Japanese banks were on steroids,'' said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist here for Deutsche Bank.
The downturn in the Tokyo market also comes at a time when the banks' traditional business of lending to companies is being eroded. Japanese corporations have grown so wealthy that they do not need large bank borrowings; when they do want capital, they generally go to the securities markets.
 
Unprofitable Core Lending
''The core lending business of Japanese banks is simply not profitable any more,'' said Robert Zielinski, a senior analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities. ''The stock market was a kind of drug they lived off of. They have now been cut off from their opium.''
Real estate lending, especially in Tokyo, was another booming business for Japanese banks in recent years. But the steep increases in interest rates are threatening to undermine the property market, on which tens of billions of dollars of bank loans rest.
Although few people are expecting a sudden huge decline in property values, a drop of 10 to 15 percent a year for several years could reduce bank profits significantly, analysts say. Moody's Investors Service has lowered the credit ratings of two major banks and said it is reviewing the ratings of three other banks, largely because of concerns over the property market.
 
Weakened Balance Sheets
To be sure, Japanese banks are likely to remain big and tough internationally. They are, however, facing the challenge of an emerging European market and a downtrend in the United States at a time when their balance sheets are in a weakened state.
At this stage, Government officials have said there is no effort to ease the Bank for International Settlement capital rules. Some economists said any such move would be a mistake because it would erode the credibility of the international organization. Clearly, some banks - most of which have now slipped under the 8 percent capital minimum - are using the squeeze as an excuse to argue away the bothersome new guidelines rather than bite the bullet and shrink.
Easing the rules is an enticing notion not only for Japan. American officials, threatened with a slowdown of Japanese capital investment just as the country slips toward a recession, might also find a postponement worth considering to avoid a painful credit shortage in the United States.
 
Delay Would Be Welcome
Several Japanese bankers said that no matter who initiated such a move, they would welcome a postponement of the 8 percent capital standard.
''From the beginning, I had some doubts about it,'' said Mr. Kurosawa of the Industrial Bank of Japan, echoing comments made privately by several other leading bankers here.
Mr. Kurosawa said his bank would not cut back on its lending in the United States, but he made clear it would examine lending proposals with a more critical eye. For instance, he contended the capital rules were behind the reluctance of Japanese banks to provide more capital to finance the tunnel under the English Channel between England and France.
An official at the Bank of Tokyo, which has extensive operations in the United States, said it would not be pulling back but that the combination of the weaker American economy and the capital shortage would certainly slow the bank's overseas growth.
''It's not such an easy market in the United States to expand in today,'' said Masaharu Hamakawa, deputy general manager of the planning department at the Bank of Tokyo. ''It's getting harder and harder.''
''This is a testing time,'' he added. ''It's going to take a little time to adjust.''
 
Looking to Europe and Asia
With the American economy sliding and Japanese bank loans there souring, they are looking more to Europe and Asia for expansion.
The Bank of Tokyo, for instance, is about to form a division for new financial products, including swaps, futures and options. There is subsantial risk in this business, but margins tend to be higher. The Industrial Bank of Japan has just formed a merger advisory subsidiary on Wall Street.
Moving into these businesses is much easier said than done, of course.
''Each of these businesses has its own risks and they are a lot more complicated than traditional lending activities,'' said Mr. Courtis of Deutsche Bank. ''Also, the insurance companies here also want to move into some of these businesses, like asset management, so the competition is going to be much keener than anything they've experienced before.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Executives Get Solace and Aid In Support Groups

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DARIEN, Conn., Sept. 20

 BODY:
One by one, in a brightly lighted church annex, they introduced themselves: corporate lawyers, controllers, marketing executives, commercial bankers, all from the secure suburbs of Fairfield County and all ''in transition,'' the current euphemism for being out of work.
''I'm Richard Taylor,'' announced a former director of marketing, neatly dressed in wide-wale corduroys and a crew-neck sweater. ''My company folded its New York operation two months ago. I'm 34. I have a wife and two kids. I started off on a real high, but then I crashed.''
Gatherings like these may well become the support groups of the 1990's. Books with titles like ''Fired for Success'' and ''Rites of Passage at $100,000+'' were passed around. Advice on getting through to the person with hiring power was plentiful. And men and women were told to find strength in the ''four F's'': faith, family, fitness and friends. 
After a decade in which corporations cut away at middle management and mergers and acquisitions eliminated entire layers of executives, thousands of administrators, professionals, executives and managers in the New York region are rolling out of bed in the morning with no place to go.
With such large numbers of once high-powered people out of work, many of the unemployed and those who counsel them say there is less stigma to being jobless today. At the same time the fact that so many are on the sidelines has prompted hundreds to turn to unusually open forums in support groups, like the one here, both to help one another in their job searches and with emotional stress.
The loss of a blue-collar job is no less traumatic, of course. But the public nature of plant closings and union backing have tended to make those layoffs shared experiences. Now, with white-collar unemployment burgeoning, the once private pain of the jobless executive has also turned public.
Today's ranks of unemployed professionals are caught in a double bind, searching for work at a time when a shaky economy has cast their own financial well-being in doubt and when many corporations, to save money, are choosing not to fill available positions. ''The jobs go poof, so there are more people looking for fewer opportunities,'' said Robert J. Graham, a senior vice president and general manager of the Stamford office of Drake Beam Morin Inc., an executive job placement concern.
 
Northeast Badly Hurt
The employment outlook in the Northeast is more dismal than anywhere else in the country, the United States Department of Labor says, with New York, Connecticut and New Jersey all ranking in the bottom 10 states in terms of job growth.
Cutbacks have affected every suburban area around New York City, as well as the city itself. Some jobless professionals enjoy a safety net of considerable savings to keep their households afloat during a potentially long hunt. But many find themselves in a race against time as their six months of severance pay or unemployment benefits are used up.
Even in two-career families the loss of a job can be devastating. Lyn Carlton of South Plainfield, N.J., was laid off last March from the First Fidelity Bank, where she was paid $56,200 as a vice president in project and systems support. Her 26 weeks of severance pay ended Sept. 6, and now, with no job prospects in sight after 200 resumes and six interviews, she and her husband are making contingency plans.
''My salary was 60 percent of the household income,'' said Mrs. Carlton, 44, the mother of a 4-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy. ''This was not for luxuries and ballet classes. This was for mortgage payments and car payments and the necessities of life. Unfortunately we were terrible savers, so we have no cushion.
 
Willing to Take Half Pay
''At this point, I'd take an administrative assistant position at half of what I was making,'' she said, adding that she and her husband were also trying to change the variable rate on their home equity loan to a fixed rate as a hedge against a worsening economy.
Many executives say that in today's tight job market the process of interviewing has slowed to a crawl. John J. Troy, 45, of Stamford, lost his job as a senior vice president and regional manager at the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company in January. He was interviewed for the president's post at one bank in March and didn't return for a second interview until this month. He is still waiting to hear. ''Employers are reacting to the economy, so everything has become drawn out,'' said Mr. Troy, sitting in a mini-office for use by unemployed executives at Drake Beam Morin in Stamford. ''Whereas before they'd make their decision in six to eight weeks, now it takes them three to four months. They're asking themselves whether they can do without this position or if they can fill it with someone part-time.''
If anything can assauge the frustrations and fears felt by unemployed executives, it is comfort in numbers. Daylong job search seminars sponsored by the Roman Catholice Diocese of Bridgeport have drawn hundreds of people. And support groups have sprung up in affluent suburbs like Rye, N.Y., and Greenwich and Ridgefield in Connecticut, a sign that, for many, being out of work does not carry a sense of shame or personal responsibility.
 
'Cutting Back to the Bone'
''Companies used to think there was something wrong with the unemployed person we'd present to them,'' said Robert Larson of Berman & Larson Associates in Paramus, N.J., a computer industry headhunter. ''But there's no longer a stigma. It used to be that companies would lay off the fat, but now they are cutting back to the bone.''
At St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church in Darien, Joseph Davis, a parishioner and founder of the monthly support group, holds a good-paying, rewarding job as the managing director and executive vice president of a health-care advertising agency in Manhattan. But he remembers how frightening it was several years ago when he twice found himself out of work, once for eight months and the next time for six months.
''When you're in transition, you really feel like you're out there by yourself, and we're trying to encourage the idea that you're not isolated, that you're part of a community and there's help,'' said Mr. Davis, an affable moderator who strikes a balance between the emotional and the practical.
Ranging in age from 34 to 63 and sporting everything from top siders to wing tips, blue jeans to khaki suits, the 17 men and one woman sat in a circle here and alternately commiserated and coaxed one another.
 
Two Minutes to Score
They practiced their ''two-minute drills,'' concise sales pitches combining personal history and business skills to kick off an interview or a networking session. ''If you fumble the first two minutes, it's hard to recover,'' Mr. Davis said. ''You have to rehearse the first two minutes like you're an actor on Broadway. Be ready to spring into this at any moment - on the train, on the plane.''
They learned to think in terms of short-term goals, such as obtaining an interview rather than the job itself. ''Otherwise you've got a zillion defeats and one victory,'' one participant said.
And they were drilled in the importance of maintaining a positive self-image, with living proof of its effectiveness in Brad Hughes, a former support group member who returned Thursday night to give a pep talk. After scouring the area for a job for eight months, Mr. Hughes, 49, of New Canaan, was hired last month by Warner Computer Systems Inc. in Fair Lawn, N.J., as vice president for finance and administration.
 
Accenting 'Little Things'
''I paid attention to a lot of little things,'' he explained. ''I used engraved stationery. I lost 30 pounds. I shined my shoes once a day. I had a haircut every week. If you know you're looking your best and feeling your best, it helps put you in an up mood.''

HEADLINE: El Salvador Chief Lobbying to Stop U.S. Aid Cuts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador begins an intensive three-day lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill on Monday in an effort to thwart legislation that would cut United States military aid to his country by 50 percent next year.
Salvadoran diplomats here said Mr. Cristiani would try to meet with as many as 60 Senators and members of the House panel that has been investigating the slaying of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador last November.
If Mr. Cristiani fails, the Salvadoran Ambassador, Miguel A. Salaverria, said the lawmakers could inadvertently encourage leftist rebels to abandon negotiations and begin a military offensive.
An influential Salvadoran Army officer, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, agreed. ''President Cristiani knows a cut in aid might be inevitable,'' the officer said, ''but he wants them to know what they are doing. And maybe then they won't do it.'' 
The six Jesuits were among the leading critics of the Government in Salvadoran intellectual circles. They, their housekeeper and her daughter were killed in their university quarters by gunmen. An army colonel and seven lower-ranking soldiers were arrested in January, but judiciary officials have complained that tampering with evidence by the army has hindered prosecution of the case and investigation into whether the slayings were ordered by higher military officers.
 
Movement to Cut Aid
The slayings mobilized the strongest movement in Congress to cut military aid to El Salvador since the early 1980's. The House has already passed a bill to withhold 50 percent of the $85 million in military aid that the Bush Administration had proposed to send El Salvador next year, and the Senate is about to consider similar legislation.
More than $4 billion in economic and military support and hundreds of military advisers have been sent to El Salvador since 1980, and many Democrats and Republicans in Congress question whether the largest American investment in a counterinsurgency campaign since the Vietnam War has been worthwhile. While they grant that the Bush Administration has made a stronger pitch for human rights there than did the Reagan Administration, they complain that a corrupt and violent military still dominates the civilian Government.
Some members of Congress argue that Mr. Cristiani is a worthy politician but lacks the power to change his country.
''It's not enough for him to say he's going to try and do this and try and do that,'' said Representative Joe Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Rules Committee. ''The members want to see results.''
 
'His English Is Perfect'
The argument for cutting back the United States commitment to El Salvador has been strengthened by the realization that with the cold war over, the threat of Soviet expansion in Central America has diminished, no matter who wins the Salvadoran civil war.
''A lot of people think El Salvador is a tar baby and it's time to say goodbye,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who is chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, which early next month will consider a bill to cut aid to the country. But Mr. Leahy added: ''Cristiani could have an effect on some votes. People like him and think he's trying. His English is perfect, too, and that helps.''
Bernard W. Aronson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, has privately agreed that the Administration would accept some cuts in military aid - up to 30 percent - as long as Congress gave President Bush more discretion over the aid. Seeking to forge a bipartisan policy on El Salvador, Mr. Aronson has proposed that military assistance be channeled through President Cristiani rather than directly to the armed forces.
During his stay in Washington, Mr. Cristiani will also meet with Vice President Dan Quayle. He will confer with President Bush in New York next week.

HEADLINE: De Klerk Arrives in the U.S. for Talks With Bush

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa, citing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as an inspiration for the changes he has begun in his own country, arrived in Washington today for talks with President Bush.
After four decades in which Washington has kept South Africa at arm's length because of apartheid, Mr. de Klerk stepped off his South African Airways jet into a red-carpet reception at Andrews Air Force Base.
Mr. de Klerk, who was invited to Washington in February by President Bush after he released the black South African leader, Nelson Mandela, from prison and began negotiations to end white minority rule, clearly relished the moment.
''I am deeply aware of the historical importance of this visit,'' Mr. de Klerk said to the Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Herman J. Cohen, who headed the American welcoming party. ''South Africa has embarked on a great journey. It is a journey towards full democracy at home and abroad, full participation in the family of nations. It is a journey that I sincerely believe will bring the fruits of both justice and economic well-being to every South African family.'' 
 
Anti-Apartheid Sanctions
''In a few moments, we will begin our visit to Washington at the Reflecting Pool,'' said Mr. de Klerk, referring to the ceremony where he was formally welcomed by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. ''It is there where the reflections of the great monuments to Washington and Lincoln come together. And it was there that many thousands of Americans heard the Rev. Martin Luther King describe his dream for an America of justice and harmony through nonviolence.
When Mr.de Klerk referred to the ''family of nations,'' it was no idle oratorical flourish. To be welcomed at the White House on Monday, with the South African flag waving next to the Stars and Stripes, will be for him and other white South Africans the ultimate sign that their country is finally breaking out of its pariah status.
It was striking that moments after Mr. de Klerk's plane landed, almost all of the South African Airways flight attendants gathered around one of the United States Marine honor guards and asked him to pose for a picture with them next to the aircraft, which he gladly did. The flight was the airline's first to land in the United States since Congress banned air links with South Africa as part of the 1986 anti-apartheid sanctions.
Although the small official welcoming party that met Mr. de Klerk was in marked contrast to the tumultuous tickertape parades that greeted his negotiating partner, Mr. Mandela, the African National Congress leader, last June, it did not diminish the South African leader's evident satisfaction. He is the first South African head of Government to visit the United States since 1945.
 
'With Charity for All'
''The words and deeds of Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Dr. King still ring out to us all,'' continued Mr. de Klerk, 54, who at the time of Dr. King's civil rights activities in the 1960's was an enthusiastic advocate of apartheid. ''Inscribed in stone above Lincoln's statue are the great words, 'With malice towards none, with charity for all, let us do all which may achieve a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.' These are words which also describe our efforts today in South Africa.''
Mr. de Klerk's reference to Dr. King and his famous 1963 speech, one of the most inspiring of the civil rights movement, was seen as offensive by some American black leaders.
Randall Robinson, executive director of the African-American lobby TransAfrica, argued that Dr. King ''died in a lifelong effort to perfect American democracy,'' while ''South African blacks are fighting to establish the very essentials of a democratic system against a white minority, including de Klerk, that has insisted on retention of its privileges.''
Mr. de Klerk was closeted with his aides much of the day and dined this evening with Vice President Dan Quayle. Monday morning, he will meet with Mr. Bush. After a working lunch at the White House, the South African President will go to the State Department for talks with Mr. Baker. On Tuesday he will deliver an address at the National Press Club and also meet with Congressional leaders.
 
A New Constitution
During his talks in Washington, the South African leader is expected to receive mixed messages from the White House and Congress.
Administration officials say he will hear praise for his bold decision to release political prisoners in return for the suspension of armed struggle by the African National Congress, and for his decision to begin talks with Mr. Mandela on how to draft a new constitution to govern a post-apartheid South Africa.
The Bush Administration wants to heap enough praise on Mr. de Klerk to encourage him to keep moving forward and give him something to point to when his rightist white critics ask what, if anything, his reforms have gained for South Africa abroad.
But this praise, Administration officials say, will be tempered by admonitions that the African leader still has not gone far enough in his reforms to justify a lifting of sanctions by Washington.
Mr. de Klerk, officials added, will also be questioned about how he plans to contain the factional violence in South Africa's black townships, which threatens to undermine the constitutional negotiations. Many black leaders have accused the South African police and right-wing organizations of instigating some of that violence, which has led to more than 1,700 deaths this year.
 
'A Sad and Tragic Situation'
These and other issues explain why not everyone in Congress welcomes the de Klerk visit. TransAfrica is planning a demonstration across from the White House while Mr. de Klerk is in the Oval Office. And on Saturday the Congressional Black Caucus announced that it was canceling a scheduled meeting with Mr. de Klerk.
Mr. Robinson, of TransAfrica, said he had encouraged the cancellation because of his group's feeling that the de Klerk visit is nothing more than a ''superficial photo opportunity, staged with the assistance of President Bush, to put a smiling face on a sad and tragic situation.''
The American public, Mr. Robinson said, ''must be reminded that the major pillars of apartheid remain firmly in place in South Africa.''
A senior Administration official briefing reporters at the White House before Mr. de Klerk's arrival said, ''We recognize, as will this visit, that President de Klerk has played a major role in bringing changes about.''
The Administration official said, though, that he was certain that Mr. de Klerk was under no illusion that the sanctions against South Africa, embodied in the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, would be lifted.
''The United States has specific legislation relating to sanctions, and those cannot be relaxed until such time as certain conditions in the law are met,'' the official said. ''And he understands, as do we all, that those conditions have not yet been met.''

HEADLINE: Khrushchev Memoir Tells of Castro Plea For Attack on U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Fidel Castro urged the Soviet Union to attack the United States in 1962 because he feared an American invasion of Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis, Nikita S. Khrushchev said in portions of his memoirs published today.
The new excerpts, in Time magazine, include material deemed by Khrushchev's relatives and friends to be too incendiary or delicate for publication in the two volumes of memoirs printed in the United States in 1970 and 1974.
Khrushchev seems to confirm a longstanding rumor about the missile crisis. He quotes the Cuban leader as saying in 1962 that the Kremlin ''should launch a pre-emptive strike against the U.S.'' to prevent destruction of the Soviet missiles in Cuba. 
''Castro was hotheaded,'' Khrushchev says. Mr. Castro ''totally failed to understand'' that Soviet missiles had been placed in Cuba to deter an American attack, not to attack the United States, he said.
 
'The 'Missing Tapes'
Khrushchev's account may appear somewhat self-serving. But experts on Soviet affairs say it is plausible.
The third volume of Khrushchev's memoirs, based on tapes dictated from 1965 until his death in 1971, is to be published next month by Little, Brown & Company. The ''missing tapes,'' as Time calls them, were translated by Jerrold L. Schecter, former diplomatic editor of Time magazine, and Vyacheslav Luchkov, a Soviet affairs expert.
In the Time excerpts, Khrushchev bluntly acknowledges political and economic failures of the Soviet system. He says the Kremlin should not be afraid to let its citizens leave their country.
In the latest memoirs, Khrushchev says that Stalin made ''a very secret approach to Hitler'' with peace overtures in World War II.
''I think it was in 1942,'' Khrushchev says. ''Stalin wanted to reach an agreement that would let the Germans keep the territory they occupied in the Ukraine, Byelorussia and even certain areas of the Russian federation. One of our people was sent to Bulgaria and instructed to inform a German contact there that the Soviet Union was willing to make some territorial concessions.''
''There was never any answer from Hitler,'' Khrushchev says. ''Apparently, he felt the Soviet Union's days were numbered.''
Stalin could say he was just stalling so he could build up Soviet forces and eventually win back what he had given away, Krushchev wrote. ''But to gain time at the cost of such concessions!''
Khrushchev also says that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed in 1953 after being convicted of conspiring to pass American atomic secrets to the Soviets, provided ''very significant help in accelerating the production of our atom bomb.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: Strains of Gulf Crisis;
Sharp Questioning by Congress Comes Amid Jockeying Among Bush Officials

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
After seven smooth weeks of handling the Persian Gulf crisis, the White House is fumbling several critical gulf issues on Capitol Hill and finds itself grappling with internal tensions that strain its vaunted air of collegiality.
Administration officials admit privately that they were taken aback by the sharpness of the Congressional questioning on why the Reagan and Bush Administrations supplied the military and economic aid that helped Saddam Hussein establish himself as a regional strongman.
They are nervous about continued Congressional investigation into whether the Administration misread signals in late July that Mr. Hussein was set to invade Kuwait. And both White House officials and Congressional Republicans say that while overall support for the Persian Gulf policy is strong, lawmakers' questioning of individual aspects is likely to grow.
By their own admission, Administration officials were unprepared for the extent to which Congress would rake through their Iraq policy. 
''We got lulled by the fact that the crisis management by Bush and the whole team was so good and Congress was away for most of the time,'' a senior official said. ''We didn't realize that once the novelty and the early tendency to rally behind the President wore off, it would become politics as usual.''
 
Grumbling Over Arms Sale Plan
Taken together, the events of the last week have forcefully reminded Mr. Bush that political support for military operations can drain away quickly, threatening both the political vitality of a President and the comity among his main advisers.
White House officials have started to privately accuse the State Department of trying to steal credit for the response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, while grumbling about the Pentagon's handling of a proposed $21 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called the proposed sale ''a gross miscalculation of Congress.''
The Congressional criticism of previous policy toward Iraq has also focused an unaccustomed and uncomfortable glare on the State Department and, by implication, the Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d. Lawmakers have so far not directly blamed him, but the crisis is testing Mr. Baker's widely envied political skills.
Last week, it produced the unusual spectacle of the Secretary and his staff hunkering down in Foggy Bottom while a new lineup of ''golden boys'' - notably Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Brent Scowcroft, the National Security Adviser - stepped forward. Mr. Baker broke his public silence with a television appearance today in which he evaded the central questions: Was American policy before the invasion misguided and was he responsible?
And, while Mr. Bush works to maintain Congressional support for his Gulf policy, Administration officials have started complaining - very quietly -about lawmakers who backed American overtures to Mr. Hussein and made their own missions to Baghdad, including a group led by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader.
''You don't see any of those guys coming out to remind people about it now,'' a senior official said with evident pique. Harbinger or Temporary Bump? While these tensions have come into sharp focus in the last week, lawmakers and Administration officials said they were probably just a temporary bump. But some worried that they might be a harbinger of deeper trouble.
''These do not represent an insurmountable problem if events work out with regard to the possible conflict with Iraq,'' said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ''If events do not work out, it's the tip of the iceberg.''
Perhaps the most dramatic setback for the Administration came in the Congressional examination of its overtures toward Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait, particularly the now-famous conversation on July 25 in which the American Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, told Mr. Hussein that the United States did not want to be involved in Iraq's border dispute with Kuwait.
Mr. Baker and his staff were clearly unprepared for the uproar, and the Secretary, who is widely believed to have Presidential ambitions but who has taken an unusually low profile at other times in the crisis, became less visible again last week until his television appearances today.
There is no doubt that Mr. Baker is still a commanding presence. In a revealing private moment, he strode out of a National Security Council meeting on Thursday at the head of the pack of Mr. Bush's top advisers and led them across the West Wing lobby for a follow-up meeting.
 
'You Bet' Baker's Involved
But appearances are critical in Washington. And before Mr. Baker reappeared today on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' his spokeswoman and loyal aide, Margaret D. Tutwiler, found herself in an extremely odd position - assuring reporters that her powerful boss, the President's best friend, was still engaged in the most critical foreign policy issue on the agenda.
''Is he involved in - continuously involved in - the gulf crisis?'' she said testily. ''You bet he is.''
There are signs of real, if subtle, shifts within the Administration. By virtue of their natural roles in this crisis, Mr. Scowcroft, Mr. Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have formed a new axis of power in the White House.
The last week has displayed a marked difference in the operating styles of Mr. Cheney and Mr. Baker.
After the Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Michael J. Dugan, talked to reporters about contingency war plans, Mr. Cheney had him cleaning out his desk within 24 hours.
At the State Department, Ms. Glaspie and John Kelly, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs, have been left to take the brunt of the criticism of United States policy toward Iraq from members of Congress without their boss offering much of a public defense or putting them out of their misery by moving them to other jobs.
Today, during ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Baker cited not his own view, but a newspaper article about the issue. He spoke of ''some 20-20 hindsighting'' that he said has ''been highly critical of some career public servants.'' But he refused to say whether the criticism was justified or whether it should be directed at him and not Mr. Kelly and Ms. Glaspie.
 
Criticism of Cheney
Mr. Baker also sidestepped a question about how he now viewed the pre-invasion policy. ''The President has said in hindsight, maybe there were some things we should have done differently,'' he said. Mr. Baker paused and added, ''I agree with that of course.''
An Administration official said: ''Kelly and Glaspie are twisting in the wind. But what can Baker do, since they were clearly just following Department policy?''
While Mr. Cheney's image has been polished by his overall handling of the gulf crisis, he has come in for some internal criticism, officials said.
The firing of General Dugan was widely supported, but there was concern that it left the impression of ''not so tight a ship,'' an official said.
Lawmakers and Administration officials said Mr. Cheney also mishandled the arms sale to Saudi Arabia, the size of which circulated among reporters before Congress or Israel were consulted. The White House was later forced to back down and seek Congressional approval of the sale in two separate phases. And the Pentagon stirred trouble with a suggestion that the Administration spend billions of dollars in foreign contributions to the gulf operation without Congressional supervision.

HEADLINE: Dole Hints at Willingness to Alter Income Tax Rate in a Budget Deal

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
In the first public hint that Republican opposition to income tax rate increases may be cracking, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas said today that budget negotiators were looking at ways to raise taxes for wealthy Americans that would ''pierce the so-called bubble.''
His reference was to an anomaly in the tax system under which married couples with incomes of $78,400 to $185,730 pay a tax rate of 33 percent on their last dollar of income, while married couples with incomes of more than $185,730 pay a 28 percent rate on their last dollar of income.
Although Republican negotiators have tentatively accepted other types of tax increases, like increases in excise taxes, and have discussed a variety of possibilities for increasing the tax burden on the wealthy, they have been adamant in opposing an actual increase in income tax rates.
The comments of Mr. Dole, the leader of the Senate's Republican minority, came in a television interview several hours before Administration officials and the top five Congressional leaders resumed budget negotiations late today amid signs of increasing friction between the White House and Congressional Republicans over how to reach a deficit cutting deal. 
 
Critical Deadline in a Week
If no agreement is reached by Oct. 1, just a week away, automatic spending cuts totaling $85 billion will be imposed on a wide array of domestic and military programs, forcing layoffs of thousands of Federal workers and affecting vital services like air traffic control.
There are also signs of division in the Administration on strategy, with some advisers recommending that President Bush allow the automatic spending cuts to take effect so as to force a budget agreement.
''It may be the only thing that will focus the attention of Congress,'' said one Administration official.
Other advisers had recommended that Mr. Bush personally step into the negotiations to hasten a compromise, and officials said he may become more directly involved early this week.
The negotiators have been deadlocked over Republican insistence on a cut in the capital gains tax rate, which President Bush says is needed to stimulate the weak economy. Democrats are equally adamant that they will not accept such a cut unless it is accompanied by tax increases on the wealthy taxpayers who would be the primary beneficiaries of the reduction.
Democrats have long maintained that they could accept a reduction in the capital gains rate if the ''tax bubble'' were eliminated by increasing the highest income tax rate for the wealthy.
 
Seeking Republican Votes
Mr. Dole said today that the White House insistence on the capital gains tax cut arose largely from concern about winning enough votes from House Republicans to pass a budget package. ''We've got to have enough votes,'' Mr. Dole said. ''That's why the White House is so concerned about the capital gains issue, in my view. In addition, it's a promise that President Bush made in the campaign.''
The Senator spoke on the CBS News television program ''Face The Nation,'' where he appeared with the Senate Democratic majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine. After agreeing with Mr. Mitchell's assessment that capital gains and the whole issue of tax fairness had become the major sticking points in the budget talks, Mr. Dole said the negotiators were trying to address the fairness question.
''We're looking at ways to achieve what the majority leader suggests,'' he said, ''and that is, how we can increase taxes on upper income in a way that will, in effect, maybe pierce this so-called bubble, but maybe not go clear up to 33 percent.''
 
Criticism of Dole Expected
Administration officials said Mr. Dole appeared to be speaking for himself. But in discussions before the formal talks between Congress and the White House, the White House Budget Director, Richard G. Darman, had floated the idea of raising the top tax rate for the wealthy to 31 percent.
Mr. Dole was not available to elaborate on his comments today, but his suggestion is likely to provoke strong criticism from rank and file House Republicans, many of whom have signed a letter saying they will block any budget package that touches tax rates.
Mr. Dole has already incurred the wrath of the White House and conservative House Republicans with his suggestion last week that budget negotiators sever the capital gains cut from the deficit reduction package.
Mr. Mitchell said Democrats would be prepared to consider that suggestion but that the Administration seemed to have ruled it out.
''If this were a negotiation just among the members of Congress, that is the Congressional leadership, we could have had an agreement a couple of weeks ago,'' Mr. Mitchell said.

HEADLINE: Canada Has Created Model Health System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a physician who has trained and practiced in both Canada and the United States, I can attest to the superiority of the Canadian medical system and its feasibility here. It is an efficiently administered plan in an immense country that also has a large underclass, and it results in better health for the average person. 
It produces greater consumer satisfaction than the system of any other country in the industrial world, in contrast to substantial and growing dissatisfaction in the United States. All this with a smaller share of the gross national product devoted to health in a country less wealthy than the United States.
Yes, the system has flaws. Democratically elected governments underfinance hospitals in some provinces, preferring to use tax dollars elsewhere. Some people have to wait for nonurgent surgery. Governments tend to skimp on the latest high-tech machinery, but no more than Canada's equally cautious private sector. Pressures north of the border are similar: an aging population, high public expectations, a proliferation of expensive procedures.
According to an analysis in the August Consumer Reports, balancing health-care premiums, co-payments and deductibles against the increased taxes to match the system in the United States, the average family would come out approximately even. This is before computing the value of time lost in filling out forms, paying bills and communicating (usually arguing) with providers.
I have met only three types of Americans, who, given the facts, prefer this country's nonsystem: doctors, employees of the health insurance industry and the politicians who receive contributions from the other two.

HEADLINE: Soviet Union Needs Modernized Banking

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Economic and social deterioration in the Soviet Union (''The Bread Shelves in Moscow Shops Suddenly Go Bare,'' front page, Sept. 4) threatens the best opportunity that country's talented and dynamic peoples have ever had to become democratic masters of their own destiny. Time is not on their side. The assistance that outsiders can offer the Soviets may be of profound importance.
A model for such assistance is a continuing program of the American Bar Association, with seminal support from the Soros Foundation, for training Soviet lawyers in the United States. This program has enjoyed signal success thus far.
The bar's nonnegotiable criteria for the program - consideration only of candidates with high competence in English and selection entirely by the American hosts - insure well-prepared Soviet participants of integrity and spunk.
A modernized banking system will be central to Soviet economic achievement. The 500-day plan that was unveiled Sept. 3 at a meeting of the Russian Parliament and intended to bring radical economic reform, now has the joint support of the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian republic. It puts banking high on the list for action in the critical first 100 days.
Would the Soviets welcome American assistance in establishing the legal and regulatory structures for their new banking system and in developing appropriate domestic and international banking institutions and procedures and training?
Representatives of the American Bankers Association and the American Bar Association and others are beginning to explore those questions together. Their efforts deserve broad support from their members and other bankers and lawyers, from schools of business and law and government, and others - in the interest of the United States as much as the Soviet Union.

Shanghai Breezes

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
On a foggy morning about a dozen years ago, passengers on a flying jalopy were told that Beijing was socked in and the pilot had been diverted to Shanghai. We landed at a deserted airfield; no planes were expected at Shanghai that morning, and nobody on the ground quite knew what to do with a planeload of transients. Hungry and disconsolate, we sat in a barren waiting room, a handful of Westerners stranded in a Communist wasteland.
Then an aged, bent Chinese woman, muttering to herself, came bustling onto the dreary scene with a large tray holding bowls of noodles. Not your ordinary noodles, but a wondrous Shanghai breakfast with chunks of chicken and an exotic green vegetable in a broth dominated by wide, slippery, handmade noodles. 
I can taste that magic bowl of noodles today, in my mind's tastebuds, as I overlook a city of 13 million from the 37th floor of the Shanghai Hilton, having just ordered a waffle with Vermont maple syrup for breakfast, while watching a live satellite telecast of the ''NBC Nightly News.''
Tourist China ain't the same. In the 70's, you could count on unrelieved mustiness, uncomprehending telephone operators and stark white dining rooms with Western guests strictly segregated; drains in the bathrooms were plugged by rubber stoppers attached to rusty chains, and only your shortwave radio kept you in touch with the outside world. The visitor's life was uncomfortable in many ways, but the feeling was gloriously foreign.
Today, the momentum of the economic open door of the 80's is carrying China's major cities into the 21st century. High-rise hotel and convention complexes create new skylines. The mustiness has been replaced by the smell of metal polish, because proud new managers of these half-occupied glass and chrome palaces live in terror of tarnish; the well-trained young help eagerly and courteously address even Japanese visitors in English. They all want to make you feel at home, as if home were not the place you wanted to get away from.
Some things have not changed: off the tourist track, the real China exists in all its bravery and squalor. Outside the travelers' cocoon, the dead hand of Communism stifles dissent just as it did in the 70's.
But the sense of repression is not the same everywhere. Let's use two contrasting cities to illustrate the forces going head to head in China today.
Shanghai is to Beijing as New York is to Washington: bigger, more colorful and cosmopolitan, its people more outspoken and sassy, resentful at having to pay taxes to prettify the parasitic capital but warily respectful of its greater power.
Shanghai is a real city, unplanned, with traffic-clogged narrow streets and no state security goons tailing resident foreign reporters; Beijing is laid out to rule, majestic in its wide boulevards, conscious of history in the Forbidden City and Tiananmen, the national center of control and corruption. Political Beijing hustles; businesslike Shanghai bustles.
Beijing, permeated by a fear of chaos if a billion people break loose, represents the stiff spirit of order. Shanghai, which did not shoot its protesters last summer and does not join in the jamming of the Voice of America today, stands for the spirit of enterprise that flourishes in a freer atmosphere.
We cannot carry this analogy too far; Shanghai was the hotbed of Maoist radicalism that was defeated by Dengist reformers. But the point is valid: the farther you get from the socialist center, the more China becomes Chinese.
Shanghai's Mayor, Zhu Rongji, although a friend of Beijing's fearsome Li Peng, bears a curious resemblance to former New York Mayor Ed Koch. When I tried to set him up with an opening softball question at a dinner last week, Mayor Zhu responded with a bit of politico-media wisdom that deserves adage status: ''A softball question is usually followed by a hardball question.'' The man is wryly hip and slyly practical; will his ilk, who could attract foreign investment, run China after the great funeral?
Not even a peripatetic Bigfoot knows for sure. China could go completely totalitarian, or break completely free, or muddle down the middle until the Beijing way or the Shanghai style emerged triumphant.
But I can conjure a vision. The stultifying octogenarians are gone; the Politburo is meeting in the Forbidden City; the opposing forces are in deadlock, getting hungry and irritable. Suddenly, this aged, bent Chinese woman, muttering to herself, appears with a magic bowl of Shanghai noodles . . .

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
When Decline Hurts

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Massachusetts voters turned angrily against incumbents in primaries last week, and many other states report a mood of hostility toward politicians. Why? The experts talk of high state taxes, corruption, cynicism. But a far more profound phenomenon may underlie the discontent.
I believe we may be seeing an early sign of the process that Professor Paul Kennedy described in his book: ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers.'' That is the economic decline of a great power even as it continues to exercise its military might in the world. 
The United States right now is marshaling large military forces in the Persian Gulf. But in order to pay for that effort it has had to hold a tin cup out to allies and friends. There could hardly be a clearer demonstration of the gap between the ambitions of our policy abroad and the weakness of its economic base at home.
The same fiscal bankruptcy that makes us ask for help on Gulf costs has had devastating domestic effects. In particular, it has put a heavy strain on state and local governments.
During the Reagan years the Federal Government taxed less and spent more - on weapons. The Reagan Administration's non-answer to the resulting deficit was to cut, indeed virtually to eliminate, all kinds of Federal aid to the states. The money saved was piddling compared with the deficit, but the local pain inflicted was great.
Some things just have to be done. When the Federal Government reduces payments for hospital care of the indigent, cities and states must somehow find the money.
Massachusetts and New York and New Jersey and other states are now feeling the responsibilities dumped on them by Washington. In boom times the burden could be borne. Now it demands higher taxes or bloody budget cuts. The states cannot run deficits. The voters have to pay, and they are angry.
A curious result of our federal system is that the anger is misdirected. The politicians close at hand are the targets. They have done plenty of things wrong, but those really responsible are in Washington - and somehow hardly anyone associates them with the pain.
Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York has called attention to this political curiosity. President Reagan's ''new federalism'' amounted to making state and local taxpayers bear new burdens, but they did not notice who had done it.
Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts made a similar point when I asked him about the reasons for voter discontent. ''It's a combination,'' he said, ''of 10 years of Washington kidding the public about paying the bills, and the steady dropping of more and more burdens on the states.''
Of course it is not economic folly alone that has put the United States into an economic decline - and made it a country with bad schools, inadequate health care, uncompetitive technology. It is failed political leadership.
Vested interests scream at any proposal that would touch them, and the politicians draw back. Steps obviously needed right now - such as higher gasoline taxes and realistic pricing of Medicare for the well-off elderly - are dismissed. All President Bush suggests to balance the budget is more tax cuts for the rich.
The challenges to reviving the American economic base obviously could be met. But so far there is no sign that they will be. The political will is just not there. Perhaps the greed and folly of Reaganism did too much damage. But that was the political leadership we wanted.
That is why Professor Kennedy's historical warnings are so troubling. For what we are experiencing in the United States may be more than a mistake here and there. It may be a leadership failure that reflects a people's unwillingness to meet the responsibilities of a dynamic society.
In a piece written for New Perspectives Quarterly, Professor Kennedy said of the American commitment in the Persian Gulf that ''the cause may be just, the deployment impressive.'' But in the 17th century, he said, Spain was impressive in deploying armies abroad, while at home it was sagging in ways that proved decisive: ''Massive debts, inefficient industries, reliance on foreign manufacturers, vested interests. . . .
''The emperors, kings, prime ministers and presidents of great powers have always preferred the heady world of diplomacy, war and international affairs to the unglamorous realm of fiscal reform, educational change and domestic renewal. . . . It is left to later generations to pay the price.''

New York City On the Rocks? Don't Bet on It

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
A looming recession, coupled with soaring energy prices, presage the loss of nearly 100,000 jobs in the first year of the new decade and will keep the number of employed New Yorkers from expanding at all in the next 10 years.
That forecast was the product of a computer program that used 1,500 equations and 1,400 variables. It was also wrong.
While other aspects of the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates 1980 projection proved prescient, it failed to anticipate the financial services boom that contributed to an increase of more than 300,000 jobs, or 10 percent, in the 1980's. 
''The major thing that changed it,'' said William J. Lawrence, an economics professor at Pace University's Graduate School of Business who designed the computer model, ''was what happened down on Wall Street.''
That the projection failed to register the first whirrings of an engine that would drive the city's economy through much of the decade is less a reflection of the formula's efficacy than of the vicissitudes of forecasting the consequences of events that are still evolving or events that have yet to occur.
Even if the forecast for yesterday was rain and it didn't, deciding on the basis of yesterday's experience to leave your umbrella home the next time rain is predicted would be imprudent. The burden of being prepared is likely to be outweighed by the costs of getting soaked. Being prepared does not demand, though, that you open your umbrella or move to an arid locale just because it is cloudy.
Dire forecasts about New York City's fate have been precipitated by its latest economic slump, social malaise and understandable preoccupation with crime. No forecaster can say with certainty, though, whether the city is slipping into another cyclical recession or whether it is headed for a permanent decline.
Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, has been saying that a social, political and economic crisis confronting the city today is far more serious than the fiscal crisis it survived in the 1970's.
The Ford Administration's initial response to the city's plight then - capsulized by The Daily News as ''Drop Dead'' - provoked an outcry that persuaded out-of-towners that their prosperity was inexorably linked to the city's.
In contrast, Mr. Rohatyn said, reaction has been muted to President Bush's recent assessment that New York ''is becoming more expensive, more difficult and more dangerous than ever before.''
One reason, Mr. Rohatyn said, is that many people, himself included, largely concur. Another, he said, is that the city lacks the structured cooperation between business and labor and the strategic alliance between the city and state that enabled it to cope with the last fiscal crisis.
''There is a feeling of helplessness about the city's long-term problems,'' he lamented last week at a forum sponsored by New York University's Urban Research Center to discuss a new book, ''Urban Politics: New York Style'' (M. E. Sharpe: Armonk, N.Y.).
Two weeks ago Time magazine trumpeted the ''rotting'' of the Big Apple. Now, another magazine, NY, published by the Manhattan Institute, a policy research center, asks, ''Is New York going down the tubes?''
Peter D. Salins, the author of the article and chairman of the Department of Urban Affairs and Planning at Hunter College, says no, because New York has the nation's strongest municipal economy and will remain preeminent if only it reduces business taxes, shrinks government and improves many services that should not be sacrificed to austerity.
''The question is not whether New York will survive, but will New York thrive,'' Mr. Salins wrote.
Many economists - among them, Robert A. Dye, director of state forecasting for the WEFA Group, Wharton Econometrics' successor - have trouble, though, identifying an industry that, without a major rebound on Wall Street or changes in Federal spending priorities, will drive the city's revival, much as financial services did a decade ago.
Mr. Salins suggested that the city would capitalize on the ''world information economy.'' Dr. Lawrence predicted that revival would be spurred by small businesses that might become even more profitable after a recession made labor and land costs in New York more competitive with costs in the rest of the country.
''But,'' said Dr. Lawrence, who designed the computer model on which the gloomy 1980 Wharton forecast was based, ''I tend to be overly optimistic about the city.''

HEADLINE: On the Sidewalks, Business Is Booming

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Steven Frost makes his living on the street, selling toy spiders that jump when you squeeze a rubber ball. They are $3 each, two for $5.
''This is better than working in an office,'' the bushy-haired peddler said recently while standing on Broadway near 39th Street. ''I'll eat lunch and then maybe go to the movies.''
Mr. Frost's occupation has never seemed more common. As sales in stores across the city lag, commerce on the sidewalk is brisk. Peddling may be one of New York City's few remaining growth industries. 
Peddlers have set up shop on Fifth Avenue, which until recently was largely forbidden territory, have turned parts of Canal and 14th Streets, among others, into bazaars, have set up shop in Astoria, Queens, and are stirring animosities on 125th Street, where many white and Asian shopkeepers are competing with black street vendors.
''It's hard to find a block where you don't see someone doing it,'' said Carol O'Cleireacain, the New York City Finance Commissioner, who knows that the city is losing tax revenue from much of the curbside business, but does not have an estimate of how much. ''It's part of the third worldization of New York City.''
New York limits the number of licenses for general merchandise vendors to 853, although military veterans, who are automatically entitled to a license, have pushed the total above 1,000. This year the city's Consumer Affairs Department will issue about 50 licenses, drawing from a waiting list that has 710 names and has been frozen since 1988.
But many vendors, like Mr. Frost, do not wait for licenses or heed regulations that, with a few exceptions, prohibit even licensed vendors from peddling anything but food and printed material in much of midtown and downtown Manhattan.
As part of the proliferation of curbside commerce, sides of newsstands are being turned into mini-malls of clothing, sunglasses, jewelry and souvenirs, even though the stands are not supposed to sell goods - other than publications - that cost more than $2. Several newsstands near Madison Square Garden are so filled with other merchandise that it is hard to find any publications.
Vendors are also subletting store windows or the space in front of them for their own displays, creating stores-within-stores that are especially common along 14th Street and around Times Square. The destitute and the homeless add to the clutter, spreading assortments of used clothes, battered furniture and magazines on the sidewalks.
Although city officials and urban planners refused even to estimate the total number of peddlers, licensed and unlicensed, in New York City, there is a consensus that the number has risen sharply, propelled not only by economic forces but also by changes in the city's demographics.
Many of the new sidewalk merchants emigrated from countries like Senegal, where peddling is a tradition. High rents have also pushed more business onto the sidewalks, where the city's heavy pedestrian flow provides a steady stream of customers. And the faltering economy seems to have made some New Yorkers eager for bargains, turning the curbside sale of T-shirts, books, costume jewelry, cologne, video and audio cassettes, telephones, and, of course, umbrellas into big business. One peddler has been spotted lugging a room-size rug around the Upper West Side.
 
Counterfeit Merchandise
Although the authorities say the peddlers are usually not selling stolen merchandise, they quickly add that much of it is counterfeit, such as watches that look like Rolexes and T-shirts with unlicensed reproductions of Gucci, Chanel or Fendi logos or the snarling countenance of Bart Simpson.
''I honestly believe we are talking about $100 million in gross sales revenues,'' said Tom Cusick, president of the Fifth Avenue Association, which represents some of the city's toniest -and most anti-peddler - merchants. Unpaid sales and income taxes on the curbside transactions add up to millions of dollars, he believes.
Mr. Cusick estimates that book stands, which are exempt from many city regulations under the Constiution, generate $250 to $300 a day in gross revenues, with about $40 in cash going to the vendor, who is often an employee. A T-shirt stand can gross $1,000 a day, he believes. ''This is a well-organized activity,'' he said. ''The people on the street are largely employees, and it's all a cash business.''
Mr. Frost, who tried selling other ersatz insects before discovering the spiders, which are imported from Poland, says he grossed $75,000 in the best of his three years as a peddler.
 
Arrested 15 Times
''But if you get arrested, it's three days in jail and they take away your stuff,'' Mr. Frost said, adding that he has been arrested 15 times.
As illegal peddling has grown, the Peddler Task Force, a group of 25 police officers and five supervisors who cover Manhattan from the Battery to 59th Street, found that many of their summonses - which totaled 50,374 in 1985 alone - were being issued over and over to the same people, who considered the fines a cost of doing business. So the squad began arresting illegal peddlers and confiscating their goods. Last year, it made 3,411 arrests and 5,174 confiscations.
But an arrest ties an officer up for hours, and the city's courts and jails are already crowded with defendants accused of more serious offenses. And the peddlers, in response to the confiscations, have learned to keep inventories thin. Watches hawked for $20 to $30 are packed into briefcases in hotels on the West Side, so if a peddler is caught he will lose only the watches in his case. The peddlers also enlist look-outs and money-runners.
Lieut. Robert J. Louttit, the peddling squad's commanding officer, said he would need twice as many officers to ''to enforce the regulations as they exist.'' But reinforcements do not seem likely anytime soon. Earlier in the year, his officers found themselves being assigned other duties, like policing demonstrations, and the squad's $375,000 overtime budget was cut.
A letter-writing campaign by merchants moved City Hall to restore the squad's overtime budget, and the squad staged a series of sweeps in July that resulted in 700 arrests.
But even as the police were making inroads, a group of peddlers were winning in court what amounts to a special franchise on city sidewalks. Joseph Kaswan convinced a judge in January that a state law allowing disabled veterans like him to peddle goods in any street or alley took precedence over city regulations that ban even licensed merchandise vendors from many streets. Now many veterans peddle wares on Fifth Avenue.
''I'm not trying to upset people,'' said Mr. Kaswan, 72 years old, who took up peddling a few years ago. He has suggested that some of the stores on Fifth Avenue might want to help peddlers build gentrified versions of the pushcarts that plied the Lower East Side so long ago, but indicates that the response has been less than encouraging.
 
Trouble at Tiffany's
Tensions rose in front of Tiffany's -an establishment with a relationship with vendors that ''is not considered cordial,'' according to Fernanda Gilligan, a Tiffany's group vice president -when a row of white planters appeared on the sidewalk in front of the store where Milton Brown and other disabled veterans wanted to set up their tables.
''The security guards started calling us names,'' Mr. Brown said the other day, as he sold T-shirts for $5 in front of the burnished facade of Gucci, an establishment he said was more sympathetic. ''It almost got into a physical confrontation.''
''These people are very unfair -we're the smallest guys on the block,'' said Mr. Brown, who adds that he pays taxes and issues receipts.
Mr. Cusick of the Fifth Avenue Association said the police are doing the best they can under the circumstances. He talks about an effort to seize counterfeit goods from vendors, though he is not likely to get city police officers to carry it out.
 
Not on Rodeo Drive
The peddlers clog already congested sidewalks, often deprive the city of tax revenue and ''bring down the whole image,'' Mr. Cusak said. ''On Rodeo Drive, you won't see a single vendor anywhere.''
But instead of shooing peddlers from place to place, John A. Gaber, an assistant professor of city and regional planning at Pratt Institute, suggested that the city lure them to special districts, like 14th Street. In contrast to Fifth Avenue, Professor Gaber notes that some merchants there welcome the peddlers, who pay rent for display space and attract potential customers.
''These are people who are making a living,'' he said. ''They're an important element of Manhattan street life.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Spent $21.5 Billion in 1989 To Support Families of Teen-Agers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
The Federal Government spent more than $21.5 billion last year on welfare programs for families started by teen-agers, said a report released today.
The amount is $1.7 billion higher than for 1988, partly because of inflation and expansion of Medicaid benefits but also because of an increase in births to teen-agers, said the report by the Center for Population Options, a private organization that concentrates on worldwide population issues.
The center said the figures illustrated the need for greater efforts to prevent pregnancies among teen-agers, including sex education, family planning, counseling, support for celibacy, access to contraception and medical services, including abortion. 
''We can no longer let our youth stumble into parenting, a course that should be embarked on only when one is ready, willing and able to become a parent,'' the report said.
The costs of pregnancies for teen-agers go far beyond those of public support, the report said, adding that child-bearing too early often impoverishes ''the lives of girls brought too soon into the rigors and responsibilities of motherhood, of boys bewildered and unable to parent and provide adequately, of babies not planned or welcomed.''
 
Widespread Burden
''It places a heavy burden on families and communities and contributes to our country's unconscionably high rates of low birth weight and neonatal mortality,'' it said.
The most alarming increases in such pregnancies are occurring among 15- to 17-year-olds, the report said. After a decreasing rate of births in this age group from 1970 into the mid-1980's, the rate began increasing. It jumped from 30.6 per 1,000 teen-agers in 1986 to 33.8 in 1988, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
In estimating Federal spending on families started by teen-agers, the center included families headed by mothers now in their teens as well as those in which the mother is 20 years or older but had her first child as a teen-ager. The cost includes the Federal Government's share for Aid for Families with Dependent Children, Medicaid and food stamps received by these families.
The center also calculated the public cost for five states and two cities for 1989, adding in the welfare expenditures of the states, cities and towns.
These were: Louisiana, $360 million; New Mexico, $80 million; Oregon, $174 million; Vermont, $39 million; Wisconsin, $437 million; Baltimore, $246 million, and St. Louis, $81 million.

After 2 Decades of Silence, a Novel on Alcoholism

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

Sams in a Dry Season
By Ivan Gold
244 pages. Houghton Mifflin/Seymour Lawrence. $19.95.
In the early 1960's, Ivan Gold published ''Nickel Miseries,'' a collection of stories, some of which he had written as an undergraduate at Columbia and as a disciple of the teacher and critic Lionel Trilling. The collection's tough, economical style and acute moral vision of society's outsiders made Mr. Gold a writer to watch, especially in light of the decade's upheavals. A novel, ''Sick Friends,'' followed in 1969; it was full of talent but self-indulgent. Then Mr. Gold fell silent. No more books for two decades. One quickly learns why at the opening of his newly published novel, ''Sams in a Dry Season.'' The first chapter is called ''Still Drinking After All These Years.'' The year is 1976. Jason Sams is a creative-writing teacher at the University of Greater Boston and about to lose his job to an English novelist named Fiona. 
''He was entering his eighth year of marriage, father of one and author of two (in marked contrast to Fiona, divorced dam of seven, perpetrator of six), 43 and intermittently aware that alcohol had become less useful to him than once it had been, at some indeterminate period in his life. He knew there might well come a day (comfortably in the future) when he would elect to give it up entirely.'' But that future is more imminent and less comfortable than Jason anticipates. In the pages that follow, he will descend on New York City to see if he can scare up still more advance money for the new book he isn't writing and to drop in on his parents, who have stuck it out in an apartment in the deteriorating East Village.
There will be no more advance money; publishing times have changed, and the editor who once succored Jason has dropped dead on a golf course at the age of 37. But when Jason visits his parents on the Friday night Sabbath, he learns that his father's twin brother has died and will be buried Sunday. So the trip has a point after all. Jason will stay on for the funeral.
Though time trickles away unaccountably, the weekend is not a lost one. Bad memories keep Jason from oblivion. Wrestling with these, Jason finds he doesn't just need a drink. Drink has become the whole point. On the Saturday night before the funeral, meaning to nurse a glass of Scotch, he ends up downing two entire bottles.
But on Monday aboard the train home, a miracle occurs in the form of panicked withdrawal. Back in Boston, he staggers to Alcoholics Anonymous. By the end of the novel, he is keeping a journal. The book in the reader's hands is the story's ultimate resolution. It is an occasion for cheering. Though the details are fictional, the story strikes one as too close to autobiography not to engage the reader in what one inevitably reads as Mr. Gold's personal struggle.
But one wants the book to be more than an inspirational story. One wants Jason's alcoholism to have some deeper meaning. Mr. Gold tries. At several points in the story, he links Jason's drinking to his writing, as if he were going to confront the great mystery of why so many American writers drink. But he won't romanticize Jason or let him kid himself. Jason may drink because writing makes him anxious, but the only effect of alcohol is to interfere further with his writing. Jason is long past the stage when drinking can do him any good creatively, if in fact it ever did.
Mr. Gold also tries to fashion a prose style that reflects the effect of alcohol on his character's awareness. As Jason goes off on his weekend bender, the novel's sentences begin to fragment and collide. The technique may even be a conscious tribute to certain of Mr. Gold's predecessors. ''In his time . . . he had become as smashed as Papa ever got, in Cuba or the Keys, as creatively looped as Faulkner ever got in his own barn, ah now, that bastard, I devoured him, even read Mosquitoes twice and tried like hell to read the poetry, then for years wrote just like him, if you believe that, Jewish kid from the Lower East Side of Manhattan playing Ivy League aristocrat way up there on Morningside Heights knowing he would never make it until one day having read and reread all the works of the great William Faulkner published to that time began writing like the mind of the South, struggling toward a style, until one day confronted the man himself. . . .'' And so on for whole pages.
But such a style suggests inebriation only at several removes. It is even far from the prose disintegration of Malcolm Lowry's Consul in ''Under the Volcano.'' It is closer to what a sober mind might apprehend watching a drunken mind reeling.
In the end, Mr. Gold is really too tough-minded to find high art in the subject of alcoholism. As Jason falls in step with the routines of A.A., he learns that the objective is to get through one day at a time and that, as members themselves often say, the reason drunks drink is that they are drunks.
In the end, ''Sams in a Dry Season'' is worthwhile simply because it is the well-told story of a man's recovery. Now that Ivan Gold has written that book, he can move on and write others.

HEADLINE: In Shift, Fed Puts Emphasis on Inflation

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
After 15 months of gradually lowering interest rates to avoid a recession, the Federal Reserve has shifted strategy and is trying to freeze rates at their present levels, having concluded that inflation is now the greatest threat to the American economy.
The inflationary impact of rising oil prices is the primary reason for the strategy shift. The Federal Reserve's resolve has been bolstered by other leading industrial nations, which are also holding up interest rates. The Group of Seven industrialized nations endorsed the strategy in a communique on Saturday.
But above all, Federal Reserve officials insist that the United States economy, although sluggish, is not in a recession and, therefore, lower rates are not justified, no matter what the other industrialized nations might do in the future. 
''There isn't a convincing signal to move interest rates dramatically up or down,'' said Robert T. Parry, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Nine of the Federal Reserve's 17 regional bank presidents and governors offered the same opinion, in recent interviews and public statements. And Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, insisted that the nation was not in a recession.
Mr. Greenspan, in fact, offered a new, more stringent definition of recession, one that requires the economy to go into a steep decline. He suggested that the Federal Reserve might refuse to ease interest rates if the nation entered what most economists consider to be a recession, namely six months in which the gross national product shrinks.
''Mr. Greeenspan is defining recession as more complex than simply two quarters of negative economic growth,'' said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana and the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. ''This new definition of his, which is new to me, leads me to believe that Mr. Greenspan seeks maneuvering room not to ease interest rates despite weak economic data.''
However the experts define a recession, millions of Americans believe the nation is in one now, public opinion polls show. Layoffs, rising unemployment, salary freezes, the decline in home prices and other hardships have brought them to this conclusion. But some Fed officials hesitate to use the word recession, even for the Northeast, the region widely considered to be experiencing the greatest economic hardship.
''Things are undoubtedly in a downturn in New England, but conditions are mixed,'' said Richard F. Syron, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which covers the New England region.
 
Major Economic Danger
Absent a recession, as the Federal Reserve defines the word, Mr. Greenspan raised inflation as the ''major danger'' to the economy, particularly if rising oil prices lead people to demand higher wages. Once ''oil prices have either stabilized or come down, you still have got the wage inflation in there to contend with,'' he told the Joint Economic Committee in testimony last week.
Then he, in effect, ruled out another reduction in interest rates soon. ''I think it is very clear that there are actions that we can take in the short run, which would be perceived to have short-term benefits, but could have intermediate and long-term major negatives,'' he said.
Mr. Greenspan and other Federal Reserve officials believe that lower interest rates would stimulate the American economy, perhaps within a few weeks, by encouraging people and companies to borrow for consumer spending and investment. The construction industry and home sales, in particular, would get a push.
But the officials also contend that while high interest rates tend to reduce spending and investment, over the long run they hold down prices by reducing the demand for available goods.
Mortgages and most other consumer loans now carry rates of 10 percent or more, a level that has helped to weaken the economy in recent months.
 
Stable Monetary Policy
The Group of Seven's communique, issued on Saturday, noted that higher oil prices posed a risk of inflation and recession and asserted that inflation was the greater immediate danger. It said ''stability-oriented monetary policy'' was the ''correct policy response.''
The Federal Reserve subscribed to the communique, although Mr. Greenspan contends that his central bank can split away and manipulate American interest rates separately, if an American recession or rising inflation should require such action. The United States economy is far weaker today than the economies of most of the other industrial nations.
Two developments could end the Fed's interest rate freeze over the next few weeks. One involves bank lending practices. As the economy weakens, banks, fearful of defaults, have made fewer loans. To offset the credit squeeze, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates in July and could do so again, although Fed officials say bank lending has not become more restrictive in recent weeks.
 
Budget Accord a Factor
The Federal Reserve might also lower rates if Congress and the Bush Administration agree to a plan to reduce the budget deficit, although Fed officials insist that a budget agreement will not automatically produce a drop in interest rates.
''There has been a perception from Alan Greenspan's testimony that as soon as a believable budget accord is struck, the Fed will ease,'' said Roger Guffey, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.
''That is too simplistic,'' he said. ''What would happen is that once a credible accord was struck, long-term bond rates would come down and the Fed would happily confirm the lower rates. It would not lead the process.''
A credible agreement requires tax increases and spending cuts that reduce the budget deficit by $50 billion in the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1 and by $500 billion over five years, Mr. Greenspan said last week. Such a cutback would probably convince the bond markets that inflation is under control, he has said.
Without a budget agreement, the decision to postpone another reduction in interest rates means the nation may find itself deep in a recession before the Federal Reserve acts again. That happened during the 1981-1982 recession, which was nearly a year old before the Federal Reserve, then led by Paul A. Volcker, the chairman, reduced rates.
Mr. Volcker's resistance to lower rates drew sharp criticism from Reagan Administration officials, and in 1987 Mr. Reagan replaced Mr. Volcker with Mr. Greenspan. Mr. Volcker, however, had to deal with a Consumer Price Index that rose by more than 10 percent in some years.
 
Seeking a Balance
Until the Middle East crisis, the Consumer Price Index has risen at an annual rate of 5 percent or less during most of Mr. Greenspan's three years as chairman. As a result, he has been free to make minor adjustments in interest rates, trying to keep the economy free of recession while trying to reduce the inflation rate to well under 4 percent.
Mr. Greenspan once told Congress that if the economy falls into recession, the recession should be attributed to a mistake in Federal Reserve policy. He and other Fed officials still hold the view, but say they have not made a mistake so far and the economy, despite its weakness, is not in recession.
Now, Mr. Greenspan seems to be hedging that earlier statement. The gross national product, measuring the total value of the goods and services created in the nation, has grown at an annual rate of only 1.5 percent this year, and Mr. Greenspan suggested the G.N.P. could tilt into one or two quarters of mildly negative growth without being in recession.
 
Steeper Decline Necessary
A true recession, he argued, requires a much steeper decline, one in which inventories of unsold goods pile up as consumer spending declines. This leads to sharp cutbacks in new orders, falling corporate profits and widespread layoffs. This process has caused some postwar recessions, in which the G.N.P. has contracted for two straight quarters, but not all of them.
Whatever Mr. Greenspan's new recession requirements, the Federal Reserve for months had made preventing a recession a top priority. From June 1989 until last month, the Fed had shaved 1.5 percentage points off short-term interest rates in small steps, most of them taken last year.
This gradual approach brought criticism from Bush Administration officials, who called on the Federal Reserve to bring down rates more quickly as the economy weakened earlier this year. Lately, however, the criticism has declined, and the Administration has even agreed with Mr. Greenspan that the economy is not in recession.

HEADLINE: Finance Chiefs Back Money Rein

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Most of the world's industrial and developing nations decided this weekend not to try to shield consumers from higher energy prices, endorsing a strategy of tight monetary policies that increases the risk of a recession.
The world's finance ministers, at a series of meetings here, agreed to refrain from subsidies or price controls to cushion their countries from the short-term effects of the turmoil in the Persian Gulf.
The finance ministers are gathered for the preliminaries to the 45th joint annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and its sister lending organization, the World Bank, which begins Tuesday.
 
Strength Is Seen
The prevailing view of economic managers of the seven leading industrialized countries, the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, who met for seven hours on Saturday, is that their economies are still strong enough to resist a downturn. 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said that although economic growth was ''slower than it should be, I don't accept the use of the word recession.'' He added, ''There is underlying power in this economy that's still with us.''
He told reporters that nothing had happened here this weekend to cause him to alter his thinking that financial markets would take heart from a bipartisan agreement to cut the Federal budget deficit and provide the latitude for further cuts in interest rates.
 
'Correct Policy Response'
A communique issued Saturday night after the finance ministers of the seven industrial countries met noted that the rises in oil prices brought the twin risks of inflation and lower economic growth and said that ''stability-oriented monetary policies and sound fiscal policies constitute the correct policy response.''
The task now, Mr. Brady said, was to ''navigate between those two risks.''
Advocates of the new strategy say that to act otherwise would be to repeat the policy mistakes of the 1970's, when oil prices also rose sharply. At that time interest rates were cut and efforts were made to cushion consumers through subsidies and price controls. But inflationary pressures continued to rise, leading to the stringent tightening of monetary policies in the late 1970's and the recession of 1981-82.
As Canada's Finance Minister, Michael Wilson, put it, ''If we don't get on top of inflationary pressures now, the difficulties will be far more severe in the future.''
The strong disinflation of the early 1980's, said Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, laid the foundation for the exceptionally durable period of noninflationary growth in the main industrial countries throughout the past eight years.
Still, he called it an ''uncomfortable message'' in countries like Britain, where interest rates have been high for a considerable period and output is slowing.
While the focus has been on the general economic policy response to rising oil prices, great attention is also being paid to aid packages for the developing countries most severely affected by the seven-week crisis in the Middle East.
 
Aid From Rich Countries
Such aid is being prepared by rich surplus countries, like Japan, Germany and Saudi Arabia, and by both the monetary fund and the World Bank, which are being pushed by their members to be more flexible and responsive to the needs of their more distressed members.
Many third world countries have been hit not only by costlier energy and a slowdown in growth in industrial countries, which hurts their exports, but also by the loss of billions of dollars in worker remittances.
Egypt, Jordan, India, Bangladesh and other countries now have to house and feed thousands of workers who have returned from Kuwait and Iraq and whose earnings in support of relatives back home had been an economic lifeline.
''Let's assume that countries do what they have to do, and in particular that they accept to pass through to consumers the effects of this oil shock,'' said the fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus. ''Then the international institutions have to help.''
 
About $20 Billion Pledged
Donor countries have pledged about $20 billion, which is intended both to offset costs of the United States-led military operation in the Persian Gulf and to help the most seriously affected countries.
Both the I.M.F. and the World Bank, which have recently gotten members to approve big infusions of capital, plan to disburse more loans faster to these countries. In addition, the agencies have been called upon by donor countries to coordinate the money flows those nations are providing.
The precise role that the agencies will play is expected to come up during the annual meeting. Mr. Brady, for example, has specifically requested that a special emergency mechanism in the I.M.F., known as the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility, be expanded to deal with the crisis.
Also, he wants the fund to consider measures on a temporary basis to increase the access of members to fund resources. Other members are likely to back this request.
 
Recycling by Institutions
In contrast to the 1970's, when most of the recycling of petrodollars was handled by commercial banks, this time around, most experts are agreed, most of the recycling will be by governments and international financial institutions.
Banks have taken substantial losses on third world loans and are not anxious to make new loans to many of these countries. But some private bankers here noted that developing countries that are competitive and creditworthy can still count on commercial bank support.

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Rose by 23% Last Month

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Aided by a sharp increase from domestic manufacturers, new orders for American-made machine tools jumped 23 percent in August from the previous month's level, according to a monthly report being released today by the Association for Manufacturing Technology. But analysts said the rise was not significant because it was primarily the effect of an industry trade show.
The August level of machine tool orders rose to $288 million, from $234.2 million in July. The figure also represented a 26.8 percent increase from the level of machine tool orders in August of last year. For the first eight months of the year, machine-tool orders increased 1.8 percent from the similar period last year. 
Economists and analysts said that the August increase represented more of a surge in buying stimulated by the recent industry trade show in Chicago than any significant change in manufacturers' plans to increase their capital spending. Machine-tool orders typically rise whenever the trade show is held.
 
A Period of Uncertainty
''From all the estimates on what will happen in the economy, capital spending is going to be up just barely this year,'' said James J. Paper, an analyst with Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian Inc. in Omaha. ''We're going to have to wait and see what impact higher oil prices have on the economy and, then, on factory orders. It's possible that machine tool orders could trend south again.''
Albert W. Moore, president of the association, said that the figures did indeed represent increased buying by manufacturers. ''Many analysts see a shaky economy in the coming months,'' Mr. Moore said. ''But you wouldn't know it by watching the level of activity the last two weeks,'' he added, referring to the activity at the industry trade show.
Richard O. Priebe, a spokesman for the Cross & Trecker Corporation, a big machine tool producer based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said his company had not yet seen any downward trend or slackening of orders from automobile manufacturers, who account for nearly half of its orders.
''There has been anticipation of a significant drop-off in spending,'' Mr. Priebe said. ''But there has been no sign of it yet. But then, there are no signs, either, of continuing upward movement.''
The August figures included a 25.4 increase in orders from domestic customers. Orders from foreign customers, which had shown particular strength through most of the year, were down 2.7 percent in August, the report said. Indeed, for the first eight months of 1990, orders from foreign customers were 13.3 percent higher than for the same period last year, while domestic orders were up only a tenth of 1 percent.
 
'Critical Indicators'
Machine tools are power-driven devices for cutting or shaping metal parts used in products as varied as appliances, vehicles, aircraft and construction materials. The strength of tool orders generally reflects the strength of industrial production, and economists consider patterns of machine tool sales critical indicators of capital spending by manufacturers.
Shipments of machine tools were up 3.8 percent in August from July's level, to $242.3 million. Shipments to foreign customers soared 75.3 percent in August, from July's level, while those to domestic customers were down 3.6 percent. Shipments were up 7.3 percent compared with August of last year, and up 8.7 percent for the first eight months of this year, compared with the period last year.
Orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, soared 64 percent in August, from July's level. That segment of the industry typically accounts for three-fourths of new orders. Orders for metal-forming tools dropped 45.6 percent in August.
The machine-tool order backlog stood at $1.61 billion, up from $1.56 billion in July. The figure for August 1989 was $2.13 billion.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Inventory Data Can Be Deceptive

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
THE sluggish American economy is in danger of sliding into a recession. Few Americans dispute that; yet they are being told by economists to take comfort. The national economy will muddle through, as long as companies maintain small stockpiles of unsold goods. The problem with this thesis is that when sales plunge recessions can be born anyway, no matter how small the stockpiles.
A shoe store owner, for example, might keep in inventory only four pairs of size 9D men's shoes, instead of the eight pairs he had maintained in inventory just before the 1981-1982 recession. Overnight delivery from his supplier keeps the stock at a steady four pairs. But if sales suddenly drop from three pairs a day to one, then the store owner has to drastically reduce his daily order or his inventory will quickly rise beyond four pairs. 
The factory that supplies the store owner, in turn, has to cut back production and lay off workers. This process of production cutbacks, shrinking profits and layoffs, when it occurs across many industries, is what in the past has pushed a weak American economy into recession.
''Everybody argues that inventories have been under great control, and that is true,'' said Gerald Donahoe, a Commerce Department economist. ''But the issue isn't inventory levels, it is how quickly they might rise, even from a low level, if sales collapse.''
What is more, computer monitoring of inventories and just-in-time overnight delivery, much praised by economists and business executives as a means of keeping down inventories, could work against the economy. ''It means that businessmen might start canceling orders sooner than in the past,'' Mr. Donahoe said.
When inventory accumulation does occur, the starting point is usually the retail sector. Stockpiles build up in stores as sales fall, then at the wholesale and distributor level as orders are canceled, then among manufacturers. In fact, an inventory buildup might be getting under way at the retail and wholesale levels now, although the Commerce Department is slow in catching changes.
Monthly inventory surveys, based on questionnaires filled out by a few thousand companies, produce national statistics with a 60-day delay. July inventories, for example, were published only last week, and they are incomplete. The statistics cover primarily the manufacturing sector. Supplies held in stock by service companies, the construction and mining industries, airlines, telephone companies and the agricultural sector are calculated annually, not monthly. And they can account for 20 percent of the nation's total inventories, Mr. Donahoe notes.
Still, the July inventory report showed that manufactured goods held by retailers rose to $236.4 billion in July from about $232.7 billion in March and April. A similar rise to $236 billion late last year raised concerns then about recession, but sales held up and inventories declined, without forcing drastic cutbacks in production and layoffs.
''The issue is always sales, not inventory levels,'' says A. Gary Shilling, an economics consultant. Retail sales weakened notably in August, and now the question is whether the weakness will continue into the Christmas season, finally bringing on a classic recession in which the nation's industries produce so little wealth that the gross national product shrinks in value.
Although retailer inventories are rising, retailers often can keep their stocks misleadingly low by forcing wholesalers and distributors to hold inventories. Retailers then tap these inventories when their sales are brisk. And from the other end, manufacturers put the same pressure on wholesalers and, to a lesser extent, also on retailers - pushing their production from the assembly line into the marketplace as quickly as possible.
In a weak American economy, the upshot of this dynamic is that wholesale inventories swelled from May through July to an average of $192.3 billion a month, compared with a $189.7 billion monthly average in the February-through-April period.
Through it all, manufacturers' inventories have ranged between $370 billion and $373 billion since February, and production has held up, in part because exports have helped to offset weak sales at home. The linerboard industry is a good bellwether. Linerboard is used to make the corrugated boxes in which many products are shipped, so when manufacturing production declines nationwide, the demand for linerboard also falls.
Right now, linerboard manufacturers are operating at a healthy 94.4 percent of production capacity, and their inventories total a 5.7 week supply, at present sales levels. The danger signal, requiring production cutbacks, is more than six weeks. ''We have been braced for a recession, but we don't see it yet in our business,'' said Timothy McKenna, a spokesman for the Union Camp Corporation, a packaging manufacturer in Wayne, N.J.
Even when a recession comes, the Commerce Department's inventory figures might not announce the arrival. In hindsight, economists decided that the 1981-1982 recession began in July 1981, but the sharp jump in inventories as sales declined was not obvious in the data until August and September. And when the public learned of the inventory problem from the publication of these figures, in November, the recession was already well under way.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Vision of Los Angeles Leads to a Magazine: Buzz

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
A year and a half ago, Eden Collinsworth, a young New York book publisher who often came to Los Angeles on business, began to notice profound changes taking place there. ''A cumulative effect had been going on in Los Angeles,'' she said. ''It was becoming far more confident and sophisticated a city.''
So, never having lived in Los Angeles or worked on a magazine, in the worst period for magazine advertising in well over a decade, when city magazines in particular are reeling from the decline in retail advertising, and in a city that may well have too many magazines already, Ms. Collinsworth is starting a new magazine: Buzz, The Talk of Los Angeles. But why? Because young entrepreneurs have been starting publications since the days of the penny press. In the last five years more than 2,000 magazines were started. Of course far more fledglings die than survive, but Ms. Collinsworth, like generations of entrepreneurs, is convinced that there is a market for her magazine. 
 
Reasoning Behind a Vision
''The editorial side of my brain told me that there were other magazines but none in terms of business, science and the arts that said that there had been this extremely successful progressive change,'' Ms. Collinsworth said. ''And the business side of my brain told me that Los Angeles was now the richest and most populous metropolitan area in the United States and the nation's fastest-growing large city.''
Buzz, which hits the newsstands Oct. 2, will compete directly against Capital Cities/ABC's 30-year-old Los Angeles, the same company's newly acquired Exposure, and American Express's L.A. Style. Also in direct competition is the regional magazine California, formerly known as New West. A slew of other publications with largely non-paid circulation includes The Brentwood Bla Bla, In Beverly Hills, Angeles and L.A. West.
''I just don't see a need that is not being filled,'' said Geoff Miller, founder and publisher of Los Angeles, which has a circulation of 172,000 and is the only profitable city magazine in Los Angeles. ''It's a very tough market. The city is not constructed on conventional grids and truly is a collection of towns. It takes a long time to find the real issues and concerns that pull these communities together. It took us a good decade to break even.''
 
Contrast in Assessments
Thomas Ryder, president and executive publisher of the American Express Publishing Corporation, which publishes the 85,000-circulation L.A. Style, put it more bluntly: ''Given the state of the marketplace generally and the competitive nature of the Los Angeles marketplace specifically, I think the odds of Buzz surviving on its own is less than one in 10,000,'' he said.
But Porter Bibb, managing director, corporate finance, at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, who has been involved in the start-ups of about 30 magazines, thinks otherwise. ''It's unbelievable,'' he said. ''My business is investment banking and I've never in my life seen someone say they are going to do this in a six months time-frame and do it,'' he said. ''To raise the money in this economic environment is really remarkable.''
When Ms. Collinsworth first got the idea to start Buzz she had just left her posts as president and publisher of the Arbor House Publishing Company because its merger with William Morrow & Company had changed her job. She asked Allan Mayer, the editorial director of Arbor House and a former journalist at Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal, to be the editor in chief. Mr. Mayer went home and wrote down his editorial vision for the magazine. ''That memo became this magazine,'' Ms. Collinsworth said. They were soon joined by Susan Gates, now publisher of Buzz, who had experience in developing advertising and circulation-marketing plans and budgets.
 
The Business Plan
Ms. Collinsworth, who is president and chief executive of the venture, showed her business plan for the new magazine to a variety of private investors. She and her colleagues formed a corporation, Buzz Inc., sold 30 percent of the stock and within nine months raised $1 million. When there was no money to pay for start-up services, Ms. Collinsworth gave people cartoons drawn by her husband, William Hamilton, the author and New Yorker cartoonist.
''It was the only way I could think of paying them,'' she said.
The business plan, which calls for an investment of $5 million over the first three years, contained two pivotal stipulations - that the first direct-mail test achieve a 2.8 percent response rate and that the first issue contain 35 pages of advertising. The direct-mail test, which went to 55,000 people, received a remarkable 11 percent response. The first issue will have 52 pages of paid advertising.
Investors came aboard in various ways. On a flight, Ms. Gates told the man sitting next to her about the proposed magazine. He gave her his card and asked her to send him the business plan. Dubiously, she did. He turned out to be Lawrence Ellison, president and chief executive of the Oracle Corporation, a computer software company with revenues of $236 million, and became a primary investor in the magazine.
 
Issues and Circulation
Eight issues a year are planned, and the initial circulation will be 50,000 - 22,000 paid subscriptions, 20,000 newsstand sales (including 5,000 in New York, San Francisco and Santa Fe, N.M.) and 8,000 unpaid subscriptions to a selective list of power and society people. The circulation goal is 150,000 within five years.
The first issue of the sleek, glossy magazine is a mix of news, gossip, reflections and commentary by journalists, writers, artists and members of movie land about life in Los Angeles - ''the buzz of a good dinner party,'' Buzz editors like to say. There is a long piece on Los Angeles's water woes and a photo essay on the Port of Los Angeles.
Ms. Collinsworth, 38 years old, said she could not believe how fast Buzz had been pulled together. ''I came to Los Angeles with no place to live, no furniture, no bank, no accountant, no lawyer and no staff,'' she said. ''I find myself bemused by it all.''

HEADLINE: Proposals for a U.S. Energy Policy: Some Possible, Most Not

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
From the day Ronald Reagan arrived in Washington until the day before Saddam Hussein's troops reached Kuwait City, energy policy was a fringe issue in the United States. Now, the deployment of American troops in the Persian Gulf to assure a steady flow of oil has left many policy makers wondering whether the United States has options other than force to insure an adequate supply of energy.
But many proposals - including driving at the speed limit, paying high taxes on gasoline, running cars on natural gas and bicycling to work - seem a radical departure from how Americans work and play and live and how they think about natural resources. Here are 10 frequently mentioned proposals and their prospects for adoption:
 
1 Reduce Speed Limits And Enforce Them
A car that gets 28 miles a gallon at 55 miles an hour gets about 21 miles a gal lon at 65 miles an hour, the Insurance Institute for High way Safety says.
Driving more slowly would seem to benefit both individuals' pocketbooks and the nation's balance of payments and energy security, not to mention side effects like saving lives and reducing pollution. (Remember Earth Day?) But a few minutes on any Interstate highway demonstrates that when it comes to getting from point A to point B, most drivers agree that the proper speed is as fast as possible. 
In New York, where the speed limit is 55 miles an hour, a vacationer who toured 180 rural miles of the New York Thruway at 60 miles an hour last month was the slowest vehicle on his stretch of road. Even the proverbial milk wagon went faster.
After the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, when most people worried where their next tankful of gas was coming from and children on Halloween dressed up like OPEC ministers, Congress responded to the new national mood by imposing a national 55-mile-an-hour speed limit. Most people actually slowed down almost to that speed.
But when gasoline once again became inexpensive, Washington responded by allowing the states to raise their speed limits to 65 miles an hour.
Speed aside, encouraging drivers to keep their tires fully inflated, and providing air hoses at a time when fewer gas stations do, would also increase gas mileage considerably.
PROSPECTS: No change unless a crisis mentality takes hold or law-enforcement officials deploy their troops to stop speeding.
 
2 Insist on Cars With Better Mileage
Six million bar rels of oil a day, out of total domestic consumption of 16 million, is used to provide fuel for cars and light trucks. Federal policy has already had a major impact on gas mileage; alarmed by the Arab oil embargo in 1973-74, Congress required car makers to raise the mileage of cars, step by step, until the average of all cars sold reached 27.5 miles a gallon.
As new cars were built and old cars retired, the average efficiency of cars on the road in the United States has risen from 13.3 miles a gallon in 1973 to about 20 miles a gallon today, an improvement of 50 percent. Even if the Government does nothing more, average fuel economy will improve as new cars replace older ones.
But the collapse of crude oil prices in 1986 pushed gasoline prices so low that car buyers stopped demanding the more efficient models. Between the 1988 and 1990 model years, buyers moved so heavily to bigger cars with bigger engines that average fuel economy declined by 3 percent. The average fuel economy of 1990 model-year cars is 27.8 miles a gallon, down from 28.6 two years ago. (On the other hand, cars do accelerate more quickly. The 1990 models, on average, go from 0 to 60 miles an hour in seven-tenths of a second less than it took the 1988's.) A bill in the Senate would raise the corporate average fuel economy standard by 40 percent by 2001, to about 40 miles a gallon. That would save nearly three million barrels a day when the new cars are fully phased in, according to the bill's supporters. This is a big number in relation to the seven million barrels a day currently being imported and far exceeds the 730,000 barrels a day that the United States had been getting from Iraq and Kuwait.
Supporters say the Senate bill, sponsored by Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, would stimulate the development of engine and transmission technologies, along with increased use of lightweight materials.
But the auto makers say they used almost every trick they knew to double fuel efficiency from the mid-1970's to the mid-1980's. Nearly all cars made today have front-wheel drive instead of rear-wheel drive, and use fuel injectors instead of carburetors; all have been redesigned to cut wind drag. If substantial advances are to be made, the manufacturers say, it will have to be by making the cars smaller.
''I don't think it's reasonable to hold that the most mobile society in the world can meet its personal and business transportation needs with a fleet of mini-compacts, subcompacts and compacts,'' said Thomas H. Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association.
''Sales, the only barometer of consumer preference, support this,'' he said. ''In 1989, cars rated at 50 miles per gallon or better accounted for less than 3 percent of U.S. sales.''
But rather than making smaller cars, designers could increase mileage merely by cutting horsepower, forcing drivers to wait a second or two longer to go from 0 to 60. But that, Detroit says, does not sell cars.
PROSPECTS: A law increasing mileage standards is likely to pass in some form.
 
3 Substitute Pedals For Petroleum
Half of all trips to work are estimated to be five miles or less. That is a com fortable bicycle ride for a healthy adult.
But bicycles do not mix well with rain, snow, extreme heat, or the proper attire required by many companies. They also compete poorly for road space with automobiles, and in most places, local governments do not think they are important enough to warrant bicycle paths. Many employers provide parking for cars; fewer provide secure bicycle racks, or showers.
Cycling already saves about 50,000 barrels of oil a day, said Charles Komanoff, an energy consultant and electricity expert in New York who is the president of Transportation Alternatives, a bicycle advocacy group. Part of the savings comes from the three million people who commute by bicycle; a larger part comes from people who cycle for pleasure, rather than going for a Sunday drive. Another part comes from trips by children who do not have to be ferried in cars, he said.
If 10 percent of the work force shifted to bicycles for most of the year, from less than 3 percent now, the country could save an additional 25,000 barrels of oil a day, he calculates. Only 30 percent of car miles involve going to or from work, but bicycles could still substitute for part of the other 70 percent.
The public is skeptical, and some interest groups go so far as to suggest that bicycling is almost un-American. One major chemical company, the Ethyl Corporation, seeking to build public support for a gasoline additive that it said would save oil, ran full-page newspaper ads showing photos of cyclists commuting in Beijing, with a caption that said some solutions to the energy problem were not practical here.
PROSPECTS: Barring a dramatic change in personal habits and how people are required to dress for work, no change.
 
4 Tax Gasoline At a Hefty Rate
Most other indus trialized countries tax vehicle fuel by $1.50 to $3 a gallon; the average in this country, combining state, Federal and local taxes, is about 25 cents.
Oil companies and car makers agree that recent decades have demonstrated that the most effective way to decrease consumption is to increase the price. The idea is hardly new. John B. Anderson, a former Representative from Illinois, built a Presidential campaign on the issue 10 years ago. The idea's appeal to voters, as measured by the Electoral College, was zero.
Mr. Anderson, who now teaches law at Nova University Law School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said he believed such a tax was unlikely to prove any more popular now.
And not everyone agrees that a higher tax would reduce fuel use. ''I don't think that consumption taxes do much except buy a bigger government,'' said Theodore Eck, the chief economist at the Amoco Corporation. Even with a 50-cent-a-gallon tax, he said, ''the incremental cost of driving a mile is low as heck,'' compared with fixed costs like the purchase price of the car and the insurance cost. ''Not too many people are going to hang it up and walk,'' he said. The oil industry also argues that the tax would fall more heavily on poor people, who can least afford it and who often drive the oldest, thirstiest cars.
To encourage national policy goals, Americans like tax breaks, not tax increases. Raising the tax on beer and liquor to keep up with inflation has been difficult in recent years. And gasoline is one of the few consumer products more popular than beer.
PROSPECTS: Fair to poor.
 
5 Use Natural Gas To Power Vehicles
North America is largely self-suffi cient in natural gas, and major gas utili ties are offering to sell it for vehicle use at the equiva lent of 70 cents a gallon. Burned in a car or truck, natural gas produces far lower levels of soot and the chemicals that cause smog and acid rain than gasoline does. (Methanol and ethanol, two other alternative fuels, are more expensive than gasoline and offer less of an environmental advantage over gasoline.) Thousands of gasoline stations sit astride pipes that carry natural gas to homes, factories and other businesses. Natural gas does not require new refineries. Cars would have to be built with different fuel tanks, or have the tanks added, but existing gasoline engines will run acceptably without major modifications, and with relatively modest changes, a gasoline engine can be converted to run well on natural gas.
In the San Francisco area, Pacific Gas and Electric says that of the seven million vehicles in its service territory, 500,000, which account for one-quarter of the area's fuel use, would be obvious candidates for an easy switch to natural gas. These are almost all fleet vehicles, from buses and delivery trucks to the vans of plumbers and electricians, that could or already do refuel at a central point.
Pacific Gas and Electric, with two other big California utilities and others in Texas, recently signed a deal with General Motors to produce 1,000 three-quarter-ton pickup trucks powered solely by natural gas. They are to be sold and serviced through regular G.M. dealers in 1991. But progress has been slow, even in California, with its severe air pollution problems. ''We face a public acceptance obstacle,'' said Norman L. Bryan, vice president of Pacific Gas and Electric. The public dislikes the idea of a gaseous fuel, he said, even though natural gas appears to have technical advantages over gasoline. For one thing, if it leaks, it dissipates rather than forming a puddle, he pointed out. Explosion is a possibility with any flammable substance, but the ignition temperature of natural gas is 400 degrees higher than gasoline's.
Natural gas is also hampered by a public perception, accurate 10 years ago when Government price regulations depressed drilling, that the supply is limited. This is a self-fulfilling perception, because fears about supply have held down demand for gas and therefore its price, removing an incentive for exploration. Experts point out that prospectors are drilling deeper and deeper, and the deeper the well, the more likely that what is found is natural gas. The size of the inventory in this continent is uncertain but seems likely to be substantial.
Natural gas in vehicles also requires bulky canisters, which cut down cargo space in cars. And some bridges and tunnels deny access to vehicles carrying bottled gas.
PROSPECTS: Natural gas will cease to be unusual in fleet vehicles. But it may be be many years before most drivers are interested in exploring this option.
 
6 Tax Imported Oil To Spur U.S. Drilling
American oil pro duction is declining 5 or 6 percent a year, because even now prices are too low to stimulate drilling, and drillers are not sure how long the current higher price will last. In many cases, even the current prices do not justify keeping open wells that produce only small amounts.
Since 1986, when Saudi Arabia entered a price war with other OPEC producers and the price of a barrel dropped below $10, production in this country has declined by 2.3 million barrels a day, or about a quarter.
If the Government taxed imports, it would raise the price that domestic producers could get for their oil, to the amount of the world price plus the tax. That would encourage drilling.
But two hurdles stand in the Government's way. Washington has signed a free trade agreement with Canada, a major source of crude oil, and is negotiating a similar pact with Mexico, another major oil supplier. In addition, this country does not want to damage Mexico's economy, which is already shaky.
If Canada and Mexico were excluded, it would be difficult to tax oil from Venezuela, with which Washington has cultivated strong ties, experts say. Venezuela is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries but during the oil embargo of 1973-74 it produced extra oil to help the United States weather a difficult period, and is doing the same now.
If Venezuelan oil is exempted, what about oil from Saudi Arabia, which is also an ally of the United States? And if not Saudi oil, then who would be singled out? One expert suggested Iraq, Iran and Libya, from which imports are already effectively banned.
And the timing for such a tax is dreadful. Few lawmakers are willing to add to the burden of higher oil prices with an oil tax.
PROSPECTS: Nil.
 
7 Conserve Electricity
Nationwide, the Energy Depart ment says, utilities burn about 650,000 barrels of oil a day, accounting for about 6 percent of their fuel. But New York and New Eng land get about a third of their electricity from oil-powered generating plants.
If electricity demand falls, many utilities continue to use the same amount of coal, hydroelectric and nuclear power, and the cut in output comes from lowering their use of oil. Conversely, if demand rises, the increase is met by burning oil because the plants that use cheaper fuels are already in full use.
Of the 870,000 barrels of oil used each day in New England, 158,000 go to generate electricity, said Armond M. Cohen, senior attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston group that has negotiated efficiency programs with utilities. Putting more insulation in home attics and walls, wrapping water heaters and pipes, installing low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators and putting in fluorescent lighting where appropriate can cut consumption by 15 to 20 percent in electrically heated houses, he said. These improvements can yield direct oil savings if the houses use oil for heat; if they use gas, they can save gas that would be available elsewhere as a substitute for oil. Many such changes could also be made in the commercial sector.
In their manufacturing processes, most factories use big electric motors and put brakes on them to adjust them to the proper speed, and they use big pumps and reduce the flow to the proper level by forcing the pump to strain against a valve. If these companies bought smaller motors or variable-speed motors, which consume less power when less work is needed, and they modernized their lighting, they could save 12 to 15 percent of their electric consumption, Mr. Cohen said.
In many cases, he said, it costs less to save a kilowatt-hour of electricity than to buy the oil to produce it.
But even if such conservation makes sense economically, there are barriers. ''It's rare to find a business that will spend to improve energy efficiency if it doesn't pay back in a year or two,'' Mr. Cohen said, although a utility will build a new generator to meet inflated demand, while projecting a payback of 15 or 20 years.
And ''most homeowners are so cash constrained that if they face a $2,000 or $3,000 investment that pays back in six months, they won't do it,'' he said.
PROSPECTS: Despite resistance, increasingly efficient electrical use is likely. Many states, driven by worries about acid rain and climatic change as well as the oil crisis, will establish regulations that reward electric companies for selling less power.
 
8 Give Tax Breaks To Drillers
In addition to the standard corporate income tax, oil drill ers in the United States are taxed on revenues, in the form of royalties, which they pay to landowners on all oil taken from the ground, and severance taxes, which are based on the amount produced. When times are bad, this encourages the abandonment of marginal wells, some experts say, because the Government is taking a portion of the revenues, which are already lower than expenses.
Robinson West, president of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting firm, said the United States should follow the example of countries that tax profits; it would reap proportionally more in good years and would avoid depressing production in bad ones.
Mr. Eck of Amoco argues that the 1986 tax law penalizes projects with a heavy start-up investment and slow recovery of resources, like drilling for hard-to-get deposits. An investment tax credit or accelerated depreciation to reduce taxes on those projects and unconventional gas wells could stimulate production, he said.
But some drilling companies will report record profits this year, making it hard to argue that they deserve tax breaks.
PROSPECTS: The mood in Washington is to cut spending and raise taxes to close the budget deficit. Giving drillers more money is unlikely.
 
9 Breathe New Life Into Nuclear Power
Opponents of nu clear power have a long list of prerequi sites: solve the waste storage prob lem, ''prove'' nu clear power is safe, insulate customers from the effects of cost overruns, exhaust the potential for improved efficiency first.
Many utilities agree. They do not want to be stuck with radioactive wastes, they are afraid of cost overruns, and they would prefer not to build anything.
''Nuclear is a long-range solution,'' said Timothy Guzzle, chief executive officer of Teco Energy, the parent of the Tampa Electric Company.
PROSPECTS: For now, none.
 
10 Do Nothing; Wait and See
Drillers are find ing oil a lot faster than customers are using it. Proved re serves, or oil found and waiting to be pumped, rose by 50 percent in the 1980's. True, these reserves are not in North America, but in the long term, the supply of willing sellers seems large. Some, notably the Saudis, are determined not to let the price get too high, lest substitutes be found. The oil market will have occasional wild periods, as in 1973 and 1979, but the long-term average price is likely to be moderate.
Constructing an energy policy, winning public support and enforcing the rules is expensive, inconvenient and a little painful. And it must compete for attention with problems like a budget deficit, a shaky economy, an education crisis, homelessness, the environment and the drug problem.
PROSPECTS: For doing little, excellent.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Mitterrand Says Iraqi Withdrawal Could Help End Mideast Disputes

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 24

 BODY:
President Francois Mitterrand of France said today that an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait could help settle other Middle East disputes, like the Arab-Israeli conflict, and bring about a regional disarmament accord for which diplomats said Iraq might then take credit.
His remarks, delivered on the opening day of the General Assembly's annual debate, appeared calculated to establish a bridge with the beleaguered Iraqi Government by telling President Saddam Hussein that he could still save face if he withdrew from Kuwait.
The Persian Gulf crisis is expected to dominate the political agenda of the 45th General Assembly session. Also addressing the Assembly today was the Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, whose country has a 750-mile border with Iraq and is rebuilding relations with Baghdad after an eight-year war. 
Mr. Velayati pledged that Iran would abide by the sanctions against Iraq adopted by the United Nations Security Council.
''It is the firm conviction of the Islamic republic of Iran that faithful commitment to and compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions by all parties, particularly Iraq, is the only path to the establishment of peace and tranquillity in the area,'' he said. ''The Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirms its intention to comply with relevant Security Council resolutions in line with its obligations under the Charter.''
 
Iran Sees a Discrepancy
But Mr. Velayati criticized the Security Council for reacting so firmly to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait after failing to impose similar sanctions when Iraq attacked Iran 10 years ago.
Reports attributed to intelligence officials and to Middle Eastern oil industry sources have said that Iraq has discussed a deal with Iran in which Baghdad would provide 200,000 barrels of oil a day to Teheran in return for food and medicines. Iran has steadfastly denied the reports, and Mr. Velayati seemed to underscore those denials today.
Mr. Mitterrand was careful in his presentation to remain firm in opposing the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait. The French President, who has ordered ships, warplanes and about 4,000 troops to the gulf, called Iraq a ''warlike state.'' He said there could be ''no compromise'' with Baghdad as long as it rejected the Security Council's order to withdraw its forces and allow the Kuwaiti Government to resume power.
But Mr. Mitterrand seemed pessimistic about the prospects for an Iraqi withdrawal. ''Not one gesture, not one word from the President of Iraq has given us a glimpse, a hope of reconciliation,'' he said.
 
France's Warning to Iraq
He said France had told Iraq that it would side with any country in the region that became a victim of aggression.
His words suggested that France would join with the United States and other countries in defending Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations from any further Iraqi attack. The remark also implied that France would support Israel if Iraq tried to provoke an Arab-Israeli confrontation.
The idea of linking a resolution of the Kuwaiti crisis to a wider Middle East settlement is not new. Spokesmen for President Hussein have talked repeatedly of the need for a comprehensive settlement that would link the Kuwaiti issue to the settlement of disputes between Arab countries and Israel. Mr. Hussein has also called for a plebiscite in Kuwait.
But President Mitterrand appears to be the first Western leader to have publicly suggested that the Iraqi President could offset the humiliation of giving up Kuwait by claiming he is breaking the impasse in Middle East diplomacy.
 
Mitterrand Offers a Scenario
In a discourse that French officials said often departed from his prepared text, Mr. Mitterrand said that if Iraq would ''declare its determination to withdraw from Kuwait and free the hostages,'' then ''everything might be possible.''
Without explaining how it could come about, the French President said ''the international community'' could then guarantee the withdrawal of foreign forces from the gulf region, as well as ''the democratic expression of the Kuwaiti people's will.''
This would be followed by what Mr. Mitterrand called ''a third stage'' replacing ''confrontation with the dynamics of good neighborliness and security and peace for each country.'' He spoke of a direct dialogue, with an international conference eventually serving ''as a catalyst for a solution.''
The French President said the solution would involve a settlement of the Lebanese conflict and a resolution of the Palestinian issue. It would also mean that Israel was no longer ''living in constant insecurity,'' he said.
In what he called a fourth stage, Mr. Mitterrand said he could envisage a ''mutually agreed reduction of armaments'' in the Middle East. He said the cuts should cover an area extending ''from Iran to Morocco,'' implying disarmament by both Iraq and Israel.
 
No Promise to Hussein
The French President did not specifically say that Mr. Hussein could claim political credit if Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait led to a breakthrough in the search for a Middle East peace settlement. But diplomats said that such a tradeoff was implicit in his remarks.
In Washington, President Bush restated his opposition to linking an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait with any other issue, although he did not address President Mitterrand's proposal.
At a White House meeting with Arab-Americans, Mr. Bush said, ''Our objectives remain clear: Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately, and without condition.'' At another point, he said, ''We must also resist his attempt - Saddam Hussein's attempt - to link the Iraqi invasion with other conflicts.''
Mr. Mitterrand's address dominated the opening session of the Assembly's general debate, in which heads of government and foreign ministers outline their views on world problems.

HEADLINE: Bush Rejects Delays in Deadline For Automatic Cuts in Spending

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Tightening the political screws a notch, the White House stressed today that President Bush would reject any measure extending the Oct. 1 deadline for across-the-board spending cuts.
Without a change in the budget law, or an agreement between Congress and the President to lower the Federal budget deficit, spending for most Government programs will automatically be reduced by more than 30 percent over the fiscal year. The process will begin on the first day of the new fiscal year, this Monday.
The immediate furloughs of thousands of Federal employees could result in flight cancellations and havoc at major airports, long lines at tax, Social Security and immigration offices and delays of trials in Federal courts. 
 
Not the Usual Game of Chicken
Games of political chicken are commonplace in Washington, with the President and lawmakers approaching an absolute deadline before one or the other swerves or a compromise is struck.
But the political oratory has reached such heights this time and the differences boil down to such fundamental principles that it will be more difficult than usual for either party to back down.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the veto threat was serious, and it was taken seriously by Congressional leaders of both parties, meeting separately today.
The automatic cuts, Mr. Fitzwater told reporters, ''are an important discipline.''
''They were put there by Congress to enforce decision-making,'' he said, ''and we won't agree they should be extended.''
Richard G. Darman, the budget director, took the same stance after a meeting with the Republican Congressional leadership, saying, ''If you get into the business of suspending and suspending and suspending, we will be at it for 114 years.''
Mr. Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and John H. Sununu, the President's chief of staff, met again tonight with top Congressional leaders from both parties in the sixth meeting they have held in the last week on their differences over the budget.
The main division appears to be over President Bush's determination to lower the capital gains tax rate and the Democrats' insistence that any cut in that rate be accompanied by a higher income tax for the wealthy.
 
Debate Over Capital Gains
Mr. Bush maintains that a reduction in the capital gains rate is essential to stimulate a weakened economy. The Democrats counter that the benefits would go largely to the wealthy and that the price of deficit-reduction would thus be paid by people with modest incomes and even the poor.
Mr. Fitzwater and other Republicans emphasize that important differences also remain over spending limits and the procedures to enforce whatever agreement is reached. But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, has conceded that the tax issue is the main sticking point.
At the Republican leadership meeting today, according to people who were there, Mr. Brady wondered aloud whether room existed to ''split the difference.''
Mr. Darman reportedly replied, ''Split the difference? What difference?''
Some Congressional staff assistants took that exchange to indicate divisions in the White House team, but others said it was just idle talk.
 
Few Back Suggestions on Impasse
The suggestions made by Mr. Dole over the last few days to break the deadlock appear to have gained little support at the White House or among Republicans in the House of Representatives.
Mr. Dole has proposed that the issues of capital gains taxes and tax rates on the wealthy be subjected to a separate vote from that on other deficit-reduction measures. On Sunday, he hinted that he might favor some way of eliminating the part of the tax system that allows the wealthy to pay a lower rate on the last dollars they earn than the rate paid by taxpayers who are somewhat less affluent.
All sides agree that a condition of any budget compromise is that it have the support of a majority of lawmakers from both parties in each house of Congress.
''It's a very delicate process of coalition-building,'' said Mr. Darman, perhaps indicating that the White House could not back any idea that could not carry the votes of a majority of Republican Representatives.
Several Republicans today gave speeches on the House floor blaming the Democratic leadership for the impasse and vowing to oppose any tax increase.
 
Panels Work on Legislation
Committees in both houses are working on legislation that would extend until later next month the requirements of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law for automatic, across-the-board spending cuts.
No firm action on these bills is expected until late this week.
A measure scheduled to go before the House Rules Committee on Tuesday would extend the deadline for automatic spending cuts until Oct. 20, continue spending authority for Government agencies until that date and provide $2 billion requested by the President for military operations in the Persian Gulf.
If this measure gains the support of the Democratic Congressional leadership, it would likely pass, but probably by an insufficient margin to withstand a Presidential veto.
Democrats are of several minds about extending the deadline. Some fear the disruption that would occur if the indiscriminate spending reductions go into effect. Others worry that the President could pin the blame on Democrats for whatever damage or inconvenience voters suffer from the cuts.
One person who sat through the Democratic leadership meeting today said the prevailing view seemed to be that automatic spending cuts ''would cause havoc for Republicans too'' and that the Democrats should do nothing to stop them.

HEADLINE: Apartment Doubling-Up Hits the Working Class

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Willie Avery Jr. is the kind of hard-working, tax-paying citizen who forms the bedrock of any community. But he cannot afford his own New York City apartment, so he and his wife, Sonja, and their two small daughters live with relatives in a small house in Springfield Gardens, Queens: 10 people jammed into four bedrooms.
Doubling-up, once mainly the plight of the poorest of New York's poor, has become an affliction of the working class. Affordable housing has become so hard to find that the number of families forced to live doubled- and tripled-up has increased markedly in the last few years, housing experts say.
In housing projects alone, the number of two- and three-family households has doubled in seven years, according to housing officials, who estimate that at least 100,000 people live doubled-up in projects. Labor leaders say crowded housing is among the gravest concerns of workers. 
For these families, temporary stays with relatives and friends are often grueling ordeals that strain marriages and friendships. Adults have little privacy and children readily pass around illnesses and find it difficult to study for school.
At the Averys' temporary quarters, now populated by Mrs. Avery's mother, uncle, a brother-in-law, two sisters and one of their children, the line can be long for the only bathroom. The kitchen is used in shifts.
Their long-term prospect is worse. Like many others in their circumstances, the Averys' ordeal may be only a stop on the way to homelessness.
Mr. Avery worked for 28 years at the same job, distributing chemicals at an auto parts factory in Woodside, Queens. He was earning $30,000 a year when he had heart-bypass surgery in January. He has been out of work ever since, and has seen his weekly income of $600 shrink to a $105 disability check. His family was evicted from their apartment in Hollis in June because they could not pay the rent.
Now they cannot afford even the $360 a month Mrs. Avery's mother asks for the two small bedrooms in which the family has been living. She has ordered them out by the end of the month.
''I might have to go on welfare,'' said Mr. Avery, a wiry man with a dark beard and glasses who looks considerably younger than his 49 years. ''I don't want to, but I might have to.''
The number of families that became homeless increased sharply and unexpectedly in July and August, city officials said last week. The increase forced the city to begin moving families back into welfare hotels, breaking a promise two years ago to stop using the hotels by this past summer.
City officials attributed the increase to their recent success in providing permanent apartments for homeless families living in hotels and shelters. They speculated that families who had been living doubled-up may have decided to declare themselves homeless to qualify for the apartments.
Many housing experts agreed with that, but added that the economics of New York housing had contributed significantly to the increase in crowding and homelessness.
When asked how far up the economic ladder crowding went, Peter Marcuse, a professor of urban planing at Columbia University, said, ''I can tell you that it goes right through tenured college professors.'' He lives with a daughter and her foster child in his small Manhattan apartment.
The reasons for such crowding are clear. Rents on vacant apartments have increased more sharply in the last decade than many people's incomes. The city has begun an ambitious effort to produce new housing, but cannot begin to meet the demand.
 
No Trickle Down
Overcrowding is expanding even in New York's real-estate slump. Housing prices have fallen and some rents for luxury apartments have declined, but that has had no effect on housing for the less affluent.
''The real-estate market's woes do not mean that the affordable housing problem has been solved,'' said Eric H. Weinstock, director of the housing research project of the Community Training and Resource Center, a nonprofit agency. ''It really doesn't matter much to these people that a studio apartment that was selling for $120,000 has dropped to $90,000.''
The statistics show a big gap between families' incomes and housing costs. The median household income in New York in 1987 was $20,000 a year, according to the city's most recent housing survey. The median renter's income was $16,000 a year.
Most of those in such households -as well as those earning $25,000 or $30,000 - could not buy an apartment or house, even at lower prices. Many cannot afford to rent, either. ''And rental rates have not dropped significantly,'' Mr. Weinstock said.
 
'We Couldn't Afford It'
A family making $20,000 a year can afford a monthly rent of about $500, under conventional guidelines. But a vacant two-bedroom apartment in most neighborhoods - including many of the most impoverished and crime-ridden areas - rents for at least $600 to $700 a month, many experts say.
Sandy D. and her husband, Gary, together make $22,000 a year at their jobs at a Queens garment factory. After getting married last winter, they lived in a furnished studio in Forest Hills that rented for $650 a month.
''We couldn't afford it,'' Sandy said. ''We either had money for rent and no money for food, or money for food and no money for rent.''
After four months, they moved in with Gary's mother, who has a three-bedroom apartment in the East Tremont section of the Bronx. Ten to 12 people shared the apartment. $700 Is Too Much The couple eventually wound up in a city shelter in Brooklyn. Because Sandy is pregnant - she is expecting to give birth to twins in about a week -they were given a pleasant room of their own in a special section. ''We were not the only working couple there,'' Sandy recalled.
After two months in the shelter, Sandy and Gary moved in with her mother in Forest Hills. They can stay there for a while, but ultimately they want to move on. ''My mother has her own life,'' Sandy said. ''Plus I'm married; I have my own responsibilities. I want a place of my own.''
But she has no idea how she will afford one. If Sandy and Gary were to pay 30 percent of their gross income for rent - the conventional standard -they could afford $550 a month. A two-bedroom apartment almost anywhere in Queens costs at least $700 or $800 a month, said Sandy, who has looked at many apartments. ''It depresses me a lot,'' she said. Doubled-up families encompass a wide range of people. Some are young couples like Sandy and Gary, forced to seek shelter temporarily with parents. Others are single mothers, many of them still teen-agers, who raise their children in their own parents' apartments. Still others are immigrants, many recently arrived, sharing small quarters with their extended families.
''Overcrowding is probably the classic way of dealing with a housing shortage,'' said Mr. Marcuse of Columbia.
No one knows precisely how many families are living with friends or relatives in New York City. ''The standard measures are so restrictive that we don't have a firm estimate of the scope of the problem,'' said Bonnie Brower, executive director of the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Development, a coalition of community groups.
Many experts say they believe estimates by the city's Housing Authority provide the best measure of the problem. Those estimates come from school and utility records, staff reports and even the agency's own waiting list. Thousands of those applying for apartments list their current addresses as other apartments in the projects, where they are living with friends or relatives.
 
Largest Since World War II
In 1983, the Housing Authority estimated that 50,000 people were living doubled-up in city projects, the largest total since after World War II, when returning veterans married and, because of a housing shortage, moved in with family members.
Today, the total is twice what it was. About 20 percent of the 178,000 city project apartments contain more than one family, an arrangement that is against housing rules but almost never enforced. Most of the projects' authorized tenants - more than 70 percent of the households - work for a living.
The city's triennial housing report, which measures apartment crowding citywide, estimates the number of people a room, excluding kitchens and bathrooms. The most recent report showed that in 1987 the number of ''seriously crowded apartments,'' those with more than 1.5 people a room, increased to 42,000 from 29,000 in 1978. To be considered seriously crowded, a two-bedroom apartment would have to contain five or more people.
This growing population encompasses some of the people that city officials say are so difficult to count in census enumerations. The officials say many such families tend to move from place to place and fear talking to government representatives.
The Community Service Society, a nonprofit social-welfare organization, estimated in 1986 that 103,000 families living below the poverty level were doubled up. Tens of thousands of other families above poverty level are also crowded, said Victor Bach, the society's director of housing policy and research.
''I'm not sure it's acceptable by American standards of housing,'' Mr. Bach said. ''It's not a stable form of housing for many families.''
Jaime Estades, a social worker for District 65 of the United Auto Workers, surveyed the union's Hispanic members last year. Housing was cited as their most serious problem.
''We're talking about people who are working, who are members of the union,'' Mr. Estades said. ''They cannot even have an apartment of their own. The American dream does not exist for them.''
 
'Really Pretty Hopeless'
Some unions try to keep members informed about new apartments completed by the city under its $5.1 billion housing effort. But the apartments are scooped up quickly under a lottery system, and many are set aside for the homeless and for families earning $25,000 to $30,000 a year. The Housing Authority has a waiting list of 180,000.
''It's really pretty hopeless in New York City,'' said George Bailey, director of the members assistance program for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.
Mr. Estades of the auto workers union said: ''They come here and say, 'Help me.' There is so much frustration in saying, 'We cannot do anything.' ''
''Living overcrowded drives the families crazy,'' he added. ''But what else can they do?''
Mr. Avery said he has begun looking for a place to live after he leaves his mother-in-law's house, but has found nothing under $700 a month.
''I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said. ''I shouldn't have to go through this after working 28 years.''

HEADLINE: Khrushchev on Rosenbergs: Stoking Old Embers

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Nearly four decades after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for conspiring to pass America's atomic bomb secrets to the Soviet Union, the case that has haunted scholars, historians and partisans of the left and the right has found a new witness: Nikita S. Khrushchev.
But the late Soviet leader's testimony - praise for the Rosenbergs in a newly disclosed memoir that seems to reaffirm the verdict of the court that condemned them in 1953 - is unlikely to settle a matter that has generated passionate books and an endless debate that swirls with intrigue and mirrors an age of nuclear fear and cold-war doubt.
From Stalin and from the longtime Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav M. Molotov, the memoir says, Khrushchev learned that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg had ''provided very significant help in accelerating the production of our atomic bomb.''
''Let this be a worthy tribute to the memory of those people,'' the memoir says of the Rosenbergs. ''Let my words serve as an expression of gratitude to those who sacrificed their lives to a great cause of the Soviet state at a time when the U.S. was using its advantage over our state to blackmail our state and undermine its proletarian cause.'' 
The reaction yesterday was like much of the controversy that has engulfed the case for years: fervent and inconclusive.
''That is absolute nonsense,'' said Michael Meeropol, a son of the Rosenbergs, who with his brother, Robert, has written books, filed lawsuits and struggled for years to obtain secret Government documents in the case and clear their parents' names.
But Ronald Radosh, co-author with Joyce Milton of ''The Rosenberg File,'' a 1983 book that concluded that Julius Rosenberg was a spy and that Ethel Rosenberg was at least aware of his activities, called the Khrushchev memoir ''formidable evidence,'' and added, ''This comes as a vindication for our theory that espionage was going on.''
Federal Judge Irving R. Kaufman, who presided at the Rosenbergs' 1951 trial and passed the death sentences, declined to comment on the Khrushchev memoirs, saying he had made it a policy never to comment on cases.
The Khrushchev memoir, excerpted in this week's issue of Time magazine, is to be published next month by Little, Brown & Company, as the third and final volume of ''Khrushchev Remembers,'' subtitled ''The Glasnost Tapes.''
 
Dictated After Fall From Power
Between his fall from power in 1964 and his death in 1971, Khrushchev dictated hundreds of hours of reminiscences of his life and work in the inner circles of Soviet power. The tapes were the basis of two previous volumes, published in 1970 and 1974.
According to Little, Brown, Khrushchev's family withheld some of the tapes dealing with sensitive issues, fearing that he had gone too far, for example, in criticizing powerful living people. The tapes were smuggled to the West.
The memoir is the latest piece of circumstantial evidence in a case that J. Edgar Hoover called ''the crime of the century,'' and that the Columbia Law Review called ''the outstanding political trial of this generation.''
The Rosenbergs were accused of having received atomic secrets from Ethel Rosenberg's brother, David Greenglass, a machinist at the Los Alamos, N.M., atomic bomb plant, and of having passed them to Moscow.
Mr. Greenglass, the chief witness against them, was later sentenced to 15 years in prison. After appeals and public protests, the Rosenbergs were put to death on June 19, 1953.
Defenders of the Rosenbergs say they were victims of a Government conspiracy, that the evidence was coerced and manufactured, and that they were unfairly tried and executed in an atmosphere of cold-war hysteria. The Government contends that the evidence was convincing if circumstantial.
The Meeropols, who were children at the time of the execution and took the name of their adoptive parents, have spent 15 years struggling with the Government to obtain documents that they contend would prove that the Rosenbergs were framed.
In a telephone interview yesterday from Springfield, Mass., where he is a professor of economics at Western New England College, Michael Meeropol called the Khrushchev memoir ''absurd,'' and noted that the director of the nameless city where the Soviet Union developed its first atomic bomb denied last year any involvement by the Rosenbergs.
The director, Boris V. Brokhovich, told The New York Times in an interview that development of the bomb had been a matter of trial and error. ''You sat the Rosenbergs in the electric chair for nothing,'' he said. ''We got nothing from the Rosenbergs.''
Mr. Radosh, a professor of American history at Queensboro Community College, also said that, with the end of the cold war, the Soviet Union and its former East European satellites might release information vital to historians and scholars on cases like that of the Rosenbergs, but he said he believed that would only reaffirm the verdict.
''I think the Soviets want to own up to this in the post-cold-war world,'' he said. ''They want to get Stalinism behind them, and these Khrushchev memoirs are part of that process.''

HEADLINE: End to Pakistan Aid Is Sought Over Nuclear Issue

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Asserting that Pakistan has ignored American demands to curtail its program to develop nuclear weapons, a leading member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee has urged President Bush to cut off all military and economic aid to Islamabad.
The urging that aid be cut off was made in a Sept. 19 letter to President Bush by Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs and an influential lawmaker on the issue of aid to Pakistan.
The letter comes as the White House is considering the issue of Pakistan's nuclear intentions and it signals a re-emergence of the policy debate over Islamabad's nuclear activities.
 
Certification Required
To continue its aid program to Pakistan, the Administration must certify that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear weapon and that American assistance to Pakistan will reduce the risk that Pakistan will acquire such a device. That decision, which is required by law, is usually made before the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. A senior Administration official declined to comment on the status of President Bush's decision, saying the decision involved ''extremely delicate'' foreign policy issues. 
On the one hand, advances in the Pakistani nuclear program are making it increasingly difficult for the White House to make such a certification. On the other hand, Bush Administration officials are pleased that Pakistan is contributing troops to the multinational forces defending Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Solarz, however, said in an interview that Mr. Bush should decide against certification because of continued advances in the Pakistani nuclear program.
''For over a decade there has been a growing temptation to look the other way,'' Mr. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat, said, noting Pakistan's past role in funneling aid to the Afghan rebels.
''We have now reached the point where continuing to certify would deprive us of what tattered shreds may be left of our global nonproliferation policy,'' Mr. Solarz said, adding that this was the first time he had publicly opposed certification.
 
Basis of Cutoff Request
In calling for an aid cutoff, Mr. Solarz cited news reports that Pakistan is continuing to enrich uranium and procure equipment for its nuclear program, as well as conversations he has had with Administration specialists about the Pakistani nuclear program. The United States provides about $500 million a year to Pakistan in military and economic aid.
Mr. Solarz's letter drew criticism from a senior Administration official, who declined to be identified. ''This is not a particularly good time to bash the Pakistanis,'' the official said, noting that Pakistan is contributing troops to the multinational force in the Persian Gulf region and has just undergone a change of government.
In addition, the official complained that Congress was taking a tougher stance toward Pakistan's nuclear activities than toward India, which exploded a nuclear device in 1974.
But at the same time the senior Administration official said continued progress by the Pakistanis on nuclear issues made the certification question ''a very difficult issue.'' Leonard S. Spector, an expert on nuclear proliferation issues for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that Mr. Solarz's letter was significant because the lawmaker has been a major participant in the Washington policy debate over Pakistan and because the letter would send an alarming message to the Indians.
''You want to be in a position to take a firm stance on Iraq's nuclear future and impose tough restrictions when this crisis is over,'' Mr. Spector said.
In his letter to Mr. Bush, Mr. Solarz wrote, ''On the basis of a number of reports I've received from unclassified sources, I have the impression that Pakistan's commitments to respect the various markers we set last year have not been met.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. Views Threat by Iraq As Strategy to Split Critics

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials said today that Saddam Hussein's threat Sunday to attack Israel and Saudi Arabian oilfields if trade sanctions ''strangled'' Iraq's economy appears to be part of Baghdad's continuing political strategy to split the international coalition opposing Iraq.
But they said that discounting the tone of comments as merely threatening bravado would be a repetition of a mistake the Administration made in July, before Iraq invaded Kuwait, when it underestimated the Iraqi President's willingness to take military action.
''It's a deliberate step in his plan to keep what he's got and drive our coalition apart,'' said one Pentagon official. ''At the same time, we're not sloughing this off. He has the capability to do these things.'' 
By invoking fears of an attack on Israel and projecting images of oilfields burning out of control to send oil prices soaring and plunging Western economies deeply into recession, the Iraqi leader was trying to make the costs of war sound so horrific as to discourage any attack against Baghdad, officials explained.
 
'A Daily Diatribe'
While the officials acknowledged the statements marked an escalation in Mr. Hussein's bellicose oratory, they took pains to note that the threats were conveyed within an established context of intimidating public displays and comments emanating from Baghdad. ''We get a daily diatribe from Saddam, and this is another one of them,'' said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater.
Iraq announced Sunday that Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was canceling a visit to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly because the United States would not permit his Iraqi airliner to land.
State Department officials said the Mr. Aziz could take a commercial flight to New York, but that no Iraqi government plane would be allowed to land while Baghdad held hostage the 1,000 Americans remaining in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
President Bush today reiterated the Administration's position against any negotiations with Baghdad until Iraq abided by the United Nations sanctions, and withdrew its forces from Kuwait.
In doing so, Mr. Bush noted the lack of success that Arab leaders, including Jordan's King Hussein, have had in brokering a settlement.
''Whoever else has stepped up to the plate, they have struck out because of this man's insistence on remaining in Kuwait,'' Mr. Bush told a group of leaders from the Arab-American community at the White House.
 
Pressures on Jordan
Earlier in the day, Mr. Fitzwater's comments about King Hussein were even more pointed. When asked about the king's call for the removal of American troops from Saudi Arabia, Mr. Fitzwater said that the Jordanian monarch ''has some difficult pressures on him, but nevertheless, we are disappointed in the conduct of that country at this point.''
When pressed by the Arab-American group to explain the objective of American involvement in the Gulf, President Bush said it was to thwart hostile aggression: ''Iraq is no model of democracy, nor was Kuwait. That isn't the question here. The question is international law and respect for one's neighbor.''
For Government officials and Middle East scholars who have been trying to weigh Mr. Hussein's real intentions, his increasingly threatening comments in recent days recalled the days just before the invasion of Kuwait, when the Iraqi leader's ominous rhetoric was discounted in Washington as well as European and Arab capitals.
Although Iraqi forces are currently arrayed in a defensive posture along the Saudi border, military experts said an Iraqi rocket attack against Israel or Saudi oilfields would not require extensive preparation.
Administration officials said they were discouraged that Mr. Hussein has so far shown no sign of seeking a way out of the crisis. If anything, they said, his dismemberment of Kuwait, including a decision enacted today to replace the Kuwaiti currency with the Iraqi dinar, suggested a commitment to remain as an occupying power.
Today brought no change in the tone or substance of Mr. Hussein's warnings.
''Kuwait is Iraqi and we won't give it up even if we fight over it for a thousand years,'' Baghdad radio quoted Mr. Hussein as saying today.
 
Israeli Reaction
JERUSALEM, Sept. 24 (Special to The New York Times) - Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned today that Israel stood ready to ''repay'' any attack by Iraq.
Responding to the most bellicose statement yet from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Israeli officials sought to keep the low profile requested by the United States. But all used almost the same words, saying they took the threat seriously.
''We of course, are taking his threats seriously and preparing for them,'' Mr. Shamir told Israel radio this evening, ''to anticipate, prevent and, God forbid, if he'll really attack, to repay him.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
East Germans to Supply Equipment to Gulf Force

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Sept. 24

 BODY:
About half the military aid promised by West Germany for the buildup of forces in the Persian Gulf will be in the form of East German military equipment, the Government spokesman said today.
The spokesman, Hans Klein, said that of the $1 billion in military equipment pledged by Chancellor Helmut Kohl when he met with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on Sept. 15, $460 million would come from the East German Army, which will merge with the West German Army when the two countries unite on Oct. 3.
The military aid is part of a total package of about $2 billion that also includes economic aid to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey. But West German officials have acknowledged that much of the money was pledged before Mr. Kohl and Mr. Baker met. 
Mr. Klein confirmed the plan to send military equipment after it was reported by Die Welt, a daily, and Der Spiegel magazine. The spokesman said that weapons were not part of the package, but that it might include protective equipment against nuclear, chemical and biological attacks. He said that some of the equipment being provided might be Soviet-made.
 
Trucks and Cranes
Die Welt reported Saturday that the Defense Ministry was considering sending East German trucks, radio equipment, electric generators, cranes, water transport vehicles and engineering equipment.
American diplomats said they were not surprised by the inclusion of East German equipment in the package, noting that the army was probably the best-equipped in the Warsaw Pact and that much of its equipment is new.
Der Spiegel said in a report published today that the Americans were irritated when they learned that they would be receiving East German equipment. But officials at the United States Embassy denied this.
The East German Army has been disintegrating since the move toward reunification began last winter, and Die Welt said that army officers were complaining that it had become increasingly difficult to guard the stores.
When Mr. Baker visited Mr. Kohl in Ludwigshafen on Sept. 15, the Chancellor said that the West German Government would contribute $2.06 billion toward the American-led effort to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Mr. Baker greeted the announcement and said the package was ''substantially'' larger than the aid that Bonn had discussed earlier.
The West Germans say that their Constitution bars them from taking part directly in military operations outside the NATO region, and they have not sent troops to the Gulf. But Mr. Kohl is known to be sensitive to any perception that the Germans, with their economic strength, are not helping defend Western interests.
Beyond military equipment, the package announced by Mr. Kohl included $840 million in aid to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey to help them overcome the losses incurred through the blockade against Iraq.
How much of the package constitutes new aid is in dispute.
A spokesman for the Ministry of International Cooperation said that of the $609 million promised to Egypt, for example, $147 million had been pledged before the Kohl-Baker meeting, and $337 million was aid that had been delayed until Egypt met certain conditions. Thus only $125 million of the $609 million was fresh money for the package. [In Washington, a State Department official said that Mr. Kohl had told Mr. Baker that some of the equipment pledged was coming from East Germany, but that it was new. [The official said that Mr. Baker apparently did not press Mr. Kohl on any issue other than whether all of the money for Egypt and other countries was actually being sent after Aug. 2, the day that Iraq invaded Kuwait. Mr. Kohl assured him that it was, the official added.] A West German Government minister acknowledged last week at a briefing that the $2.06 billion package included money that was allocated before the meeting.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Convoy Heads to Baghdad With Powdered Milk, but No Exemptions

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 24

 BODY:
A convoy of more than 40 tractor-trailers loaded with food set out from this capital at dusk today on a 570-mile journey across a desert road to Baghdad.
The convoy's sponsors were a group of Palestinian volunteer agencies based in Jordan, and their action in dispatching the food supplies was an opening shot in what is likely to be a protracted battle. At issue are the United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq, and how much food, and under what arrangements, will be permitted to pass through the blockade that the United Nations Security Council has imposed on Baghdad.
The organizers of the convoy said they had not sought exemption from the Security Council's sanctions committee for the convoy, as required under the terms of the sanctions, because their undertaking was a humanitarian one. The organizers said the cartons of powdered milk, sugar, rice, pasta and vegetables were to be unloaded sometime Tuesday evening and turned over to the Iraqi Labor Ministry in Baghdad. They said the food was intended for Iraqi children. 
 
Children Chant Slogans
Hundreds of children who gathered to see the tractor-trailers depart chanted slogans in support of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. ''With our souls and blood,'' the children shouted, ''we sacrifice ourselves to you, Saddam.''
On Sunday, apparently prompted by tightening food shortages, Mr. Hussein issued a warning to the United States and other nations with military forces deployed against Iraq that Baghdad would not allow its 16 million people to be ''strangled'' by the United Nations embargo. Mr. Hussein implied that Iraq might mount pre-emptive strikes against Israel and against oilfields in Saudi Arabia and other Arab states arrayed against Iraq.
Mr. Hussein's statement set the stage for what diplomats here and in Baghdad said today is likely to be a new, and, for the United States and its allies, increasingly awkward phase of the confrontation with Iraq.
Mr. Hussein has already indicated that he intends to use the specter of food shortages in Iraq to weaken and perhaps break the common front among nations that have condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The diplomats predicted that Baghdad would increasingly publicize scenes of Iraqi women and children, in particular, suffering from food shortages.
An official representing a United Nations relief agency in Amman put it bluntly. ''How long will the Americans be able to hold to the embargo when the television news begins to show shots of hungry children?'' he said.
The situation poses a dilemma for Jordan, which is caught between strong support for Iraq among its 3.5 million people and a desire not to alienate Western nations that are its main sources of aid. Senior officials on the Government's Higher Committee for Relief, set up to handle refugees from the invasion arriving in Jordan, said tonight that they had no knowledge of the food convoy heading for Iraq.
A senior Foreign Ministry official said that the Government had not approved the convoy. ''I didn't have any idea about this,'' he said.
 
Shipments Subject to Approval
When it voted 10 days ago to approve shipments of food through the embargo ''to relieve human suffering,'' the Security Council authorized its sanctions committee to review specific cases and approve shipments. The Council ruled that food should be provided ''through the United Nations in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross or other appropriate humanitarian agencies and distributed by them or under their supervision in order to insure that they reach the intended beneficiaries.''
Officials of the United Nations committee in New York say that only one exemption has been granted - to India, the nation that pressed the issue hardest. The committee gave permission for an Indian ship, the Vishwa Siddhi, to carry 10,000 tons of food for Indian and other Asian residents of Kuwait.
Indian diplomats in Baghdad said today that their Ambassador, Kamal Bakhshi, was in Umm Qasr, a port in southern Iraq, awaiting the ship's arrival, which United Nations officials said is expected on Tuesday.
Jordan has said that it will abide by the United Nations sanctions. But the Palestinian convoy that left Amman today appeared not to meet the conditions set by the sanctions committee. Abu Mohammed, a spokesman for the General Union of Voluntary Societies, the Palestinian organization that chartered the tractor-trailers, said that distribution of the food would be left to the Iraqi authorities.
United Nations officials said that at least 60,000 Asians are in transit camps around Baghdad, and that conditions there may be worse than anything evacuees encountered when they began pouring into camps in the Jordanian desert last month.
Diplomats who have visited the Baghdad camps said that they are closely guarded by heavily armed Iraqi security forces, that food is extremely scarce, and that there are no organized sanitary arrangements.
United Nations officials here said that information about Asians in the Baghdad camps and about food shortages in Kuwait was extremely sketchy because nearly all United Nations staff members who are not Iraqis or Kuwaitis were evacuated shortly after the Iraqi invasion. But the officials said that Asians who arrived in Jordan over the weekend were markedly weaker than those who arrived only a week ago, and that their accounts of their stays in the Baghdad camps were grim.
''What we are seeing is just the tip of the iceberg,'' a United Nations official said. ''I'm afraid that if we don't get more supplies into Iraq, we may end up with some of these people dying before they even get here.''
 
Iran Says It Seized Food
CAIRO, Sept. 24 (Special to The New York Times) - The Iranian authorities said today they had seized 29 people accused of trying to smuggle food across a remote border region into Iraq, the first suggestion that Teheran is enforcing the international embargo imposed after Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait.
The Iranian press agency said two bands of smugglers trying to cross the frontier had been arrested with contraband food including rice, vegetable oil and sugar and had been handed over to a revolutionary court in the northwestern Kurdish-speaking city of Sanandaj. It gave no other details. Iran officially supports the international sanctions imposed on Iraq. But there have been suggestions, despite Iranian denials, that Teheran has agreed with Baghdad to provide food in exchange for oil.
The announcement coincides with a visit to Iran by the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, his first since the Islamic revolution of 1979. Syria is considered Iraq's archrival in Arab politics. The Syrian leader is said by diplomats to be pressing Iran for a tough stance against Baghdad, Teheran's foe in the eight-year gulf war.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Forum on Mideast Crisis Proposed

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Based on the so-called Helsinki process that helped ease East-West tensions over the last 15 years, Spain and Italy proposed today that a broad new organization be created to address security and development problems throughout the Mediterranean and the Middle East.
The initiative, which also has the backing of France and Portugal, was originally born of growing concern that economic problems and population pressures in North Africa would continue to stimulate large-scale emigration to the countries of southern Europe.
''But the gulf crisis has reminded us how, despite the end of the East-West confrontation, the North-South issue remains fundamental if we are to build a new international order,'' Italy's Foreign Minister, Gianni de Michelis, said. 
Underlining the model for their new organization, the plan was unveiled at a meeting in Palma de Mallorca, organized by the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. That conference gave birth to the 1975 Helsinki accords committing signatories to respect human rights and promote democracy.
 
Recalling 'Spirit of Helsinki'
''We must apply the spirit of Helsinki to the Mediterranean and the Middle East,'' Spain's Foreign Minister, Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez, told the meeting today. ''Events in the gulf have shown in a dramatic way the lack of a system for preventing and discussing crises in the area.''
So far, preparations for a Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean have involved Spain, Italy, Portugal and France in Europe and Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya and Mauritania in North Africa. But the plan is that it eventually embrace other nations in Europe and the Middle East as well as the United States and the Soviet Union.
Mr. De Michelis said that both Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization would be invited to take part. Recognizing the possibility of an Israeli boycott, he noted that the Helsinki process operated well despite the absence of one country, Albania.
Spanish officials have said the purpose of the conference is not to resolve specific disputes in the region, but rather to establish a broad code of conduct covering a variety of problems, from the inviolability of borders and democracy to immigration and economic development.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia's Financial Crisis Turns on Mayor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 24

 BODY:
Mayor W. Wilson Goode, a sharecropper's son and self-made man, took office in 1984 amid high hopes that he would put the city on a sound financial footing and help ease the city's racial tensions.
Instead he has led the city to brink of insolvency and has lost support among the city's largely white population and power structure. Elected state officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, say that he has lost so much credibility in Harrisburg, the state capital, that he is now the greatest obstacle in solving the city's deepening fiscal crisis.
Democrats who control the State House of Representatives say there has been a complete collapse of the political process in Philadelphia. And Republican leaders who control the State Senate say they are so outraged by the Democratic Mayor's handling of the city's finances that they will block any solution that does not include a temporary state takeover of the city's management and finances. 
 
City's Fate in Question
The 52-year-old Mayor has flatly ruled out that alternative, setting up a situation where the fate of city employees and services may depend on whether the Mayor or the legislators, who have apparently nothing to lose, will accept defeat first.
''Mayor Goode and his administration are kind of like the alcoholic who says, 'I'm O.K., I don't drink too much; just give me another drink,' '' said State Senator Robert C. Jubelirer, a Republican from Altoona, in western Pennsylvania, who is president pro tempore of the Senate. ''We're not going to throw more money at the Goode administration, or give them more taxing authority, until they admit they have a problem, admit they need help and say they are going to dry out.''
Senator Jubelirer's words only add to a chorus of criticism against the Mayor, who made history here by becoming the city's first black Mayor nearly seven years ago, riding in on a comfortable majority of votes. Back then, it was widely thought that if anyone could forge racial harmony and bring sense to city management and finances, it would be this deeply religious, hard-working man with a master's degree in business from the prestigious Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a reputation for being fair to a fault.
Conservative in dress, speech and manner, he was widely seen as someone who could satisfy the board room without losing the people on the street. A few months after Mr. Goode took office, Walter F. Mondale interviewed him as a possible running mate in the 1984 Presidential election.
 
Fellow Democrat's Doubts
But now Mr. Goode's political star has fallen so low that even Gov. Robert P. Casey, a fellow Democrat, has publicly expressed doubts about the Goode administration. Although Mr. Goode says he has repeatedly briefed the Governor on the severity of the city's financial problems, Mr. Casey told reporters last week that the state would not help the city until the Goode administration provided ''a clear, accurate picture of the extent of the problem.''
Democratic legislative leaders say they will put together a proposed solution by Dec. 1, but not before the Nov. 6 statewide elections. This suggests they fear a backlash from voters elsewhere in the state if they do anything now that could be portrayed as a state rescue of the city. The Governor and nearly all legislators are up for re-election this year. Members of the City Council, which has in the past routinely imposed its own financial plans and ignored Mayor Goode's, are also testing campaign slogans for elections next year. Several are jockeying to succeed the Mayor, who is in his next-to-last year in office and is prohibited from seeking a third consecutive term.
The shifting deadline underscores Mayor Goode's credibility problem in Harrisburg, since he initially said Philadelphia could be insolvent as early as late October. Then last Friday, he announced a variety of accounting measures that he said would postpone insolvency until Dec. 1. ''After that we can't make payroll,'' he said.
Mayor Goode, sitting in his wood-paneled office in City Hall, seems insulated from the howls at his door. ''We have got to change this unproductive course, making groundless charges of mismanagement,'' he said, speaking with the dispassion of an academic in an interview last week. ''A distressed city declaration by the state won't solve the problem, a bankruptcy won't solve the problem, a municipal assistance corporation won't solve the problem. What we need is the taxing authority to solve our own problems.''
The taxing authority is needed because, unlike many other major cities, Philadelphia is not permitted to increase city taxes without approval of the State Legislature.
 
Politics, Race and Class
''I don't understand why state legislators won't help us out,'' he continued, ''not unless something else is involved: politics, race or class or all three.''
Just days earlier, Philadelphia, which has chronically failed to balance its books, was thrown into a financial crisis with the collapse of a deal to borrow $375 million in short-term notes. The money was desperately needed to cover cash outlays until winter taxes are collected.
The deal was doomed in June, when Moody's Investor Services downgraded the city's bond rating to Ba, which is reserved for speculative investments. Moody's and other credit agencies acted after reviewing the city's $2.1 billion budget for the fiscal year 1991, and determining that it was unrealistic. The Mayor later acknowledged that the budget would result in a $206 million deficit. All credit agencies now rate the city as one fast approaching a default.
The city and the state are usually at odds over budget issues, and the debate is always colored by Philadelphia's enduring reputation for corruption and mismanagement. That enrages most state legislators in this largely white, rural and conservative state.
One of the seeds for the current fiscal crisis was planted back in 1850, when the General Assembly tried to contain Philadelphia by preventing it from annexing any more territory. That decision stifled the city's growth and kept it from following its residents out to the suburbs, as Houston, Atlanta and other cities have done. Philadelphia has lost a half-million middle-class residents since 1950, leaving behind an increasingly poor, elderly, needy and black population totaling 1.5 million, preliminary 1990 census figures show.
In this environment, it is hard to determine whether City Hall's history has simply rubbed off on the Mayor and magnified his errors or whether the conventional wisdom is correct: that he is an incompetent manager with few political skills and no credibility outside the 39 percent of the city's population that is black.
 
Target of Ridicule
Agreeing with what several Goode supporters said in interviews, Dr. Sandra Featherman, director of the Center for Public Policy at Temple University, said: ''I don't think he was a bad Mayor; he tried hard to be a good Mayor. But he was weak, not vindictive enough - and you have to be vindictive to manage something as complex as this city, with its fractious City Council. He has been a target of ridicule for a long time.''
Philadelphians are used to the ridicule; some even wake up to it if their clock radios are tuned to KISS-AM. Every morning the soft-rock station does a brief satire titled, ''Bad Wilson: The Blunder Years.''
The division among Mayor Goode's supporters and detractors is largely along racial lines, as interviews with people on the street suggest. ''He's a black Mayor, and I don't want to give him any type of criticism,'' said J. Farmer, a black letter carrier. Several white residents gave the Mayor mainly negative reviews. ''I think he is a nice man, but he is not qualified to be Mayor,'' said J. Woodcock, a banker. ''This whole mess is totally attributable to Wilson Goode.''
Judgment of the Mayor may be overly harsh because expectations of him were very high when he was elected in 1983. ''Mayor Goode couldn't have been as good as he was portrayed then, just as it's impossible for him to be as bad as everybody says he is now,'' said Frederick L. Voight, executive director of the Committee of 70, a private nonpartisan agency dedicated to better government.
At first, Mr. Goode seemed to have something for everybody. He says he considered becoming a Baptist minister, but took up public service instead. In the 1960's, his community group built more low-income housing than the city's housing agency. He later obtained his master's degree in business administration and became chairman of the State Public Utility Commission.
In 1980, Mayor William J. Green made him the first black managing director, placing him in charge of the city's 10 operating divisions.
 
'He Doesn't Smile Much'
He viewed himself then as a ''technocrat,'' and displayed the charisma of one. As his 87-year old mother, Rozelar Goode, said in a recent interview: ''He doesn't smile much or have much to say. He took after his father.''
In 1983, Mr. Goode ran for Mayor and was elected with 97 percent of the black vote and 22.5 percent of the white vote, Dr. Featherman said.
Friend and foe alike say the decline in the Mayor's political fortunes began after 17 months in office, at 5:30 P.M. on May 13, 1985. It was on that night that he permitted a police helicopter to drop a bomb on a West Philadelphia house held by an armed radical group, Move, that had been the subject of complaints by many neighbors. The resulting explosion and fire killed six adult members of the group and their five children and burned 250 other homes.
Perhaps the worst thing he did in 1985 was to avoid accepting responsibility for the debacle until after a commission, appointed by him, reported its finding that he had been negligent, irresponsible and had ''abdicated his responsibilities as a leader.''
His actions during and after the bombing crippled his ability to govern, and the incident continues to provide an easy hook for anybody who wants to criticize his management skill without adding new specifics.
In 1987, Philadelphia voters had the choice between what a political analyst here said was the ''evil of two lessers'' - Mr. Goode and former Mayor Frank L. Rizzo. Mr. Goode narrowly won re-election, getting 97 percent of the black vote and 18 percent of the white vote.
The Mayor's second term has been dominated by insurmountable budget deficits and what he calls ''unproductive'' relations with almost all elected officials in the city and state.
Mr. Goode has no close friends or regular advisers, but his press secretary said William V. Donaldson would have a balanced view of the Mayor. ''He is a competent, journeyman mayor,'' said Mr. Donaldson, president of the Philadelphia Zoological Society, chairman of the Mayor's Advisory Committee on the Budget and Cincinnati's manager in the 1970's.
''What we have here is a case of failed good intentions,'' he said. ''When the Federal Government took away the money for social services, the city had to do a bunch of things that they neither had the fiscal nor intellectual ability to do. City government here is not made up of faculty of the Harvard Business School, you know. What happened is simple to explain. What to do about it is beyond me.''

HEADLINE: Debate Over Logging Means Trouble For Incumbent in Washington State

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OLYMPIA, Wash.

 BODY:
A Congressional district that has the volcanoes of Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens on one side and the Pacific Ocean on the other would seem a natural to embrace a politician whose family is well-known among outdoor enthusiasts here.
But Representative Jolene Unsoeld, the first-term Democrat from southwest Washington State, is in trouble, primarily because of the rancorous debate over what to do with all that scenery.
After winning a seat by 618 votes in the closest House race of 1988, Ms. Unsoeld has worked to save salmon runs from huge Japanese fishing nets and to protect ancient forests from timber companies that export the logs. Those are positions an Unsoeld (pronounced UN-sold) is expected to take in the Northwest: her husband, Willi Unsoeld, who died in an avalanche nearly 10 years ago, was an outspoken environmentalist and one of the first Americans to climb Mount Everest. 
But those positions, and Ms. Unsoeld's support for logging restrictions to protect the threatened northern spotted owl, do not always go over well in this part of Washington, where saving forests usually translates into lost jobs.
 
Catcalls From Loggers
Under Washington's open primary system, all candidates for Representative run in the same primary, and the top finisher from each party runs in the November election. Last Tuesday, Ms. Unsoeld received 52 percent of the total primary vote, Gomer Robert Williams, a conservative Republican, won 38 percent and two other candidates split the remainder.
Small, soft-spoken and bespectacled, Ms. Unsoeld has had a tough time among loggers, millworkers and others whose livelihood is dependent on the evergreen forests in this wet part of the country.
Trying to explain the news that timber jobs are disappearing because of overcutting, which she opposes, and environmental restrictions, which she supports, Ms. Unsoeld has at times been met with boos, catcalls and disparaging remarks about her sex and appearance.
 
A Strong Challenge
Her critics say she comes across too much like an urban environmentalist and a feminist in a district where chain saws are hung over the doorways and the spotted owl is sometimes spoken of sarcastically as a delicacy for dinner.
Several thousand people in the timber industry here are expected to be out of work in the next few years if the Forest Service, as expected, restricts the number of trees to be cut in an effort to save the rare owl.
The district is heavily Democratic, with a populist labor tradition dating from the days of the radical Industrial Workers of the World, the Wobblies. Its urban edges, at the Columbia River north of Portland, and in the state capital of Olympia, are fast-growing high-technology and government centers, with little connection to the tree-cutting economy. Mr. Williams, an accountant who has strong backing from fundamentalist Christians and the timber industry, is running a strong race. A former state Representative, Mr. Williams was the Republican challenger for governor two years ago. He has been attacking Ms. Unsoeld as too liberal, too environmentalist and too ineffective.
''It's the loggers who got her elected, and she hasn't done anything for them,'' he said. Mr. Williams says the owl could be saved even with continued high levels of logging in national forests.
Even some Unsoeld supporters have doubts on her environmental positions. ''What Jolene needs to do is make some real solid announcements about supporting working people,'' said a backer, Frank Chestnut, an official with the International Woodworkers of America, a timber workers union, in Aberdeen, a coastal logging town.
Mr. Chestnut said most loggers realize that no matter who is elected, the days of unrestricted tree cutting and shipping overseas - sometimes criticized here as ''rip and ship'' - are over, and that jobs in the woods will be lost. But he said the woodworkers want somebody to speak out on their behalf, to assure them that mortgages will not suddenly be threatened and that their families will not crumble from debt.
Ms. Unsoeld has asked for Federal money to retrain laid-off loggers and, in a move she says will help save 6,000 mill and logging jobs, has championed a ban on log exports recently signed by President Bush. She says that the timber crisis was caused by overcutting by private companies and the export boom. Last year one in four logs from the Northwest were sent overseas and never touched the hands of American millworkers.
''Our overcutting, our mismanagement of the forest, our export of raw logs, all are to blame for the situation we're in,'' she said in a recent interview. ''It's a difficult and complex situation. People criticize me because they are emotional, they feel threatened. I understand that.''
She would like to see more bite in American trade policy so that Japan buys less raw goods and more finished wood products like building material, furniture and siding. Tariffs as high as 30 percent keep many Northwest wood products out of Japan.
In recent weeks, as anxieties in the timber towns increase over the uncertainty about next year's logging level, Ms. Unsoeld has changed her message somewhat to emphasize her ties to logging as well as the environment.
During a House hearing in Olympia on timber, Ms. Unsoeld talked about the loggers in her family. ''My father and grandfather were timber men,'' she said. ''My father started out as a kid working a donkey engine on Larch Mountain. My brother is the third generation in this proud industry and today owns a wood treatment plant. My family has long been supported by timber dollars.''
Ms. Unsoeld may have come from timber stock, but her reputation was made, early on, in the mountains. She was the first woman to climb the north face of Mount Teton, in Wyoming. Robert Redford bought the rights to the life story of Mrs. Unsoeld's husband for a possible film. Their daughter, Nanda Devi, was named for a Himalayan peak. She died in 1976 while trying to climb the mountain with her father.
Ms. Unsoeld got into politics as a consumer advocate and campaign reformist and later was a state representative known for taking on industrial polluters and big companies. She won the primary here in 1988 after the long-time representative, Don Bonker, made an unsuccessful try at the Senate. She barely beat a political unknown, Bob Wight, in the general election.
Then, as now, she said it was important to tell voters the truth about how their area was changing. Those in this district who want to believe that jobs in the woods will always be plentiful might not like her message, but Ms. Unsoeld says she thinks they will share her vision, even if it is not always optimistic.
''Nobody who knows anything about the forest believes we can continue cutting as we have,'' Ms. Unsoeld said.

HEADLINE: All U.S. Hondas to Get Air Bags by Fall of '93

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The new president of the Honda Motor Company said today that starting in the fall of 1993 all Hondas sold in the United States would be equipped with air bags on both the driver's and front passenger's sides.
On his first visit to this country as head of his company, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, who was promoted in May, said Honda made the decision two months ago. Mr. Kawamoto was in the United States to address a meeting of Honda dealers and to attend a conference on motorcycles, with a trip to Detroit to meet automotive reporters. Honda's announcement raises the competitive stakes for American and foreign auto makers, who have increasingly been installing air bags to comply with the Federal law requiring passive restraints in addition to seat belts. Most auto makers at first installed ''automatic'' belts that did not require buckling for front-seat passengers. 
Air bags have become popular as evidence has accumulated that they are effective and that they do not inflate prematurely, a possibility that had concerned auto makers.
The Ford Motor Company, which already installs air bags on the driver side in about half its cars, said last January that it would have air bags for drivers and front-seat passengers by the mid-1990's. But Ford has been plagued by supplier problems that make its schedule uncertain.
 
Moves by American Makers
Daimler-Benz has driver-side air bags in all its cars and passenger-side air bags in more expensive Mercedes-Benz models.
Last month, the General Motors Corporation said it would install driver-side air bags on all its American-made cars starting in the fall of 1995 and some for front-seat passengers by 1992. Because of G.M.'s size and influence, its decision virtually assured that air bags would become a standard piece of safety equipment. The Chrysler Corporation was the first auto maker to commit itself to installing air bags, in 1988.
What may be most remarkable about Honda's announcement is how swiftly the auto maker will switch from mostly automatic belts to air bags. Honda now has air bags only in its Acura Legend luxury car and Acura NSX sports coupe, which account for 10 to 12 percent of the 700,000 cars it sells each year in this country.
Within 36 months Honda must accomplish the design and engineering on its remaining lineup - the Civic, Accord, and Acura Integra - to accommodate the air bag systems, which require advanced electronic sensors and propellants for inflation.

HEADLINE: White House Objects to Bills on Cleaner Fuel

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The White House has decided to oppose both the House and Senate versions of plans to make oil companies provide cleaner-burning gasoline. Those requirements are a centerpiece of proposed revisions to the Clean Air Act.
In a letter dated Friday, the White House, which had not expressed a public position beyond saying that any new requirements should be worth the cost, said, ''Both the House and Senate reformulated gas provisions are needlessly inflexible and present enormous implementation problems.''
Both houses had approved unusually specific legislation about what steps would be required, reflecting frustration over past laws that had failed to achieve the anticipated progress. 
The letter, addressed to Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, continued, ''Unless these provisions are changed, they will result in unnecessary increases in the price of gasoline to consumers and in potential supply disruptions, without producing commensurate environmental benefits.''
The letter was signed by the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, William K. Reilly, the Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins, and the President's assistant for economic and domestic policy, Roger B. Porter.
 
Passage Further Complicated
The letter does not explicitly mention a veto, but it concludes that the signers ''look forward to working with you to produce a bill that the President can endorse.'' The letter would appear to further complicate passage of a new bill, which would be the first major amendment to the 20-year-old act since 1977. The bill has been before a conference committee all summer.
Air pollution experts say reformulated gasoline is a particularly important step to achieve progress quickly. William Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, said that requiring changes in automobile emissions would also help, but he said: ''Emission standards reduce emissions from cars yet to be built. Cleaner gasoline affects emissions from all cars on the roads.''
But the letter said: ''It is simply inappropriate and needlessly expensive to specify a formula for gasoline in the statute, because technology and markets move in ways that cannot be easily anticipated. If it is not possible to eliminate the formula from the bill, at a minimum the conference should include flexible language allowing fuels that provide equivalent benefits to be used in lieu of the mandated formula.''
The oil industry has raised similar concerns and has lobbied hard against the provisions.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is a leading proponent of the gasoline provisions, called the White House's position ''unbelievable.'' Reducing pollution by changing gasoline is far cheaper than reducing it by other means, he said, and the White House's position is ''not good for the environment and it's not good for the economy.''
House staff members said the House version was not overly restrictive. At the urging of the oil industry, staff members said, the House had drafted a law that would allow oil companies to use either the House's recipe for gasoline or any equally clean gasoline.
The House and Senate took different approaches, but set specifications for the levels of certain kinds of hydrocarbon compounds in gasoline and the oxygen content. Oxygen is present in methanol, alcohol and other combustible liquids that can be added to gasoline, promoting fuller combustion. But it can also result in increased production of nitrogen oxides. And by some estimates, the additives required under the bill would be in very short supply and would have to be imported.
The Administration estimated that the reformulation provisions would cost the oil industry an average of at least $3 billion annually between 1992 and 1994 and raise gasoline prices by at least six to eight cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: How to Answer Iraq's Threats

 BODY:
The United States and its allies would make a terrible mistake to take all Saddam Hussein's rhetorical flourishes literally. But they would commit at least equal error in not taking the man and his record of fulfilling past threats seriously.
The Iraqi leader thus confronted the U.N. allies with a genuine dilemma on Sunday when he threatened to launch a pre-emptive strike against his adversaries if the U.N. economic embargo strangled his country. In some of his bloodiest language to date, Mr. Hussein said ''Iraq is in good shape and ready to start a war'' to ''strangle'' Arab states, the oilfields and Israel. 
It's easy enough to find lots of reasons not to respond at all to this oratory. Maybe it's just bravado. Or perhaps it's simply his retort to General Dugan, the former U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff, who was dismissed after saying his aircraft were ready to lay waste to Baghdad. Or maybe he's trotting out his terrorist thesaurus - filled with words like ''strangle,'' ''flood,'' turn ''into flames'' - to spook a U.N. coalition already shaky at any thought of war. No need to answer him on these accounts.
Perhaps, too, Mr. Hussein's tirade is a good sign, a sign that the U.N. embargo is already pinching his country hard. In that event, and in any event, the response then should be to keep squeezing and closing loopholes in the embargo, like air traffic.
Yet Mr. Bush and Israeli leaders were wise yesterday not to entirely discount that Saddam Hussein could be contemplating a first strike. It could be that he doesn't have the patience to try to outwait the embargo, or the confidence he could do so. It could be that the pressure is getting to him, and he's becoming less rational. Or maybe he's quite rational and believes war is inevitable, and that it would be far better for Iraq to strike the first blow.
For these reasons, the possibility of an Iraqi pre-emptive attack cannot simply be dismissed. But Washington's response ought not to be to launch the first strike itself. Few, if any, allies would now join such an effort. The whole crisis would be transformed into an Iraqi-American conflict. The coalition that President Bush labored so skillfully to forge these past seven weeks would be destroyed. And whatever the results of the attack, the full wrath of the Arab world eventually would fall on the United States alone.
The most adroit response for Washington would be to discuss the issue with its allies now - urgently and frankly. What are the costs and risks of leaving the initiative to Baghdad? Could substantial numbers of lives and oilfields be saved by hitting first? Would the political costs of pre-emption outweigh these savings? If U.S. forces received signals of an imminent Iraqi attack, would the allies back a unilateral American action? If not, what then?
Tackling these questions will be a nasty but necessary and prudent exercise. The U.N. coalition, so vital to prevailing over Iraq, could swiftly fall apart if it proves unable to come to terms with the issue of whether and when to use force.

HEADLINE: Good Politics, Bad Economics

 BODY:
The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, is desperately seeking a way out of the impasse over capital gains taxes that plagues negotiations on deficit reduction. He now floats two ideas: One is to vote separately on a package to cut the deficit by $500 billion over five years and on a controversial package of revenue-losing measures, including a capital gains tax cut. The second is for Republicans to swallow higher income taxes on the rich in exchange for a lower tax on capital gains. 
These ideas are ingenious. But by improving the chances of success for President Bush's misguided campaign to lower the tax on capital gains, Mr. Dole would solve a political problem and create a severe economic one. What's needed is not ingenuity but a sense of national interest. Mr. Bush has to abandon his obsessive romance with a capital gains tax cut and let Congress complete the vital task of whacking the Federal deficit down to size.
Mr. Dole's first idea is to split the deficit votes into two stages. The first vote would be on proposals to cut the deficit. The second would be on proposals that would wind up increasing the deficit - a package of new spending and tax cuts, including lower capital gains taxes. This package would contain the means to pay for these new initiatives.
One danger is that the deficit reduction package would not receive final approval unless the second package also passed. That would make deficit reduction hostage to a capital gains tax cut.
There is another, more subtle danger. Along with capital gains, the second package would include plans to raise the standard deduction and the earned income tax credit, two changes that would insulate poor families from the brunt of deficit reduction. This package would also include provisions for child care and other useful increases in neglected social services. Thus legislators could reject the capital gains tax cut only by rejecting the needs of the poor.
Mr. Dole's second idea is to link the capital gains tax cut to higher income tax rates for the rich. That seems like a fair compromise. It would cure the problem of inequity, but by creating a bigger problem. The 1986 tax reform act equalized taxes on ordinary income and capital gains. This led investors to put their money in projects that would expand economic output, not minimize taxes. Mr. Bush's proposal threatens to unravel that magnificent accomplishment.
If the Republicans follow Mr. Dole's lead, the top rate on ordinary income would rise above 30 percent, while the rate on capital gains would fall to 15 percent. With that large a difference, armies of lawyers would be back in the business of creating appallingly wasteful tax shelters that allow investors to report their income as capital gains.
All Americans share Mr. Dole's frustration that the budget talks are deadlocked. Yet the summiteers have made significant progress on a wide range of issues. If Mr. Bush would get out of their way, they could begin fixing the nation's sordid fiscal stance without undermining either the tax code or the economy.

HEADLINE: Auto Fuel Efficiencies Lie Within Our Grasp

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Washington's Mood Worries Detroit'' (Business Day, Sept. 3) conveys the impression that stricter auto mileage standards could doom ''energy-consuming luxuries like air-conditioning and anti-lock brakes.'' An analysis of auto efficiency by Marc Ledbetter, policy analyst at the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, and Marc Ross, a University of Michigan physicist, shows that Environmental Protection Agency-rated fleet average fuel efficiencies of 40.1 miles a gallon could be reached by the year 2000, using technical options, each costing no more than $1.13 a gallon, at an average conserved gasoline cost of 52 cents a gallon (Business Day, Aug. 1). 
Average automobile efficiencies similar to those proposed in Senator Richard H. Bryan's bill (40 miles per gallon) are feasible and cost effective. Policies to promote them (including fleet average efficiency standards, combined with revenue-neutral gas-guzzler taxes and gas-sipper rebates on new cars) are needed without delay. These policies will save consumers money and reduce the environmental consequences of automobile use without raising gasoline taxes.

HEADLINE: OBSERVER;
Up-and-Down Town

BYLINE: By Russell Baker

 BODY:
New York is dying again, as it was in 1974 when I moved there from Washington. Then, as now, many people were saying good riddance. ''Drop Dead'' was The Daily News's famous headline summation of President Ford's advice to the city.
Fed-up New Yorkers were getting out, as always. After living there a while I was struck, on trips to the suburbs, by the vast population of former New Yorkers out there who had decamped because of previous deaths of the city. All over New Jersey, Westchester County and Long Island, old-timers who had lived in the city during the Depression or the war years or the fat 50's talked lovingly about its bygone glories. 
Still speaking the city's distinctive accents, they were quick to reminisce about its lost splendors. ''But I'd never live there now,'' they often added, and gave you an unpersuasive account of the quiet pleasures of suburban life.
They often seemed amazed to hear I had deliberately chosen to live in New York. So awful now. I should have been there in the old days . . .
I had several reasons for going in 1974. One was a hick's suspicion that though small-town roots and mud-between-the-toes rusticity might be wonderful to boast about, no American could claim he had lived life to the hilt until he had experienced New York.
I stayed 11 years, which may be longer than average for an adopted New Yorker. Settlers seem to exhaust the city's joys too quickly, maybe from overindulgence when they first arrive, and then start to miss the more pastoral pleasures remembered in quieter places. E. B. White, for example, though often thought of as the quintessential New Yorker, lived most of his adult life in Maine.
The dying New York of 1974 was the victim of a long siege of very bad government. Not just city government either, but state government in Albany and Federal Government in Washington, both of which were blind to the fact that cities are absolutely vital to a nation's health and, so, utterly uninterested in trying to make them flourish.
Nelson Rockefeller's revenue-sharing plan, later savaged by Reagan know-nothings, was a grudging Federal acknowledgment that, yes, maybe Washington ought to be interested in shoring up local governments, but the money it distributed was small when measured against the enormity of the American city's problems.
These problems were epitomized in New York, so when the Nixon recession of the early 1970's arrived, New York again began dying.
If you're not rich, the times when New York is dying may be the best times to move in. This was my experience in 1974. With Manhattan real estate on the rocks, there was a vast choice of apartments for rent or sale at what later seemed giveaway prices. And real estate is decisive in determining whether life in New York is to be wonderful, tolerable or wretched.
For paupers, a welfare hotel is better than the streets while a private apartment is a place where maybe you can start reassembling your life. In ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' Tom Wolfe expresses the millionaire's real-estate agony to perfection when he observes that after you are accustomed to living in a $3 million apartment, living in a $1 million apartment is simply impossible.
For Manhattan's well-to-do, discovering that you're not well-to-do enough to stay in a skyrocketing real-estate market - ah, friend, that is crushing evidence that you are not well-to-do at all and might as well go away. This was the awful truth delivered to me by the real-estate orgies of the 1980's when it seemed the good times could never end and New York could never die again.
Priced out, I lit out for suburbs, but suburbs far, far away. I did not want to become another of those old New Yorkers out in Jersey, in Westchester, on Long Island telling visitors that New York was just a ruined replica of the city I knew in the good old days.
You who plan to leave New York, hark! I will now tell you of suburbs: They are safer, quieter, cleaner, superior in many ways to New York. Also: in suburbs it is hard to find people who will excite, infuriate, exhilarate, amaze, stupefy, astound and provoke you, or make you re-examine everything you ever believed.
Also: It's hard to find a good play, a good restaurant, a good opera and a good protest demonstration. When everybody has fled to the suburbs and there are no more cities for suburbanites to refresh themselves in, it will be said of America, ''A restful place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.''

HEADLINE: Inflation Isn't Our Biggest Problem

BYLINE: By Roger C. Altman; Roger C. Altman, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury from 1977 to 1980, is vice-chairman of the Blackstone Group Inc.

 BODY:
The world's finance ministers, meeting in Washington this week, have reportedly urged tighter monetary policies to combat the inflation they expect from the recent doubling of oil prices. While that may make sense for the strong economies in Europe and Japan, it is wrong for the U.S., which is now almost certainly in a recession.
For the U.S., accepting the finance ministers' prescriptions would mean following the same course that proved so disastrous after the 1973 and 1979 oil price rises. Those actions - in essence, a tight money policy combined with a moderately loose fiscal policy - led directly to the severe recessions of 1974-75 and 1981-82. 
This time the results could be en n rsrse.evev b bororhaha w wheheededntnta a receioion with b budt t deficit as high as 5 percent of gross national product. A bad slump, along the lines of those of 1974-1975 and 1981-1982, could balloon the deficit into the $300 to $400 billion range. The U.S. has never had to finance amounts like these. Further, with Germany struggling to pay for unification and Japan's financial markets weakening, we no longer can count on huge inflows of foreign capital to finance our deficits, as we did in the 80's. And corporate debt is dangerously high. Currently, American corporations devote approximately 50 percent of their earnings - a historic high - to meeting interest payments. Thus, a recession could send bankruptcy rates soaring over the next year, with big job losses.
Finally, the Government lacks the traditional, Keynesian tools to fight a recession. Previously, Washington would try to revive a slowing economy with lower taxes and higher spending. Today's large deficits rule this out. Financial markets would panic if it were tried.
In short, we cannot afford to let this recession deepen. If nothing else, we should at least try to avoid the mistakes of the Carter years.
After the Iran oil embargo of 1979, the Carter Administration followed a status quo economic policy. With the economy sluggish, no effort was made to tighten fiscal policy.
Into this vacuum stepped the Federal Reserve, slamming on the monetary brakes to reduce demand and, ostensibly, to suppress oil-driven inflation. The result, however, was to severely deepen the recessionary influences that already had been set in motion. The key point is this. In today's weak economy, we can't cure the inflation of an oil shock by tightening money. That would just squeeze demand, guaranteeing a longer recession. Better to accept some temporary inflation from the oil shock than slam on the brakes and throw the economy into a dive.
The only way to stimulate the current economy is to lower interest rates sharply. But the Fed has no rationale for loosening the money supply until Congress comes up with a credible plan for cutting the budget deficit.
Before the Iraqi invasion, the Administration and Congress were on the verge of an agreement on cuts totaling $50 billion in 1991 and $500 billion over five years. A deal along these lines remains imperative. With that in place, the Fed could ease monetary policy substantially. With budget policy less stimulative, the money supply could grow and short-term rates decline without undue pressure on inflation. Undoubtedly, the Fed is not eager to repeat its 1979 overreaction.
If we reversed fiscal and monetary policy, the confidence of financial markets would soar and interest rates would fall dramatically. The Fed Chairman, Alan Greenspan, has predicted that a credible budget deal could lead to rate reductions of two full percentage points. This stimulus would easily offset the fiscal drag of a tighter budget.
Many in Washington prefer the status quo on economic policy. There is relief that the political focus is temporarily on the Middle East, not on pocket book issues at home. But, this is whistling past the graveyard.
Since the invasion of Kuwait, the economy has dropped like a stone. Consumers and businesses, recalling the earlier oil shocks, are retrenching, cutting back purchases in anticipation of a steeper downturn. Retail sales have run into a wall.
This economic fallout from the two earlier oil shocks drove Presidents Ford and Carter from office, and many Congressmen with them. Mr. Bush's war-driven approval ratings notwithstanding, the same thing can happen again.

HEADLINE: Koreans See a Gain From Boycott: Unity

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Members of New York City's Korean-American community say the long, bitter boycott of two Korean-owned stores has produced one unforseen benefit: It has mobilized their community and spurred it to integrate itself into the city's political life.
''The boycott has motivated the community to realize we have to really follow and be part of the city's politics to show the city that it has to recognize us as a political power,'' said Jay Sung Lee, founder and president of Korean-Americans for Social Concerns.
His group consists of Koreans born in the United States and those who call themselves the ''one point five'' (1.5) generation: born in Korea but educated in this country. It was one of several groups that rallied thousands of Koreans outside City Hall last week, a turning point for a community that believed it was time to speak up.
 
Dinkins Found Ineffective
The rally, called to promote racial harmony, was peaceful, but the crowed booed during remarks by Mayor David N. Dinkins, who people in the crowd said they believed had been ineffective in breaking the boycott in Brooklyn. And in case the Mayor failed to get the message, young Koreans weaved through the crowd, handing out voter registration forms. 
While their community has too few eligible voters, many Korean-Americans said they felt that the rising generation of young adults born or educated here were developing the savvy to exercise power in the political system through such devices as the building of coalitions.
''The first generation was concerned with economic stability,'' said 31-year-old Mr. Lee, who left Korea when he was 17 to attend college in New York. ''It's past time now, and we have to look for political power. We are looking at the year 2000 to how and where Korean-Americans can stand in this society.''
Several days later Mayor Dinkins purchased about $10 worth of fruits and vegetables at the boycotted stores in a show of support. When he appeared Sunday at the Ninth Annual Korean-American Harvest and Folklore Festival Day in Queens, he was greeted warmly and serenaded by a group of Korean children.
''Last week in City Hall a lot of Koreans said boo,'' said Heung Ram Park, 25, a student at Queens College. ''Today they welcome him because a lot has happened.''
The decision to mount last week's rally was greeted with hesitation at first, said several advocates who helped organize the event. There was trepidation that the rally's purpose of forging peaceful links to black and other racial and ethnic communities would be misunderstood, they said, especially if they criticized the Mayor.
But the tense standoff each day between the boycotters and the owners of the Family Red Apple store and the Church Avenue Fruits and Vegetables store in the Flatbush section had pushed many Koreans to the limit.
The boycott began in January after a Haitian-American customer said she had been assaulted by an employee of Family Red Apple. The store owners said the customer had refused to pay for groceries. When a crowd intervened on the customer's behalf, the employee sought refuge across the street at Church Avenue Fruits and Vegetables.
Korean-Americans were incensed that the city had opposed a judge's restraining order that would have placed the demonstrators 50 feet from the boycotted stores.
The tension grew over the weekend when 19 gasoline bombs were discovered on the roof of the Family Red Apple store, The police yesterday had made no arrests in the case.
Estimates of the city's Korean population vary widely, from the New York City Planning Department's figure of 40,000 to the 250,000 cited by several Korean trade and civic associations. The community is relatively new to this country, dating back two decades, and it is composed heavily of young adults and the middle-aged, whose participation in politics is hampered because they often are not registered to vote, have limited fluency in English and lack familiarity with American ways.
Still, Korean groups have participated in the give-and-take of the city's political scene by endorsing Jesse Jackson in the 1988 Presidential election and raising money and distributing literature during the last mayoral campaign. They have even elected a Korean woman to a seat on the board of Community School District 25 in Flushing, Queens, where many Koreans live.
 
A Force to Reckon With
Korean-Americans do not appear to be wedded as a group to either of the major political parties. ''They're not necessarily all Democrats,'' said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a Democrat who represents sections of western Queens where many Koreans live. ''They're pretty evenly split between the Republicans and the Democrats.''
Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, in an interview three days after the Korean rally, said: ''I don't think you can count out any constituency as a political force in this town. There seems to be a rising political consciousness in relation to electoral politics in the Korean community.''
The strife in Brooklyn has helped heighten that awareness and unify a community that had been too caught up with looking out for the narrower interests of various business associations.
''The many organizations were like separate islands,'' said Hanyoung Lee, 55, who was elected to the Flushing school board last year. ''But now we have a common issue where we work together.''
Pulling together is an expected result of conflicts involving small ethnic businesses, especially in an ethnically diverse city like New York, said Pyong Min, an assistant professor of sociology at Queens College who has researched how such businesses foster ethnic solidarity.
 
Only the Beginning
Mr. Min said that past boycotts against Korean businesses had strengthened the community's sense of solidarity but that the intensity and duration of the current conflict had had an even greater unifying effect.
''This is the beginning,'' he said of the recent City Hall rally. ''They learned they can do it, and in the future they will stand upon that collective mobilization more often.''
The boycott had already spurred Mr. Min and several other Koreans to form the Korean-American Civil Rights Committee of the Korean Association of New York. The group intends to advocate Korean interests, not just in matters relating to businesses and the current boycott, but also discrimination and voter registration. He added that the group planned to lobby at state and city levels.
Before they can have a real impact on the city's political scene and begin electing their own candidates, Korean-Americans will have to broaden the issues that concern them, said Sung Soo Kim, a self-styled ombudsman for Korean business owners and founder of the Korean-American Small Business Service Center of New York.
''We have to educate our people to be aware that politics is daily life,'' Mr. Kim said. ''Concentrating exclusively on the issues that Korean-Americans have is not enough.''
 
Rise of Younger Generation
A number of Korean candidates are said to be waiting in the wings to run for a seat on the expanded City Council after redistricting. But the candidates who may have the best shot could come not from the older leadership but from the ranks of their children.
The younger generation speaks of building coalitions and addressing issues that concern the city's minority communities, and they do so with a native's understanding of how the city's agencies and officials work.
''We are prepared and willing to work with other progressive and liberal groups to make city politics better, more just and fair to everybody,'' Mr. Lee said. ''The Korean-American community of New York is becoming larger and more active, and we deserve more attention and fair representation.''

HEADLINE: Uneasy Doctors Add Race-Consciousness to Diagnostic Tool

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DOCTORS are showing a cautious resurgence of interest in giving more consideration to their patients' racial or ethnic backgrounds when diagnosing and treating illnesses.
Mounting evidence suggests that race and ethnicity can and should be factors in evaluating symptoms while reaching a diagnosis and in determining the treatment and how the patients fare.
Because of the country's sensitivity to racial issues, there has been a reluctance to address race or ethnicity in medicine except in the most obvious cases, experts say. Tay-Sachs disease among descendants of Eastern European Jews, sickle cell disease and hypertension among blacks, diabetes among some native Americans and stomach cancer among immigrant Asians are well-known conditions associated with particular groups.
But specialists note that other well-known health problems, although often considered ethnically neutral, may express themselves in different ways and vary in incidence among ethnic groups, requiring different approaches in treatment. 
For instance, new evidence indicates that the incidence of severe kidney failure among some blacks, long known to be higher than that of whites, is much worse than previously believed. Research also suggests that Chinese and Hispanic women face a significantly greater risk of developing diabetes during pregnancy than comparable blacks or whites.
Also, blacks with high blood pressure generally respond much better than whites when treated with diuretics, drugs that lower salt and water levels, while Asians being treated for psychiatric problems respond to some anti-psychotic drugs at doses one-tenth the level recommended for whites.
Proponents of increasing the awareness of ethnicity in medicine acknowledge the problems that could result, such as a rise in racism, increased debate over the relative roles of heredity versus environment in illness, and misconceptions about genetic superiority or inferiority associated with eugenics.
''The political concerns are real,'' said Dr. Robert F. Murray Jr., a genetics expert who is professor of pediatrics and medicine at Howard University in Washington. ''There is always a desire among some to use any hint of a genetic defect against you. But all groups, without exception, have genetic disabilities and people have to recognize that and move on to what we can do about them.''
It has become almost impossible to properly deliver medical care without considering the ethnic background of the patient, including the effect of both genetics and socioeconomic factors, said Dr. Murray and other experts.
''The idea of emphasizing ethnicity in medicine came up before, 20 years ago during the civil rights era,'' Dr. Murray said, ''but it was downplayed because some felt the racial climate was too charged and there were too many people who would use this to perpetuate their racism. Now people are beginning to say we have to address this because you get better results with your patients if you do.''
Citing mounting evidence that knowledge of a patient's background can improve care, Dr. Arthur C. Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota, said: ''You must take into account race and ethnicity. You can't ethically treat patients without considering it.''
American society remains unsure how to handle the idea of equality, and medicine reflects this uncertainty, Dr. Caplan said. With some exceptions, he added, medicine generally has ignored ethnic difference in the name of equality, which has led to considering the norm as being white and middle class.
''On one hand, society believes it can only reach equality if it treats people as if they were identical, interchangeable or the same,'' Dr. Caplan said. ''But it also thinks it can deal with equality if it recognizes differences and makes adjustments, such as special programs, to assure equal access and opportunity.''
Dr. Richard A. Williams, a cardiologist and adjunct professor at the Medical School of the University of California at Los Angeles, said that if people were becoming ill because of genetic problems or their way of life, doctors and other health professionals could not ignore it.
''Failure to acknowledge the racial or ethnic background of a patient is itself a kind of discrimination,'' said Dr. Williams, who 15 years ago was editor of the ''Textbook of Black-Related Diseases,'' an out-of-print volume by two dozen experts that summarized disease as it related to blacks.
 
Ignoring Reality
''A lot of people run away from the idea of considering ethnicity because they feel the implication is inferring inferiority or superiority among groups,'' said Dr. Williams, who is completing a new book, ''The Textbook of Ethnic Medicine,'' that he says addresses health problems of many ethnic groups. ''Doctors can't be so sensitive about ethnicity that it keeps them from doing their job.''
Dr. Caplan and others cited new evidence suggesting that race could be factor in successfully adapting to transplanted organs as an example of a quandary facing medicine. Most transplant studies show that kidney transplants are about 15 percent less successful in blacks than whites. But recent evidence that organ survival in blacks improves by 5 percent to 8 percent when kidneys from black donors are used could pose more problems at time when donor organs from all people, particularly blacks, are in short supply, Dr. Caplan said.
''Now race and ethnicity may become factors in deciding where to send a scarce resource,'' he said.
The nation's blood collecting and banking system, which does not label blood by the race of the donor, may also be facing new medical and ethical questions involving race.
 
Transfusion Complications
In June, Dr. Elliot P. Vichinsky and colleagues at Children's Hospital in Oakland, Calif., published a report in The New England Journal of Medicine suggesting that patients with sickle cell disease might avert transfusion complications if they received blood donated by blacks.
One treatment for severe episodes of sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder that mainly affects blacks in this country, involves giving the patient blood transfusions. About one-third of these patients develop antibodies against foreign proteins in the donated blood, which makes it very difficult to find compatible blood for subsequent treatment.
The Oakland researchers determined that 82 percent of the antibodies produced by sickle cell patients were against four proteins commonly found in blood donated by whites and suggested that the complication was partly a result of racial differences.
In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. Samuel Charache, a hemotologist and sickle cell expert at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, said complications for these patients might be reduced if the race of the donor was known.
Dr. Charache suggested that the ethical merits of asking donors to indicate their race, information that would only be used by the blood bank to channel supplies, should be debated. While acknowledging that the notion of black blood for blacks and white blood for whites suggested ''colored only'' drinking fountains and segregated buses of another era, he said, ''It is time to bring the question out of the closet.''
 
Unanswered Questions
Raising the perception of ethnic differences begs the question of what is behind those differences. Clearly, there is an interplay among traits that are genetically passed on from generation to generation, multifaceted environmental differences and cultural factors.
While it is easy to point out the well-known genetic defect, found more often in blacks than whites, that causes abnormal hemoglobin to form in sickle cell disease, it is more difficult to determine why black men are four times as likely as whites to have no warning pain with a heart attack.
Lupus, a condition in which the immune system goes awry and attacks connective tissue and organs, was once believed to be a disease afflicting young white women. Studies now indicate that while the disease affects one in 750 women generally in varying degrees, it inexplicably afflicts one in 245 black women and one in 500 Hispanic women, according to the Lupus Foundation of America.
And why do Mexican-American women, who tend to live in poverty and have prenatal care as poor as blacks, have a much lower rate of infant mortality? In fact, the Mexican-American infant death rate of 9.0 per 1,000 infants in the first year is even slightly better than the overall white rate of 9.1, which in turn is half the black rate of 18.7.
Dr. Rueben C. Warren, assistant director for minority health at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said he believed that most ethnically related health problems in this country have environmental and cultural causes. Factors like cigarette smoking, eating rich diets high in fats, and alcohol consumption not only do damage by themselves, but also aggravate genetic predispositions toward certain diseases, he said.
''There are many things that ethnic minorities share in common that influence poor health, and most of them are social and economic,'' Dr. Warren said. ''Many minorities live in older neighborhoods, for instance, which are full of lead paint, may be on some forgotten toxic waste site or near industrial pollution.''
''In health, you have to take ethnic background into account,'' he said, ''but always in the context of environment.'' Many people, especially members of minorities, he said, mistakenly believe that if a disease is genetic, it is a kind of ''act of God'' that they cannot influence, and they therefore do not try. ''We have to work through that attitude and try to change it,'' he said.
Dr. Murray of Howard University gives genetics at least equal weight with environmental factors in determining ethnic health.
''Genetics is playing a predominate role in that it determines a predisposition to conditions produced by the environment,'' he said. ''Environment can trigger the expression of genetic disease and if it were not for social and economic factors, many genetic diseases would stay dormant and people would never suffer from them.''
 
Influencing the Environment
Even with new prospects of genetic therapy, repairing or replacing defective genes responsible for most inherited disease is years, if not decades, away, Dr. Murray said. ''For the time being, you can't take the genes away, but you can influence the environment,'' he said, ''and that's what we should be trying to do.''
In a book to be published in October by Johns Hopkins University Press, Dr. Murray and Dr. James E. Bowman of the University of Chicago write that genetic differences can also be positive. While blacks may be prone toward skin pigmentation disorders and umbilical cord hernias, the authors say in ''Genetic Variation and Disorders in Peoples of African Origin,'' they are far less likely than whites to suffer with cystic fibrosis, skin cancer or PKU syndrome, a metabolic disorder that can lead to mental retardation.
Dr. Keh-Ming Lin, an associate professor of psychiatry at the Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Torrance, Calif., said doctors also had to consider ethnicity in dealing with mental illness and personality disorders. While all psychotic, personality and mood disorders can be found in every ethnic group, cultural factors influence how they are expressed as well as viewed by the therapist, he said.
''The Asian culture discourages people from expressing feelings, especially negative feelings,'' said Dr. Lin, ''while Western culture goes to the other extreme and people talk a lot about their problems. Therefore, Western-style psychoanalysis may not work so well with these minorities.''
 
Problem of Misdiagnoses
Dr. Lin also said it was not uncommon for blacks suffering from bipolar manic depression to be misdiagnosed by white psychiatrists as schizophrenic, thus decreasing their chances of recovery. Blacks with psychological problems are more likely to complain of hallucinations and hearing voices, which seen in cultural context might not seem as bizarre as it would be in whites, he said.
''Part of the problem may be racist in that the doctor may be unfamiliar with blacks, scared of his black patient and overestimates the degree of pathology he sees,'' Dr. Lin said.
The psychiatrist said it was important that all health providers take courses on ethnic issues early in their training so that sensitivity to cultural diversity in medicine develops early.
''But you must strike a balance,'' Dr. Lin said. ''You want to increase cultural sensitivity but be aware of the danger of cultural stereotyping. You must see each patient as an individual and not just as belonging to some group.''
Several experts pointed to this danger of seeing people so much in terms of their ethnic background that patients are misdiagnosed or given the wrong treatment.
''If a black patient comes in with a warty lesion on the bottom of his foot, you can't just say 'blacks shouldn't have malignant melanoma' and not take it seriously,'' said Dr. Williams of U.C.L.A. ''Being conscious of ethnicity should improve diagnostic skills rather than hamper them.''

A Musical in Which the Insects Sing

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON

 BODY:
''Whatnot'' is a mishmash.
Billed as ''the new musical vaudeville'' and opening the seventh season of the Musical Theater Works at the Theater at St. Peter's Church, ''Whatnot'' is a collection of musical bric-a-brac that its creators and their friends might find cute but that may seem more like a hodgepodge of attic junk to an outsider.
Three of the dozen songs in the show are sung by insects - a lightning bug, a moth and a fly - and another is a hymn to the joys of entomology. Only the lightning bug figures in the story. 
The showcase chosen by Mark Waldrop and Howard Crabtree, who conceived and wrote it, to display this accumulation of curios is a variety show being produced to raise money to save the local Whatnot Shelf Factory, the economic backbone of Whatnot Springs, from bankruptcy. The authors have also thrown in a bit of science fiction, or perhaps biblical parable (a giant fish swallows a boat with a boy and his grandpa inside), a feud among three eccentric sisters, an invisible family that has formed a dance troupe, a nefarious knickknack manufacturer who tries to sabotage the fund drive, and a romance that detours the plot through Las Vegas, Nev. The aim of all this appears to be a folksy cabaret parody of Smalltown, U.S.A., but there is little of the empathy or affection for its targets that, for example, ''Oil City Symphony'' so brilliantly achieved a few seasons back. The music, credited to Dick Gallagher, includes some rather silly rhymes set to some very familiar tunes that range from country and western to 1960's rock to Broadway musicals to the Maguire Sisters.
Four game actors play about 14 roles and pour a lot of energy into the show, not the least of which is spent in an awesome number of quick costume changes. Mark Lazore gets the most out of all his roles, whether in drag or pants, and Jennifer Smith is especially good as the fly singing a torch song. John Treacy Egan has one of the more amusing turns delivering radio ads for knickknacks of Michelangelo's ''Last Supper'' in biodegradable plastic or an endangered species series ''made from the skins of the animals they immortalize.''
Some of the numbers, which are lavishly costumed by Mr. Crabtree, might be found diverting in the way a college fraternity house skit is, provided one has had a few beers first and is an acquaintance of someone in the cast. But for most of it, ''Whatnot'' is defined by its title - a nondescript object.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 59.41 in a Broad Stock Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
New fears of war in the Middle East and a steep rise in the price of oil depressed stocks sharply yesterday, pushing prices to new lows in issues in every important industry and every leading index.
The Dow Jones average of the 30 leading industrials fell 59.41 points, or 2.4 percent, to 2,452.97 - its lowest level in 14 months.
And in an unmistakable sign that the selloff was exceptionally widespread, the broader Standard & Poor's average of 500 Big Board stocks fell 6.73, or 2.2 percent, to 304.59, a 16-month low.
With many traders investors and speculators continuing to show skepticism about putting much money into the market, trading volume dropped to 162.2 million shares, from an abnormally heavy 201 million on Friday. 
But in a depressing development, 1,432 individual stocks, or 72 percent of the 1,991 traded on the New York Stock Exchange, declined, with 444 plunging to new lows.
Among the new lows were Berkshire Hathaway, the most expensive stock on the Big Board and the main investment of Warren E. Buffett, the Omaha billionaire. Berkshire fell $200 a share, to $5,825, after hitting a new low of $5,750.
Other lows were CBS and Loews, both huge investments of the Tisch family and of Laurence A. Tisch, the Manhattan billionaire. CBS fell 2 5/8, to 155, after a new low of 153, while Loews fell 1 1/2, to 85 1/8, after a new low of 85.
''The story's oil again; it's boring but it's oil,'' said Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president of Shearson, Lehman Brothers. ''It has been oil, is oil and will be oil.''
To be sure, other events are shaping thinking on the stock market, particularly the growing prospects for a recession, inaction on the budget deficit and deepening pessimism that interest rates can be reduced anytime in the next few months.
''Whether we have a mild recession or something more serious,'' Mr. Grennan said, ''most likely will hinge on the price of oil.''
While acknowledging first that ''oil's up again,'' Michael Metz, chief market analyst for the Wall Street firm of Oppenheimer & Company, argued that ''the Fed's in a box,'' adding, ''It's unable to ease money despite the slow economy for fear of inflation.''
''Tensions are heightening in the Persian Gulf and there's considerable anxiety that it means war.'' he said. ''In that environment, discretion is the better part of valor and market participants are choosing not to participate.''
 
Foreign Stocks Drop
In most foreign markets, stocks also fell to new lows in the wake of extreme weakness on American markets last week. The sentiment deepened from the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, with the Dow dropping more than 50 points just before 11 A.M. and 62 points by 12:45. It recovered only slightly in the remainder of the session.
With the Dow down 50, the Big Board's 50-point rule went into operation, prohibiting program traders from selling on a downtick. But Birinyi Associates said that program trading still continued extremely heavy. One selling program plus six selling waves, one of which lasted 20 minutes, chopped 34.4 points off the Dow, Birinyi said.
Traders said that except for gold, no category of stocks was spared. The selloff extended from airlines, trucks and autos, to banks, chemical companies and high-tech stocks. Utilities, drugs and food companies, often regarded as havens in bad times, also fell. Other areas of decline included paper and packaging, utilities, insurance, stock brokers, cosmetics and media companies.
With the price of gold rising yesterday by $13.60 an ounce, to $403, Newmont Gold jumped 3 1/8, to 46 1/2; Newmont Mining 2 1/8, to 44 1/8; ASA Ltd. 2 5/8, to 50 1/2; American Barrick 1 3/4, to 23 3/8, and Homestake Mining 1 1/4, to 21 5/8.
Aluminum and bank stocks came under particularly severe pressure.
Aluminum stocks have been a surprisingly strong group, but after Alan Abelson, editor of Barron's, voiced skepticism over the price of the metal, Alcoa fell 3/4, to 63 3/4; Reynolds Metals 3 7/8, to 63 1/2; Amax 1 3/4, to 23 1/4, and, on the American Stock Exchange, Maxxam fell 6 3/8, to 58 1/2.
 
Chase Is Most Active
Chase Manhattan's announcement Friday that it would cut the dividend, trim staff by 5,000 and set up more reserves for bad loans, put Chase at the top of the Big Board active list; it slid 1 5/8, to 11 1/8, on 5.1 million shares and hit a new low of 10 7/8. J. P. Morgan fell 1, to 31 1/8; First Chicago 1 3/8, to 16 7/8; Wells Fargo 1 3/8, to 49 7/8; Chemical 1 7/8, to 15 1/8; First Interstate 1 3/8, to 23 3/4, and Bankers Trust 2, to 32 1/4.
''It takes a real hero,'' said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/ Twenty-First Advisers, ''to stand in and buy stock because you don't know where the bottom is. Stocks look cheap but the fear is that they may get cheaper.
''It's a pretty bad scene out there,'' he added. ''And with the end of the quarter coming up this Friday, it takes a very courageous money manager to buy stocks. They all want to go out of the third quarter with big cash positions. That probably means lower lows all week.''
In one new high, Consolidated Natural Gas, part of an emerging new group, rose 1/8, to 52, after reaching a new high of 52 7/8.
Like the Big Board, where the top 10 stocks all declined, the top 10 on Nasdaq all declined. MCI, the long-distance telephone company, was the exchange's second-most-active stock, falling 1 3/4, to 29 3/4, a new low, on nearly 1.9 million shares.
Prices held up somewhat better among smaller stocks on the Amex. The Amex market-value index fell 3.17, or 1 percent, to 312.84.
 
Tokyo Shares Off
TOKYO, Tuesday, Sept. 25 (AP) -Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell in early trading today, with the Nikkei average of 225 issues off 440.64, or 1.9 percent, to 23,337.19, at the end of the morning session. The index gained 174.85 points on Friday. Tokyo's financial markets were closed on Monday for the autumnal equinox holiday. Today's decline resulted from declines in overseas markets overnight and a rise in oil prices, said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader at Daiwa Securities. The traders said large-capitalization steel stocks paced the broad slide.

HEADLINE: Iraqi Moves Lift Crude To $38.25

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Oil prices approached $40 a barrel and gasoline and heating oil topped $1 a gallon yesterday in sometimes frenzied futures trading.
Traders scrambled to buy supplies after President Saddam Hussein of Iraq threatened on Sunday to order attacks on oilfields in Saudi Arabia, other Arab countries and Israel unless a United Nations embargo against his country was lifted.
Crude for November delivery traded as high as $39.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange before retreating in the afternoon to settle at $38.25, up $2.82 for the day. It was one of the largest single-day increases in seven and a half years of trading on the exchange, and marked the ninth straight trading day that the November contract had risen, for a total rise of $8.38. 
 
Impact on Other Markets
The jump in oil prices had an impact on other financial markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average off by nearly 60 points. Also, gold prices were up sharply, and long-term interest rates rose to their highest levels in 18 months. [Pages D16 and D17.] Increasingly hawkish statements by Iraqi leaders on Thursday, Friday and Sunday have sent oil prices spiraling upward after about two weeks of relative stability and small daily increases.
Sunday's announcement particularly alarmed the many traders and brokers who had assumed that Iraq would go to war only if attacked, said Virginia Wiater, an energy futures broker for United Energy Inc., a New York brokerage. ''That just made everybody completely cuckoo,'' she said.
 
About $39 in Informal Deals
In a further sign of price pressure, traders making informal oil deals after the close of trading on the mercantile exchange were agreeing to prices of about $39 a barrel, said Robert F. Murphy, an energy futures broker at Lehman Brothers Inc. ''Even without war, and without the destruction of the oilfields, we could reach $40'' in trading today, he added, declining to speculate on how high prices might go if war did break out.
Comparing current prices with those prevailing during the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 is difficult because most oil was then shipped under long-term contracts rather than being traded on markets, and because prices in general have risen in the last decade.
The highest price paid for comparable oil was $39.80 on March 29, 1980, said Peter C. Beutel, an oil price analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., a consulting firm in Hoboken, N.J. Adjusted for inflation over the last 10 years, that is comparable to nearly $65 now.
Heating oil for October delivery rose yesterday by 6.71 cents a gallon, to $1.0392, on the mercantile exchange, while October gasoline rose 6.78 cents a gallon, to $1.0423. The contracts for crude oil delivery in December through March all rose the limit of $1.50 a barrel, while heating oil and gasoline contracts for November through March all rose the limit of 4 cents a gallon.
Jet fuel prices set a record of $466 a metric ton in deals struck yesterday in Europe, far surpassing the previous mark of $420 a ton, set on Jan. 3, 1980, said John H. Kingston, the managing editor of Platt's Oilgram Price Report, a daily New York newsletter. Jet fuel is traded in direct deals between refiners and airlines rather than on a commodity exchange, and jet fuel has been in particularly short supply for the last month because a large refinery in Kuwait was one of the world's main producers.
 
Quick Effect Expected
The recent sharp increase in oil prices is likely to affect consumers quickly, although the direct effect on politically sensitive gasoline prices may be muted. Oil companies are marking up the prices of jet and diesel fuel and heating oil quickly, while accepting much-reduced profit margins on sales of gasoline, said Theodore R. Eck, the chief economist of the Amoco Corporation in Chicago.
Rising jet and diesel fuel prices are passed on to consumers by airlines, in the form of higher ticket prices, and by trucking companies that must charge more for transporting food and other goods to stores.
The price of a standard 42-gallon barrel of crude oil has risen from 40 cents a gallon to 91 cents since July 1, including yesterday's sharp increase, said Neil T. Geary, a spokesman for Amoco. During the same period, Amoco has increased the average price it charges to service stations and wholesalers by 21.5 cents a gallon for gasoline and 27.5 cents a gallon for heating oil, he added. Amoco's jet fuel prices have typically climbed about 37 cents a gallon, although increases for specific airlines have varied widely depending on whether they had long-term contracts.
But Edwin S. Rothschild, the energy policy director at Citizen Action, a consumer group based in Washington, said that oil companies could afford to increase gasoline prices slowly now because they raised them slightly during the first six months of this year, when crude oil prices fell $5 a barrel. ''They're already ahead of the game,'' he added.
 
Changes in Payment Practices
Rises in crude oil prices have affected consumers more quickly in recent years in part because of changes in the payment practices of oil companies. Imported oil meets about half of the needs of the United States, and most of this oil is now paid for by the companies when it arrives at an American port, instead of when it is loaded aboard tankers at jetties in the exporting country.
As a result, four-fifths of the imported oil pumped at Amoco service stations has belonged to the company for only the five to seven days that it takes to refine the oil, ship it by pipeline and truck to the dealer, and store it in the dealer's tank until sold to American drivers, Mr. Eck said. In the early 1980's, Amoco paid for oil when it was loaded and owned the shipment during the tanker trip to the United States, which lasts four to six weeks for journeys from the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Hope for Industrial Might

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHIHUAHUA, Mexico

 BODY:
From down the highway, the Ford Motor Company plant, which manufactures more than 1,000 car engines a day for the United States, seems at first glance like just another brown hillock on the vast desert plateau that surrounds this boom town.
Up close, a different story emerges. The Ford plant is a modern, high-tech factory, manned by highly skilled Mexican workers - and a pioneer in a process that is beginning to establish a manufacturing zone in northern Mexico that might some day rival South Korea or Taiwan or even the American Middle West.
Most of the force behind this process comes from United States companies, particularly auto manufacturers, that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in up-to-date plants, whose products range from Kodak cameras and I.B.M. computers to Whirlpool appliances and Caterpillar forklift trucks. Big European and Japanese companies, including Volkswagen, Nissan and Sony, and several Mexican companies are also part of the movement. And their marketplace is primarily the United States. 
The emergence of a high-tech industrial zone in northern Mexico, one roughly as large as California, would significantly alter both the United States and Mexican economies. If the movement takes root - and the factories do not pull up stakes in a decade or so - northern Mexico will become an extension of the United States manufacturing base, in effect increasing America's most sophisticated industrial capacity.
''Ford was among the first to demonstrate, with its Chihuahua engine plant, that the most sophisticated, high-quality manufacturing can be carried out in a rural, third world city that lacks experienced workers or adequate roads and communications,'' said Harley Shaiken, an economist at the University of California at San Diego, who has studied manufacturing in northern Mexico.
Perhaps most important, northern Mexico would add to the American labor force a pool of skilled workers, technicians and engineers, numbering perhaps two or three million people, whose wages for many years would probably be lower than their American counterparts. Already these new workers are showing up in neighborhoods of newly built, two-story apartments in Chihuahua, Monterrey, Hermosillo and Saltillo. Many have rooftop television dishes aimed north to capture American stations.
So far, United States labor unions have not strongly challenged the growing presence of these skilled workers, who earn only a fraction of the wages and benefits that are paid to American workers with similar skills. ''But if the United States unemployment rate were to rise during a recession, then what is happening in Mexico is likely to arouse considerable protest,'' Mr. Shaiken said.
After Ford came to Chihuahua in 1983, General Motors, Nissan, Volkswagen and Chrysler soon set up similar export-oriented engine plants, and now modern auto manufacturing plants are also being built, the most notable being a recently opened Ford factory in Hermosillo that makes cars for the United States.
 
The Second Stage
The new industrialization represents a second stage of manufacturing investment in Mexico. First came the assembly plants that are ubiquitous in northern Mexico. Known as maquiladoras, they are simple, labor-intensive operations that import parts for assembly into finished products that are then exported. Despite their numbers, the maquiladoras accounted for only 30 percent of Mexico's $12.5 billion in manufacturing exports last year. They create little wealth for the nation, beyond the $3 or $4 a day paid to the thousands of unkilled, often semiliterate workers.
In the second stage, Ford and the others are putting down deeper roots, carrying out most of the manufacturing process here. They have helped to double Mexico's manufacturing exports since 1985. Their success has depended on tapping into a hitherto ignored pool of Mexicans who have little manufacturing experience but are graduates of technical and vocational schools in every big city.
 
Big Technical Schools
Most of the schools are state-run, but some are private, the most famous being the Monterrey Technology Institute. It is a college level school with 45,000 students, several campuses and millions of dollars in support from private industry. I.B.M. and Apple Computer, for example, donated $20 million for a research center, not so much to develop technologies, but to teach existing skills.
Ford hired from this pool of workers for its new engine plant, which gave Chihuahua, until then a cattle and mining center, the town's first experience with heavy industry. The recruits learned not only to run the assembly line but also to maintain and repair the computerized machinery, and even to improve upon the manufacturing process.
''In the beginning, we had 50 Americans to train these people and to transfer our engine technology and engineering procedures, but now these skills are spread among many Mexican technicians and supervisors and we have only three Americans left here, including myself,'' said Lyle L. Raymond, the plant manager.
Ford officials brag that the 950 Mexican employees in Chihuahua are as productive as their American counterparts who manufacture the same four-cylinder engine in Lima, Ohio. The workers here earn $3 to $5 an hour, including benefits, while Ford's American employees receive more than $15 an hour.
 
A Typical Worker
Fernando Llanas, 30 years old, a graduate of the state-run Technology Institute here, is typical of the new work force. A supervisor at the Ford plant, he manages a team that both operates and repairs the computerized equipment that machines engine blocks and crankshafts. Before joining Ford in 1982, he considered emigrating to the United States. Now he earns $1,000 a month, a wage handsome enough in Chihuahua that his wife does not have to work. The couple have three daughters.
''I knew nothing about factories when I came here,'' Mr. Llanas said. ''I spent two months in Michigan for training and people came from there to teach us.'' Today, he and his colleagues train the newcomers, who always start as assemblers, and work their way up, through a series of in-house training sessions and exams, to technician and supervisor.
Now the Mexico-United States free-trade agreement, just entering the negotiation stage, is likely to accelerate the industrialization of northern Mexico. Without tariff barriers, manufacturing companies, foreign and Mexican, would concentrate on high-volume production. Each plant would be dedicated to a single product, to supply markets in both countries. Factories that for years served only the protected Mexican market would probably be forced out of business as too costly, or upgraded to high-volume production.
But free trade and open borders are still years in the future. For the moment, the foreign companies come for two main reasons: the pool of low-cost, skilled labor and the need to meet a Government requirement that foreign companies generate exports as a quid-pro-quo for the right to serve the Mexican market.
The Chihuahua plant, in fact, was a gamble on Ford's part to try to fulfill this requirement and compete more effectively against Japan by staffing a factory with low-cost labor sufficiently skilled to produce a world-class engine. Major Mexican companies have adopted the same strategy.
 
Joint Ventures
Whirlpool, for example, is installing a washing machine factory in Monterrey, in a joint venture with Vitro Inc., a Mexican conglomerate that manufactures glass products. Whirlpool pursues lower labor costs while Vitro seeks the technology to manufacture appliances on its own for export to the United States.
''We know that the Mexican labor advantage won't last forever; maybe 5 or 10 years more,'' said Tomas Gonzalez Sada, president of Vitro Household Products, the joint venture subsidiary. ''Once wages rise and the advantage is gone, and Whirlpool perhaps departs, we want to have the technology to continue on our own.''
Vitro's strategy will undoubtedly work, economists say. But Mexico has only about 10 manufacturing conglomerates, and they cannot by themselves sustain northern Mexico as an industrial power.
Foreign corporations are indispensable, businessmen and government officials say. But whether they stay, once Mexican wages have risen, depends on whether these companies find themselves hooked on Mexico. Probably the biggest hook is the development of a nearby network of reliable parts suppliers.
 
Decision Due in November
That, at least, is a major issue in Ford's thinking. The four-cylinder engine made here is soon to be phased out, and by November, Ford will decide whether to retool the plant, a process that could require tens of millions of dollars for new machinery to manufacture a new engine. Ford could also decide to move the factory to another country, the main candidate being the United States.
''The decision will probably be determined by Ford's overall global strategy,'' Mr. Raymond said. ''But a major consideration is ties with local suppliers.''
Those ties have come slowly, mostly because Mexican suppliers have had difficulty meeting quality standards. When the engine plant opened seven years ago, 65 percent of the parts were brought by truck or rail from the United States. Now this has been whittled to 50 percent.
Fuel injectors, some valves, the flywheel, the electrical harness and other items are still imported. But Mexican companies now supply the engine block, the intake manifold, clutch plates, piston rods, gaskets and, soon, the oil pan.
 
Seeking Suppliers
Above all, Ford wanted a Mexican supplier for the engine block, a heavy item that is expensive to ship from a Ford plant in Cleveland. The company finally found Cifunsa, a manufacturer in Saltillo that had been making the blocks for years, but only to the standards required for cars made and sold within Mexico.
Cifunsa was forced into a major upgrade, including a $150 million investment in a new plant. Although Ford did not underwrite the upgrade, it insisted that Cifunsa acquire engine block technology from Fiat and for months Italian technicians worked at the Saltillo factory, helping to train its employees and transferring the technology. ''We started with 27 Italians and we still have three here,'' said Ernesto Garza Martinez, Cifunsa's general director.
Ford experts also spent months at the company, supervising quality. To achieve the cost reductions that come with high volume, Cifunsa was encouraged to also supply engine blocks to General Motors, Chrysler and Volkswagen as well.
Now those engine blocks are less expensive than any available in the United States, Mr. Garza Martinez says, in part because Cifunsa's 2,000 employees are paid much less than their American counterparts.
''We aren't able to make breakthroughs in engine block technology,'' Mr. Garza Martinez said. ''But when others introduce improvements, we are now in a position to apply them quickly to our operation. And we now have in our hands the Fiat process.''

Support Sought By UAL Pilots

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: ROSEMONT, Ill., Sept. 24

 BODY:
United Airlines pilots, struggling to complete a proposed $4.4 billion buyout of the carrier, today accused the chairman of the UAL Corporation, Stephen M. Wolf, of trying to undermine their effort.
 
In a letter to pilots, the
United Airlines unit of the Air Line Pilots Association said Mr. Wolf was telling the company's board that employee ownership was not widely supported by the union's members. 
''Unfortunately, some members of the board believe him, and the board will decide our collective future on Oct. 9 based on Mr. Wolf's allegations,'' the group said.
 
The pilot-led group has until
Oct. 9 to arrange financing for the $201-a-share deal, which the board accepted in April. UAL stock fell sharply after the release of the four-page letter.
UAL was off $8.50 a share today, to $92.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
UAL said in a statement that its executives had not yet seen the union's letter and thus could not comment. ''There is, however, a growing concern within the industry and among United employees about being a highly leveraged carrier during these uncertain economic times,'' the company said.
 
The union is asking every
United Airlines pilot to convey support of the proposed buyout to the UAL board by letter or Mailgram.

HEADLINE: Kuwaitis Sell Stake in British Hotels

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The Kuwait Investment Office, which manages much of the $90 billion to $100 billion in foreign assets owned by Kuwait, today sold its 10.1 percent stake in Mount Charlotte Investments P.L.C., generating speculation that the exiled Kuwaiti Government is having to sell stocks to pay for its commitments related to the Middle East crisis.
The Mount Charlotte stake was sold to Sir Ron Brierley, a New Zealand businessman who at the same time also made a takeover bid for the entire company, which is one of Britain's largest hotel operators.
A spokeswoman for the secretive, state-owned Kuwait Investment Office, which is based in London, said the Mount Charlotte sale was ''purely an investment decision'' and ''does not signal any kind of selling program.''
 
Denial on Pressure
At a lunch with reporters in London on Friday, Kuwait's exiled Finance Minister, Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, denied that Kuwaiti state-owned enterprises were under pressure to sell stocks. 
The exiled Government has promised to spend about $2.5 billion over the next three months to help support the American military forces in the Persian Gulf region and another $2.5 billion or so for economic aid to Middle Eastern countries being hurt by complying with the trade embargo against Iraq.
In addition, the Government in exile, which is based in Saudi Arabia, is helping to support some 150,000 Kuwaiti exiles. Sheik Ali estimated that the exile-support program would cost $50 million to $100 million a month.
 
Net Reduction in Assets
He said all these demands would mean a net reduction in Government-owned foreign assets. But he added that the money would come from drawing on bank deposits and other short-term securities and would not require a selloff of assets like stocks and real estate.
He added that aside from broad guidelines set by the Finance Ministry, the Kuwait Investment Office's professional investment managers were making the decisions about which stocks to buy and sell. Given the drop in many of the world's stock markets, he repeated that the office might be interested in bargains or stocks with long-term growth potential in markets like Britain and West Germany.
Other large European companies in which the Kuwait Investment Office or other state-owned concerns are believed to hold large stakes include Britain's British Petroleum and Midland Bank; West Germany's Daimler-Benz, Hoechst and Metallgesellschaft; Spain's Ebro Agricolas, a food company, and Torras Papel, a paper company, and Italy's Ifil, a holding company controlled by the Agnelli family. They are also believed to own billions of dollars worth of American and European real estate.
 
Stake at 39.9 Percent Now
A Brierley-controlled company purchased the Kuwait Investment Office's stake in Mount Charlotte for about 64 million ($120.2 million). That increased the amount he owns or controls to 39.9 percent, and he offered to pay $727.1 million for the remainder. Under Britain's takeover regulations, he had to make a bid for the whole company after his holding passed the 30 percent mark. The vast Brierley holdings include airline, brewing, shipping and apparel interests in New Zealand and stakes in military contractors, a travel agency chain and food retailing in Britain.
His bid of 73 pence ($1.37) a share values the company, which operates more than 100 hotels in Britain, with about 14,000 rooms, at 644 million ($1.2 billion). In an interview, Robert Peel, Mount Charlotte's chief executive, said the bid was too low and the company would resist. He called the offer ''derisory and opportunistic.''
Lindsay Russell, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd., estimated Mount Charlotte's asset value to be at least 1 ($1.88) a share.
 
Stock Prices Depressed
A slump in the British real estate market has depressed the prices of property-related stocks. Mount Charlotte is also struggling to reduce a high level of debt, which it incurred last year when it bought the Thistle hotel chain from Edinburgh-based Scottish and Newcastle Breweries P.L.C.
Mr. Peel acted surprised that the Kuwait Investment Office had not given him any prior warning or explanation of today's sale. ''With the Kuwaiti crisis, the Kuwait Investment Office is arguably under some pressure,'' he speculated.
Mount Charlotte, which is based in Leeds, England, is the second-largest hotel operator in Britain after Trusthouse Forte P.L.C. About half of its rooms are in central London, where its hotels include the Selfridge, the Tower Thistle, the Grosvenor, the Mount Royal and the New Barbican.
 
Three-> to Five-Star Hotels
Its strategy has been to focus on three- to five-star hotels, or those in the medium-price and luxury categories. In 1989, the company had pretax earnings of 47.6 million ($76.6 million) on revenues of 155.5 million ($250.3 million) Mr. Peel said the Kuwait Investment Office had held various stakes in Mount Charlotte since the mid- to late 1970's. It bought the 10.1 percent block right before the stock market crash of October 1987, he added.
Mount Charlotte's shares closed today on the London International Stock Exchange at 70.5 pence ($1.325), up 11 pence (20.7 cents).

HEADLINE: Budget Deficit at Record

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
The Federal budget deficit jumped $52.8 billion, to a record $241.7 billion, in August but could be reduced before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, the Treasury Department said today.
The 67 percent surge over the comparable 11 months of last year pushed the spending imbalance well beyond the record of $221.1 billion posted in the 1986 fiscal year. But the August total fell short of the one-month record of $53.3 billion set in March.
''We used to have years that were that bad,'' Bruce Steinberg, an economist for Merrill Lynch & Company, said of the August deficit.
The department said about $25 billion of the August deficit reflected a shift of payments of military pay and Social Security checks normally made in September to the previous month to avoid delays from the Labor Day weekend. ''This will affect September's results by $25 billion as compared to last year,'' the department said in a statement.
But even without the $25 billion early payment, the deficit so far this fiscal year would still total $216.9 billion. The deficit in September 1989 was $6.1 billion.
The Bush Administration had forecast a $218.5 billion imbalance for all of the 1990 fiscal year.
Revenues in August totaled $78.5 billion, up 3.1 percent from the comparable month last year. But the receipts were offset by $131.2 billion in outlays, a 33.5 percent gain over August 1989.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Oil Price Rise and Stock Fall Help Push Gold Beyond $400

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of gold futures climbed above $400 an ounce yesterday as soaring energy prices, crumbling stock prices and a slumping dollar renewed investor interest in metals.
Gold settled $13.60 to $15.30 higher on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with the contract for delivery in September at $403 an ounce, the highest level in a month.
Silver futures ended 12.5 cents to 13.7 cents higher, with September at $4.915 an unce. 
Demand for gold was prompted mainly by an enormous jump in oil prices and a 59.41-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, both of which occurred largely in reaction to heightened fears of war in the Middle East, analysts said. Oil for November delivery rose $2.82, to $38.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Iraq's leaders warned over the weekend that they would begin a war before allowing the United Nations trade embargo to ''strangle'' their nation.
Besides the threats of greater inflation and international turmoil, two historical buying signals for gold, the analysts said precious metals were supported by a further decline in the dollar's value against other leading currencies.
James Steel, an energy and precious metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New York, noted that the dollar had strengthened in the oil crises of the 1970's.
''Other oil-importing countries, like Japan and Germany, have seen their currencies appreciate,'' Mr. Steel said. ''This could indicate that in this time of rising energy prices, the world has more confidence in their economies than in ours.''
The analysts said the selling of physical gold that kept a lid on prices last week appeared to have abated, which may have encouraged speculators to buy gold futures.
In coffee futures, meanwhile, prices plunged on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange after Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, called for a one-year extension of an international accord that contained no coffee export limits.
Several other large coffee-producing countries, including Colombia, have been pushing for a return to export quotas to increase prices.
Coffee settled 2.25 cents to 3.5 cents lower, with December at 94 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Retreats Broadly Except Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar sank against all major currencies yesterday except the Japanese yen in selling touched off by speculation that industrialized countries might not try to stop the United States currency from sinking further.
News that the Government's pool of red ink swelled to a record level in August also weighed down the dollar.
Trading in the foreign exchange markets was choppy, with attention directed largely at the relative values of the German mark and the Japanese yen, currency dealers said. 
The dollar's weakness against most foreign counterparts followed a weekend statement from the Group of Seven finance ministers urging that monetary policies continue firm in the face of high oil prices, which are stoking inflation.
The Group of Seven statement also expressed contentment with recent movements in currency values, implying that the monetary authorities might not object to more of the same movements, dealers said. The Group of Seven members are the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, Canada, France and Italy.
A monthly report on the Federal budget deficit also was a negative for the dollar. The deficit expanded by $52.8 billion, to a record $241.7 billion in August - 67 percent larger than it was in the first 11 months of the fiscal year 1989.
The British pound rose in London to $1.8810, from $1.8465 late Friday. A pound was quoted at $1.8805 late in New York, up from late Friday's $1.8430.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.5595 marks from 1.5775.
The yen lost ground in New York, however, amid concern that a prolonged oil price spiral could damage the Japanese economy.
The dollar fell to a closing 135.57 yen in London from 137.33 yen at Friday's Tokyo close. Tokyo markets were closed yesterday for a holiday marking the arrival of fall. But as trading ended in New York, the dollar was quoted at 137.50 yen, up from 136.65 yen on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's late quotes, included: 1.2980 Swiss francs, down from 1.3190; 5.2210 French francs, down from 5.2815; 1.14975 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1529, and 1,167.75 Italian lire, down from 1,175.25.

Gaining New Perspectives On Medicine

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
THE effort to make the medical field better understood and more sensitive to the needs of the modern world has resulted in an increase in medical humanities courses.
Davidson College, a liberal arts institution in Davidson, N.C., with an enrollment of 1,350, has a new program called Medical Humanities, which could be helpful for anyone interested in the field. The program is a 15-credit concentration in medical-related topics, and 14 students are taking it this fall.
There is a basic required course, called Perspectives on Medicine, and 4 electives selected from a list of 14, like American Medical History; Medical Anthropology; Genetics, Society and Decisions; Economics of Population; Bioengineering and Health Technologies, and Death and Dying. 
''A large number of our students are accepted into medical school,'' Dr. John W. Kuykendall, Davidson's president, said in an interview in New York last week. ''This program is good for them.''
In recent years, medical schools have stressed that they want prospective students with a broader background in liberal arts, not just in science. The theory is that in medical school, students receive training needed in anatomy, physiology and other specifics.
Davidson's program is also for students interested in hospital management, nursing, social service and corporate personnel jobs, as well as for those who may want to become ministers, said Dr. Rosemarie Tong, the professor heading the program. It could also be useful to future corporate managers who will wrestle with rising costs for medical benefits. In addition, Dr. Tong stressed that some students want to know how to deal with the elderly or disabled in their families.
Many universities, especially those with medical schools, offer medical humanities courses, but Dr. Kuykendall thinks that Davidson might be the first liberal arts college with such a comprehensive program.
''We no longer have a pre-med major, so those students can major in anything from classics to chemistry,'' Dr. Tong said last week. She explained, however, that four students in their junior year are planning to go to medical school and that they are using the program as a major, in addition to necessary courses for medical school like organic chemistry and biology.
''What Davidson wants to do is to create future sensitive human beings, as well as those expert in science,'' she said.
''I teach a course in medical ethics with a local doctor,'' she said. This year the ethics course has attracted 42 students. ''We focus heavily on economic issues, as well as political, social and legal ones,'' she commented. Discussion might involve rationing expensive medical care and the question of whether the terminally ill should be kept alive.
Dr. Tong, 42 years old, graduated from Marygrove College in Detroit and obtained a doctorate at Temple University. Her specialty: philosophy of law.
''This is a forward-looking program.'' she said, adding that she thinks students should have double majors or interdisciplinary programs. ''During a lifetime, they will wear several hats. Careers are starting to come into existence that we never thought about earlier.''
In Wall Street, Dr. Lindsay Rosenwald exemplifies this trend. A medical doctor, he is now managing director of corporate finance for D. H. Blair & Company, a privately owned investment firm. He heads a team of three physician-financiers who search in the medical community for the latest developments that can be marketed with the help of private investment. They get in touch with hospitals, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, universities, scientific firms and research groups.
A graduate of Temple University's medical school in 1983, he called the switch from physician ''intellectually stimulating, as well as financially rewarding.''
''We get to locate, research, finance and underwrite cutting-edge technologies in areas of medicine like diagnostics and medical imaging,'' he said. ''I am doing a deal at the University of Pennsylvania, that doesn't even have a name yet.'' Developed by a professor, it involves a process to synthesize carbohydrates. ''It could be used in nutritional products,'' he said, including perhaps as a substitute for mother's milk.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Rich Man's Quest for Salmon Is Toast of a Soviet Outpost

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UMBA, U.S.S.R., Sept. 23

 BODY:
All summer long this pristine stretch of Marx-forsaken frontier has witnessed the strangest of sights: the Communist Party has been quietly catering to American plutocrats who fly over for a $6,000 week of premier sports fishing for Atlantic salmon.
The local Communist Party exective committee, through a dummy tourist corporation, has become a nervous but increasingly open partner in a joint venture to reap hundreds of thousands of dollars from the vodka-clear waters of the Umba River here, just inside the polar circle, a scenic outpost that salmon anglers already are hailing as one of the most bountiful in the world.
 
'Here's to Money'
The salmon have been as spectacular in their cooperation as the visiting Americans have been generous with big checkbooks, tall fish tales and nighttime toasts with the local rough-hewn vodka to warm the Slavic gullet of such as Nikolai. He is one of the local river residents hired, trained and equipped by the American sponsors to be a salmon guide, working for hard-currency tips and, no less novel to the average Soviet laborer, professional pride. 
''Here's to money! We all want money!'' boomed Nikolai, with an upraised glass and dancing blue eyes at the close of a night's rigorous round of vodka toasts at the camp meal.
It had been a long riff of garrulous drinking that began with such oldie-goldies as ''To mutual friendship and understanding.'' But when Nikolai cut to the chase - the nation's rapidly heightening pursuit of personal profit - Herb Van Dyke, a bearded American fisherman who is a partner yet a clear-eyed skeptic in the venture, felt his heart leap up like one of the silver and gun-metal salmon plying the river out beyond the camp lights.
''I've been teaching him about the profit motive,'' Mr. Van Dyke said. ''And Nikolai's just beautiful. Some of these businessmen offered to hire him for $100,000 and take him back to America to become a joint-venture executive, but Nikolai says he wants to make the big money and still stay here.''
 
A Race for Wealth
The salmon venture is literally the most far-out example of what is becoming a national race by Communist Party officials to be on the cutting edge of free enterprise and turn their lingering power and resources into hard-currency wealth.
In Moscow, the party has begun renting rooms to tourists for dollars in its two V.I.P. hotels, which were once reserved for the hierarchy.
As party ideologues dust off their anti-capitalist dialectic in the Kremlin's endless foundering over how to approach free enterprise, other party hustlers have opened a Communist bank named Kompartbank in Kazakhstan, begun investing hundreds of millions of rubles in interest-bearing accounts and acquiring real estate and newspapers. They have even solicited the first paid advertisements in Pravda, the party newspaper.
The key to the salmon deal here is Bill Davies, an Arizona businessman and Russophile who has been roaming the backwoods and bureaucracies of party power for the past five years. He convinced local party officials to shut down the Umba's salmon-processing business, an unsporting net funnel across the river that routinely turned the glorious creatures into canned food as they headed to their spawning grounds upriver.
''They made 30,000 rubles a year from that, all of it going into the central treasury in the Kremlin,'' Mr. Davies said. ''They'll be making about $200,000 a year in local hard-currency profits from us'' - a mere 160 trout anglers annually.
 
Riches Spawn Jealousy
Hiring local people as guides and camp workers, Mr. Davies has worked on esprit, giving them the latest in high-tech equipment and inventing a voucher system for channeling rather generous tips from the fishermen into hard-currency purchases from Western mail-order department stores. Inevitably, such flourishes of personal wealth have brought troubles to this new workers' paradise, with some party officials openly covetous and complaining.
A few freelancers emerged in the local party apparatus, seeking richer personal dealings with rival American investors by promising them the Umba, the venture's partners said, despite the five-year contract that Mr. Davies' Philadelphia-based operation, Soviet Sports Connections, already has with local officials.
The intrigues are understandable. Sports salmon fishermen are relentless in their search for the perfect grounds, spending $10,000 and more for trips to Scandinavia and Britain, even as the world's prize salmon runs are increasingly endangered. While such fees normally net a good fisherman a few salmon for a week's joy, here on the Umba visiting anglers can be seen hooking two or three in a day, a veritable Valhalla for man, and for fish, too, since the venture's rules require all salmon caught to be immediately released back into the river.
''This place is incredible,'' said Dick Talleur, a well-known American expert on the arts of angling and hand-making the casting flies that attract trout and salmon. ''There's nowhere like it on earth. Fish for two hours here and you get two big salmon, a catch that takes a week in other, better-known places.''
 
The Art of Making Flies
Mr. Talleur wants to broaden the economy here further by opening a branch of his own operations and teaching local residents the art, arcane but precise, of making the expensive flies from bits of colorful fur, feathers and hooks.
''The future of all this depends very much on the Russians,'' he said, noting that while the camp's great success is already clear, suspicious party apparatchiks keep dropping by, ill at ease with the entrepreneurial initiative on the part of fellow villagers and barely suppressing their envy.
In a strange marriage of Western corporate espionage and Communist paranoia, a particular Umba resident who sits watching the camp from dawn to sunset is widely suspected of being a spy for the party's new capitalist intriguers. This local witness shows up regularly at the camp headquarters, citing old Communist regulations governing business. The Kremlin's new free-market gospel of decentralized economic initiative is quickly read back by Mr. Davies, a veteran of long bouts of fencing and drinking through the night with party provincials.
''The country here is moving and we're glad the Americans have come,'' said Vasily Shevelev, a white-haired river man hired as the chief guide for the visitors.
 
Martians and Make-Believe
Mr. Shevelev enjoys shepherding them to the big fish. He is amused at the sight of the sportsmen mincing along the edges of the cold, fruitful river, Martian-like in their high-tech, designer river waders and color-coordinated impedimenta, casting make-believe flies where a stick of dynamite used to do.
''The only ones opposed to what is happening here are party bureaucrats who brought the nation to the depths,'' he said, throwing a hard glance at the nearby woods as he steered his boat to where the salmon waited.
''The hacks still think the good life is only for them to have,'' added Mr. Shevelev, who drank deeply at Nikolai's toast to money.

ECONOMIC GROWTH NEAR A STANDSTILL, U.S. FIGURES SHOW

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The Commerce Department reported today that the American economy nearly came to a standstill in the second quarter of this year, with the meager growth being far worse than previously thought.
For its part, the Bush Administration today sharply lowered its projection for the growth rate of the economy this year - and declined to rule out a recession. The White House has slashed its internal estimate of the growth in total economic output to roughly 1 percent, about half of what the Administration projected as recently as mid-July.
The sharp reduction in the White House growth estimate was only partly attributable to soaring oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August. 
 
Oil Shock Called a Factor
''We believe that the economy now is on a weaker growth path than we did in the summer, partly - but not exclusively - because of the oil shock,'' said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
The Commerce Department report indicated that the economy was weaker earlier this year than previous reports showed. The department now puts growth in the April-June period at a meager four-tenths of 1 percent on an annual basis, well under the 1.2 percent rate previously reported.
While many Americans believe that a recession is already here, they are being told by Government officials to put their worries aside for the moment because other economic issues, mainly inflation, have to be dealt with first. [Economic analysis, page D1.] Many businesses have experienced continued weakness since the second quarter, and a growing number of private economists believe the nation's economy is no longer growing and possibly in a recession already.
''I think this tells you we're a lot closer to stagnation than we thought,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the Pittsburgh National Bank.
Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Company, said that ''the economy was headed toward a recession before Iraq, and Iraq was just the nail in the coffin.''
The National Association of Business Economists, a group of economists at American corporations, said today that the risk of a recession had risen ''significantly,'' with the median probability of this occurring in the next 12 months now at 50 percent, up from 20 percent in May.
Mr. Boskin noted that the United States economy had been growing ''sluggishly'' for several quarters before the Iraqi invasion, a point underscored by the Commerce Department's report today. The growth in the gross national product has now averaged a rate of less than 1 percent for the latest three quarters despite extra stimulus in the first three months of this year from exceptionally warm weather that aided construction.
 
No Specific Figures
Mr. Boskin did not supply specific figures for his lowered projections for this year and next, which he said might remain internal until publication of the budget in January, but he cited reduced expectations in a survey of members of the business economists group and said the Administration was doing ''likewise.''
The business economists' panel of 71 forecasters now predicts that G.N.P. growth this year will be 1.2 percent, down from the 2 percent predicted in May. For 1991, the business economists envision growth of 1.4 percent instead of the 2.4 percent forecast three months earlier. The poll was taken in August.
The Administration, in its mid-session review published on July 16, had expected 2 percent growth this year and 2.8 percent in 1991.
Mr. Boskin said nothing about a recession during his address but afterward he said in response to questions from reporters that he could not rule it out.
 
Revenues and Outlays Affected
Slower growth in the G.N.P. generally cuts Treasury revenues and, to the extent unemployment rises, raises outlays for jobless and other benefits.
Two straight quarters in which the G.N.P. rises at a rate of less than 1 percent could lead to a suspension of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. This requires passage of such a resolution by both houses of Congress and the approval of the President.
Mr. Boskin, while acknowledging that the G.N.P. revision was ''not good news,'' contended that the effects of the oil shock would be less than those of the 1970's because the economy now uses one-third less energy per unit of output and because of the lifting of counterproductive price controls and energy regulations.
He blasted as ''ludicrous'' legislation that would force auto makers to raise the fuel efficiency of vehicles by a further 40 percent. The Administration has contended that the requirement would exact a heavy economic toll, raising costs for auto makers and consumers so that sales would be hurt, and increasing inflation. Later in the day, the measure was blocked in the Senate, ending any chance that the bill will pass this year.
 
Fall in Exports and Inventories
In revising the G.N.P. data, the Commerce Department said that the downward adjustments since last month were a $4.7 billion reduction in net exports and a $2.1 billion reduction in business inventories. In the last few years, frequent and sizable revisions in the Government's economic statistics have become increasingly common, which has made the task of policy makers even more difficult as they try to manage the economy.
Inflation, however, remained at the same 3.9 percent pace, as measured by the G.N.P. price index that assumes an unvarying composition of output in goods and services.
The gross national product, as expressed in current dollars - that is, not adjusted for inflation - is now shown to have advanced at a 5.1 percent rate during the spring quarter instead of the 5.8 percent reported last month.
Today's report also said that corporate profits from current production - before taxes but with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments - rose in the second quarter by $100 million more than estimated a month ago.
The Commerce Department's first estimate of the G.N.P. for the current quarter, which most economists now think is likely to fall short of a 1 percent rate of gain and may well be negative, is to be published on Oct. 30.

HEADLINE: White House and Congress Map Strategy for Deep Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
With time for a budget compromise running short, the White House and Congressional Democrats each prepared doomsday scenarios today to keep the Government running when the new fiscal year begins on Monday and to turn to their advantage automatic spending cuts that would take effect that day.
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, told Senate Republicans in a meeting behind closed doors that President Bush was prepared to rely on an apparently untested legal opinion, issued in the final days of the Carter Administration, to continue ''essential services'' even though money to pay for them has not been approved by Congress.
The strategy immediately drew criticism even from members of Mr. Bush's own party, who warned Mr. Sununu that it was an intrusion on Congress's constitutional spending power.
Mr. Sununu outlined this aggressive strategy as the White House found its bargaining demand for a cut in the capital gains tax rate weakened as the top Republican leader in the House, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, said he would be willing to abandon the cut if that would mean a budget deal with Democrats. 
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader and the only other Republican lawmaker in the top-level negotiating group that has been meeting for the last week, has previously indicated that lowering the capital gains tax rate is not as high a priority for him as a budget deal.
For their part, the Democratic leadership prepared for the budget deadline by laying plans to ram an alternative budget through both houses after first allowing the automatic spending cuts to take effect for the first few days of the new fiscal year.
 
A Stopgap Spending Bill
Both strategies assume that in the absence of a budget deal within the next 48 hours, Democratic Congressional leaders will put forward a stopgap spending bill to finance the Government and delay the automatic spending cuts for at least a week and perhaps as much as three. A stopgap bill delaying the cuts until Oct. 20 cleared two crucial House committees today and is expected to reach the House floor on Thursday. That bill includes $2 billion that Mr. Bush has requested for American military operations in the Persian Gulf.
Although Congress has until midnight Sunday to work out a solution to the money crunch, the time for floor action is actually much tighter. Both the House and Senate plan to suspend formal sessions on Friday afternoon through Saturday evening to accommodate lawmakers observing the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur.
 
Bush's Latest Veto Threat
Mr. Bush reiterated to reporters today that in the absence of a budget compromise, he would veto a stopgap spending bill that delays the automatic cuts. ''So if there is no budget agreement with real spending reduction and real process reform by the end of the week, I will have to veto it,'' he told reporters. ''I do not want to see further delays and kicking this problem on down the road.''
Mr. Sununu's message came in response to questions from Republican senators who were concerned that the automatic spending cuts would be devastating to the economy and to their party.
Republicans said the White House would base its authority to continue some Government operations on a 1981 legal opinion by Benjamin R. Civiletti, the Attorney General under President Jimmy Carter. Those operations could theoretically exempt air traffic control, meat inspection and military operations from cuts that would otherwise be required under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law.
In his legal opinion on Jan. 16, 1981, just four days before Mr. Carter left office, Mr. Civiletti argued that while the Government could not operate unless Congress authorized the money, exceptions could be made ''in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.'' That opinion was a revision of one Mr. Civiletti had issued nine months earlier in which he said Government agencies would have to shut down if money to finance them was not approved by Congress.
If no stopgap spending measure is enacted by Monday, it would not be the first time the Federal Government has operated without money for the new fiscal year. Such a situation has occurred five times since 1977 - three times during the Carter Administration and twice during the Reagan Administration. Although the situation led to a lot of confusion, the Government did continue to run.
 
Issue of Capital Gains
The high-level budget talks continued tonight. Democrats say the talks have foundered on the issue of a cut in the capital gains tax. Senator Dole, who suggested last week that a vote on capital gains and other revenue losing measures be separated from the deficit-reducing package in hopes of moving the stalled talks along.
Congressional Democrats are adamantly opposed to the cut in the capital gains tax unless it is accompanied by tax increases on the wealthy Americans who would be the primary beneficiaries of the lower capital gains rate. Democrats have said that once the capital gains issue was resolved, remaining disputes over spending cuts and budget enforcement procedures could be settled quickly.
In declaring his position today, Mr. Michel noted that he did not speak for all House Republicans, most of whom continue to insist that a gains cut must be part of the budget package. He also noted that Mr. Bush had campaigned on a pledge to lower the gains tax rate and that so far the Administration appeared to be standing pat. ''I still take my lead from the Administration,'' he said.
House Democratic leaders said they planned to make a decision by late tonight or early Wednesday on how to proceed with the stopgap spending bill and its provisions for delaying automatic spending cuts. Some form of temporary spending measure will be necessary by Oct. 1 even if there is a budget agreement because Congress has not enacted any of the 13 regular spending bills that are supposed to finance the Government for the 1991 fiscal year that begins then.
 
Democratic Scenario
Like the Republicans, Democrats assume the President would make good on his threat to veto a stopgap spending bill. Democrats also assume that at least initially they will not have the votes to override that veto and that about $85 billion of reductions in domestic and military spending will take effect.
Some Democrats say the automatic cuts should be delayed until Oct. 20 to give Congress more time to work out a budget solution. But others, including Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, have suggested a delay of just a few days.
Under this plan, Democrats would use their majorities in the House and Senate to try to pass their own version of a budget quickly. While such a budget would undoubtedly meet Republican resistance, Democrats are wagering that lawmakers faced with the choice between a Democratic plan or continuation of the automatic spending cuts will approve the Democratic budget.
Senate Republicans, who fear precisely such an outcome but who also object to Mr. Sununu's plan, today began to prepare their own budget alternatives.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
New Group to Direct Flow of Crisis Aid

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
President Bush announced today the formation of a steering group of countries to coordinate international economic aid to nations hard hit by oil price increases and other results of the Persian Gulf crisis.
Establishment of the council, the Gulf Crisis Financial Coordination Group, helps resolve what had been a growing dispute over control of the money.
Washington had been eager to keep as much control as possible, while Japan, Germany, Saudi Arabia and other creditor nations, who have altogether pledged $20 billion in the effort, had sought to have international organizations coordinate the effort.
The President made the announcement in a welcoming speech to delegates from more than 150 countries at the 45th annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which have sweeping responsibilities in the global economic system. #2 Americans to Head Committee Both organizations have endorsed plans to speed billions of dollars to help the countries most seriously affected by the Iraqi invasion through faster disbursement of loans and other measures. That assistance is separate from direct commitments of money from one country to another, which will be coordinated by the new group. 
Although the new steering committee is multinational, both its chairman and deputy chairman will be Americans. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will head the organization. His deputy is to be an official to be named by the State Department.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are also providing major financial support for newly emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and soon may even play a role in restructuring the Soviet economy.
 
Continued Aid for Egypt
As the President was addressing the delegates, one element of the Administration's effort to help hard-hit countries lost ground when the House Appropriations Committee set aside a proposal to forgive Egypt's $6.7 billion military debt, after lawmakers said the plan would die on the House floor.
To buy time for legislators and the Administration to work out a compromise, the committee adopted a temporary waiver that allows Egypt to continue receiving American military aid. Without the waiver, aid would have been cut off because Egypt is a year behind in repaying its military debt.
The President spoke to the bank-fund meeting after seeing President Turgut Ozal of Turkey at the White House. Their talks were dominated by the global response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and Turkey's strategic role in the buildup against Iraq.
 
Aid and Trade for Turkey
The Turkish leader vowed to continue honoring the United Nations trade embargo against Iraq and received assurances of both aid and trade to soften the economic effects.
While there are no immediate plans to send emergency military aid to Turkey, officials familiar with American arms sales said Ankara would probably receive surplus F-4 fighter planes and M-60 tanks from the European inventories of the United States and other NATO countries next year.
Turkey is one of the nations that is to get assistance not only from the bank and the fund but from the individual country donors who have joined the new gulf coordination group.
In his address, the President made reference to ''special invitees'' from the Soviet Union whose ''presence here reminds us all of how events of the past year are producing a new partnership of nations.''
 
A Soviet Application
The two organizations had invited Moscow to take part in an annual meeting for the first time, as a prelude to possible full membership.
Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of Gosbank, or the State Bank of the Soviet Union, led a 15-person Soviet delegation to the meeting. Members of the group told reporters to expect a Soviet membership application soon.
The World Bank makes long-term loans, largely for projects like dams, irrigation works, harbors, ports and so on. The I.M.F. makes shorter-term loans to help members cover short-term cash shortages. Both organizations impose conditions of economic policy on their assistance.
 
Head of World Bank Speaks
Barber B. Conable Jr., president of the World Bank, and Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also spoke of the long shadow cast by the gulf crisis on the world economy.
''The crisis in the Middle East has reminded us all that peace is fragile and that economies are always vulnerable,'' Mr. Camdessus said in his opening remarks.
Mr. Conable warned that the crisis could have a ''serious effect'' on the poor. He noted that more than a billion people, half of them in South Asia, still live on less than a dollar a day.
 
Criticism in House
As the World Bank and the I.M.F. met, members of two House subcommittees blamed the Bush Administration for failing to warn thousands of Americans to leave Iraq and Kuwait before they were taken hostage.
Elizabeth M. Tamposi, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, said her office did not do more to warn Americans before the invasion because few people anticipated the attack.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, blamed President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d for lapses of judgment.
''Certainly, the chances of a loss of life, the dangers, were real enough that some warning could be given, flights averted, people asked to make plans for their own personal safety,'' Mr. Torricelli said. ''The victimization of Americans in Kuwait really began with the failure of judgment in the United States State Department.''
Representative Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, the ranking Republican on the International Operations Subcommittee, expressed bewilderment that the State Department did not update travel advisories already in affect for months warning against terrorism in the Middle East to advise travelers that the Iraqi buildup on the Kuwaiti border might endanger their lives.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: Man in the News;
The Exiled Emir: Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 25

 BODY:
One of the first tasks assigned to Iraqi troops when they invaded Kuwait in the early hours of Aug. 2 was to capture or kill Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait. Alerted early in the morning about the invasion, the Emir fled in a car to Saudi Arabia, minutes before the first Iraqis soldiers entered the grounds of Dasman Palace.
The Iraqis wanted to consolidate their seizure of Kuwait by capturing and probably killing the estimated 1,200 Sabahs who form the vast clan whose name has been associated with the existence of a Kuwaiti entity since the 18th century.
But many members of the family were vacationing abroad at the time and most of the senior Sabahs in Kuwait, including the Crown Prince, Sheik Saad al-Abdallah al-Salem al-Sabah, slipped away to safety in Saudi Arabia, where they now live in the summer resort town of Taif.
 
In All Major Posts
As Emir since 1978, Sheik Jaber, who is scheduled to meet with President Bush on Saturday, has reigned at the head of this powerful clan, with his brothers, cousins and other relatives controlling all major aspects of government, including security, oil, the economy, information and defense. 
Until his flight to Saudi Arabia, the Emir steered his country through difficult years that included the Iranian revolution in 1979, the Iraq-Iran war from 1980 to 1988 and the spectacular rise and fall of oil revenues in that period.
He refused to yield to Iranian threats, backed by hijackings of Kuwaiti planes and an attempt on his life by pro-Iranian militants, maintaining his financial and moral support of Iraq in its war against Iran. Playing Americans against Russians, Kuwait put its oil tankers under the flag of the two superpowers to discourage Iranian attacks.
Once the war was over, however, the Emir shut the money tap to Iraq. He gambled, wrongly as it turned out, that Kuwait's skillful diplomacy of playing enemies against each other would save his country from Iraqi demands for money and access to the Persian Gulf through Kuwait.
 
Quiet and Aloof
Although most Kuwaitis do not regard their Emir as a brilliant or even exceptional ruler, they do not hold him responsible for any major errors in judgment throughout his rule, and few think he could have done things differently to prevent the invasion by Iraq.
Asked what they thought of him as a person or what they knew about his life, numerous Kuwaitis seemed to have little to say beyond that fact that he had grown quite aloof since becoming Emir.
The 64-year-old Emir received little formal education, being pulled out of school by his father while in fifth grade to be trained in the ways of governing. He continued his formal education with private tutors and is not known to have received any university degrees.
By all accounts he is a quiet man who says little in private meetings, even those with heads of state. A senior American official who met with him in Kuwait for more than two hours in 1987 to discuss security questions surrounding the Iraq-Iran war commented that Sheik Jaber ''hardly said two words the whole time,'' leaving much of the talking to others there.
Associates say he is a practicing Muslim and a hard worker who when in Kuwait rose with the sun to be driven to his seaside office complex on the Persian Gulf shore by 8:30 every morning.
 
Father of More Than 70
Although he stuck firmly by the Koranic law allowing Muslim men to have as many as four wives, he has pushed the edict to its most liberal intepretations, marrying scores of women - perhaps as many as 40 -while divorcing others to keep the number of wives always at four.
He is said to have fathered well over 70 children. His personal wealth, managed by Khalid Abu al-Saud, a Palestinian investment banker, ranks him as one of the world's billionaires, bankers say.
Signs of his aloofness deepened after he was named Crown Prince in 1966 and then Emir in 1978.
He has gradually left day-to-day affairs of state to other senior members of the Sabah family, including Crown Prince Saad, who is Prime Minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, the Emir's brother, who is Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, and Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, a distant cousin, who has served brilliantly as Oil and Finance Minister, moving quickly to control Kuwait's funds abroad after the invasion.
Many older Kuwaitis give their Emir high marks for his early performence as Finance Minister in 1963 and eventually as Prime Minister from 1965.
 
On-the-Job Training
He started his on-the-job training in 1949 as Governor of the vulnerable oil province of Al Ahmadi, where he became particularly mindful of security operations. Most refineries and oil sites in the province have now been mined by Iraqi troops.
The Emir takes credit for adopting, when Finance Minister in the 1960's, a Fund for Future Generations by setting aside part of the country's oil earnings every year for investments abroad. The fund has grown into a huge portfolio of foreign investments estimated today to be worth well over $100 billion, virtually all of it outside Kuwait and away from Iraqi control.
This money, an enormous amount for a country with a native Kuwaiti population of no more than 600,000 people, now constitutes the war chest that largely sustains the Kuwaiti government-in-exile headed by the Emir, who lives in Taif.
Leading Kuwaiti political figures and business people say that while they continue to revere their Emir as the only possible ruler of a liberated Kuwait, he must move quickly after the liberation to reduce the influence of the Sabahs in government, which gained alarmingly in the last decade.
''Sheik Jaber did a splendid job in privatizing the economy and organizing the structure of government in the 60's and 70's,'' said Abdallah Youssef al-Ghanem, a promiment Kuawiti businessman. ''But after liberation the Kuwait we want back must be a democratic country where there is a much clearer sharing of power.''
 
No Free Parliament
After much debate and consultations last year with pro-democracy advocates who agitated for an unconditional return of the Parliament that the Emir abolished in 1986, the family council headed by the Emir refused to allow a free parliament to be elected or to lift press censorship.
Instead, the Emir offered a weak alternative in the form of a National Assembly in which 25 of 75 members were Government-appointed. Most opposition figures boycotted the election to the National Assembly, which opened its sessions in July.
In defending the Emir's decision, supporters say it was impossible for a tiny country like Kuwait, wedged between huge autocratic nations like Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia, to carry on with a democratic experience that might provoke those neighbors. ''No ship sailing in the sea of international politics can seclude itself,'' the Emir declared after closing Parliament.
At the moment, the priority for most Kuwaitis is to rally around the Emir until their country is freed from Iraqi control. ''Then we will have something to say about the way the country should be run,'' said Ahmad al-Khatib, a former member of Parliament and a pro-democracy advocate who was in London when the invasion took place.
 
The Emir Before Hussein
Given a choice between their Emir and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, most Kuwaitis have no hesitation in choosing.
''I am not a member of the ruling family, but I can tell you I don't want to go back if the Emir does not go back,'' said Siham Youssef, a Kuwaiti who is working in the Free Kuwait movement in London.
''Even those who disagreed with him have been allowed to do so without having their assets confiscated, being sent to jail or executed,'' she added. ''Can Iraq say the same about the way it treats its citizens?''

HEADLINE: Stakes High in Contest For Alabama Governor

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., Sept. 25

 BODY:
Senator Howell Heflin put his hands in his pockets, leaned his ample belly into the lectern and gave Lee County Democrats what they came for: a dose of old-time Democratic religion.
Senator Heflin was laying into the Republicans in all their many varieties, including what he calls the ''Grey Poupon element of the Republican Party'' - the ''Gucci-clothed, Mercedes-driving, Jacuzzi-soaking, Perrier-drinking, Aspen-skiing Republicans,'' to be exact.
Mr. Heflin is up for re-election this year but is considered to be so far ahead of his Republican opponent, Bill Cabaniss, that Democrats snicker about it. Most of this partisan fervor is being directed to another state race: the governorship.
Four years ago, after an extraordinarily bitter and divisive primary to choose a successor to George C. Wallace, Democrats lost control of the governor's office here for the first time since 1874. 
They want it back. They hope that Paul Hubbert, a top official with the Alabama Education Association, the state teachers' organization, who won the Democratic nomination last summer in a runoff after a five-way primary, can get it.
 
Determined to Keep Power
For their part, Republicans are determined to prove that Gov. Guy Hunt, a fundamentalist Primitive Baptist preacher and former county probate judge, is no fluke. Control of the governorship can do wonders for Republicans trying to develop a vigorous two-party state.
There is a shortage of independent polls in Alabama at the moment, which has only fed speculation on where the race stands. Democrats insist their polling shows the race to be close and winnable, while Republicans contend they have a comfortable lead.
 
Democrat Has Edge in Money
Recent campaign finance reports showed Mr. Hubbert with an edge in contributions, and his organizational base with teachers, the party apparatus and black political groups is considered formidable. Still, Mr. Hunt, whose rural roots make him decidedly not a ''Grey Poupon Republican,'' has the advantages of incumbency and a certain folksy appeal, many Alabamians say.
''People out there don't have any reason to vote against Hunt,'' said Ken Lamb, communications director for the Alabama Republican Party.
William Barnard, professor of history at the University of Alabama, said he believed Democrats tended to underestimate Mr. Hunt. ''There's a lot of people who see him as a decent man,'' said Mr. Barnard. ''And in some circles, simply not to have the state embarrassed over the past three years is an achievement.''
Mr. Hubbert, who like Mr. Hunt has rural roots, is trying to sell voters on the need for a New South governor, for better leadership on education and economic development to help Alabama catch up with states like Georgia.
At the Lee County Democratic Club dinner in Auburn on Saturday night, Mr. Hubbert gave a quiet, reflective speech.
He talked about picking up the paper that week, reading that Atlanta had been chosen as the site of the 1996 Olympics, and realizing the difference that leadership had made in the fates of Atlanta and Birmingham 30 years ago.
 
Leadership Issue Pressed
''While Birmingham was worried about whether they had enough firehose,'' Mr. Hubbert said, ''Atlanta was negotiating with Delta Airlines.''
Later, in an interview, the Democratic candidate argued, ''We have not had a Lamar Alexander or a Bob Graham or a Bill Clinton, the New South kind of governor who has been able to market this state the way they've been able to market theirs,'' he said, referring to two past and governors of Tennessee and Florida and the current Governor of Arkansas.
Republicans argue that in fact Alabama does have a successful New South governor who happens to be a Republican. Governor Hunt argues in his television spots that things are ''just fine'' in Alabama.
A series of regional commercials hails the plants and projects Mr. Hunt has brought to the state; critics assert the state still has far to go on jobs, per capita income, and a number of other indicators.
 
Criticism of Challenger
There are a number of subplots here. Republicans are trying to cast Mr. Hubbert as a special-interest candidate because of his ties to organized labor and the teachers' organization. ''It's just a question of whether the people of Alabama are prepared to turn the state over to A.E.A., and I believe they're not,'' said Mr. Lamb of the Alabama Republican Party.
Republicans are quick to note that Mr. Hubbert has drawn heavily from teachers in his fund-raising.
Another recent subplot came to light in The Birmingham Post-Herald, which reported that Hunt campaign officials had called in Alabama business leaders and told them not to engage in the time-honored custom of hedging their bets with contributions to both candidates.
''It's having a reverse effect with some business folks,'' said Mr. Hubbert. ''They don't like to be threatened.''
All of the maneuvering attests the high political stakes here. For example, Billy Joe Camp, a longtime Wallace aide and the Democratic nominee for Secretary of State, said: ''You've got a lot of boards and commissions in Alabama. With an eight-year span of appointments, there will be a lot of Republicans in office throughout the state for a long time to come.''
Democrats are beginning to feel the heat; an eight-year fluke would be no fluke at all. So at the Lee County Democratic Club dinner Saturday night, there was lots of talk of unity, of Democrats ''coming home'' and ending their ''backsliding'' ways.
 
THE 1990A CAMPAIGN
 
Alabama Governor: The Record vs. Calls for Change
Scripts and photographs of television commercials from the governor's race.
 
GUY HUNT - Republican
 
BACKGROUND: Governor Hunt is touting his record on economic development and arguing that Alabama is doing, as his commerical puts it, ''just fine.'' The Hunt campaign is also trying to present Mr. Hubbert, a top official with the Alabama Education Association, as a candidate of special interests.
 
SCRIPT: ''For four years he's governed. And under Guy Hunt's leadership, Alabama is doing just fine. The environment is safer. The economy is growing. The drug dealers are finding it tougher to survive. And increasingly, citizens are joining Governor Hunt in the fight to return control of our schools to the people of Alabama. Guy Hunt's working hard for us. And it's paid off. This November re-elect Guy Hunt for governor.''
 
PRODUCER: Ed Blakely, Smith & Harroff Inc., Alexandria, Va.
 
ANALYSIS: This spot is a classic appeal to re-elect an incumbent: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Critics would assert, however, that while Alabama's economy may be growing, it still lags near the bottoom in income per person.
 
 
PAUL HUBBERT - Democrat
 
BACKGROUND: Paul Hubbert, Democratic candidate for Governor, is trying to persuade Alabama voters that they need a ''New South'' governor to compete with states like Georgia. He is also trying to persuade them that he is that kind of leader, while Guy Hunt, the Republican incumbent, is not.
 
SCRIPT: ''In sports, we never settle for anything but the best from our teams and our coaches. We know what it takes to win: hard work, discipline and strong leadership. That's exactly what Alabama needs to compete in the 1990's for good jobs, quality education and a good life for our hard-working families. We can't just sit on the sideline while every other state is running for the goal line. What we need is leadership - leadership to bring our state together, as a team. With strong, progressive leadership, we can win.''
 
PRODUCER: Greer, Margolis, Mitchell & Associates INc., Washington, D.C.
 
 ANALYSIS: This commercial tries to appeal to Alabama's legendary competitive prode. One Hubert aide pointed out that Alabamians were willing to oust head football coaches when they fall short and hoped the analogy would apply to politics.

HEADLINE: Bill to Raise Cars' Fuel Efficiency Dies With Senate Vote on Debate

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The Senate failed by three votes to cut off debate today on a bill that would require car makers to improve fuel efficiency significantly. The vote in effect kills the measure in this session of Congress.
It was the first legislative test of a measure intended to reduce American dependence on foreign oil since the start of the Persian Gulf crisis.
The auto industry and the Bush Administration lobbied heavily against the bill, saying it would do little to clean up the environment and would exact a major financial toll on car makers. 
In a vote of 57 to 42, the Senate rejected a petition that the bill be brought to a vote. Sixty votes were needed to cut off debate. #40 Miles to the Gallon The legislation would require that new cars sold in this country attain a level of fuel use averaging about 40 miles to the gallon by the year 2001. Current law generally requires that auto makers sell cars that get an average of 27.5 miles to the gallon.
Although the plan took on added interest because of the Middle East conflict, it was considered an effort to curb air pollution when it was introduced last year.
The bill's chief sponsor, Senator Richard H. Bryan, said the Senate's action was ''a small and shortsighted victory against our struggle for a real energy conservation policy.'' Although Senate leaders said they did not plan to take up the matter again this year, Mr. Bryan vowed to introduce a similar bill when Congress returns in January.
''Clearly the auto industry mounted a massive campaign against it,'' said Mr. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat. ''They need to ask themselves: What is their answer to every parent in America whose son or daughter is in the Middle East because of our oil dependence? What are they proposing to make us less vulnerable on foreign oil and vulnerable to the potential instability in the Middle East?''
Environmental groups were less restrained in expressing their disappointment. ''Today the gas guzzler won and they're popping the champagne corks in Saddam Hussein's palace,'' said Daniel F. Becker, who heads the Sierra Club's energy and global warming program.
 
'Horrendously Expensive'
But the leading opponent of the bill, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said its passage would place a ''horrendously expensive'' burden on auto makers. He said manufacturers would have no choice but to build smaller cars, which would lead to increased traffic deaths.
''The automobile industry is under a considerable amount of stress these days,'' he said. ''You can't just wave a wand and impose massive costs on a major part of the economy without weighing the implications very carefully.'' He disputed Mr. Bryan's contention that the bill was a step toward developing a national energy plan and called the plan ''a piecemeal strategy.''
The bill's backers said the auto makers could meet the new fuel-use standards by altering the design of the engine combustion system to stress fuel efficiency over power or by reducing the size of the vehicles. But manufacturers argued that the proposed new standards were unrealistic and that the technology needed to meet the requirements could not be developed quickly enough to comply with the law.
Even if the bill had not been stopped in the Senate, its prospects were not strong. In the House, it probably would have had difficulty getting past the Energy and Commerce Committee, headed by Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is a staunch backer of the auto industry.
 
Administration Opposed It
And Administration officials lobbied vigorously against the bill, threatening a Presidential veto.
''We do not believe that recent events in Kuwait should cause us to rush ahead with ill-considered policies,'' Samuel K. Skinner, the Secretary of Transportation, and James D. Watkins, the Secretary of Energy, asserted in a recent letter to the Senator majority leader, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine. They said their overriding concern was that highway safety would be compromised.
The heavy lobbying campaign appeared to pay off. In the first test of the proposal last month, the Senate voted 68 to 28 to limit debate - 11 votes more than today.
Besides raising the fuel-use standards, the bill would double penalties for repeated violations of the standards; provide a fuel economy credit for makers of small passenger cars that are equipped with airbags, and require reports to Congress on the accuracy of tests of vehicle fuel economy.

HEADLINE: Swift and Wide Impact Is Expected If Negotiations on U.S. Budget Fail

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
From the control towers overlooking the nation's airports to the guard towers overlooking its prisons, thousands of Federal workers could be laid off on Monday if the Government cannot quickly resolve its budget crisis.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Prisons are just two of the agencies planning to furlough employees unless negotiations between Congress and the Bush Administration produce an agreement on spending, taxes and the deficit by the beginning of the fiscal year on Monday.
Although sweeping automatic spending cuts have been imposed before, they have never been as deep as those that might take effect next week. Congressional negotiators have been meeting with White House officials for weeks and talks continued late tonight, but if these efforts fail, the automatic cuts would be felt immediately across the country.
 
Stakes if Talks Fail
For example, air travelers would face delays and cancellations that would escalate day by day as thousands of airline flights were canceled because of a shortage of air traffic controllers. Within weeks, fresh meat could become scarce in supermarkets, the accuracy of weather forecasts might deteriorate and lines would probably grow longer and longer at offices where citizens go for such routine tasks as obtaining a new Social Security number. 
But as dozens of agencies draw up detailed plans for this possible havoc, few Government officials claim to know today exactly what to expect.
The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, has agreed with airlines to phase in disruptions to flight schedules over the first few days, avoiding instantaneous gridlock on Monday morning, but the airlines still call the plan unworkable.
The National Weather Service, which at one point envisioned immediately canceling nighttime weather reports and thereby grounding all flights at night, is now forecasting no disruptions to its programs for the next two weeks. That could be managed by paying workers with about $1 million left over from this year's budget. But the White House's Office of Management and Budget has not yet approved this fiscal maneuver.
 
Impact of Layoffs
Some Government programs are exempt from cuts. They include Social Security benefit payments, pay for the uniformed military, medical assistance and Congressional salaries. Even so, the layoffs of Federal workers would be widely felt.
The National Park Service is drawing up plans to cushion the effects in the field by cutting heavily at headquarters, but the cuts would ruin some vacations, said George Berklacy, assistant to the director. Yellowstone, like many other wilderness parks, would close campsites and visitor centers, and the Government would miss collecting fees from visitors to the park. The Statue of Liberty, like many other monuments, would be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and would accept only half the usual 20,000 visitors on other days, at a financial loss to the private companies that operate ferries and other services there.
If the emergency measures were to last an entire year, something nobody expects, Government agencies would be seriously crippled. According to the Office of Management and Budget, over the course of the year F.B.I. investigations of organized crime groups would be cut 20 percent, there would be 27,400 fewer inspections of mines by occupational safety experts and the Internal Revenue Service would fail to collect $8.5 billion in taxes.
 
Effects on New York
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, said today that a yearlong cut of this sort would be ''a disaster'' for New York City. ''We would lose a tremendous amount of Federal aid in areas in which the city can least afford it: mass transit, education, housing and other social services,'' Mr. Schumer said. He estimated the cost to the city of the budget cuts over the course of a year at more than $715 million. The entire Federal budget would be cut by $85.4 billion, with only a few agencies spared.
But officials say they believe that an immediate outcry over the initial disruptions would force politicians to enact a budget that distributes the nation's fiscal burdens more rationally.
Automatic spending cuts have been imposed three times before under the Federal deficit-reduction law, at the start of the fiscal years 1986, 1988 and 1990, but the 1988 order was rescinded and in the other two instances the cuts were small and of short duration. The 1990 cuts, for example, in the end amounted to only about 1.5 percent, a far cry from the current situation.
 
Budget Cuts of 32%
As the Oct. 1 deadline approaches, Federal agencies are planning for furloughs on the assumption that they must cut their annual budgets by 32 percent, beginning immediately.
At most agencies, cuts of that magnitude cannot be achieved without laying off workers. Rather than dismissing much of the work force, agencies are directing employees to take a few days off without pay in each pay period.
At the aviation agency, for example, furloughs would affect every employee for two and a half days in each 10-day pay period. With one-fourth fewer controllers at work each day, the agency says it must cancel up to 3,000 flights daily to ensure safety in the skies.
At the busiest times of day, under the plan devised by the F.A.A., airlines would have to cancel about one-third of all flights landing and taking off from major airports.
For example, at New York's La Guardia Airport, on a weekday at 4 P.M., only 24 of the 43 scheduled landings could occur. At the peak departure time, which is 7 A.M., only 24 flights could take off when 40 normally leave.
After the plan was presented to airlines last week, Robert Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association, dashed off a letter to F.A.A. Administrator James B. Busey calling it ''totally unacceptable,'' ''basically unworkable,'' and ''a scheduling impossibility.'' Among other changes, the airlines asked the agency to control takeoffs but to leave landings unrestricted, simplifying their scheduling problems.
This week, the situation grew even more confused, as the National Weather Service told airlines that it planned to close weather stations from 7 P.M. to 7 A.M. Without the weather forecasts, no planes could land or take off during the night, rendering the F.A.A.'s elaborate schedules meaningless.
Reed Boatright, a spokesman for the weather service, said today that its own officials ''didn't get the word'' about a change in plans that would delay any such disruption to weather services. But he admitted that the agency had not yet won approval from the White House to exempt itself temporarily from the budget cuts.
At the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the branch of the Agriculture Department that inspects meat products during processing, managers have drawn up contingency plans for furloughing about 7,500 inspectors for four days on Oct. 9.The whole industry, with an estimated 7,000 plants employing upward of 300,000 workers, would be shut down simultaneously if the furloughs occurred.
 
Cutbacks at Prisons
Out of the public eye, Federal prisons across the nation are also bracing for a one-third reduction in normal staffing. Each penitentiary is drawing up its own plans, which vary depending on whether the prison keeps inmates under maximum security.
''Just because the staff is working only two-thirds time doesn't mean you can serve only two meals a day,'' said Steven B. Schwalb, deputy director of the Northeast regional office of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. ''An education department might have to be closed to have the education staff go do rudimentary parts of the food service.''
The biggest problem facing prison managers, several officials said, is balancing the need for security against the need for supervised recreation. Almost all prison employees are trained to stand guard duty, but using them that way will cut into other services for inmates. As inmates' routines are disrupted, Mr. Schwalb said, ''the tension level among them is going to rise.''
''It's a scary situation,'' said Michael Grotefend, president of the prison employees union, who works at the Federal prison in Oxford, Wis.
''This is another new experience I wish I had never experienced,'' said Mr. Grotefend. ''But we are going to make it through. I just hope nobody gets hurt. That would be too heavy a price to pay for this silly game.''

HEADLINE: The Politics of Anti-Politics

 BODY:
In Massachusetts last week, Republican and Democratic voters rejected established politicians in favor of mavericks who had never held elective office. In Oklahoma, voters repudiated familiar faces and imposed a 12-year limit on the tenure of state legislators.
The September primary election results were fragmentary but the message seems unmistakable: Americans are frustrated and dismayed by the unresponsiveness of their elected leaders. Though that message has been registered at the state and local level, Congress and the White House would be foolish not to listen. 
There's no shortage of explanations for voter discontent, starting with economic fears. Both Massachusetts and Oklahoma are suffering recessions. Cynicism runs a close second. Polls show that at least two-thirds of Americans think government is usually wasteful and that politicians quickly lose touch with their constituents.
The daily headlines from Washington certainly can't help incumbents at any level of government: endless partisan wrangling over the budget deficit . . . the monumental savings and loan scandal that could not have occurred without the complicity of both the executive and legislative branches . . . a Congress that cannot bring itself to clean up a system based on buying and selling influence. Of course, the voters may also be angry with themselves. After all, they enthusiastically endorsed eight years of Reaganism. But if the public wanted less from government 10 years ago, it seems to want more now. Nearly every survey suggests widespread and well-articulated concern about a range of issues: industrial decline, stagnant standard of living, better schools, safer streets, cleaner air.
But people perceive politicians as living in cocoons, inside the beltway or the state house or city halls. The result, as former Vice President Walter Mondale once put it, is a politics of irrelevance and avoidance, yielding few new ideas and no real evidence of political will.
Do the politicians themselves offer any defense? Yes: they blame the voters. If Americans do not believe in the politicians they elect, Michael Oreskes noted in a recent article in The Times, the politicians are terrified of the people who elected them. He quotes Ed Jenkins, Democrat of Georgia: ''We are simply afraid to make any difficult decisions. We're afraid we'll make someone mad at us.''
Yet what voters seem to resent most is inertia. What they seem to want most is ingenuity and courage. For nervous incumbents, some risk-taking might be in order. It might win them respect, and perhaps even re-election.

HEADLINE: Divorce Case Quandary: Is Fame Property?

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
It sounds like something out of an opera plot. In Act I, a mezzo-soprano on the cusp of celebrity marries an aspiring bass-baritone she meets in music school. In Act II, she becomes an internationally renowned star; he acts as her photographer, adviser, voice teacher and companion on the Bois de Boulogne.
But in Act III, which takes place many years and two children later, their marriage comes apart. And as for the final scene, it remains to be written. The libretto now rests with the courts, which must answer whether or not a performer's enhanced celebrity status is ''marital property,'' and therefore must be quantified and divided when a marriage is dissolved. 
The setting for the drama is State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The principal players are Frederica von Stade, the opera star; her husband of 17 years, Peter Elkus; two lawyers, Raoul Lionel Felder and Alfred Ferrer 3d, and Justice Walter M. Schackman, who yesterday handed down the first of what will likely be several decisions in an evolving area of the law.
In his decision, handed down a day after the couple's divorce, Justice Schackman rejected Mr. Elkus's claim that having aided Ms. von Stade in her rise to stardom, he was entitled under New York's equitable distribution law to a chunk of her star value.
The ruling comes in the latest, and perhaps the most glamorous, in a series of cases in which New York courts have wrestled with precisely what contributions during marriage are compensible at the time of divorce.
Mr. Felder, who is representing Ms. von Stade, hailed the decision. ''For the first time a court has drawn the line in the sand. There is a limit to what is possible under equitable distribution,'' he said. ''And that limit is drawn when one seeks to obtain a portion of someone's God-given talent or recognition. Who knows what a career is worth? And where do you stop? How about the shoeshine man and the plumber?''
 
An Economic Partnership
Mr. Ferrer said he planned to appeal the decision, which, he said, favored spouses of doctors and lawyers over spouses of artists and other ''nonprofessionals.''
''A marriage is an economic partnership, regardless of what business activities each of the spouses engages in,'' he said.
All documents in the case are under seal. In the opinion, the 45-year-old Ms. von Stade is referred to only as ''F. Elkus,'' though Justice Schackman notes that she has become ''quite well known over the last few years'' and has performed on two recent occasions for President Bush. Neither she nor Mr. Elkus, 50, was available for comment. But according to the decision, Mr. Elkus had hoped to introduce expert testimony as to the value of Ms. von Stade's career at trial. Conversely, Ms. von Stade disputed what Justice Schackman referred to as ''the nature and value'' of her former husband's ''alleged contributions.''
Five years ago, in the landmark case of O'Brien v. O'Brien, New York's highest court ruled that a wife who had deferred her own career to send her husband to medical school effectively owned part of his medical licence. Since then, trial courts have found that degrees in law, accounting, and other academic disciplines, as well as teaching certificates, are also marital assets.
 
Acting as Property
In two others cases, it has extended that principle to celebrity status. Mr. Ferrar cited one of them, a 1988 divorce case involving the actress Marisa Berenson and A. Richard Golub, the lawyer. In it, the court held that the increased value of Ms. Berenson's acting and modeling career were in fact marital property, even though no license or degree was involved.
''The courts should treat all matrimonial litigants equally,'' the court stated. ''The noncelebrity spouse should be entitled to a share of the celebrity spouse's fame - limited, of course by the degree to which that fame is attributable to the noncelebrity spouse.''
Justice Schackman disputed the applicability of the O'Brien case, in which a husband sued to end his nine-and-a-half year marriage three months after receiving a medical degree paid for largely through the sacrifices of his wife. He noted that Ms. von Stade and Mr. Elkus had been married longer, and that Mr. Elkus had remained working in music, his chosen field.
He further noted that Mr. Elkus had enjoyed ''a substantial life style'' from Ms. von Stade's earnings and stood to benefit from the sale of their house, worth close to $1 million and other assets accumulated during the marriage. Having ''reaped the rewards of his association'' with Ms. Von Stade, Justice Schackman wrote, Mr. Elkus ''can hardly be equated with the discarded spouse in O'Brien.''

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Papal Document on Education Hailed For Support of Academic Freedom

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Pope John Paul II issued a long-awaited document on Roman Catholic higher education yesterday, and many Catholic educators promptly expressed satisfaction and relief at the degree to which the Pope recognized the legitimacy of autonomy and academic freedom for their institutions.
The Apostolic Constitution on Catholic Universities, issued in the Vatican, strongly enjoined Catholic colleges and universities to maintain their religious character and fidelity to Catholic teachings.
But the document did not adopt some of the more stringent provisions of earlier drafts, which had appeared to inject the Vatican authorities and local bishops directly into university affairs.
''This is a totally different, much more positive and progressive document than the drafts produced in 1985 and 1988,'' said the Rev. J. Donald Monan, president of Boston College. ''The document itself and the process by which it was written are major reasons for satisfaction.'' 
 
Academic Freedom Stressed
At a major consultation with Vatican officials in April 1989, Catholic educators warned that assigning responsibility for upholding their institutions' Catholic identity to the church authorities outside university ranks could violate academic freedom and possibly jeopardize government financing.
Several educators involved in that meeting called it a turning point.
''We made the point that universities, to be universities, had to have the proper kind of autonomy and academic freedom,'' said the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, president of Fordham University in New York. ''It also came through loud and clear that universities all around the world were concerned about not having universal prescriptons from Rome.''
About one in seven private universities and colleges in the United States are affected by the papal document; 230 of the 1,620 such institutions in this country are Catholic. That is by far the largest number of Catholic institutions of higher education in a single country. The next highest is the Philippines, with 20, according to the Vatican, which says there are 935 Catholic institutions of higher education throughout the world.
 
A Brief Set of Guidelines
Despite the Vatican's apprehension about theologians who question Catholic teachings or student groups who advocate homosexual or abortion rights, the Apostolic Constitution issued yesterday includes only a brief set of guidelines, called general norms, and permits them to be tailored to local conditions by national bishops' conferences and university officials.
Sister Janet Fitzgerald, president of Molloy College in Rockville Centre, L.I., who attended the April 1989 gathering at the Vatican, said much of the wording emerged directly from that session.
But the document still contains several potentially explosive strictures. It called on Catholic institutions of higher education and especially Catholic theologians on their faculties to adhere to church doctrine, but left unresolved how such requirements were to be interpreted or enforced.
The papal document also contains a requirement, not present in any earlier version, that the majority of teachers at all Catholic institutions of higher education be Catholic. Although it is widely thought that a majority of faculty members at most Catholic colleges and universities are Catholic, many schools do not request any religious identification in hiring.
 
'Statistical Standard' Questioned
Several Catholic educators said the requirement would have to be adjusted to American practices.
The general norm reflected a valid concern ''that recruitment of personnel is critical to the character of an institution,'' Father O'Hare said, ''but trying to assure that through a statistical standard, at least in the United States, is not effective.''
Like several other university presidents, he said non-Catholic faculty members often made a greater contribution to maintaining their schools' Catholic character than did some Catholic faculty members.
In Rome, Archbishop Pio Laghi said yesterday that a Catholic majority might be a goal, but was clearly impossible for Catholic schools like Sophia University in Tokyo, for example, because of the small number of Catholics in a particular population.
The Archbishop, a former papal Ambassador to the United States who is now head of the Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education, presented the Apostolic Constitution at a news conference yesterday.
 
Governance by Lay Trustees
Some Catholic universities have been founded or directly governed by the papacy, by national bodies of bishops or by individual dioceses. But many, particularly in the United States, were founded by religious orders and operated independently of local bishops, although usually with their approval.
In recent years many Catholic schools have transferred governance to lay boards of trustees. While retaining theology departments, religious guidance for those seeking it and varying degrees of interest in Catholic culture, many schools have dropped strict obligations on students or faculty to study Catholicism or to participate in religious exercises.
Catholic educators have acknowledged that these steps, sometimes taken so that the schools can qualify for state funds, have shown a tension between keeping a distinct religious identity for their schools and joining the mainstream of American higher education.
Much of the papal document urges Catholic universities and colleges to overcome the fragmentation of knowledge by academic specialties, to inject ethical reflection into professional training and to foster exchange between religious and scientific scholarship.
 
Needs of 'Emerging Nations'
The Pope also called on these schools to examine ''contemporary problems in areas such as the dignity of human life, the promotion of justice for all, the quality of personal and family life, the protection of nature, the search for peace and political stability, a more just sharing of the world's resources and a new economic and political order that will better serve the human community.''
Catholic universities should especially strive to make education accessible to the poor and to minorities, the Pope said, and to direct attention to the needs of ''the emerging nations.''
The document should be put ''in the context of America's wider debate about the role of the university in general,'' said the Rev. Charles Hagan, a staff member dealing with higher education for the American bishops' conference.
''The document comes down on the side of the university as an instrument for dialogue with the culture and for raising questions about meaning,'' Father Hagan said, ''not just as a place for learning practical skills.'' In that view, he added, ''theology is a key discipline.''
 
Intervention Seen as Limited
Although the papal document calls on local bishops to insure that Catholic universities and colleges act in accord with their religious identity, the educators interviewed by telephone yesterday agreed that intervention by the church authorities would remain limited because of the tenure rights of professors or other established patterns of academic freedom.
''There still are some ambiguities that will have to be worked out,'' Father Monan said. But he added that the document does not authorize the Vatican or a local bishop to remove a Catholic theologian who challenged official church teaching in the way the Rev. Charles E. Currran was banned from teaching theology at Catholic University last year.
The Rev. James W. Sauve, who worked on the document for several years at the Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education, agreed. Father Sauve, now vice president of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, noted that the Vatican acted against Father Curran on the basis of another document governing theology departments, like Catholic University's, that offer special Vatican-accredited degrees.
''The effort bore fruit,'' said the Rev. Edward Malloy, president of the University of Notre Dame, who was deeply involved in the discussions between educators and the Vatican. ''It is a reminder that when the church develops a good process of consulation, the final result is far superior.''

HEADLINE: In the New Home Ec, Choices for Life

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
EVERY day more than 3 million teen-agers take their seats in home economics classes across the United States. Many of their classrooms, unchanged since the 1950's, look like shabby sanctuaries of June and Ward Cleaver's home. Rows of battered sewing machines and files of well-used clothing patterns seem ready to train yet another generation of resourceful homebodies. The trim kitchenettes seem to promise an unchanging tide of well-balanced, matter-of-fact meals.
But between the McCall's and Simplicity patterns on the wall in the sewing classroom of Intermediate School 318 in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn was a poster picturing a crashed car and the words ''Crack: Is It Worth the Trip?'' Across the hall, in the cooking classroom, there were no familiar posters picturing the ''four food groups.'' Instead, there was a sign that said, ''Being Healthy Is Building a Positive Self-Concept.''
What the New Math was to the 60's, the New Home Ec is to the 90's. Around the country, the courses are called ''Human Environmental Science,'' ''Family Life Management,'' and other serious-sounding euphemisms. But they share common cause. 
''We are seeking to empower families to function effectively and maintain meaningful lives in a very confusing world,'' said Dr. Beverly J. Crabtree, Dean of the College of Family and Consumer Sciences at Iowa State University.
Just as the New Math didn't exactly teach the multiplication tables, the New Home Ec doesn't necessarily teach tidy blind-stitching or perfect egg poaching. ''I teach students how to decide if they want an egg, is an egg the best choice for their family's nutrition, the best use of their family's resources, the best use of their own time,'' said Alma Ortiz of Intermediate School 318. ''The actual cooking is a way of getting students involved in making their own decision.''
''Decisions, decisions, decisions,'' said Jehova Delgada, a 13-year-old student. ''When do we cook?''
''After you've decided what to cook,'' Ms. Ortiz said, ''and you can explain to me why you want to cook it.''
The theoretical approach to home economics began replacing the time-honored practical approach in a handful of states about three years ago. Already, it has been blamed for everything from the increase of food-borne illnesses to the demise of the family dinner. But like the theoreticians who tried to prepare a generation of math students for computer-age thinking, home economists believe they are responding to a nation of decentralized families.
''Two out of three meals are eaten away from home; everybody works,'' said Jewell Deene Ellis, director of Home Economics Education for the Kentucky Department of Education. ''At the basic level, we teach students how to manage consumer information and make their best decisions. At the advanced levels, we try to train professionals for work in family eating environments away from home, in child care and in geriatric care.''
Accommodating a shift from the home to the marketplace is nothing new to home economists. In 1917, when the Smith-Hughs Act established vocational education in American public schools, the traditional ''domestic arts'' of textile- and garment-making had largely moved out of homes into factories.
''The theme of woman's kingdom slowly slipping away from her, of men appropriating woman's work and removing it to the industrial world outside the home, was a recurring one,'' wrote Laura Shapiro in ''Perfection Salad,'' (Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1986), a social history of home economics at the turn of the century. In response, schools offered domestic arts courses that focused fiercely on what remained: cooking.
And lest the field suffer another loss to the industrial sector, its practitioners relinquished the moniker and the attitude of ''domestic arts'' and fortified themselves with the more scientific ''home economics.'' Their approach has endured for most of the century, from when cooking was still done over wood-burning stoves to the introduction of the microwave oven.
Like so many good little wives, home economists responded to the needs of society as staunchly as if those needs were the man of the house. During the Depression they preached canning, preserving and cooking on a budget. During the 1950's, they became the handmaidens of convenience.
''Hands-on work was practical at one point in history,'' said Karl Weddel, executive director of the American Home Economics Association, based in Alexandria, Va. ''Learning how to purchase and employ convenience products is more practical for the modern world.''
Consumer orientation assures a professional niche for the home economist, something that is increasingly important. ''For the past 15 years, I've asked my students how many planned to use their skills outside the home and every year more and more raise their hands,'' said Dr. Crabtree of Iowa State. ''Few have the luxury of staying home.''
In response, and in accord with society, the field became ''a group of specializations over the past three decades,'' Mr. Weddle said. In recent interviews, several dozen home economists were quick to identify themselves by specialty. One was an ''apparel manager,'' another a ''family resource manager,'' a third was a ''nutrition and dietary manager.'' Others specialized in housing, geriatric care, childcare and ''family wellness management.''
''Science'' and ''economics'' have now gone the way of ''arts.'' Domestic life now requires ''management.'' ''Look at the pressures facing American families and tell me proper management won't help,'' Dr. Crabtree said. ''There are two working parents, teen-age pregnancy, single parenting, drugs, homelessness and an aging population with nobody to care for it. Our mission hasn't changed; the world changed.''
And home cooking has become a luxury. The hand that feeds today's world is increasingly a fast, cheap, commercial one. The family meal, the historic underpinning of home economics, has left home. And graduate-level ''family life managers'' have responded by designing a secondary school curriculum that uses cooking (and sewing) as merely a metier for teaching students the decision-making and information-processing skills mandated by the changing world.
But for the secondary school students who reported to the courses two weeks ago, the allure is as unchanged as the look of the classrooms.
''When are we going to start cooking?'' asked Cynthia Rosaria, a 13-year-old student in the Food and Nutrition class at Intermediate School 318. After the 20-member class has learned sanitation, kitchen safety, tool identification and measurements, replied her teacher, Ms. Ortiz.
Pacing between the classroom's six kitchenettes and the card tables where her students are scribbling notes, she primed students for a world that might have shocked homemakers of yore. ''If you have cuts or sores on your hands, you are going to wear clear plastic gloves when handling food like bread dough,'' she said. ''Why?'' ''Germs,'' answered Jehova Delgado. ''Bacteria and viruses,'' said the teacher. ''And when you start cooking next week, you are going to leave these kitchens cleaner than a hospital. Why?'' ''Pests and rodents,'' chorused the students. ''That's right. And Mom's not home and the maid died. So you are going to clean up here and at home. Get it?''
As in most secondary-school classes nowadays, Ms. Ortiz's class is nearly an even mixture of young men and women. The American Home Economics Association estimates that 20 percent of public-school students study home economics and, while the programs have become elective, rather that required, in most states over the last two decades, the percentage has remained unchanged. According to Mr. Weddel, at least two states, New York and Virginia, have reinstated the requirement for home economics study in the last two years.
''They saw that they'd lost a critical component of secondary education,'' he said. And it wasn't simply the preparation of workers for family care at large that was lost.
''It was the surrogate parent,'' Ms. Ortiz said. ''What do you think I do all day?''
Waving toward a flow chart of the decision-making process, she addresses her class: ''You identify the problem. You examine your choices. You make a choice. You act on your choice. Get it? You have a choice!''
Jehova Delgado, who said that he planned to be a lawyer but had enrolled in the class because he wanted to learn to make hamburgers, looked surprised. So did Cynthia Rosaria, who plans a career in science, but wants to be able to ''cook nice meals on the weekends.''
''Next week you are going to make muffins,'' Ms. Ortiz told them. ''I am going to give you three choices and you are going to decide. Do you want cranberry, blueberry or corn? You have a choice. Just like when you go to a party and your friend wants you to smoke crack, right?
''You have a choice.'' And then she leaned toward her students and softly sounded a timeless parental refrain: ''If somebody had told me that, it would have saved me a lot of grief.''
