HEADLINE: Mexicans Hopeful as They Await Bush Today

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Seeking to capitalize on the warmest official American-Mexican relations in recent memory, Mexican authorities prepared for the arrival of President Bush here on Monday for a two-day state visit that is expected to focus largely on trade issues.
The visit, which will be the sixth meeting between President Bush and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, is seen here as a confirmation of the good personal ties between the two leaders, who held their first talks even before Mr. Bush was sworn in as President.That theme has dominated descriptions of the meeting by aides to Mr. Salinas, who has staked much of his personal and political success on his ability to work as an equal with Mr. Bush in improving relations between the two countries. 
 But officials familiar with the agenda said that the meeting would also include substantive talks, dominated by efforts to eliminate potential obstacles to a free-trade agreement that would link North American economies in a giant new trading partnership.
They said the two leaders would also confront a variety of more divisiveissues, ranging from drug enforcement efforts to violence against illegal Mexican immigrants entering the United States near San Diego, where ethnic tensions have flared in recent months.
 
Preventing Problems
 "This is not so much a meeting to solve problems as to prevent them," said a Mexican official involved in preparations for the visit. "We believe we have better relations with this Administration than with any other in years, and we don't want to lose the chance to keep things going forward."
Preliminary discussions toward a Mexican-American free-trade agreement have been under way since the two Governments formally accepted the idea during a visit by Mr. Salinas to Washington in June.
Since then, however, the environment for direct negotiations has been sharply affected by a series of international developments, ranging from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to the stalemate of the Uruguay Round of international trade talks in Geneva.
Among the major outstanding issues in the talks is the degree to which any free-trade agreement would cover Mexico's large oil sector, which Mr. Salinas has repeatedly said must be excluded from negotiation. American interest in that issue has grown with the potential for conflict in the Persian Gulf, but senior aides to Mr. Salinas asserted again last week that he would not accept oil as part of the trade package.
Other concerns, officials said, include efforts in both countries to allay domestic opposition to the pact, which must overcome sharp differences in everything from wages to environmental restrictions. Diplomats and officials on both sides have also expressed worry over the potential political fallout from continued charges of fraud against Mr. Salinas's governing party, most recently during local elections Nov. 11 in the state of Mexico, just outside the capital.
 
Canada's Role Is Issue
 The format of the trade negotiations themselves has also been thrown into question by the proposed participation of Canada, whose inclusion in any formal agreement would create a trading zone some 25 percent larger than theEuropean Community.
A free-trade pact between the United States and Canada went into effect last year. But the announcement of negotiations toward a similar agreement between the United States and Mexico prompted immediate Canadian demands for some sort of participation or representation in the new talks.
The idea of permitting a new participant at the negotiating table has been opposed by many proponents of the agreement, who have argued that it would slow the progress of the talks, which both sides hope to complete before the end of Mr. Bush's term in 1992.
But senior Mexican officials now say that some degree of Canadian participation appears inevitable, if only in the form of an invited observer or other special status.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
An Ailing Buyout Tries a Buyback

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
WHEN Supermarkets General went private in 1987, in a deal completed just before the stock market crash, the company's expectations were for steady growth that would provide more than enough cash to meet its debt payments.
Three years later, results are not up to the rosy forecasts, the company is in violation of its loan agreements with banks, and it is refinancing. A crucial part of that refinancing is a proposal to buy back securities at a small fraction of their value when they were issued three years ago. 
 Part of the company's problems concern its regional concentration in New England, with Purity Supreme supermarkets, and in the New York area, with Pathmark supermarkets. Both regions have weak economies, and the company said sales in the latest quarter, ended Nov. 3, were down from a year ago. It has also been set back by problems at its Rickel home centers subsidiary, which led to a $31.4 million charge last year to cover the costs of closing eight stores and writing down excess inventories.
The company now forecasts that it will have sales of $6.2 billion in the 1991 fiscal year, which ends Feb. 2, 20 percent below the $7.8 billion it expected for that year back in 1987. Operating profits are expected to be $182 million, 35 percent below the forecast of $279 million. Now, not until 1996 does the company expect to have sales as high as it had once projected for 1991.
The figures for operating profits do not include interest payments, which have plunged the company into red ink. It lost $31 million in the first halfof this year, compared with a loss of $38 million in the same period a year earlier.
Company officials say the proposal to buy back some securities should be viewed not as a sign of distress but as "an opportunity to improve the balance sheet and a first step toward unleveraging the company," said Harvey Gutman, a company spokesman. He added, "It is not a step we have to take, or need to take."
But if that particular step is not required, some action is. The company has reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will soon be in violation of its bank lending agreements, because its financial reports will show that its operating profit and net worth are below minimum acceptable levels. As part of negotiations with the banks, the company agreed to come up with additional capital.
The plan is for institutional investors, including the Equitable Life Assurance Society and partnerships organized by Merrill Lynch, both of which were involved in the buyout, to buy new preferred shares. A fund run by Adler & Shaykin, another buyout group, has also agreed to participate. In all, about $80 million is to be raised, the company said.
The money will mostly be used to repurchase the "cram down securities," in the jargon of Wall Street, that public shareholders received for some of their holdings in 1987. Shareholders got a package of bonds and preferred stock valued at $45.26 a common share. In the intervening years, holdershave received no cash dividends or interest, and now are being asked to sell the securities back for a total of $19.41 a share, a 57 percent haircut.
Those prices, as low as they are, are much better than the market valuations before the exchange offer was announced earlier this month. Then, the bonds were trading at 20 cents for each dollar of principal value, while the preferred shares were quoted at about $3.50 each for those with an eventual redemption value of $25. The prices being offered, for half the outstanding bonds and a quarter of the preferred shares, are 27 cents on the dollar for the bonds and $5 for each preferred share.
If Supermarkets General is eventually able to honor its obligations, the annual rate of return on its bonds, for anyone who buys at 27 and holds to maturity, will be more than 30 percent. The return on the preferred will be even higher. Both securities are supposed to start paying cash to holders in 1993.
One Wall Street analyst, who insisted that he not be quoted by name, said he was recommending that investors not tender, in large part because he thinks they would get more money in a 1993 restructuring.
The presence of Adler & Shaykin may lend credence to that sentiment. Alone among the buyers of the new preferred shares, it is not a current investor in the company, and thus presumably is making an investment based solely on current conditions. It is investing $10 million and is promised an 11.5 percent annual return, counting both dividends and a consulting agreement that the company has signed. In addition, the investment is convertible into common stock, offering a big upside if the company prospers.
For Adler & Shaykin to get that money, it will be necessary for other holders to be paid off, too. If its investment is wise, then those who sell their securities now would seem to be getting a poor price.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 29, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
The Market Place column in Business Day on Monday referred incorrectly to the status of the Supermarkets General Corporation's bank loan agreements. The company says it will be in violation of its bank loan agreements when it files financial reports for its current fiscal year, which ends on Feb. 2, but it is not in violation now. The article also misstated the 1987 value of a group of securities issued as part of a leveraged buyout. It was $34.66, not $45.26. The price being offered by the company for those securities now, $19.41, is 44 percent below that figure, not 57 percent.

HEADLINE: Bush Adviser Offers Outlook

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The White House chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, said today that the United States economy would probably rebound from its current slowdown by the middle of next year once oil prices decline.
But a drop in oil prices depends on resolving the Persian Gulf crisis, Mr. Boskin said on the "Newsmakers" program on Cable News Network's
"When oil prices decline from where they are now and for other reasons, we will come out of it sometime in the middle of next year," he said.
Oil prices have doubled since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and remain high and volatile as the standoff in Saudi Arabia continues.
While many economists say the economy is in more dire straights than a mere slowdown, Mr. Boskin repeated his view that it was too early to tell whether the United States had entered its first recession in eight years, defined as six months of shrinking output.
In a separate interview on NBC-TV today, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher was mostly upbeat. "We have a lot of down sides, but we still have some up sides," he said, pointing to strength in the agricultural, medical supplies, chemicals and pharmaceutical sectors.

HEADLINE: Bush Visit to Highlight Caracas Chief's Role

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
If there is a world leader who works the international telephone operators harder than President Bush, it is President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela.
The two have little else in common. One is a blue-blood Republican, the other a charismatic Social Democrat. But their instinct to reach for the Rolodex when crisis strikes has helped make them uncommonly close allies. 
 Administration officials say Mr. Bush's visit to Caracas on Dec. 7 as the final leg of his South American tour will highlight Mr. Perez's central rolein Latin American politics. The two leaders plan to discuss how to reinvigorate the stalled Salvador peace negotiations, how to insure that the coming elections in Haiti are peaceful and fair, and how to cushion the international oil market from the gyrations of the Persian Gulf crisis.
Mr. Bush's talks with Mr. Perez, a State Department official predicted, "will have a nice personal glow."
Their relationship blossomed two days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, when Mr. Bush called Mr. Perez on the telephone to express his concern that an explosion in oil prices could destabilize the Western economy.In a formal note delivered to Mr. Perez by Vice President Quayle four days later, Mr. Bush asked Venezuela, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, to increase its oil exports. Without hesitating, Mr. Perez said he would expand production as quickly as possible, and with the help of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia he lobbied for weeks to persuade OPEC members to sustain production levels.
"He's a real operator," said a White House official, who noted that Mr. Perez's promise to help ease the oil crunch was "the first bit of really good news the Administration had received internationally after the invasion.""His word was his bond," he said. "He delivered."
Venezuela, which has the largest oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere, has increased its production since the invasion from 2 million to more than 2.4 million barrels a day. The nation plans to boost production by 100,000 barrels more by January.
"I have told President Bush, and I think he understands, that the potential reserves of Venezuela can take care of all the energy needs of the hemisphere for the forseeable future," Mr. Perez said in a telephone interview.
What makes the emerging close relationship between the two Presidents all the more remarkable is Mr. Perez's populist record from his first term as President in the 1970's. Then he used his country's oil wealth to expand the role of the state in the economy and tohelp finance and arm the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua. But today a mellower Mr. Perez is a promoters of a more conservative school of thought that seeks to encourage private enterprise and foreign investment.
 
'Clear Latin American Lead'
 "Venezuela and Carlos Andres Perez have taken the clear Latin American lead," said Michael M. Skol, the American Ambassador in Venezuela. "Venezuela has influence and has used it responsibly."
Recognizing Venezuela's role as the most influential nation in the Caribbean basin, Mr. Bush urged Mr. Perez at their last meeting in September to keep a close eye on the Haitian presidential campaign. The Venezuelan needed little encouragement, and in loose coordination with Washington, hehas pursued an aggressive policy to insure that elections next month are fair.
Mr. Perez said Venezuela was sending 15 military advisers to help insure the security of the balloting in Haiti, and is sending 300,000 barrels of oil at preferential rates during the campaign to ease the country's import burden. Venezuela is also sponsoring seminars for all seven presidential candidates to teach them how to campaign and get out their supporters on election day.
Mr. Perez said he had spoken with Mr. Bush on the telephone twice in recent weeks about developments in Haiti, Nicaragua and El Salvador. In those conversations, he said that he had also proposed that Venezuela, the United States, Mexico and Spain join in developing an economic aid package for Central America, and that Mr. Bush agreed that it would be a good idea.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Aims for High-Tech Niches

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HSINCHU, Taiwan

 BODY:
In the glass and steel buildings beyond the green lawns of this science park, Taiwan is trying to stage a new industrial revolution.
Instead of toys, companies here are making personal computers. Instead of electronic gadgets, they are making satellite receivers. Taiwan is trying to abandon the low-technology products that made it rich to develop high-technology niches that will enable it to compete with American and Japanese companies. 
 The Government's science park is leading the movement. It has brought back 600 Taiwan-born American-trained scientists and engineers, reversing a brain drain over the last two decades that saw Taiwan's best and brightest beat a path to America, work their way through graduate schools and then find jobs as engineers at electronics companies in Silicon Valley in California and along Route 128 in Massachusetts.
Now, the Government is trying to use these experts to replace the country's copycat strategy with one based on innovation, and while critics say progress is slow, 107 companies already are operating at the science park, and there is little space left.
Taiwan has been able to advance its expertise in computers. It now has a sizable share -- 20 percent by some counts -- of the world personal computer market. While it still buys the basic chip from the Intel Corporation, Taiwanese companies can build almost everything else. Its largest personal computer maker, Acer Inc., is expanding rapidly and had sales of $480 million last year.
Even so, establishing a high-technology base is a process that requires patience in a country where little is spent on basic research and development, which can lead to the biggest breakthroughs. And scientists have not always been eager to give up their high salaries and easy way of life in America to return home.
For Taiwan, the change in strategy is a matter of survival. For two decades, the country has relied on its cheap labor to reproduce low-technology electronic products like toys and computer keyboards accurately and swiftly. But with labor costs rising as its economy matures, Taiwan, like many rapidly developing Asian countries, is seeing its traditional markets eroded by countries with cheaper labor like China. It is being forced to move into more sophisticated frontiers to survive.
"A couple of years ago, Taiwan found a niche in low-end products like monitors, but now, with rising wages, these niches have vanished," said Benjamin H. W. Chen, an analyst at Baring Research (Taiwan) Ltd. "The new niche will be at the medium-tech level, like telecommunications products."
Taiwan has hundreds of small concerns that are moving into the world of technology. It makes about 30 percent of all traditional computer monitors used in the world, more than the share made in the United States.
 
 Silicon Valley a Model
 But Taiwan still has no company that even approaches the global might of the International Business Machines Corporation or Fujitsu Ltd., one reason that the Government created the science park. Using Silicon Valley as a model, the park hopes to provide the infrastructure, the manpower and an atmosphere for closet entrepreneurs who will help create one or two flagship companies that will become household names around the world.
"I don't think we can ever be on top, but we'd be proud to be second or third," said H. Steve Hsieh, director general of the Science Park Administration, who returned to Taiwan in 1982 after 13 years in America.
The park has stiff guidelines including a requirement that its tenants spend 5 percent of their revenues on research and development. "Nothinghere is at the forefront of research and development, but at least the direction is right," said Sydney Merritt, an adviser to the United Microelectronics Corporation, a company in the park that is one of Taiwan's largest makers of integrated circuits.
 
 Tax Breaks and Loans
 Companies in the park also receive a variety of tax incentives and low-interest loans. The park promotes exchanges with two nearby universities. The Industrial Technology Research Institute, which is affiliated with the park, is mapping out strategies for industrial development and is trying to start ventures in new fields like aerospace.
Yet critics say that Taiwan's attempt to create its own version of Silicon Valley at the science park is progressing slowly. Park planners hope that by 1996 its companies will generate a total of $8 billion in annual revenues and devote $600 million a year to research and development.
This is an ambitious target, considering that at the end of last year, the companies in the park brought in $2 billion in revenues and invested only $70 million in research.
The park could also have trouble attracting investment because of slower economic growth expected by Taiwan for the next couple of years and the collapse of the stock market here. The majority of investment in the park comes from Taiwan companies and individuals.
 
 Difficult Supply Situation
 Although conditions at the park have improved considerably, they still are not on a par with Silicon Valley. When Matthew F. C. Miau, chairman of the Mitac Computers Group, returned to Taiwan from Silicon Valley in 1976, he could not find the plastic he needed to make disks for his personal computers and a machine shop to grind the materials to make the disk drives. After working for Intel for five years helping to develop the first generation of microprocessors, he was used to having suppliers at his doorstep.
These days, logistical constraints in the science park still make it difficult for companies to expand. "In Silicon Valley, it is so easy to lease things," said Mr. Miau, who has had to fight to bring a gas supplier into the park because the company does not qualify as a high-technology one. Such support systems are essential, he said.
Most Taiwanese-Americans return because of the career prospects, the opportunity to be their own bosses or to play out their entrepreneurial dreams. They often return with American passports, and because of Taiwan's rapid economic development, many say the quality of the Taiwanese way of life makes returning home appealing.
But Taiwan companies cannot always offer scientists and engineers the same salaries they get in America. Taiwan's engineers still earn only a third to one-half the comparable wage in the United States. Management styles in Taiwan are also different.
"We think about endurance, loyalty and how someone develops," said C. K. Liu, president of the Tecom Company, which makes sophisticated telephone systems in the science park. "People work more like a family because people here are less sophisticated."
 
 Gaining a Vital Base
 But slowly, the park is gaining a vital base. Among the companies here is Microelectronics Technology Inc. In 1983, Chi C. Hsieh, the company's president, and seven of his colleagues from the communications field left Silicon Valley and returned to Taiwan to develop microwave technology. The company, with 600 employees, had sales of $48 million last year.
It manufactures suitcase-sized satellite communications systems that allow people to place telephone calls from the middle of nowhere. Microelectronics says that one of its systems, which is tailored for ships, was used during the summit meeting off Malta in December between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The company has been making 15 of its portable satellite communications systems each month. But it is now benefiting from the Middle East crisis: it has doubled production and sold more than a dozen to business executives and officials who want to use them in the region.
"Before we developed this microwave industry, they all were doing lower-tech TV's and other consumer products," said Mr. Hsieh, who spent 17 years in America, at graduate school and at the Harris Corporation.
 
 $260 Million Plant Completed
 United Microelectronics says that at the moment it is equipped with the world's most precise manufacturing capability in its field. It has just completed a $260 million plant, its second, which it says will eventually be able to build integrated circuits with a degree of precision as thin as 0.65 microns, or a tiny fraction of the width of a human hair.
While Taiwanese companies have traditionally been too small to acquire American corporations, in February, Mitac purchased Wyse Technology Inc, an American maker of computer terminals, taking it private in a $270 million transaction.
While it is not as large as Acer, Mitac, with $346 million in sales last year, is one of Taiwan's largest makers of personal computers. The purchase might have been the first of a wave of acquisitions by Taiwan companies if not for the plunge in the Taiwan stock market, a major source of money for large companies here.

A Struggling Czech Retailer Delivers the Goods

BYLINE: By BURTON BOLLAG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
A full year after the democratic revolution in Czechoslovakia, this country's leading department store is still struggling almost daily to stock Western products eagerly sought by shoppers.
Even so, the store, Kotva, is a leader in the drive by Eastern European enterprises to modernize their way of doing business. Kotva's executives have used energy and imagination to overcome many of the obstacles, like the scarcity of easily convertible, or hard, currency that still hobbles many Eastern European enterprises. 
The store is still state-owned, but its shelves hold a growing selection of Western goods: Swiss chocolates, American cigarettes and West German skateboards. In the past, the few Eastern European stores carrying such products accepted only hard foreign currency like dollars or German marks. Now, Kotva sells all its wares in the local currency, the crown.
 
 Struggling to Improve
But the Kotva scenes of people crowding around special stands selling Lego toys and Nina Ricci perfumes or having their photos developed overnight at the Fuji film counter are still rare in Czechoslovakia.
Many stores, shops and consumer services are still struggling to improve, hindered not only by a lack of currency needed to import Western wares but also by vestiges of strict Government controls. As a result, many remain old-fashioned, unattractive and unresponsive distribution points for shoddy products.
Kotva's accomplishments are even greater than they might first appear. The store's managers say they must fight against the sloth and lack of initiative that many workers acquired during four decades of Communist rule.
Goods imported from non-socialist countries account for 30 percent of Kotva's sales, up from 7 percent last year, store officials say.
 
 Bartering for West's Goods
 To stock the fashions and other Western products it sells, Kotva has developed extensive bartering arrangements.
Kotva opened in 1975; it has 65,000 square feet of floor space, and its officials say it is the largest department store in Central and Eastern Europe.
"Kotva is led by young people," said Martin Svehla, spokesman for the State Bank of Czechoslovakia, "and we think it is one of the best in services and goods offered."
Bankers say Kotva began hiring younger, more progressive managers after the Communist Government liberalized its regulations on commercial trade in the mid-1980's, giving retail stores more leeway in seeking their own goods abroad.
Czechoslovakia's new Government has not yet decided exactly how it will carry out its changes in the economy. But Kotva's general director, Franisek Skok, told the Czech newspaper Mlady Svet in a recent interview that next year he would like to start buying out ownership of the store from the Government and distributing stock among the 1,700 employees.
 
 Elected by the Staff
 Mr. Skok was elected to his post by Kotva's staff in April 1989.
A leader in the struggle to modernize the department store is Lubomir Staffen, who is 38 years old and a Kotva vice president. He says that each morning he asks his staff of buyers three questions: "What was our profit? What was the price of the competition? What are you doing to beat the competition?"
Mr. Staffen had a career in Czechoslovakia's foreign trade ministry, which included periodic trips to Geneva with his country's delegation to the multilateral trade talks there, before taking his current job a little more than a year ago.
Mr. Staffen is largely responsible for the sharp increase in the store's selection of Western goods. "Now people go abroad," he said. "They're demanding new things, but I'm limited by what I can get through counter trade," a form of barter.
When he took his job, he created a staff of 10 just to barter for better goods. The group got the Lego toys from Denmark by exchanging Czechoslovak paper. Italian vermouth, selling in the store's basement supermarket, came in return for Czechoslovak cheese.
 
 Government Influence
 To Mr. Staffen's regret, the Government still has a big hand in business. Barter deals have to go through state-owned or licensed "trading companies." Moreover, the store's tax burden remains unchanged at 65 percent of gross profits.
To better train and motivate his staff of 56, Mr. Staffen holds classes on modern business practices. Using mimeographed sheets, he teaches ways to improve in areas long ignored, like marketing, pricing and timely deliveries.
He has also been trying to increase productivity by paying an additional half salary to buyers able to take over the duties of a colleague dismissed as inefficient. Four jobs have been eliminated in this way.
 
 100,000 Customers a Day
 Kotva, like most stores and restaurants in the region, still suffers from overcrowding and frequently dirty floors. An average of 100,000 customers visit Kotva each day and they line up for a few minutes to a quarter-hour to get to a sales counter or into the basement supermarket.
Czechoslovakia's new Government is unambiguously steering the country to a market economy. But it will take months, perhaps years, before local industry will produce enough exportable goods to allow for full convertibility of the crown. For this reason Mr. Staffen expects to have to rely on cumbersome bartering for some time.
Counter trade was used before the revolution here a year ago. But state barter did not provide goods that consumers really wanted.
"The old philosophy was fulfilling the Government plan," he said. "Mine is making money."

Westway's Ghost Pays Off, Proving Skeptics Wrong

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, just imagine where Manhattan's West Side Highway would lead.
Two decades have gone by since a cadre of urban planners conceived an underground thoroughfare, buried beneath parks, apartments and commercial development built on landfill in the Hudson River. That ambitious proposal, called Westway, collapsed of its own bureaucratic weight five years ago this fall after an investment of $250 million -- nearly a tenth of its projected budget. 
 Now another ground-breaking has been very tentatively scheduled -- this one, for a more modest replacement highway. The road is unlikely to be finished before the millenium. Officials are reviewing plans for a companion riverfront park, although the defeat of New York's proposed environmental bond issue this month cost the park project $100 million, or about one-fifth of its estimated budget.
Yet New Yorkers have collected a generous fringe benefit from Westway's defeat.
Congress had empowered localities to substitute money committed to unbuilt interstate highway system segments, like Westway, for an equivalent amount of Federal funds to be spent on mass transit and on a cheaper substi tute road. The trade- in legislation armed Westway foes, who had been dismissed as obstructionists, with a constructive alternative. Eventu ally, their loose coali tion of environmen talists, mass-transit advocates and fiscal conservatives suc ceeded in the courts and in Congress.
 Westway diehards had predicted that the trade-in wouldn't work. They warned that Washington would never relinquish the full $1.7 billion or so, or that inflation would severely devalue it. But unwilling to gamble on another environmental review after Congress refused to extend a trade-in deadline, the governor and mayor declared Westway dead. Since then the skeptics have generally been proved wrong.
The swap earmarked $690 million for a replacement highway; another $690 million for the city's own highway budget, freeing an equivalent amount of city money for mass transit, and $345 million directly to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
"That complicated agreement has basically worked," said Mortimer L. Downey, the M.T.A.'s executive director.
"A surprising amount has ended up in mass transit," said Marcy Benstock, the Clean Air Campaign director who was instrumental in defeating Westway.
Mr. Downey said the transit agency had received $694 million of the $1.035 billion from both sources and had invested most of it in subway car overhauls and track and signal repairs.
By the end of next year, the agency expects, it will have collected the rest of the $690 million that was to be funneled through the city under the Westway shuffle and most of the direct mass-transit money -- which has since grown to $380 million. (The city recently rejected Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's proposal to spend trade-in money to hire more police officers; he had warned that fearful New Yorkers would use the new highway to leave town.)
Not surprisingly, plans for the substitute highway, from the Battery to 59th Street, are only inching along. Several alternatives for the Route 9A Reconstruction Project, as it has modestly been called, range between six and eight lanes in width and between $300 million and $1 billion in cost. A draft environmental impact report is to be completed next spring. Barring other impediments, construction could start late in 1992. It could take about six to eight years to replace the existing temporary roadway -- itself a substitute for the elevated West Side Highway, which was razed.
"We've made a lot of progress," said Richard A. Maitino, project director for the State Transportation Department, "in that most of the people we talk to, instead of asking why should the road be built, are asking how the road should be built."
Since 1985 roughly $40 million has been obligated for West Side Highway purposes under the trade-in program, which expires next September. Still unresolved are how much the city will be reimbursed for the old Westway right of way and where the viaduct north of 59th Street will be rebuilt. Also, how much, if any, of the proposed waterfront park will be endorsed by Mayor David N. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and whether they will find another source for the $100 million that would have come from the defeated environmental bond issue.
Five years ago the governor predicted that Westway would soon be forgotten like "a walnut in the batter of eternity." It has been. But on the surface, the ripples remain.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Rose 1.9% Last Month

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Machine tool orders increased nearly 1.9 percent in October from the September level, the industry's trade association reported in its monthly survey. Some analysts said the increase indicated that the nation's economic slowdown had not yet prompted manufacturers in the United States to sharply reduce spending for new equipment.
The level of new orders for American-made machine tools reached $269.3 million, compared with $264.3 in September, the Association for Manufacturing Technology said in its report, which is scheduled to be released today. The October figure, which was one of the three highest monthly totals in the last 12 months, represented a 31.4 percent increase from October 1989. For the first 10 months of this year, machine tool orders were 2.1 percent higher than in the comparable period a year earlier. 
 Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in products ranging from appliances and vehicles to aircraft and construction materials. The strength of tool orders generally reflects the strength of industrial production, and economists consider patterns of machine tool sales to be important indicators of capital spending by manufacturers.
 
 Manufacturing Strength
 "The rise in new orders indicates that -- despite gloomy prospects elsewhere in the economy -- the level of business activity in the manufacturing technology industries remains firm," said Albert W. Moore, president of the association, which is based in McLean, Va.
As has been the case for much of this year, foreign demand for machine tools continued to be strong, with overseas orders increasing 22.7 percent in October from the previous month. The level of orders from foreign customers in October was up 52.8 percent from October 1989.
Domestic orders were down one-sixth of 1 percent in October from the September level, but were 28.8 percent higher than in October 1989.
 
 'Economic Turning Point'
 "The United States is at an economic turning point," Mr. Moore said. "In spite of caution on the consumer side of the economy, United States manufacturers need to look to the future. They have to take the long view, and that means they must continue to upgrade their manufacturing operations."
Shipments of machine tools fell 14.9 percent in October, to $254.3 million, from the September level. The association said the September figure reflected the surge in shipments that typically occurs at the end of each quarter.
Analysts said orders for machine tools from the aerospace industry had remained firm and the decline in orders from auto makers had not been as pronounced as many had feared. Auto makers typically account for more than a third of overall orders, and sluggishness in the auto industry has caused machine tool orders to slow in several months this year.
 
 Good Short-Term Prospects
 "At the moment, things are looking relatively good," said James J. Paper, a machine tool analyst with Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith Inc. in Omaha. "Orders are coming in well from a diverse base of industries, and the inquiry rate is strong from potential customers, indicating that the prospects, at least in the short term, are good."
Despite the stronger results for October, Mr. Paper and other analysts predicted that orders would fall if a prolonged economic downturn occurred. "The risk is, of course, that the whole economy will go through a downturn and stay down six months to a year or longer," Mr. Paper said. "That will affect manufacturers' operating rates, and their future plans for capital spending are sure to be affected."
Orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, dropped 12.1 percent in October from September's level. That segment of the industry typically accounts for three-fourths of new orders. Orders for metal-forming tools increased 55.3 percent in October from September's level, helped by a surge in foreign orders.
The backlog in orders stood at $1.58 billion in October, up from $1.57 billion in September.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Inflation Fear Is Said To Subside

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Many credit market analysts say inflationary pressures have begun to ease significantly, even though oil prices remain substantially above the levels before Iraq invaded Kuwait and could go higher still if war erupts in the Persian Gulf.
The moderating trend has come as a welcome surprise to many credit market participants, who feared that rapidly rising oil prices would in turn push up the prices of other goods and services. 
 Price pressures are still evident in the service sector, but producers of goods are finding it difficult, if not impossible, to raise prices. Since early August non-oil commodity prices have declined significantly.
 
 Modest Rises Lately
 The drop has pushed the Commodity Research Bureau's index to levels not seen since the summer of 1989. After rising sharply in August and September, consumer prices excluding food and energy have posted modest increases of three-tenths of a percentage point in each of the last two months.
Fears about an oil-generated inflationary spiral have not been borne out because the economy was much weaker than most people realized at the time of the Iraqi invasion, analysts said. That weakness has intensified since, further crimping demand.
"We have resolved a lot of doubts about the economy," said Richard Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers, "particularly about how fast inflation will come down. We are reversing perceptions that inflation will be staying at extraordinarily high levels."
 
 Expectations Exceeded
 Rudolf Thunberg, an economist at Ried Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm in Westport, Conn., said the declines in non-oil commodity prices "reflect a slowdown in demand for basic commodities, one which has exceeded my expectations."
"The rate of inflation is likely to diminish over the next several quarters as the economy sinks into recession," he added.
As a result of economic weakness, Mr. Thunberg is forecasting that for the 12 months ending in December 1991 consumer prices will rise at a 4 percent rate, down from a 6.4 percent rate for this year.
The grudging awareness among credit market participants that inflationary pressures seem to be easing is something of a testament to the Federal Reserve, analysts said.
 
 Reputation Reinforced
 The fact that the central bank chose not to push interest rates lower in the early stages of the Persian Gulf crisis may prove to be the deciding factor in hastening an economic downturn, but the delay also reinforced the Fed's reputation as an inflation fighter.
'Financial markets were a little bit slow to recognize that the Fed was very reluctant to allow commodity prices to run up, too," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. "I could make a case that the underlying inflationary trend is a little bit lower now than it was in July."
The sense in the credit markets that the inflation threat is receding is seen in bond yields, which have declined over the course of November despite the fact that the Fed has moved to lower the overnight Federal funds rate twice. Very often a reduction in short-term interest rates by the Fed will be poorly received in the bond market, which is highly sensitive to any steps that could stimulate demand and thereby ignite price pressures.
 
 Move Called Impressive
 The movement in bond yields in the wake of the Fed's moves "is very impressive to me," said Paul L. Kasriel, a vice president and money market economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "The fact that the bond market has rallied on those cuts in the funds rate suggests that the economy is weakening at a faster rate than the Fed is easing. The Fed is winning its battle against inflation, and its move to ease monetary policy is not over."
Market participants will continue to look for, and expect, additional evidence of economic weakness this week. But a significant surprise could come on Wednesday, when the Commerce Department releases revised estimates of third-quarter economic growth.
In late October most analysts dismissed the department's preliminary growth estimate of 1.8 percent as too high, adding that it would almost surely be revised downward later on. A month later, that view has changed. Most economists now expect that the figure will be revised upward, perhaps substantially.
 
 Huge Revision Predicted
 The revision in the gross national product figures will be huge, said Robert Giordano, a partner and director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company. Because of increases in inventories, consumer spending and foreign trade, he expects the third-quarter output figure to be raised to 2.5 percent.
Economic growth of that magnitude would seem to cast doubt on just how weak the economy truly was at the time of the gulf crisis. But Mr. Giordano and others assert that stronger third-quarter numbers have no bearing on current conditions.
"Much of the gain in G.N.P. came before confidence plummeted in the wake of the crisis," he said. "Right now the economy is declining, and the Fed can't afford to conduct policy on the basis of history. A healthier looking third quarter may lead to some political crowing in Washington, but it will have no impact on monetary policy."

HEADLINE: JAPAN WEIGHS AID TO NORTH KOREANS

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Nearly a half century after the end of its brutal subjugation of the Korean Peninsula, Japan is starting to think about possible reparations for North Korea but finding the decision-making difficult because of Koreans' extreme wariness of Japanese motives.
Japanese officials said last week that talks on a compensation package could begin after the first of next year, most probably in Pyongyang, with North Korea demanding at least as much as the $500 million that South Korea received when it normalized relations with Japan in 1965. 
 In theory, that package of loans and grants would be worth several billion dollars today, but Japanese officials acknowledge that coming up with such a large sum would stir anger in South Korea and perhaps the United States.
"We're at an impasse on the issue of compensation," said a Japanese official. "The problem is that this is not simply an issue between Japan and North Korea alone. There are other interested parties."
 
Prime Ministers Meet
 The discussion over an aid package with North Korea offers an intriguing glimpse into diplomacy in post-cold-war northeast Asia, where the rules of alliances are being rewritten in a far less visible fashion than in Europe.
At the center is an incipient reconciliation between North and South Korea, reflected in the recent meetings between the Prime Ministers of the two countries, the highest level of contacts since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The first two rounds of talks in September and October were marked by speeches reiterating familiar charges and countercharges and a general failure to narrow longstanding differences. The next round of talks is to begin Dec. 11.
But North and South Korea have also engaged in a ballet of diplomatic maneuvering with other countries, particularly China, Japan, the Soviet Union and the United States.
What has emerged is a new regional game of "two plus four" relating to the Korean Peninsula, much as German reunification was settled by negotiations involving East and West Germany plus the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain.
 
Wooing Moscow and Beijing
 The four powers outside the Korean Peninsula have all made clear that they hope North and South Korea are successful in trying to solve their problems, easing tensions in a heavily armed region that remains an anomalous relic of East-West confrontation.
But most diplomats agree that the current discussions between North and South Korea are generally seen as the fruit of two years of assiduous courtship of North Korea's longtime patrons, the Soviet Union and China, by President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea.
For Mr. Roh, the payoff has been an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with Moscow, including a possible trip to the Soviet capital himself, and the opening of Chinese and South Korean trade and liaison offices in Seoul and Beijing.
Moscow especially is putting pressure on Pyongyang, demanding that it repair its international image as a sponsor of terrorism and give up its belligerent posture toward Seoul.
To counter these presures, North Korea succeeded this fall in opening up a dialogue with Japan, which could help it out of its economic stagnation.
Somewhat to the dismay of both American and South Korean officials, Japan opened this new avenue by abruptly sending a delegation to North Korea in September to begin negotiations to establish diplomatic ties.
 
Seoul Is Incensed
 The Japanese step incensed Mr. Roh's Government, which accused Japan of advancing its economic interests, heedless about the concern that doing so would undercut Seoul's careful drive to isolate Pyongyang and force it into a more reasonable position. "We have doubts today about the strength, consistency and even the dignity of Japanese foreign policy," a special adviser to Mr. Roh said last month.
Since then, however, Japan has taken a much more cautious approach to North Korea. Senior Japanese officials said in interviews that Tokyo would not do anything to undercut the North-South dialogue.
In recent weeks, Japan has been reaching out to South Korea, deciding, for instance, to eliminate fingerprinting requirement for many Koreans living in Japan for several generations, always a sore subject among Korean people.
South Korean officials said they were somewhat reassured about Japanese intentions. "We feel much more at ease than before," one said.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
U.S. Aides Press Iraqi Nuclear Threat

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today stepped up its effort to raise American concern about Iraq's ability to develop nuclear weapons, saying Baghdad might be able to produce a crude nuclear device within a year.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, said in separate appearances that the Iraqi nuclear weapons program was advancing despite the embargo, and they provided intelligence estimates intended to buttress President Bush's statements about Iraqi's emerging nuclear ability made during his Thanksgiving visit to Saudi Arabia. 
 Mr. Bush's statements, and the remarks today by the two officials, were clearly intended to add weight to the Administration's argument that the situation in the Persian Gulf must be brought to a decisive turn this winter.
The Iraqi nuclear program is not a new concern for Washington, and the assertion today that Iraq might build a rudimentary nuclear device within a year appeared to be an attempt to counter Democratic lawmakers who have suggested that the United States should give sanctions a year or more to work so war might be avoided, as well as to influence the United Nations Security Council meeting on the gulf crisis to be held on Thursday.
 
Hearing Due This Week
 Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, is scheduled to lead Armed Services Committee hearings this week that are expected to become a forum for challenging the Administration's decision to speed up its timetable for resolving the crisis caused by the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on Aug. 2.
In recent weeks the Administration cited a variety of reasons for forcing a resolution of the gulf crisis, including destruction in Kuwait, the holding of hostages and threats to the economy of the United States and the world.
In his appearance today on the ABC News program "This Week," Mr. Scowcroft said the Administration was also motivated by concern that the coalition confronting Iraq might dissolve if the crisis was prolonged. It was the first time a senior official has publicly acknowledged that factor.
"This international coalition is a disparate group of people," Mr. Scowcroft said. "There are all sorts of tensions and pressures one way or another." He added that there was a "common feeling" within the coaltion that the crisis "needs to be brought to an end."
 
Poll Results Cited
 None of those rationales for possible military action against Iraq appears to to have decisively swayed public opinion. In contrast, in a recent New York Times/CBS Poll, 54 percent of the respondents said they believed that preventing Iraq from acquiring nuclear weapons was a good enough reason to take military action against Iraq.
An Administration official said the survey results had been noted by the White House, which is also looking for an argument that will sway the public. Another Government official, who insisted that he not be identified, said the Administration's statements today that Iraq could produce a bomb in a relatively short period was unduly alarmist, considering the difficulties of the technical processes.
While Mr. Bush gave new emphasis to Iraq's nuclear potential during his Thanksgiving visit to American troops, he did not provide intelligence estimates about how long it might take Iraq to develop a bomb.
 
More Detailed Estimates
 Today, Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Cheney sought to buttress Mr. Bush's statements by providing more detailed estimates about Iraq's nuclear potential. Administration officials said the remarks by Mr. Cheney and Mr. Scowcroft reflected a classified intelligence estimate that Iraq could develop a nuclear bomb in six months to a year, but probably longer, even if it conducts a crash program.
Such an effort would involve using about 27 pounds of highly enriched uranium that has been supplied by France and was recently inspected by officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency, experts say. In addition, Iraq might also use a small quantity of less highly enriched uranium that it has acquired from the Soviet Union.
"If he were to take that material, he could produce a crude device with it," Mr. Cheney said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," adding that a "worst-case assumption held that such a weapon might be developed in a year or less.
"It wouldn't be anything you could deliver from an airplane," Mr. Cheney said. "It wouldn't be anything that would be weaponized in the sense that we think of a nuclear weapon. But it would be capable, for example, of doing some damage, of producing some kind of a yield -- a very crude system."
The Defense Secretary asserted that the Iraqis could build a more sophisticated weapon in 5 to 10 years by developing the ability to refine crude uranium available in Iraq.
Mr. Scowcroft said Government estimates about when Iraq might acquire a nuclear weapon ranged from "months to as much as 10 years." That estimate includes the possibility that Iraq might conduct a crash program to develop a crude bomb as well as its ongoing, longer-term effort to build a more sophisticated weapon that could be delivered by a missile or plane.
The national security adviser then drew a direct link between the prospective Iraqi nuclear threat and the need to resolve the gulf crisis in a short period of months.
Waiting a year or two to see if sanctions will work, as some Democratic lawmakers suggest, Mr. Scowcroft said, "raises the possibility that we could face an Iraq armed with nuclear weapons, which would dramatically change the character of any conflict."
 
Danger Called Exaggerated
 Gary Milhollin, an expert on the spread of nuclear weapons, said the Administration was exaggerating the danger that Iraq could develop a nuclear weapon in a short period to buttress its case for considering a war this winter.
"What are you going to do with one untested, unwieldly bomb when facing three nuclear weapons powers -- the United States, France and England -- that have already deployed troops and a fourth nuclear power Israel that is not far away?" Mr. Milhollin said.
"I would think it would be a reckless, desperate act to threaten four nuclear powers with one untested bomb," Mr. Milhollin added.

HEADLINE: Middle-Class Blacks Try to Grip A Ladder While Lending a Hand

SERIES: Scraping By: Second of Three Articles.

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON

 BODY:
Joyce Ford, the daughter of laborers, fled the hand-to-mouth world of Washington's black housing projects and now has amenities of the middle class: a good job in the Government, an office across the street from the White House, a merit raise and an American Express card. But she still has the bone-deep worries of the poor.
Sitting at her desk the other day, she got yet another call from a frantic relative with bad news and high expectations. "Your brother's sick," the caller said. "He needs to see somebody. What are you going to do?" 
 What else could she do? She spent the better part of the day trying to figure out where her out-of-work brother should go for treatment, and how to pay for it.
Mrs. Ford, 44 years old, is among tens of thousands of black people who are the first in their families to break out of poverty and take a tenuous place in the American middle class. Many are scaling the economic ladder with one hand on the middle rung and the other still outstretched to the relatives who need them.
 
The Peril of Falling Back
 To the outside world, Mrs. Ford and those like her are examples of how far this nation has come since the civil rights movement opened up legions of professional jobs previously closed to black people. To their families, they are the American dream come true, showpieces to brag about.
But even in the best of times, these newly arrived blacks have a loose grasp on prosperity. And as a faltering economy tumbles toward recession, they may slip out of the middle class altogether, many economists and sociologists fear, creating an even deeper well of need among impoverished blacks to whom they now lend support.
Two main things tend to distinguish black middle-class people from middle-class whites. One is the likelihood that many more of their relatives will come to them for help. The other is that they tend to lack the resources of people who started life in the middle class.
There is no clear-cut definition of "middle class," a concept that can embrace not just how much money people make but the way they make it: usually not with their hands. Most economists and sociologists agree that the middle class includes mainly professionals, skilled service and clerical workers and entrepreneurs, each one earning $25,000 to about $50,000 a year, or more if the person lives in an expensive city or has a lot of children.
Under those criteria, about 40 percent of blacks fall into the category of middle class or above, while 30 percent are blue-collar working class and 30 percent are the unskilled poor.
But unlike the white middle and upper classes, which include nearly 70 percent of all white households and have been a fixture for three or four generations, the vast majority of the black middle class is starting from scratch.
Census Bureau figures for 1989 show that in median annual income, the households of black college graduates trailed those of white college graduates by more than a third: $37,958 for blacks as against $48,862 for whites.
And while all couples earn more if both husband and wife work, a second income for black families is usually what allows them to be middle class.
When both spouses work, the median income of black couples is $37,787, according to 1989 census figures. But when one spouse did not bring home a paycheck, the black couple's median income dropped to $18,727 -- out of the middle class. White couples, by contrast, tend to keep their middle-class status even when one spouse does not work. Last year, white couples earned a median figure of $45,803 with two paychecks and $29,689 with one.
Perhaps equally important, economists say, black people often enter the middle class with a slight fraction of the financial assets of middle-class whites whose parents and grandparents were middle class. So blacks lack the reserve of money and property needed to buy a house, to finance a college education, to weather a personal catastrophe or a national recession.
"Middle-class blacks are much more vulnerable than whites because they tend to be new to their positions and don't have the seniority or accumulated wealth," said William Julius Wilson, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago.
 
Reminders of Desperation
 Unlike most middle-class whites, they live with daily, personal reminders of the poverty and desperation they are trying to put behind them, as the loved ones back home who have not fared so well turn to them for help with the rent, use of a car, a place to stay.
"We're all tied together because upward mobility is recent for us," said Dr. Andrew Billingsly, chairman of the Department of Family and Community Development at the University of Maryland and a leading researcher on the black middle class.
The topic can be painful. Many middle-class black people were reluctant to talk to a reporter about their experiences out of a sense of duty and protectiveness toward their loved ones. Some did not want to take credit or appear to be holding themselves above the people they once played stickball with.
And in a society that in many ways judges people not only by where they are but by where they came from, many feared that their backgrounds and family responsibilities would subject them to unwanted scrutiny at work, or even be held against them.
In dozens of interviews, middle-class black people said they were proud to be the ones able to help their families, but were frustrated by their inability to get ahead.
"You can never accomplish anything," said Mrs. Ford, the Government worker in Washington. "As soon as you get anything, there's something there to take it away. I often wonder what will happen if something happens to me. Who'll be there for me?"
 
A Big Family
 
Some Dependents Aren't Declared
Donald Sheppard, an assistant professor of social work at Texas Southern University in Houston, has a wife and five children, but they are just the dependents the Internal Revenue Service gives him credit for.
When a brother needs a loan, when a sister needs a job, when a nephew needs a car, when a cousin needs a credit card or a friend needs a place to stay, they come to him.
"I know that when I get paid on the first of the month, I'm going to get a call," Mr. Sheppard, 40, said. "It's expected that I have it and that I'm going to give it. I feel I'm working for the whole extended family. It's not a question of if they're going to need it. I know they're going to need it."
His relatives have looked to him for help since he was in grade school. "When the television would get those horizontal lines, they would always call on me," Mr. Sheppard recalled. "I didn't know what to do any more than they did. But I'd turn some screw and it would work. Even as a child, people expected me to do everything."
By the time he was 11, he was catching the bus to go pay the family's utility bills. His father, a wool presser at a Houston dry cleaners with not a day of high school, could not dare ask for the time off; his mother, a maid, had suffered a stroke and was too sick. So she kept him out of school to pay the bills. He remembers being stopped by a truant officer and telling him, "Sir, my mama's sick. I'm going to go to school as soon as I pay the bills."
Mr. Sheppard became the only one of eight children to get a college degree and carry a briefcase to work. A sister once told him, "You're almost like a god in our family."
He and his wife, Jina, both social workers, earned their master's degrees at the University of Chicago in the mid-1980's by packing their five children in their 1971 station wagon and all their belongings in a U-Haul truck, driving north and feeding seven mouths on what was left of their scholarship money.
 
Sometimes He Gets Burned
 They returned to Houston to an extended family of relatives and friends who needed them. Mr. Sheppard has gone into the refrigerator to get chicken broilers and T-bone steaks for them; he has had to choose between helping a relative out with the rent or fixing the boiler at his house. The family always wins.
Lately, he has been trying to provide services rather than money. He recently got one of his nephews a maintenance job at the university. "I have to do it for me," Mr. Sheppard said. "If I get them a job, they won't have to be asking me for something."
Last August, a childhood friend of Mr. Sheppard's who was down on his luck and recently evicted asked if he could move his family in with Mr. Sheppard and his family. The answer was yes, and Mr. Sheppard's children slept on the floor to make room. They stayed for five weeks.
"Every day, I had to buy milk and bread and cereal," Mr. Sheppard said. "I had 12 people in the house, and I was the provider."
Some of his investments have begun to pay off. For instance, he saw promise in the young son of one of his sisters, who was raising the boy as a single parent. Mr. Sheppard signed the boy up for Little League Baseball, coached him and counseled him as a surrogate father. The boy is now a senior in high school, at the top of his class and a drum major in the band.
Mr. Sheppard is still paying for the help he has given. His credit cards are up to their limit and the car needs fixing. Even on his and his wife's combined income of $60,000 a year, they have only a $5,000 cushion for their retirement and have not been able to save for their children's college education.
"In my family's eyesight, we've made it," Mr. Sheppard said. "But we're living paycheck to paycheck. To lavish and wallow in the status of the middle class, we can't do it. And I can't give like I used to. But it doesn't seem to register. People still come up to me and say, 'I know it's rough on you, but it's rougher on me, so can you give me this?' "
His goal is to build up reserves so he can provide for relatives without depleting his own money. But he is a long way from that. "When I think about it, it really kind of frightens me," he said. "Sometimes I find myself frustrated and depressed. I'm called on by my children, my wife, family members, students, colleagues, friends, needing, asking, wanting. The cycle never ends."
 
Pathfinders
 
An Easier Road For Immigrants?
The role of family pathfinder is not new. Immigrants who flocked here from Europe early in this century typically relied on the first child who got an education and a foothold to serve as ambassador and teacher for the rest of the family.
But there are key differences for today's black people. For one, while many unskilled immigrants were able to get relatively good-paying factory jobs or make connections with local political machines to vault their children into the middle class, discrimination prohibited the parents and grandparents of most of today's black middle class from nearly all but menial positions in industry or politics. That meant black families had far less than white families to pass on.
Soon after civil rights measures created a more even playing field, the economy changed: once-dependable, relatively lucrative factory jobs started to vanish just as they began opening up to blacks.
Sociologists, however, point to the effects of lingering racial discrimination as the main difference. Dr. Joe R. Feagin, a professor of sociology at the University of Florida who is completing a book on racial discrimination and the black middle class, contrasts his experiences as an Irish-American with those of black Americans.
"My great-great-grandparents saw signs that said, 'No Irish or dogs allowed,' " Dr. Feagin said. "But once we lost the brogue and the look of the Irish, we could pass. People couldn't single us out for discrimination anymore. That has not been the case for blacks, no matter what their status."
Indeed, the civil rights gains of the last 20 years have done little to even out the huge gaps in white and black wealth. Census figures from 1984, the most recent available for this category, showed that for black households, the median net worth, or total value of what they own (cars, houses, stocks, equity in a business, for example) minus what they owe, such as an outstanding mortgage or education loan, was $3,397. For white households, it was $39,135.
More disturbing, perhaps, nearly a third of blacks have zero or negative net worth, meaning they owe more than they own, Only 8 percent of whites are in that category.
 
An Anchor
 
Giving Help, Giving Space
When Marjorie Ellis, 38, is not punching blueprint data into a computer as a drafting clerk at the Southern Bell Telephone Company, she runs a boardinghouse -- for her own family. Her two-bedroom ranch house just south of Atlanta bustles with the banter and footsteps of her sister, her sister's children, her elderly aunt and her mother.
They are all in transition. Her sister has a job as a civilian worker in the military and is trying to get on her feet, one of the nephews is in college, the aunt is recovering from hip surgery and her mother is struggling on a pension. They all turned to Miss Ellis when they needed help and now share space in the house, chipping in whenever they can.
Their fortune is tied to her fortune. "If there's a middle class, I'm in the poor section," said Miss Ellis, who earns about $30,000 a year.
In the months since her relatives moved in, she has depleted her savings and fallen behind on her house payments.
She doesn't have the $2,500 she needs to get the engine fixed for her 1984 Thunderbird. The car sits cold and idle in her driveway as she leaves to catch the 5:30 bus each dark morning to get to work by 7.
"I'm behind and it's hard to catch up," Miss Ellis said. "I pay one bill one week, the others when I can. I might be late a month. That doesn't mess your credit up too bad. Sometimes I sit and pray and cry. Then I figure it'll be all right somehow. I'm not going to let any of my relatives go wanting if I can help them."
 
A Wreck Is Disastrous
 A few years ago, when her nephew needed a car to get to school, for instance, she bought a car, for which he agreed to make the payments if she covered the down payment and insurance. He never got the money. Worse, the car was in an accident and she ended up owing $1,300 on it. She is still paying for the car, which neither of them can use.
Miss Ellis's father was a cement finisher who died when she was in grade school; her mother was a maid. She and her sister were the first to graduate from high school and work behind a desk.
She remembers her minister's words when she got her house: "You're coming up in the world. You're coming up slow, but you're coming up in the world."
Between the economy and her family responsibilities, she doesn't feel that way anymore. She sleeps on the speckled beige sofa in the den, beneath pictures of the assorted relatives who rely on her. There is also a dog-eared picture of her grandmother, posing not with any of the 25 children she bore but with one of the white children she tended to for a living.
Under the strain, Miss Ellis has developed a bleeding ulcer, diabetes and chronic depression for which she takes regular medication. Her nightmares are not of ghosts and gremlins but of becoming homeless.
Her mother has begun to catch on. She has seen the somber-looking letters from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which backed her mortgage. But Miss Ellis doesn't want to let on to her situation. Her relatives look up to her. She wouldn't want to let them down.
 "What are you studying about?" her mother will ask in rural Georgiaspeak when she sees her daughter thinking of the weight on her shoulders.
"Nothing," Miss Ellis will answer, and smile not very convincingly. "I'm fine."
 
Tough Choices
 
Saying 'No' To Relatives
Glen Giles of Atlanta doesn't go out for lunch or take his family on trips to Florida anymore. And for the first time in his life, he must sometimes say no when relatives need money. It is not easy for a man who, after he got his degree, sent $25 every week to the next sibling in line to go to college.
But he is an insurance account agent with an office to run and a commission to earn at a time when people are not buying houses or cars, two of the biggest things people insure.
Since the first of the year, his business has been off 50 percent as the housing market in Atlanta has slowed. Last summer he had to lay off his entire office staff: a secretary and two other agents.
Now the shiny new desks sit empty in his gray-carpeted office, and he answers the phone, takes orders and messages himself.
So when relatives need help with the electric bill or the rent, he can't help them as he used to. One brother-in-law spent several nights in jail on a traffic violation because no one in the family could bail him out.
"I don't have it to give," said Mr. Giles, 43. "It takes everything we make to pay the bills. I have to dip into my own money to pay the office bills. Some bills go lacking as long as they can. We're borrowed out."
He is the third of 10 children born to textile workers in South Carolina, and even though his siblings are all college graduates and all working, they have limited resources just as he does. So he has no place to turn. "It's just me and whatever financial institution that will help me," Mr. Giles said.
 
Starting Late
 
Decades Behind In Prosperity
Jared Samples presumably went from working poor to middle class overnight when he won a seat on the Atlanta City Council last year. One of the first things he did when he got his first paycheck was to move out of the Perry Homes housing project where he grew up. The next thing he wants to do is get his mother out.
He is saving for the house he wants to buy for her, but he is finding that the $25,000 he makes as a full-time public servant doesn't go very far, especially when he still tries to give money to his nephew in college or a sister to pay her car insurance when he can.
He drives a 1975 Dodge. "My family knows I'm still poor," he said. "I might be able to loan somebody a little money, but I need my money back. We're four generations out of slavery and one generation out of the projects."
He knows he is starting from a deficit. "I'm working for my nephews and nieces," he said. "My life is pretty much set. I can work every day but I can't get but so far."
 
Waiting for the Century?
 Many economists say it will take much of the next century to close the gap between the security levels of the black and white middle class. "Blacks can try to do better than in the past and save up, but the best they can do is to try to provide an education for their children so that by the second or third generation, perhaps there will be parity," said William D. Bradford, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland who has written extensively on race and wealth. "I don't see anything in the next 20 years. We're looking at 40 to 60 years."
And many public policy analysts say that such an outcome will require continuing Government intervention. "Blacks are dependent on the Government opening doors and keeping those doors open," said Dr. Walter Allen, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Much is at stake for the entire country, sociologists say. "If the black middle class is not stable and secure, they will fall into the lower classes and not be able to pay their bills, their fair share of taxes, and will use a larger share of public services," Dr. Billingsly of the University of Maryland said.
Black people say they are doing what they can to help themselves. Betty Brown Chappell, a social worker and a doctoral candidate at the University of Chicago, remembers her tough freshman year at the University of Michigan, when she arrived on campus with not even enough money for books and food. She remembers how her father, a factory worker, sent what he had -- a $10 bill. She gave $5 of it to one sister in college, who then sent $2.50 to another sister in college.
Mrs. Chappell wanted things to be different for the next generation. So when her niece, Alea, was born 18 years ago, she bought $150 in savings bonds for her. Last September, Alea enrolled at the University of Michigan. The savings bonds had doubled in value. She used the money to buy her books.

HEADLINE: Traffic in Fake Documents Is Blamed For New Rise in Illegal Immigration

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Four years after a new immigration law brought about a steady decline in the number of illegal aliens caught crossing the southern border, the number has turned sharply upward as illegal aliens and those who help smuggle them have widely circumvented the law with counterfeit documents.
The 1986 law, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, sought to weaken the economic magnet that draws illegal aliens to the United States by prohibiting the employment of people who cannot document their immigration or citizenship status. The law was backed up with stiff fines on employers who hire illegal aliens. 
 But a growing number of scholars and policy makers have recently concluded that the law's deterrent effect was only temporary and that its impact has been rapidly wearing off this year.
 
'Just One More Hurdle'
 "Employer sanctions may have seemed a real barrier at first, but now they are just one more hurdle to overcome," said Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for United States-Mexican Studies at the University of California at San Diego. "We seemed to have turned a corner with that perception sometime last year, and the widespread use of fraudulent documents appears to be a major factor."
Before the law was enacted, detentions of people crossing the southern border reached more than 1.6 million a year, provoking the Reagan Administration to declare the border "out of control." After three years of steadily declining, the number detained rose to about 850,000 in the fiscal year that ended in September 1989.
Recently released statistics for the 12 months ending this September showed that more than 1 million illegal aliens were caught crossing the border, an increase of more than 22 percent over the previous year. Although the numbers are subject to varying interpretations, they are widely regarded as an indicator of the surreptitious human traffic across the border.
The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Gene McNary, said in a telephone interview that part of the increase in apprehensions was attributable to an increased law enforcement effort along the border. "That's one explanation," he said. "I don't believe it explains everything because we know that we've got more fraudulent documents and we know that we have more pressure because of the economic situation in Mexico."
 
Renewed Discussions on Policy
 In recent months discussions have begun in Congress, the immigration service and elsewhere in Washington over whether the 1986 law is fundamentally flawed or whether it simply needs to be enforced differently.
The rising figures on detentions are only one reason that sanctions against employers are coming under renewed scrutiny. Last March the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, issued a report finding that the sanctions had caused "a widespread pattern of discrimination" against people who look or sound like foreigners. Many employers admitted to being so confused about the law that they simply did not hire anyone who might be an alien.
For the people who police the border there is little doubt about where to find the major weakness of the 1986 law. Many of the aliens they apprehend carry it in their hip pockets or purses.
"We've been seeing the apprehension numbers going up, and at the same time we've been seeing more and more people carrying fraudulent documents," said Dale A. Musegades, chief agent for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector. "And the quality of the documents has been improving, too.
"It's no different than when we put manpower in one spot and they simply move someplace else. They've adapted to employer sanctions and found a way around it."
 
Adaptation to New Requirements
 For the most part the sanctions against employers, usually in the form of fines, have been imposed when the immigration service believes that an employer knowingly and repeatedly hired illegal aliens.
Since the law allows workers to use 17 types of documents to prove their legitimate status and an employer need not verify the authenticity of the papers, "an illegal can present a good set of fake ID and an employer will be fairly blameless in hiring him," Mr. Musegades said.
As a measure of how sophisticated the market for fraudulent papers has become, officials pointed to a counterfeiting operation uncovered in Harlingen, Tex., earlier this month. Joseph De La Cruz, an agent in the Border Patrol station in Laredo, said a laser scanning device had been used to produce nearly perfect copies of several kinds of documents, including Social Security cards that sold for $20 apiece in bulk.
 
Counterfeits in Quantity
 The size of the market was demonstrated by the seizure of single cache of more than 25,000 fraudulent documents in Houston last January, Mr. De La Cruz said.
The increased use of fraudulent documents to circumvent sanctions against employers has renewed a longstanding debate over whether the Government needs some means to check the identities of all the people living in this country.
"I don't think that we can give up on employer sanctions yet, but we better start realizing that eventually we are going to have to face up to the document issue," said Doris Meissner, an immigration specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a research institute in Washington.
In the initial debate over the 1986 law, Congress overwhelmingly rejected national identity documents as a step toward totalitarian controls. This year more modest proposals encountered equally fierce resistance.
 
Resistance From Many Quarters
 For example, there have been numerous proposals for some kind of telephone verification system that would allow employers to check the validity of an identity document just as credit cards are often checked during a transaction. But so far, the Bush Administration has opposed such widespread public use of Government data.
Meanwhile, some important lawmakers have begun to question whether the sweeping program to revise immigration policy that began with the 1986 law is suffering a major setback just as it reaches its conclusion.
By sharply reducing illegal immigration the 1986 law was intended to lay the groundwork for the measure adopted by Congress just last month, which increased legal immigration by about 40 percent with most of the new visas going to people valued for their job skills.
During the debate on the most recent bill, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, who helped draft both immigration laws, pointed to the increased number of apprehensions as showing problems with the program. "We must face the fact that we have not yet closed that back door," he said. "In fact, we are still leaving the back door open while considering prying open the front door much wider."
At a Border Patrol detention office along the Rio Grande in El Paso, sanctions against employers seemed to be accepted as a fact of life by the men and women who were brought in one day this month after being caught crossing the river illegally.
Smiling and rubbing the dark stubble on his cheeks, a young man who identified himself as Carlos Garcia, said, "I know about the law, but it doesn't bother me." Waiting in a holding cell with about a dozen others to be sent back across the bridge to Mexico, he said that he could not remember how many border crossings he had made but that there had been dozens. This was the third time he had been caught, he said.
Whenever he went north, he said, he always managed to find work of some kind. "If you have friends you can mow lawns or something like that, and if you want something better you buy an ID to show the boss," he said.
 
Numbers Open to Speculation
 Just how many people are coming through the back door is a subject of much analysis and speculation.
There is no way to count the number of people who cross the border surreptitiously, and the number of people caught can fluctuate because of many factors aside from the actual number illegally crossing, including changes in staffing levels by the Border Patrol.
Studies published this year by two research organizations, the Rand Corporation and the Urban Institute, concluded from analyses of the apprehension figures that sanctions against employers could be credited with reducing the number of illegal entries by roughly 20 percent to 25 percent in first three years after enactment.
"Since then, and especially this year, we've seen the trend change and now the flow seems to be increasing," said Frank D. Bean, a sociologist who helped conduct the Urban Institute Study. "This calls into question whether sanctions have had any permanent impact."
But Representative Bruce A. Morrison, Democrat of Connecticut, who sponsored the House version of this year's immigration law, was reluctant to draw any conclusions from the recent rise in apprehensions. "It is hard to tell whether changes in those numbers reflect changes in reality or changes in policy at the I.N.S.," he said. "They are too easy to manipulate."
Nonetheless, Mr. Morrison questioned the effectiveness of the 1986 law. "It's not easy to know the potential of employer sanctions because they've never been effectively enforced by the I.N.S.," he said.

U.S. Is Reported To Win Support For Use Of Force

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials and foreign diplomats said today that the United States has mustered enough support in the United Nations Security Council to gain approval of a resolution that would authorize the use of military force against Iraq if it did not withdraw its forces from Kuwait by the end of January.
The final wording of the resolution has not been decided, but the officials said it would be debated and approved on Thursday. Officials indicated that the resolution was unlikely to authorize "military force" in those words, but would opt for some other formulation like "all necessary means." 
 A senior United States official said today that the Bush Administration would interpret such language as authorizing the use of force, just as it did after the Aug. 25 resolution authorizing a naval blockade of Iraq.
 
U.S. Seeks Jan. 1 Deadline
 The Bush Administration is pushing for a Jan. 1 deadline but diplomats cautioned tonight that no final decision has been made. They said the Council may end up setting the deadline toward the end of the month to allow more time for last-minute attempts to promote a peaceful settlement.
The resolution, if passed, would represent only a partial victory for the Administration. While authorizing force and warning President Saddam Hussein that Iraq must leave Kuwait without conditions, it would also give opponents of a military solution more time to make a case against an attack in gulf. There is already opposition to military force in Congress and among some of Washington's Arab allies ; anti-war demonstrations have also begun to crop up around the United States.
In Washington, the Bush Administration stepped up its effort to raise concern among Americans about Iraq's ability to develop nuclear weapons, saying Baghdad might be able to produce a crude nuclear device within a year. [Page A13.]
 
Strenuous Lobbying Effort
 The United States gained promises of support for the resolution as the result of a strenuous lobbying of Security Council members by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and repeated public statements by President Bush that, while not directly threatening war, emphasized the need to consider the use of force against Iraq. The Administration had hoped for unanimous support among the five permanent members of the Security Council for a resolution authorizing the use of force without linking it to a warning that would in effect delay military action against Iraq.
What it got was agreement to the new resolution from three of the other four permanent Security Council members with the power to veto decisions -- Britain, France and the Soviet Union. The fifth, China, said it will not block the resolution but has yet to decide whether to vote in favor or abstain.
A further 6 of the Council's 10 rotating members -- Canada, Finland, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Zaire and Romania -- have also indicated they will vote in favor of the proposed resolution, ensuring that it will get at least 10 votes.
Four other rotating members -- Malaysia, Colombia, Cuba and Yemen -- remain undecided, American officials said. But they added that Colombia, and perhaps Malaysia too, may well end up voting in favor, though Cuba and Yemen will probably vote against or abstain.
 
Warning for Baghdad
 Approval of the resolution would enable the Bush Administration to wind up its monthlong presidency of the Security Council with a partial victory that sends Baghdad a serious warning and demonstrates the cohesion of the international alliance the Bush Administration has built up against President Hussein in the gulf.
The Security Council has approved 10 resolutions so far during the gulf crisis, declaring Kuwait's annexation null and void and imposing far-reaching economic sanctions on Iraq. So far all of these resolutions have won the support of at least 13 Council members, with Yemen and Cuba the only 2 to vote against or abstain.
Approval of the new resolution would mark only the second occasion in the history of the United Nations that it has agreed to invoke the provisions of its charter allowing the organization to reverse aggression by military force if economic embargoes and other less forceful actions fail. The first was the series of decisions in 1950 that were taken in response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea.
The Security Council has also twice approved the use of force to impose an economic blockade against a country deemed in breach of the charter, authorizing Britain to cut oil supplies to Rhodesia's breakaway white seccessionist Government in 1968 and allowing naval enforcement of the trade embargo it imposed on Iraq after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
 
Baker Will Preside
 Mr. Baker, who will preside over the Thursday meeting, announced his intention to convene the Security Council early this morning in Houston. He had just returned from lightning visits to Colombia to garner support for the resolution as well as to Los Angeles for similar talks with Malaysia's Foreign Minister, Abu Hassan Omar.
Mr. Baker said during his return flight, "I think the Council will want to explore a resolution that would make it very clear that members could utilize all necessary means after a certain date to implement the previous resolutions."
"We're talking about a resolution that would lay the political foundation for a possible use of force," Mr. Baker added. "The clear message of such a resolution to Saddam Hussein would be that there is still a chance to resolve this matter peacefully and politically within that time frame. We think this offers the very best hope for a peaceful and political settlement."
 
Soviets Forced Delay
 During all the Administration's consultations, the Soviet Union has not waivered in its insistence that Iraq must obey the Security Council and get out of Kuwait without any preconditions. But the Soviets have also appeared hesitant about the use of force, repeatedly stressing the immense and incalculable dangers inherent in a Middle East war and pleading for more time to find a peaceful resolution.
As a result, diplomats say the United States has been forced to agree to a delay of about two months before resorting to force in order to give Mr. Hussein more time for reflection and other countries a last chance to persuade him to surrender Kuwait without a fight.
Officials say this was not the Administration's preferred approach because the delay gives the anti-war movement in the United States and elsewhere more time to organize and also helps those in Congress who believe that only they can authorize the use of American soldiers in battle.
China has appeared even more reluctant to envision the use of force, repeatedly saying that it believes all international disputes should be resolved peacefully. But American officials say Beijing has given assurances it will not block the kind of resolution the United States is proposing. They also say that China came under heavy Soviet pressure to vote for it at a hurried meeting last week in northwestern China between the Foreign Ministers of the two countries.
 
No Agreement on Text
 While a majority of Security Council members now favor a new resolution authorizing force after a further delay, American officials warn that there is still no agreement on the actual text. Representatives of the five permanent Council members met in New York today to discuss exactly what the resolution might say.
Officials say the draft resolution is unlikely to use the phrase "military force," in large measure to avoid Chinese objections. But Mr. Baker spoke of the Council allowing countries to "use all necessary means" to expel Iraq from Kuwait.
The Council also avoided any direct reference to force on Aug. 25 when it approved Resolution 665, which allows countries with naval forces in the gulf to intercept and board cargo vessels trying to break the trade embargo against Iraq.
The resolution is also expected to contain a last appeal to the Iraqi President to reach a peaceful settlement on the basis of previous Security Council resolutions.

HEADLINE: California, the Congressional Giant, Has the Numbers but Not the Solidarity

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
If numbers were all that mattered, the most powerful delegation in the House of Representatives would be California's.
With 45 members, and the expectation of seven more after Congressional districts are redrawn for 1992, the California contingent would become the largest state delegation in American history, holding a 19-seat advantage over its closest rival, New York. 
 But as California Representatives are the first to note, their collective clout may be more myth than reality. Poised for what would seem to be an opportunity to dominate Congress well into the next century, they see their delegation hobbled by ideological and regional divisions that threaten to significantly dilute its numerical strength.
"Some people would argue that we are the giant easily tied down by the Lilliputians," said Representative Vic Fazio, a Democrat from the Sacramento area, who will be the next chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
 
'At Each Other's Throats'
 Representative Jerry Lewis, a Republican from Redlands who heads the House Republican Conference, put it more bluntly. "We are a self-neutered giant," he said. "We represent over 10 percent of the House, and it doesn't matter what the issue is, we are constantly at each other's throats."
Politically, the delegation is as eclectic as the state itself, so profoundly split that Democrats and Republicans no longer even try to hold the kind of regular bipartisan meetings that unify other large delegations like those of Illinois, Texas or New York. California's members run the gamut from ultra-liberal Democrats like Ronald V. Dellums of Berkeley, who just filed suit to prevent the Bush Administration from going to war in the Persian Gulf without Congress's consent, to ultra-conservative Republicans like William E. Dannemeyer of Orange County, who argues that homosexual conduct is a sin and that AIDS victims "emit spores" that can spread the disease.
Eternally baffled by the politics of a state that could produce such extremes, the former House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill of Massachusetts, used to shake his head and refer to the Californians simply as "the distinguished members from Disneyland."
 
Success With Quake Aid
 Measured in simple terms of bringing home the bacon, the Californians worry that they do not deliver what their numbers should entitle them to.
Although the delegation pulled off a stunning performance last year in ramming more than $3.5 billion in disaster aid through the House and Senate after the Bay Area earthquake, that kind of effort is the exception.
Three years ago, a national earthquake monitoring center, for which California would have made a logical home, went instead to Buffalo. And Representative Lewis is still fuming over the failure of California to make a serious bid for the Superconducting Supercollider, the research center that went to Texas.
In both of those cases, Mr. Lewis said, the inability of the delegation to come together was compounded by a curious sort of indifference to Washington from state politicians and constituents back home. "People in California don't think about Congress or Washington," he said. "It's more than just 3,000 miles that separates us."
 
Eyes Toward Home
 Applying broader criteria, like influence over national policy and the ability to shape major legislation, the Californians are well placed. Members have held leadership positions or had quiet influence on panels that handle health policy, immigration, transportation, appropriations and the budget.
But there are significant gaps. There is no Californian of national stature in Congress who speaks on issues like military and foreign affairs, trade or tax policy. And California's Senators, unlike those from other large states, have historically been less oncerned with making national names for themselves than tending to their constituencies.
"It depends how you judge them," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior associate at the Claremont Graduate School's Center for Politics and Policy in Southern California. "They are in many ways very responsive to their California constituencies, and it happens that those are not necessarily the areas their colleagues in Washington perceive to be the most glitzy."
The delegation's divisions are by no means simply partisan. Democrats have feuded over such seemingly clear cut state issues as taxes on the wine industry and Federal water subsidies.
 
Ideological Divisions
 On the Republican side, the divisions are ideological. Because of disagreements over the budget, for instance, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a conservative Republican from Torrance, plans to vote against his fellow Californian, Mr. Lewis, in a contest for chairmanship of the House Republican conference next week.
Conceding that such a vote might cost the state the third-ranking slot in the House Republican hierarchy, Mr. Rohrabacher said, "When it comes down to philosophical compatibility versus pure California interests, my instinct is to go with compatibility."
Representative Robert T. Matsui, a Sacramento Democrat who serves on the Ways and Means Committee, often finds himself torn among the state's conflicting ideologies and competing urban, agricultural and high technology interests.
"I think the wise members outside the delegation know our level of incompetence and know how to exploit it," he said. "It's easy to divide us."
 
Districts Are Split
 Even the districts are divided. Representative Douglas H. Bosco, a Democrat whose district in Northern California includes some of the most spectacular forest land in the nation, is fond of explaining this to colleagues: "All of my constituents like trees." he said. "The problem is, 50 percent like them vertically and the other 50 percent like them horizontally."
Mr. Bosco was defeated earlier this month by Frank Riggs, a Republican, putting the delegation lineup in the House at 26 Democrats and 19 Republicans for the next Congress. California's two Senate seats, occupied by Alan Cranston, a Democrat, and Pete Wilson, a Republican who was just elected Governor, have been split between the parties since 1977.
Mr. Wilson's seat is known in California as "the crazy seat," having changed hands six times since 1958, and Mr. Wilson's departure will leave the state with yet another freshman in the Senate, denying California a chance to build seniority on a major committee.
The situation in the Senate is likely to get worse. Mr. Wilson will name a successor to fill his seat until 1992, and whoever is elected to it then to fill out Mr. Wilson's unfinished term will have to run again in 1994. Mr. Cranston's seat will also be vacant in 1992. The ailing Senator, currently under an ethics investigation on charges of seeking favors for a troubled California savings and loan instutition, has decided not to run for re-election and to step down from his position as Democratic whip.
 
Different Kind of Clout
 Representative Thomas J. Downey, a New York Democrat who affectionately describes his liberal California colleagues as the "bran muffin and grapefruit set," agrees that they are not as politically adept as their Eastern cousins. But he finds the hand wringing about a lack of California clout amusing.
"I look at New York now as the aging British Empire of American politics," he said with a sigh. "We are still the repository of culture and finance, thank God, but we have to rely less on numbers than on cunning, intelligence, subtlety and inveiglement."
As for the Californians, he said, they should relax a little. "Their state is so big, so rich and so economically powerful, that they don't have to exercise their political muscle to be felt."

Arafat Stresses Linkage in Settling Gulf Crisis

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUNIS, Nov. 22

 BODY:
The Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat, has said he strongly supports President Saddam Hussein's assertions that a withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait must be tied to an overall settlement of conflicts in the region, including the 40-year-old Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Mr. Arafat, who left on one of his frequent visits to Baghdad just after being interviewed early Thursday, said that based on what he knows about the Iraqi armed forces, a war would be so devastating that it would last a long time, cause tens of thousands of casualties, and leave the region in economic and political instability. 
 For this reason, he said, there was no real alternative to negotiations between Mr. Hussein and those nations opposing his occupation of Kuwait.
Mr. Arafat, whose support of Iraq has been strongly denounced by Saudi Arabia, its Arab gulf allies and Egypt, dismissed predictions of a lasting and deep rupture between the P.L.O. and pro-Western Arab nations, saying the disputes would dissapear with the settlement of the crisis.
"We have had many splits before in the Arab camp," he said. "This is not the first crisis for the Arab nation, and it will not be the last."
 
Few Regrets About U.S.
 He also expressed few regrets over the effect of the crisis on the P.L.O.'s relationship with the United States, the leader of the military forces arrayed against Iraq. He noted that the United States had ended its dialogue with the P.L.O. even before the gulf crisis.
In an interview that began after midnight and lasted 90 minutes, he insisted that the resolution of the crisis could not be achieved without a simultaneous settlement of the Arab-Israeli issue, saying the two have become inextricably linked in the minds of most Arabs and in the view of many foreign governments.
"China, Japan, Germany, the European Community and even President Bush have said so," Mr. Arafat said in a reference to the Mr. Bush's assertions early in the crisis that the world must eventually address the issue of the Palestinians.
But he acknowledged that his stand has cost the Palestinians and his organization dearly. He estimated the total cost to Palestinians at $10 billion, including savings lost by about 400,000 Palestinians who lived and worked in Kuwait and the cutoff of financial aid to the P.L.O. from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, which have been angered by the P.L.O.'s support of Iraq.
 
Principle Is Defended
 Mr. Arafat said his positions were a matter of principle that could not be changed in return for "a few coins or a few petrodollars." He dismissed talk by his Arab opponents about putting pressure on the P.L.O. to remove him as a leader of the organization, saying with a faint smile that "it is our people who chose, not anyone else" and adding that some of these Arab leaders' hold on power is less sure than his own.
He argued that a war would produce such huge casualties among Arabs in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East that it would lead to the overthrow of many an Arab government. "There is not a single Arab regime that can govern or exist over the bodies and skeletons of other Arabs," he said.
Contradicting assertions by American military officials as well as military experts in Saudi Arabia and Egypt that a war with Iraq will be quickly and decisively won by the better-armed allied forces, Mr. Arafat said Iraqi troops could withstand an assault and fight on for many months, perhaps as long as three years. He said he based that assessment on his knowledge of the Iraqi Army's armaments and ammunition, including "weapons of mass destruction,"
He placed the largest responsibility for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on the Kuwaiti ruling family, the Sabahs. He said that days before the invasion, he repeatedly urged the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, to show some flexibility toward Iraq's demands that Baghdad's $11 billion debt to Kuwait be forgiven, and toward territorial concessions along the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border.
 
His Advice to the Kuwaitis
 In a moment of self-criticism, Mr. Arafat said that in trying to persuade the Kuwaitis to compromise, he told the Emir not to become entrapped by what he described as "useless and meaningless" United Nations and Arab League resolutions against Mr. Hussein's claims.
"I told them, 'Learn from us, the Palestinians,' " Mr. Arafat said. "We have so many resolutions and decisions, but we still don't have a solution. I told them, 'Don't be fooled by resolutions and decisions. Go for the solution if there is a chance for a solution.' "
He said the P.L.O. was pursuing an eight-point settlement that it has proposed to all the nations involved in the gulf crisis. It includes a partial withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, negotiations on a financial settlement between Iraq, Kuwait, the P.L.O. and other Arab countries affected by the crisis and the replacement of foreign troops in the region by Arab troops.
He stressed that his plan put Palestinian demands for a settlement with Israel on the same footing as the United Nations demands for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
"One thing has to be understood clearly," he said. "We, the Palestinians, are not just a number in the equation. We are the difficult number. There can be no solution in the gulf crisis without a solution to the Palestinian problem."
 
Always the 'Principal Issue'
 He added that when it comes to the Middle East, "the Palestinian question has always been the principal issue" and that it "will remain the principal issue" after the gulf crisis.
Mr. Arafat said that given the ominous consequences of a war, there was little choice but to avoid one.
"This war will take place, however, in the most strategic and vital oil region in the world," he said. "So from the moment the first bullet is fired, there will be an economic panic. The barrel of oil will reach $100 or more. You know that oil wells and facilities on both sides will be damaged. That is in addition to the use of weapons of total destruction. And Israel, which is unquestionably a part of the plan, will be involved."
"Victory in this war will be ashes in the mouth of the victor," he said.

HEADLINE: Ulster County Warns Albany of a Tax Revolt

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

 BODY:
In bucolic Ulster County, some 90 miles north of New York City, there are rumblings of a tax revolt. The stirrings began three weeks ago, when the county unveiled its proposed 1991 budget -- and a proposed county property-tax rise of 82 percent.
For many of Ulster County's 168,000 residents, who have already endured a 42 percent tax rise this fiscal year, the proposal is a sign that it is time to draw the line. Groups have organized and petitions have been circulated to cut back the county budget. And some are talking of spreading the revolt, by taking the message to other counties in the mid-Hudson Valley. 
 Members of the Ulster County Legislature, who are already feeling the heat, say the anger should be directed farther up the Hudson -- to Albany. Like local government officials around the country, they say they are caught between soaring social-service costs for required programs and dwindling aid from the Federal Government and from states that see their own revenues falling.
"The first thing we're going to do in Ulster is cut the hell out of the budget because no way can we come in with an 82 percent tax increase," said Danny Alfonso, the County Legislature's finance chairman. "That's by Dec. 10. The second thing we're going to do is get together with leaders from Dutchess, Putnam, Sullivan, Columbia, Greene and Orange to put together a list" of demands on the state that will be presented in January.
Then, said Mr. Alfonso, the seven counties plan to sue the Governor. "Every time we have a public meeting, everybody says sue the state," he said. "So we're going to sue the state."
For residents already hard-pressed by the recent hard times, the tax increases, no matter whose fault, seem too much to bear. Joe and Mary Ann Marchetti, who bought a $65,000 handyman special in Kingston five years ago, paid $2,000 in county property taxes this year.
"And we're lucky," Mrs. Marchetti said. "We know some people paying $5,000 and $6,000. People talk about moving away, but with the economy the way it is, who are you going to get to buy your house?"
Instead of moving, last week at a public meeting with 33 county legislators, the Marchettis announced they had gathered 200 families -- and were gathering 200 others -- to plan a tax boycott if any substantial tax increase is passed.
 
Reagan's Cuts in Federal Aid
 In some ways, the situation in Ulster is like that faced by counties around the state. But none other faces such a steep tax increase -- in large part, officials say, because the county did not raise the tax rate for nine years before last year's rise, and the current rate of $3.50 per $1,000 of assessed value is still low by statewide standards. Neighboring Dutchess County, for instance, has a rate of $6.18 per $1,000. The projected 82 percent tax increase would give Ulster a rate of about $6.37 per $1,000.
In Ulster, as in counties throughout the state and the country, officials attribute much of their current woes to deep cuts in Federal aid for social programs. The cuts, which started during President Ronald Reagan's administration, sent state governments reeling, and the pain, they say, eventually landed lower down.
G. Thomas Goodman, a spokesman for the National Association of Counties in Washington, says the problem threatens to grow as state and Federal governments continue to pass laws mandating services, mainly in health, human services and environmental protection, without providing money for them.
"The counties are facing demands for new services from their residents but are limited in the kinds of taxes they can levy to pay for these services," Mr. Goodman said. "And all this is taking place as the nation's economy weakens and the resistance to new taxes by voters grows."
In New York State, the picture is almost certain to get bleaker. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has proposed $1 billion in cuts. They would reduce outlays to county governments by 10 percent, including cuts in revenue-sharing programs, school aid and Medicaid, foster care and other social services the state dictates.
The upshot, said Edwin Crawford, chief lobbyist for the state's 62 counties, is that the state's local governments will start cutting costs by eliminating youth recreation programs, offices serving the elderly, and other non-mandated local services.
 
Parks, Roads, Arts
 "The Governor has come around -- he's saying that mandates have to be curbed," Mr. Crawford said. "But until then, what we'll see evolving in the next few years is that parks and playgrounds will close, roads won't be rebuilt, arts will suffer."
Even before the Governor's proposed cuts, localities around the state were already facing hard times.
In New York City, where Medicaid expenditures are over $1 billion, residents face a slew of increased costs, from new sales and property taxes to subway fare and toll increases. The city stands to lose between $100 million and $180 million in state funds if the Governor's proposals are passed.
Suffolk County, the largest county outside of New York City, with 1.4 million residents, has already cut 2,500 workers from the payrolls in the last three years, is cutting 200 more next year and may have to cut even more, said County Executive Patrick Halpin.
 
Most Spending Is Mandated
 Sullivan County's 90,000 residents, more than half of whom are over age 55, face a 61 percent tax rise next year, largely because of increased costs in Medicaid, foster care and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, said the Sullivan County Administrator, Paul Rouis. "More than 55 percent of our budget goes toward these state-mandated programs," he said. "I don't think we can absorb much more."
In Ulster County, Administrator William Darwak said up to 70 percent of the $151 million budget proposed for 1991 -- up from the $136 million approved for 1990 -- would pay for services mandated by the state. Next year's budget calls for $15 million in Medicaid spending, almost $5 million more than the budget dictated for 1990 -- and about $3 million more than the county spent. The county budgeted Medicaid at $190,000 a week and has spent $350,000. It is also spending $30 million in mental health services and more than $3 million in related services for children.
But though the projected budget increase of $15 million is only 11 percent, the county faces an 82 percent tax rate increase because its revenues have been dropping as well. County officials say there is a shortfall of $2 million this year in sales-tax collections and a $1.8 million drop in property-tax revenues. Federal revenue-sharing aid of $1.8 million ended in 1987, and state revenue-sharing of $750,000 ended in 1989.
"New York State is the Cadillac of social services," Mr. Alfonso said. "Other states have Volkswagens. We're getting more people moving in for more services. If Medicaid wasn't in our budget, we'd be facing a 15 percent tax decrease instead of an 82 percent tax increase."
 
Arts Funds Frozen and Falling
 County legislators have sworn to keep many county programs, including a 280-bed infirmary for the elderly that will cost $5 million this year and a county jail at capacity with 160 inmates, who each cost $75 a day. But the Unison Learning Center in New Paltz, which holds concerts, classes and arts workshops for about 6,000 county residents each year, is threatened. The arts center stopped receiving county money two years ago; recently, it was told by the state that funds were being frozen and would probably be cut, said its director, Stuart Bigley.
Members of the Ulster County Legislature, who have held three public meetings since they outlined the new budget, are well aware that voters are worried and fed up.
"The taxpayers are extremely angry," said Gerald Benjamin, the county's Senate majority leader. He said that in the last public meeting, held on Tuesday, 500 taxpayers told the Legislature they believed the proposed 82 percent figure was a ploy to make an actual increase of 40 or 50 percent more palatable. "People said it was a cynical manipulation," said Mr. Benjamin. "That's very distressing and indicative of the public view that we're dishonest. But in my view, this is the tightest budget we've proposed in nine years."
Ulster County residents say there is a new activism born of taxpayers' disgust. Two taxpayers associations have formed in the past few months, each with more than 200 members, and leaders of the two groups have formed a countywide taxpayers alliance, designed to help others in the county's 20 towns form taxpayers associations.
On their agenda is a mock Boston Tea Party on Saturday at the Kingston waterfront. "It's symbolic," said Joe Marchetti, who organized the tea party. "But the point is to tell legislators we're tired of runaway tax hikes, bureacracy and abuse."
The head of the Kingston Taxpayers Association, Gordon Ross Webb, said: "Our point is that no one can force a legislator to vote for a budget increase. We keep hearing mandates, mandates, mandates, but there is an awful lot of waste in Ulster County. There are 33 legislators. If they don't give us what we want, we have the power to change things with our votes."

HEADLINE: Seeing the World Through the Eyes of 7-Year-Olds

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Michael Apted, the English film maker who documented the lives of 14 children in his highly praised series "7 Up" more than a quarter of a century ago, was resting in a second-grader's chair, looking bemused. A brand new "7 Up" was revving up around him, as a crew of seven film makers toiled under the direction of Phil Joanou. They were adjusting lights and loading the camera in Room 308 at Public School 97 on East Houston Street in Manhattan, as everyone waited for the first 7-year-old to arrive.
The 48-year-old Mr. Apted is the director of such feature films as "Gorillas in the Mist," "Gorky Park" and "Coal Miner's Daughter," but he is the producer of "Sevenup in America," the Yankee version of "7 Up." That's why he could afford to relax and observe Mr. Joanou at work. 
 "Philip, this is day 1 of a life's work, you know," said Mr. Apted, gray-haired, tweedy and avuncular.
"I know, I know," said Mr. Joanou.
"And," Mr. Apted continued, "I think you'll outlive me on this one!"
They both laughed. In the English series, initiated in 1964, Mr. Apted first filmed his group of youngsters when they were 7 years old and filmed them again when they were 14, 21 and 28.
 
The American Version
 The new American version -- whose title is spelled "Sevenup" so that audiences "won't confuse the film with the soft drink," Mr. Joanou said -- will follow the original's scenario. Mr. Joanou is interviewing more than 20 7-year-old boys and girls from disparate ethnic, racial, economic and social backgrounds in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Lincoln, Neb., and Dublin, Ga.
Six of the children are from wealthy families; six are poor, including one from a homeless family; the rest have middle-class backgrounds. The subjects are white, black, Hispanic and Asian; they are Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish. One child is Vietnamese and two others -- one from El Salvador, and one from Mexico -- do not speak English.
The American series is ultimately intended for theatrical release at the 28-year stage, following the pattern of the English series. Mr. Apted's "28 Up" grossed more than $1 million, he said, unusual for a documentary. Until the year 2011 -- when the young Americans will have reached age 28 -- the series will appear every seven years as an hourlong television special. CBS , which is co-producing the series with Grenada Television in England, will air the "Sevenup" special next March or April.
 
'Reality of Children's Lives'
 Why film a new version? "It seems to me that this is a rich and valuable way to look at the history of a country," Mr. Apted said. "At worst, it's a social document, and at best it's a powerful film that gains strength from its portrayal of the reality of children's lives.
"These films are really a mix of instant history, sociology and soap opera. We'll try to build a series that looks at the issues that will be important to America in the future."
Mr. Apted said that the original "7 Up," for which he was the line producer at the age of 22 in 1964, "was an accident, a one-shot," he said. "Only later did its immense popularity give us the idea to go back at seven-year intervals. If we'd known that, we'd have been more careful about choosing our 7-year-olds in the first place, and would have asked them more questions. On this series, we can finally do it right."
Doing it right, to Mr. Apted, means having a cross-cultural control group for the American series. Grenada has set loose a Russian documentary crew that is now shooting 7-year-olds in the Soviet Union. In reflecting the momentous changes there, over time, they will also serve as foils for their American counterparts.
 
Tracking Down the Originals
 Mr. Apted has not lost track of his original 14 subjects, however. In December he'll begin shooting "35 Up," a new documentary on his English cast of characters as they reach the age of 35. It will be shown on British television in May, along with Mr. Joanou's documentary on the American 7-year-olds, as well as the gestating project on the Russian 7-year-olds.
In Room 308, Mr. Joanou was going over lists of questions when his first subject bounced through the door, a streetwise whirlwind of energy wearing a Super Bowl Shuffle T-shirt. "Hello, Luis!" Mr. Joanou said.
"O.K., let's go!" said Luis -- who, like all "7 Up" children since 1964, is publicly identified only by first name.
Mr. Joanou led Luis across the scuffed red linoleum to a battered second-grader's desk, and as the camera rolled, the director asked him questions about his school, his family, his neighborhood and the life he leads as the child of a homeless family.
Despite the hot lights and the crowd of technicians around him, Luis answered Mr. Joanou's questions volubly, displaying impatience at times, prodding his questioner, "Next? Next?" When the camera stopped rolling to reload, he trained his huge, canny eyes at Mr. Joanou and said, "So -- how was I?" Mr. Joanou said he was great.
The next morning the crew traveled to an utterly different setting: the elegant precincts of the Nightingale-Bamford School off Park Avenue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The subjects, dressed in pressed uniforms and crisp white blouses, were three lively second-graders named Lucy, Kate and Alexis. They sat on a beige couch between blue accent pillows. A blue-and-white Oriental covered the floor.
 
7-Year-Old Wisdom
 Though they were just as much at ease before the camera as Luis, the girls' mode of expression reflected their upbringing: "Some nannies, I just wouldn't leave my child alone with," said 7-year-old Lucy, when asked about her future. "You have to be careful."
Mr. Joanou (whose name is pronounced Joe-ON-oh), is the director of "State of Grace," which starred Sean Penn, Gary Oldman and Ed Harris in a tale of Irish-American gangsters in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. His previous feature was "Three O'Clock High," but the film that recommended him to Mr. Apted was the documentary "U2 Rattle and Hum."
"I chose Phil not only because he's an accomplished film maker, but also because I know he'll be around for the next 30 years," said Mr. Apted. "He's 28, so he gets on well with the 7-year-olds and can grow old gracefully with them."
Mr. Apted also likes the idea "that Phil has a feature-film career, too," he said.
"Because the way things are going these days," he added, "a documentary career can be a frail reed indeed, and you never know whether documentary directors will give up. I wanted Phil to be in the business three decades from now."
 
'Kids Think It's Fun'
 The children of "Sevenup" and their parents will not be paid for their contribution to the film. Parents have agreed to participate "because they're proud of their kids and the kids think it's fun," said Vicky Bippart, the film's line producer. "But it's entirely up to them if they want to participate in the future documentaries."
Two of Mr. Apted's original 14 children dropped out of the filming in "28 Up," although they had participated at the 14- and 21-year intervals. Mr. Apted said he hoped they'd be back in the fold for the 35-year documentary.
The original English series focused on the disparities of the English class system, as played out in the children's lives. Although Mr. Joanou said he believed that America had its own class system, "I'm not going to impose an editorial point of view going in," he said.
"I'd like to present these children honestly, and let the film's themes surface in a less structured way," he added.
As Mr. Joanou looks ahead, he said he hoped he could find the emotional distance from his captivating subjects, "to be able to observe these kids as they go through life changes and dislocations, and still remain dispassionate."
"That's just essential to the project," he said.
"I think that '28 Up' was one of the greatest documentaries ever made," said Mr. Joanou. "It's going to be very difficult to live up to that." He smiled. "But I've got 21 years to get good at it."

HEADLINE: India's Hindus Try to Right a 400-Year Wrong;
Structural Reforms

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Among the varieties of leadership available in India, it is true that V. P. Singh, who has resigned as Prime Minister, was the most deserving to lead the country ("A Test of Principles in India," editorial, Nov. 8). However, his failings go beyond the issues you discuss.
V. P. Singh came to office on the specific promise of unearthing certain cases of kickbacks involving the Government of Rajiv Gandhi and a few overseas companies. But all such cases were conveniently relegated to the background in the intense jockeying for power.
Mr. Singh's revival of a dormant, ineffectual proposed "reservation-quota system" is not restricted to "low-caste Hindus," as you state. It was broadened to include the "other backward castes," many of whom are politically, socially and economically affluent.
This has become a very sensitive issue, leading dozens of youths to commit immolation in disgust. How would decision makers in this country respond if positions under affirmative action plans were usurped by the sons and daughters of a David Dinkins or a Douglas Wilder? V. P. Singh was not prepared to concede many angularities developed over the years in the reservation-quota system.
However shrewd and scheming, Mr. Singh was a politician with a relatively clean record. People had expected him to strike at the roots of the problems afflicting India.
Apart from economic reforms, India urgently requires structural reforms, mostly electoral-judicial and administrative-legislative. If applied firmly, these reforms could have taken care of the temple-mosque controversy and the conflict-ridden states.
How can a leader of the governing party resolve basic questions, sometimes involving unpopular measures, if he fears forces opposed to him within his party (the dissidents), in collaboration with the opposition, will topple his Government in a couple of months? This ailment is going to be endemic to the world's largest democracy.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Democracy in the Way?

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
As President Bush intensifies the threat of war on Iraq, we are hearing complaints that criticism of that policy spoils its chance of success. Saddam Hussein would take the threat more seriously, that is, if Americans would silently support it.
The President himself is said to have complained about Senate critics of his turn toward war. The Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees open hearings on policy in the Persian Gulf this week, and the Administration is unenthusiastic about that. 
 The case against open debate of the war policy has been made with candor by a defense specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Barry R. Posen. Writing in The Boston Globe, Professor Posen said:
"Since the President cannot want war, his purpose must be to frighten Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait. This is coercive diplomacy, and its success depends on the ability of the United States to persuade Saddam that the coalition has the capability and the will to recapture Kuwait.
"Unfortunately, the multiple voices of American democracy make this very difficult. . . . Debate can only reduce the odds of success."
In other words, democracy is inconvenient. It is a familiar lament, heard at many points in American history. Is it true?
President Bush's war-like rhetoric is no doubt intended to frighten Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait without war. The democratic leaders who visited the gulf over Thanksgiving, the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, and Speaker Thomas Foley, came back saying that the war talk was still just that: talk, not a decision to attack.
But it is not only talk. Threats are empty unless there is an intention to carry them out if talk fails.
When Mr. Bush early this month ordered up to 200,000 more Americans to the gulf, he moved into a scenario that must involve a real possibility of war. The huge U.S. force cannot stay in the gulf indefinitely. If "coercive diplomacy" does not move Saddam Hussein within a few months, there will be mounting pressure to use that force.
The President had to know that he was setting out on the path to war when he decided to raise the troop commitment to such a high level. He had to weigh fateful questions.
What was wrong with the previous policy of grinding Iraq down by economic sanctions? Was there doubt that Americans, or our allies, would have the patience for a long siege?
How would a war be fought? How many American casualties could be expected? What vital U.S. interest would be vindicated?
What would be the consequences of a war? How stable would pro-Western Arab governments prove to be? Might Israel be threatened?
Those and many other questions would have to be considered before any American President set his country on the road to war in an area as tricky as the Middle East. But we do not know what advice Mr. Bush got, or how he finally answered the questions. He has told us nothing about the reasons that made him shift to a policy of threatening war.
We are asked to take the President's policy on faith. We must believe, for example, that a war with Iraq would be relatively easy -- that U.S. casualties would be low.
But a large and growing number of Americans do not believe. They are not willing to go to war in the Persian Gulf on the President's unexplained say-so. Women especially have doubts: a fascinating point that is not adequately reflected in establishment comment and television talk shows.
Is it a weakness of the system if Americans refuse to follow a President blindly into war? I do not think so. Experience supports what Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, who won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, said on Sept. 19:
"Policy makers in the United States dare not delude themselves into thinking that we do not need to debate what we are doing [in the gulf] and to state our disagreements where they exist. A failure to do this -- a simple and blind acceptance of everything the President as Commander in Chief does -- will lead to bad policy and the potential loss of clear public support for what we are doing."
Presidents have to lead. But they must suffer public debate because it tests the wisdom of their policy. That is our constitutional system, and it has outlasted most of the others on earth.
"Democracy is the worst form of government," Winston Churchill said, "except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."

HEADLINE: Baker Is Right About 'Jobs' . . .

BYLINE: By Robert Eisner; Robert Eisner is professor of economics at Northwestern University.

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
Secretary of State James Baker has introduced a curious new rationale for our changing Persian Gulf policies: jobs. "An economic recession worldwide, caused by the control by one nation -- one dictator if you will -- of the West's economic lifeline will result in the loss of jobs for American citizens," the Secretary tells us.
Well, whatever the public relations appeal he anticipates in using this argument, the economics are essentially wrong. Far from saving jobs, the Administration's new "offensive option" will threatens more job losses and deepening recession. 
 With the gulf crisis, as we all know, crude oil rose in price from $18 a barrel to as high as $40 before settling at about $30 a barrel. This price rise contributes to a recession by draining off consumer purchasing power.
The joker is that oil prices rose not so much in response to the brutal invasion of Kuwait itself but because of the threat of general war in the region.
The invasion of Kuwait and the consequent sanctions cut off only a small portion of the world's supply of oil, an amount that Saudi Arabia readily made up. War, however, threatens the wholesale destruction of oil installations and a possibly long-term interruption of oil supplies.
Dictator he certainly is, and a pretty mean one at that. But Saddam Hussin is hardly a lunatic. He did not go for Kuwait's oil -- nor would he want Saudi Arabia's, for that matter -- to drink it or pour it into the sea.
Any dictator controlling a significant amount of oil would want to sell it for the best possible price. Too high a price would throw the world into recession, cutting demand, and would spur a search for substitutes. A number of Western analysts have calculated that the optimum price for Saddam Hussein, if he could control the oil, would be about $25 a barrel.
Now $25 a barrel is significantly more than the $18 a barrel before the Kuwait invasion. But it is still much less in real terms than what we were paying a decade ago -- not the stuff of recession.
There is one saving grace to our military escalation, which is already threatening to cost $30 billion a year. All that Government spending, which so many want to reduce, would pour into the economy.
Between the people "employed" in the armed forces, those working in expanded defense industries and those using wartime incomes to purchase goods from our nonmilitary companies, the unemployment rate would decline. It is now close to 6 percent, compared with 1 percent in World War II and about 3 percent during the Vietnam War.
If that is what Mr. Baker has in mind, he may be right after all that our policy is aimed at saving jobs.

HEADLINE: Liberian Factions Gather to Start Peace Talks

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAMAKO, Mali, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The leaders of Liberia's main political factions gathered here today in preparation for long-planned peace talks.
If the meeting begins on Tuesday as scheduled, it will be the first time all factional leaders have come together for negotiations since the country's civil war began 11 months ago. 
 Riding on these discussions is not only Liberia's political fate but also the future of the West African peacekeeping force now in Monrovia. The force, which is dominated by the Nigerian Army, installed an interim Government last week.
African and Western diplomats say the fighting appears to have reached a turning point in the last few weeks as the West African force has coordinated its moves with the remnants of the army of the late President, Samuel K. Doe, and the breakaway guerilla unit led by Prince Johnson. The three forces have pushed the main rebel group, the National Patriotic Front led by Charles Taylor, out of Monrovia with heavy artillery and air power.
The peacekeeping force was sent to Liberia last August by the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States. The intervention was conceivedas an effort to stop hostilities and organize elections. The interim Liberian Government installed by the peacekeeping force last week is led by Amos Sawyer, a political science professor and longtime opponent of the Doe Government who has lived in the United States for the last several years.
If the discussions should produce even some limited form of agreement among the Liberians, the prospects for withdrawing the peacekeeping force would be considerably brighter. If the talks should disintegrate into rancorous arguments, as lower-level talks did last August in Banjul, Gambia, then the bloody civil war is likely to continue.There are, in essence, five negotiating blocs attending the conference. The interim Government, which is backed by the peacekeeping force, is expected to be represented by Mr. Sawyer.
Representing the National Patriotic Front will be its leader, Mr. Taylor, a former bureaucrat in the Doe regime who began the rebellion last December with some 150 guerrillas, including Mr. Johnson. The conflict has caused the deaths of at least 20,000 people, mostly civilians, and the dislocations of about half of the nation's 2.4 million people.
Mr. Taylor is expected to press for the removal of the peacekeeping force, which he has accused of trying to prop up the remaining elements of the former Doe Government. He has rejected calls for cease-fire talks until the intervention force left Liberian soil. But he was forced to attend these talks, Western diplomats say, after the West African force mounted a successful assault on his main military position.
A third negotiating bloc is headed by Mr. Johnson, 38 years old, who was once a commander of Mr. Taylor's National Patriotic Front, but split with them shortly after the fighting started. Mr. Johnson's forces captured and killed Mr. Doe in late September.
A fourth bloc will be followers of the Mr. Doe, most of them members of his ethnic group, the Krahn. Attending for the group is Brig. David Nimley, commander of Mr. Doe's military forces.
A fifth bloc will be the 12,000-member peacekeeping force itself, led by Maj. Gen. Joshua Dogdnyaro, its Nigerian commander. The force comprises military units from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL FOR MCA;
Politics and Multinational Movies

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan, Tuesday, Nov. 27

 BODY:
When he announced Japan's largest purchase yet in the United States, the president of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company appeared to fuel the political concerns surrounding the deal with a surprise omission: He refused to say that the Japanese consumer electronics giant would not interfere with the content of MCA's movies, records or books.
That question, more than any other, may dictate how smoothly Matsushita's president, Akio Tanii, gains acceptance for the $6.13 billion deal for MCA in Washington and Hollywood. And it is a question likely to be asked with increasing urgency now that Matsushita, the world's largest maker of consumer electronic goods, and Sony, its archrival and owner of Columbia Pictures, now control more than a quarter of the American movie market. 
 The issue of a chilling effect on movies, books or records has been particularly potent because Japanese producers and publishers exercise a degree of self-censorship in Japan that goes beyond what is usually seen in the West. Certain topics -- the power of right-wing political groups, the existence of an outcast group in Japan known as the "burakumin," Japanese atrocities during the occupation of Korea and China -- are rarely discussed openly, and rarely the subject of extensive treatment in film or music. It is not that any overt censorship takes place, but rather that the norms of a society well attuned to subtle signals make unnecessary rigid rules about what is acceptable discourse.
There is no evidence so far that those same rules will be applied outside Japan, and Japanese often complain that the same level of concern is not raised when Australians or Italians buy into Hollywood, as they have recently in acquisitions of 20th Century Fox and MGM.
While the aims expressed by Matsushita and Sony are nearly identical -- to marry Japanese "hardware," including televisions and videocassette players, with American "software," including TV programs and movies, what Mr. Tanii on Monday called "two wheels of the same car" -- their approach to the political questions engendered by their purchases seemed markedly different.
At the time of the Sony acquisition its management, responding to American fears that an important cultural asset would be controlled from abroad, promised to "keep it totally as an American company" and not to interfere with the selection of movie topics or scripts. In recent weeks MCA has hired Washington lobbyists to make the similar claims about the Osaka-based Matsushita, which is a far more traditionally Japanese company.
But when Mr. Tanii, who has been president of Matsushita for four years and commanded its revitalization as a giant electronics concern, discussed the MCA purchase for the first time on Monday, he declined several opportunities to offer such assurances himself. He did say, however, that Matsushita was planning to keep the company's current management, including the chairman, Lew R. Wasserman. He said MCA's management had "common sense and fairness in using their powers of judgment."
The contrast between Sony's and Matsushita's statements was made more vivid when Mr. Tanii answered the same question that was posed a year ago to Akio Morita, Sony's chairman: Would his company be willing to produce a movie about the wartime role of the late Emperor Hirohito, one of the many taboo subjects in Japanese society?
 
Contrast to Sony's Pledge
 Last year Mr. Morita, without hesitation, said he would never interfere with such a production, though he said he could not guarantee that theaters in Japan would be willing to show it.
On Monday, a visibly agitated Mr. Tanii said, "I could never imagine such a case, so I cannot answer such a question." He also declined to answer when asked if Matsushita would permit the making of movies that some Japanese might perceive as "Japan bashing" because they were critical of Japanese society or economic practices.
"I never dreamed of hearing such a question," he said. But later he added: "Our new cooperation with MCA is part of broader U.S.-Japan cooperation as countries. So I believe that such a movie will not be produced." He suggested that it would be needless as the two countries resolved their increasing economic friction.
Mr. Tanii's answers seemed to reflect the depth of the differences between Matsushita and Sony, and between Japan's industrial center in Osaka, which Matsushita dominates, and the international and political center in Tokyo.
 
Politics and Culture
 Sony, half Matsushita's size, has always seemed highly Americanized and politically attuned. Created just after the end of World War II, it focused its energies on products for foreign markets, and its senior executives often seem at ease in both countries. By the time it bought CBS Records in 1988 and Columbia Pictures last year -- two moves that analysts believe spurred Matsushita to buy MCA -- it had already run a joint venture in record production for two decades.
Matsushita, on the other hand, has until very recently been a creature of Japan. Though it opened offices in the United States in 1953, until five years ago only 12 percent of its production was based outside of Japan. That figure is rising rapidly, and the purchase of MCA will easily be the company's largest single holding in the United States. Still, it is a deeply traditional Japanese company, and its executives concede that it will have a more difficult time adjusting to the ways of Hollywood.
Mr. Tanii seemed to acknowledge that when he said Monday that the company would rely on present management. But he also described plans to place Matsushita's own strong management controls on the company, making movies to strict budgets the way it makes electronics.
"In Matsushita, business plans are the core of our management," he said. "We will make firm business plans, and both Matsushita and MCA will agree on these plans. And I hope MCA's management staff with follow them."
Mr. Tanii also sidestepped another political issue that has dogged Matsushita for some time: Its observance of the Arab trade embargo of Israel. While the negotiations were under way with MCA, Jewish groups in the United States asked whether they would similarly stop distribution of their movies in Israel, an event that seems highly unlikely. Nonetheless, the boycott raises the question of whether a company willing to give in to Arab pressure to break off direct contacts with Israel would also be quick to squelch movies that might complicate its trade relations with other nations that are sensitive about how they are portrayed, such as China.

HEADLINE: Huge Rebuilding Effort Awaits Kiley's Successor

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Robert R. Kiley's successor as head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will inherit a network of rail and bus lines and bridges and tunnels on which more than $16 billion has been or will be spent in one of the most expensive rebuilding efforts ever undertaken in the New York region.
But it is also a system that will require billions of dollars more to achieve Mr. Kiley's goal of "a state of good repair," and one that will likely have to cut service or raise fares or both in the meantime. 
 The New York City Transit Authority, by far the M.T.A.'s largest subsidiary, has already said it might be forced to lengthen the waiting times in the early morning or tack another 10 cents onto a fare that rose to $1.15 from $1 in January.
People still complain about the subways, of course, and probably always will. But, Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association, a research organization, said yesterday that when Mr. Kiley arrived at the authority's Madison Avenue headquarters seven years ago the subways were plagued by derailments and fires and covered with scrawls.
 
'A Running Start'
 "He inherited one series of problems and he dealt with them," Mr. Anderson said, adding that the next chairman would have to deal with other kinds of problems, including crime and homelessness.
Mr. Anderson credited Mr. Kiley with building a strong staff and said he had given his successor "a running start" on innovations like automatic fare collection. Mr. Anderson also said Mr. Kiley was beginning to address what Mr. Anderson said was a politically difficult but necessary task of replacing underused and antiquated parts of the system, like elevated subway lines, so that expansion vital to the region's economic growth could take place.
"Do we invest in rail access to the airports, or do we invest in greater utilitization of the 63d Street Tunnel or do we invest in another tunnel under the Hudson?" Mr. Anderson said. "They all involve multibillion dollar investments at a time when we don't have the money."
Taking over from Richard Ravitch, who conceived the sophisticated and innovative plan that rescued the foundering authority and financed its initial rebuilding effort, Mr. Kiley presided over a period in which 90 percent of the Transit Authority's subway cars and buses were either replaced o rebuilt, as were all the cars on the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. Most of the 2,000 miles of rail and subway track have also been replaced.
 
20-Year Wish List
 Even the 63d Street Tunnel, a project envisioned in the 1960's was finally opened, although the new line it was to have connected to Manhattan never materialized, all but rendering the $800 million tunnel vestigial, at least for now.
But much work will remain even after the authority's second five-year rebuilding effort ends in December 1991. The agency has issued a 20-year wish list in which it estimated that it would need $37 billion to rehabilitate its transit lines fully and provide for normal replacement of equipment.
On top of that, it listed $13 billion in new projects, including building transit links to the airports, completing the mothballed Second Avenue subway line, constructing two Hudson River crossings and rehabilitating Grand Central Terminal.
"If anything, I think the M.T.A. has a more difficult row to hoe, not that getting a toll increase is easy," said Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is seeking a $1 rise in tolls on its bridges and tunnels and a 25-cent increase in the fare on its PATH trains. "They're still playing catchup."
The State Legislature, in its special session next month, is expected to renew a surcharge on corporate income in transportation authority's service region that provides $300 million a year in operating money.
But next year the authority will be back in Albany, asking for about $12 billion for its next five-year rebuilding plan. Given the state's fiscal problems, the outlook for a favorable response seems uncertain at best. One argument that may be heard in the Statehouse is that, because of all the improvements already been made, the authority no longer needs large investments.
To add to its frustration, the agency has so far been unable to develop two choice parcels of land in Manhattan, the site of the New York City Coliseum and its west side rail yards.
Still, each weekday six million people rely on the M.T.A., which has a domain that stretches from Montauk, on the tip of Long Island, to Port Jervis in Orange County to Dover Plains in Dutchess County and comprises two commuter railroads, a suburban bus line, the New York City subway and bus system, seven bridges and two tunnels.
"The case for investing in transit is strong," said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group. "When you're in a downturn, it's time to use the assets that you've got."
Mr. Brezenoff, who served on the authority's board when he was New York City's First Deputy Mayor and has remained a member, said, "Albany has always shown a lot of interest and concern for the M.T.A."
Then he added, "It's a question of what's affordable and what the competing priorities are."

HEADLINE: Bluff in Dominica Yields Columbus's First Colony

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

DATELINE: EL CASTILLO, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
ON a low limestone bluff lapped by turquoise waters, archeologists are scraping away five centuries of decay and covering loam to get at the ruins of the first known European colony established in the Americas, the place Christopher Columbus in 1494 described as a "well-situated rock" and, with extravagant hopes, christened La Isabela.
Archeologists have identified the stone foundations of the settlement's main structures: a large storehouse, watch tower and sentry posts, a powder house, hospital, church and the house of Columbus. The cemetery has yielded skeletons with their hands crossed over their chests in Christian burial. 
 They have also found the quarry half a mile away where colonists cut stone for the fort, an oven where lead was melted for pottery glaze or molded into lombard shot used in cannons, and a kiln where colonists fired ceramics, the first Old World manufacturing in America. Buried in the mound at the site of Columbus's house were fragments of earthenware plates and bowls he probably ate from, roofing tiles that sheltered him and the rim of what very likely was a chamber pot. Columbus's very own?
Digging at the storehouse site, archeologists accidentally released thousands of evanescent drops of mercury that glittered in sunlight as they floated away. With the look of a triumphant alchemist on his face, Dr. Jose M. Cruxent, a Venezuelan archeologist, cupped a brownish glob of the thickly liquid mercury in his hand and uttered the intoxicating word, "Gold." This was some of the mercury the Spaniards had brought for separating from the mineral matrix the pure gold they had hoped to find in abundance.
For more than three years, Dr. Cruxent has directed archeologists and residents of this isolated fishing village in the first systematic exploration of La Isabela. Excavations are being expanded with the addition of archeology teams from the University of Florida under the leadership of Dr. Kathleen Deagan, curator of anthropology at the Florida Museum of Natural History at Gainesville.
They are trying to reconstruct the outlines of the first Spanish capital in the Indies in time for the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage of discovery in 1492. Their ultimate aim is to learn more about how the 1,500 sailors, soldiers and settlers accompanying Columbus on his second expedition in 1493 managed in their strange surroundings at La Isabela and why their colony collapsed and was abandoned in less than five years.
"Isabela is the gem of Columbus archeology," said Dr. Deagan. "It lets us look at how the Spaniards first began to cope with the American environment and began to develop many of their concepts and methods of colonization."
 
Origin of Slave Trade
 Here the Spaniards provided the New World with the first intentional introduction of plants and animals, the first masonry houses and the first European canals. Here, too, Columbus's lieutenants led troops across the plain and into the hills to plunder and pillage, ending any hope there might have been for peaceful relations between these reunited branches of humanity. From here, a year later, Columbus loaded 500 Taino Indians into four caravels and shipped them back to Spain, inaugurating the transatlantic slave trade.
Dr. Michael V. Gannon, a historian and director of the Institute for Early Contact Period Studies at the University of Florida, said: "The town provides the first example we have of a sustained contact between Europeans and Native Americans. It was the initial experience, if you will, of a process that changed the political, economic, social and religious world of the 16th century and thereafter."
The excavations at La Isabela highlight the growing role of archeology in the study of Columbus and the period of initial contact between European and American cultures. Except for the rare discovery of a new archive or an insight gleaned from improved translations, historians have learned just about all they can from written documents of the time and are looking to archeology to fill some of the gaps in understanding this crucial period.
Archeologists, for example, are aiding Columbus scholars by searching for physical evidence of exactly where he first landed in the New World, what his ships were like and where and how his men put down their first roots on American soil.
Dr. Charles A. Hoffman, an archeologist at Northern Arizona University, digs each year in the Bahamas at San Salvador Island, searching for confirming evidence that this, and not some other contending island, is where Columbus made his historic landfall on Oct. 12, 1492. He said he had found buried there more Spanish coins, beads, ceramics and a belt buckle from the Columbus period.
"If it wasn't Columbus who was here, it was somebody shortly thereafter," Dr. Hoffman said. "Perhaps Ponce de Leon."
Expeditions from Texas A & M University's Institute of Nautical Archeology and Ships of Discovery, an archeology foundation, are in the field this fall, trying to find and recover sunken remains of Columbus ships in Jamaica and Panama.
Other archeologists are methodically sifting the sand and dirt of Bahamian and Caribbean islands for traces of the Taino people, who were doomed by their encounter with European ambitions, weapons and diseases and became virtually extinct within a generation or two. Excavations directed by Dr. Deagan in the last decade identified the most likely site of the lost encampment in Haiti, La Navidad, where Columbus left 39 men on the first expedition when the Santa Maria went aground and had to be scuttled.
Dr. David Hurst Thomas, an anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History and explorer of early Spanish missions, said the branch of study known as historical archeology, which explores periods that are already documented through written records, "has come of age in the last decade" as an independent approach to investigating and interpreting the past.
 
Reconstructing a Way of Life

 
 Dr. Deagan, a leading archeologist of the early Spanish contact period, said: "There's very little archeologists can say about individuals in the past, but we can reconstruct the world of those people, their materials and the way they ordered things. At La Isabela, we're certainly getting insights into the material trappings of the first colonists."
Trying to piece together the past at La Isabela is no picnic. The village of El Castillo has no electricity or running water and lies at the end of an unpaved road 20 bumpy miles from the nearest town with any amenities. At the thatch huts of its 40 or so families, the chickens, dogs and pigs have the run of things.
Dr. Deagan's stoical graduate students who work the dig sleep in a small concrete dormitory. Off to the side, on the way to the outhouse, are the guest quarters, a shed lodgers share with rats, land crabs and whatever else it is that scratches and scurries in the dark outside the mosquito net. Archeologists endure these hardships because the prize of La Isabela is an understanding of a pivotal moment in history when, scholars say, Columbus changed from successful mariner and discoverer to grasping imperialist and inept colonial administrator.
On his second voyage, when he arrived at La Navidad in November 1493 to rescue the men he had left behind, Columbus found their stockade burned to the ground and the Spaniards dead. He then sailed 70 miles east along the north coast of Hispaniola to the wooded promontory he chose as the place for his first permanent colony.
It was apparently a poor choice. The high ground overlooking the Atlantic must have appealed to him as a defensible position. But there was no fresh water readily available. The reef waters made a poor anchorage.
 
Shortages and Rebellion
 There was trouble from the start, from widespread illness, food shortages, dissension and rebellion against Columbus and also from the surrounding Tainos, who were provoked to hostility. The gold the newcomers coveted was scarce. In 1498, two years after Columbus returned to Spain to defend his management of the enterprise, La Isabela was abandoned and a new capital established across the island at Santo Domingo.
The derelict capital crumbled and later became the refuge of buccaneers and smugglers. In this century, nothing remained but a few exposed stones in a pasture.
In a misguided attempt in the early 1960's to restore La Isabela, the Dominican Government bulldozed the site, pushing much of the topsoil and uncounted artifacts into the sea. Less than a decade ago, Dominican archeologists began a more careful exploration and exhumed the skeletons of several dozen Spanish settlers. With the support of the Dominican Government, Dr. Cruxenta, a 79-year-old emeritus professor at the National University of Francisco de Miranda in Coro, Venezuela, came to live at the site in 1987 and undertook its most thoroughgoing study.
 
A New Theory
 While digging at La Isabela, Dr. Cruxent cast his eyes on the plain a mile away where the Rio Isabela empties into the ocean. There, at an area called Los Coles, he discovered signs that there was more to the colony than historians had imagined. He found Spanish artifacts and other evidence he interprets as marks where posts were planted for settlers' huts. He also dug up the bricks and other remains of a large kiln.
Standing at the kiln, Dr. Cruxent explained his theory that this, not the site on the promontory, was where the Spaniards first came ashore and built their colony. They lived at Los Coles, he said, while constructing the fortified settlement known as La Isabela, and most of the people probably continued to live here, with the other place serving as administrative center, fortress and residence for Columbus and the leaders.
"This place," Dr. Cruxent said of Los Coles, "had everything the settlers needed -- fresh water, good anchorage, a fertile plain for farming, clay for pottery. Columbus was not a foolish man, and logic says they came here first."
Other archeologists say it is too early to judge Dr. Cruxent's thesis. The Florida researchers, mapping the area last year, found evidence that the 200 settlers' huts mentioned in historical documents could have stood adjacent to the main La Isabela compound, across the road in the village of El Castillo. In excavations this fall, supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Florida team has uncovered post marks and shards suggesting that at least some of the settlers did live close to the fortress.
Dr. Deagan said the large amount of material found at this new site indicates that more people lived there than at Los Coles. But she conceded that archeologists must now consider the possibility that three discrete settlements made up La Isabela: the fortress, the El Castillo site and also Los Coles, which was "ancillary in some capacity." Perhaps, she said, it was the colony's farming and manufacturing center, and its source of water.
 There is little doubt, however, about the physical layout of the main settlement. The houses were built around a central plaza. To the north was the largest building, the storehouse or barracks that measured some 120 feet long and 13 feet wide. Below the plaza was the church, its few remaining stones shaded now by a gnarled guayacan tree. Beyond are the cemetery, foundation outlines of some small houses and, at the far end, the Columbus house.
Like the other structures, the Columbus house had a foundation of thick limestone, side walls of packed dirt plastered on the inside with lime and a roof of timbers overlaid with dun-colored tiles. The front wall was solid blocks of limestone, and a stone lintel rests on the spot of the front door. The house was 13 feet wide and at least 20 feet long.
Dr. Cruxent found that an outer stone wall enclosed the house and yard, an example of archeology reinforcing historical accounts. Columbus must have felt the need of protection aginst his restive comrades within the fortress as much as against the Tainos without.
One afternoon, Dr. Deagan and two other archeologists, Dr. Elizabeth Reitz of the University of Georgia and Dr. Margaret Scarry of the University of Kentucky, sat at a rough-hewn table under a thatch-roof pavilion. This is the project's laboratory. And they were examining shards Dr. Cruxent had collected at the Columbus house.
 
Columbus's Chamber Pot?
 Most of the pieces were a pale salmon color. They were in the Moorish style of 15th-century Spain and had been shaped on a wheel. Most were coarse and unglazed, indicating they were made in the colony's own kilns. The fragments were recognizable as plates, bowls and a globular vessel. "Despite the bulldozer, there's a tremendous amount of stuff still here," Dr. Deagan said.
She fingered the grooved rim to what had been a large pot. "Moorish traits," she said. "Probably a chamber pot."
"You mean, that could be Columbus's chamber pot?" someone asked.
"We'll never get any closer to Columbus than this," someone else said.
They all laughed, but not at Christopher Columbus. They laughed at themselves, at their eagerness for proximity to the man who changed history.

HEADLINE: Rebel Economists Add Ecological Cost To Price of Progress

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
COULD biologists, ecologists and other natural scientists have more to say about the economics of the environment than economists themselves?
Researchers calling themselves ecological economists are challenging traditional economics on its own turf, accusing economists of mismeasuring development, underestimating the intangible costs of pollution and ignoring society's responsibilities to future generations. 
 While many economists dismiss the ideas of their fellow scientists and critics as both unoriginal and loosely reasoned, these notions are finding a respectful audience in bastions of the establishment, particularly those that deal with the third world. The rebels' ideas have special application for countries that depend heavily on their natural resources.
The United States Agency for International Development and the conservative Pew Charitable Trusts underwrote a conference on ecological economics last May at the World Bank, which drew some 370 participants. And the Jessie Noyes Foundation in New York is supporting one of the ecological economists' favorite projects, an effort by the United Nations to incorporate environmental factors in the basic accounts used to measure national output.
 If the rebels succeed in the goal set by Robert Costanza, a biologist at the University of Maryland and a founder of the five-year-old International Society of Ecological Economists, they will persuade governments to give the "sustainability" of natural "life support systems" priority over conventionally measured economic growth. That could mean radical changes in policy, sharply reducing efforts to improve living standards through investments in land-intensive agriculture and resource extraction.
But succeed or fail, they will almost certainly force economists to face up to the issue that traditional analysis tends to undervalue environmental resources. And they may kindle public debate on some very uncomfortable questions, everything from the need for population control to the compensation owed by the present generation to those who will inherit radioactive reactor wastes in the year 3000.
Economic science long ago filed "environment" under N for natural resources. Breathable air, mountain scenery and edible marine life were categorized as inputs of production or goods for consumption, like machine tools or wheat or copper ore. The right decision on how much to use, explains Allen Kneese, an economist at Resources for the Future in Washington, depends on the "opportunity cost," what society would lose later by consuming the resource now.
Sophisticated resource economists -- among them, Mr. Kneese -- are sensitive to the practical limitations of the framework. Markets alone cannot be depended upon to weigh, say, the cost of damaging a marsh that serves as a breeding ground for birds.
But "conceptually, such values are not hard to incorporate," says Robert Repetto, an economist at the World Resources Institute in Washington. A determined economist could tote up the losses associated with filling in the wetland and compare them to the benefits of the shopping mall that would replace it. All too often, though, argues Dan Dudek, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, "economists tend to ignore such intangible benefits, effectively setting their value at zero."
 
Accounting for Resources
 Another limitation is the economists' dependence on "discount rates" to account for the dimension of time in measurements of value. Discounting works fine for showing, say, that a ton of steel delivered today is worth more than the same ton delivered a year from now; the difference is an extra year's worth of use from the products made from the steel. When economies are working efficiently, the discount rate is equal to the interest rate; a year's delay in receiving that ton of steel would make it worth about 8 percent less.
But the choice of discount rates becomes increasingly problematic in the long time frame of environmental resources. A town council might decide it is worth sacrificing a grove of 300-year-old spruce to save $100,000 on road construction. But what of future town residents, whose pleasure in seeing very large, very old trees will not be considered?
Mr. Repetto notes that decisions affecting many generations can be even stickier. Carbon dioxide emissions may eventually force people to live indoors, protected from perpetual desert summer by air-conditioning. But what point would there be, asks Mr. Repetto, in discounting the loss of free access to the outdoors to future generations who have never known, and thus may never miss, the pleasure?
 
Calculating Depreciation
 Mr. Repetto and his colleagues at the World Resources Institute have been widely applauded for an attempt to correct a common distortion introduced by conventional economics practices: the failure to include natural resource depletion in national income accounts.
When economists measure a nation's net output, they subtract capital depreciation, the loss of machines, vehicles and buildings in the ongoing production process. But they rarely account for gains or losses of less tangible forms of capital, like human skills. Equally important, they neglect changes in reserves of natural resources, which are typically large (and negative) in poor countries.
The Repetto team used the example of Indonesia to show how important this omission can be in gauging national development. Losses from soil erosion, they calculated, reduce the net value of crop production by about 40 percent. And net losses of forest resources actually exceed timber harvests. Moreover, from 1980 to 1984 depletion of oil fields reduced the value of Indonesia's reserves base by about $10 billion annually, roughly 15 percent of national income.
In industrialized countries, where total output is much larger relative to natural resource depletion, similar extensions of conventional accounting methods have been used to calculate the impact of environmental degradation. Japan, Germany and France all have ambitious projects under way. And the United Nations Statistical Office is working on a general framework for environment and natural resource accounting.
 
Seeking a New Framework
 But ecological economists are not ready to permit researchers like Mr. Repetto, who accept the basic tenets of modern economic theory, to be the profession's toughest critics. What economics needs, they argue, is a whole new framework, one that fits economic production into ecological systems, rather than the other way around.
To Herman Daly at the World Bank, David Pearce at the University of London and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford University, the key goal is the achievement of "sustainability" -- adjusting economic activity so it does not damage the natural systems that underpin all functioning economies. Too many economists, they argue, simply assume that the biosphere can roll with any economic punch and bounce back for more.
But sustainability is proving hard to define and even harder to measure. One approach, now popular among ecological economists, is to calculate energy balances on the assumption that energy supplies represent the ultimate constraint on human activity. Mr. Costanza, for example, measures the amount of energy absorbed by swampland in order to compute the swamp's value.
But economists have been down this road before. Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, an eccentric Rumanian economist who is now retired, spent a career mulling the relationship between economics and the laws of thermodynamics. The amount of energy in the universe is constant, but the amount available for work in a closed (economic) system is limited and constantly in decline.
Energy is indeed critical to human activity, agrees William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University. But only a tiny fraction of the fuel consumed is actually used to sustain life. Technology for efficient processing of inputs -- among them energy -- is thus the real, long-term constraint. And ecological economists are not any better at predicting how these limits will impinge than garden-variety economists.
Mr. Daly, an economist by training who long ago defected to the enemy, approaches sustainability from another angle. He constructed an "index of sustainable economic welfare," adjusting conventionally measured output for environmental damage, resource depletion, the availability of leisure, even the degree of income equality. The index suggests that Americans' sustainable welfare peaked more than a decade ago, that "economic development" as contrasted with economic growth has stopped.
Mr. Nordhaus and the Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin put together a less ambitious "measurement of economic welfare" in the early 1970's in response to Marxists, whose claims to be creating more liveable societies were then taken seriously. The two economists found that the output omitted from regular income accounts -- like the fruits of household labor -- roughly offset the unmeasured costs, like pollution. Thus growth in economic welfare (in advanced industrialized economies, anyway) roughly tracked the growth in conventionally measured output.
At the heart of the sustainability question, Mr. Nordhaus argues, is the issue of endowing future generations with at least as much productive capacity as this generation inherited. Current levels of economic activity may deplete valuable resources and degrade ecological systems in irreversible ways, he acknowledges. But this generation will also pass on precious new technologies, cures for fatal diseases, incredibly efficient means for processing information, for example. Who is to judge whether our resource-stripping, environmentally stressful ways will more than offset this technological bounty?
 
Technological Pessimists
 Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, offers another way of parsing the question. Traditional economics implicitly assumes that as a practical matter no wasting asset, whether it be oil or the atmospheric ozone layer, is absolutely critical to economic growth or human welfare. Ecological economists, by constrast, are technological pessimists: if nations are not careful, they will make the planet uninhabitable.
No one really knows who is right. And to Mr. Hahn, the appropriate response to uncertainty is not agnosticism. It makes sense, he argues, to err on the side of caution where the penalty in output forgone is not high. The ecological economists thus score most tellingly, Mr. Hahn suggests, in their criticism of traditional economists' live-and-let-live approach to population issues.
Traditional economics, with its focus on the welfare of individuals, has generally been indifferent to the overall scale of economic activity. But for any given living standard, it is virtually certain that more people mean more damage to ecological systems, whose carrying capacities are poorly understood. Thus, it may matter critically whether the world's population stabilizes at, say, 10 billion rather than 20 billion.
It is not yet clear whether the ecologists will establish a beachhead in the economists' carefully constructed intellectual empire. What they have already demonstrated, though, is that environmental economics is too important to be left by default to economists.
 
The Real Picture?
 
When resource depletion is accounted for, Indonesia's growth rate falls from a spectacular 7.1 percent annual rate to a more modest 4 percent.

HEADLINE: Freer World Trade Falls Victim to Its Own Success

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
In seven rounds of global trade talks over four decades, tariff rates have been slashed by more than 75 percent. As imports became so much cheaper, trade across frontiers surged, and workers the world over produced a staggering amount of wealth.
The problem for the eighth round of trade talks is precisely that success: World trade has outgrown the rules written for it. The round is scheduled to end with a meeting in Brussels next week, if a bitter dispute on farm subsidies can be resolved. 
 In general, all countries share the belief that opening markets is good. The trouble comes in translating this into specifics. The United States, with its strength in high-technology industries, in such services as finance and construction, and in agriculture, is seeking liberalization in these sectors as a way to increase exports and redress a gaping trade deficit.
The European Community, with five times more farmers than the United States, is striving to protect them, but shares Washington's hopes for cutting barriers in high technology.
Japan, the country that probably gains most from free trade, is also resisting opening markets in agriculture, while still making its consumers pay seven times the world price for rice.
Developing countries, which are being asked to open their markets in high technology and services, are pressing for greater access in textiles and food in the markets of the industrial countries.
The world's trade rules were written 43 years ago and codified as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT. They define what fair trade is and set rules for settling disputes. They impose penalties for unfair pricing, unfair subsidies and other trade violations and encourage member nations to promote even more international trade.
The alternative to GATT is bilateral bashing, in which countries square off against others that they believe are trading unfairly. In such cases, one government will curb the imports of certain goods, as the United States did in 1987, when it accused Japan of failing to comply with an agreement on fair trade in semiconductors and imposed $300 million in sanctions on a variety of Japanese electronics shipments.
Some of those restrictions have been lifted, but $165 million of Japanese products, including laptop computers and power hand tools, are still assessed a 100 percent retaliatory duty when imported into the United States.
 
 Retaliation Countered
 Such steps invite counter-retaliation, and as nation after nation responds to grievances by erecting barriers, the danger grows that trade will dry up.
The extent to which GATT rules have been overtaken becomes clear by a brief look at the communications sector. When the agreement was reached, business documents were sent across the ocean by ship or propeller aircraft; they now travel over telephone lines from computers and facsimile machines, arriving in seconds. In 1950, a 10-minute telephone call between the United States and Britain cost $209; it now costs as little as $9.90. Such changes have made it far easier to conduct business internationally.
 
 Not Covered by GATT Rules
 As more and more companies began to cross national borders, competition rose, economies of scale were realized and prices of many goods and services were driven down. These changes mean that more than a third of today's worldwide trade of $4 trillion is not covered by GATT rules, or not covered adequately.
No rule, for example, forbids the piracy of Paul Simon cassette tapes, which sell for up to $10 in the United States. Unauthorized copies are sold in Thailand for $1.25. Popular software is also unprotected, and the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, which sells in the United States for more than $300, can be had in Malaysia, in pirated form, for $2.
As a result, American entrepreneurs in entertainment, software, pharmaceuticals and scores of other industries lose more than $60 billion a year from the theft and counterfeiting of their ideas -- their "intellectual property" -- according to the tally of the International Trade Commission, a United States Government agency.
Nor do the rules cover insurance, law, accounting, telecommunications, banking, advertising, tourism and other services that have become increasingly important categories of international trade.
 
 Change in Types of Trade
 When GATT was created, almost all world trade was in manufactured goods and raw materials. Today, services provide a fifth of world trade. For the United States, services are especially important. They provide 70 percent of its total output and 90 percent of all new American jobs.
"Competitive industry demands competitive services," said Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative. "You can't design world-class chips without engineering, manufacture them without financing or export them without insurance."
The lack of GATT rules means that there is no international forum to hear complaints when the Japanese markets for architecture, engineering and construction are shut to the United States, or when German and French telecommunications monopolies bar competition from the United States or Canada.
On the other side, the Europeans and Japanese complain that the United States flouts international rules when it acts unilaterally to eliminate unfair trading practices by others. GATT panels have found a number of American practices illegal, including certain types of export subsidies and fees that Congress has imposed.
 
 Washington's Big Stick
 To fill the vacuum in intellectual property and services, Washington has been using its own big stick -- Section 301 of a trade law originally written in 1974 and amended in 1988, which empowers the President to retaliate against any unfair trade practices abroad.
In recent years, Washington singled out India, Brazil, Thailand, South Korea and others for either unfairly closing their markets in services or pirating intellectual property.
Now, hoping to win international agreement on an expanded set of rules, the Bush Administration has suspended its unilateral trade offensive. But should negotiations fail in the current talks -- known as the Uruguay Round because they began in that nation -- Washington's offensive is likely to be renewed.
Another big gap in GATT is agriculture. GATT's past efforts to deal with farm trade have largely been unsuccessful, leaving a wide variety of import barriers and subsidies, including export subsidies, that make farm trade the most protected and distorted of any sector in the trade panoply.
 
 $250 Billion Farm Cost
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has found that it cost taxpayers and consumers in the world's 24 richest countries $250 billion last year to shelter their farmers from competition. That is five and a half times what these countries give in official aid to developing nations.
Although the United States protects dairy, sugar, peanut, cotton, grain and other sectors through subsidies and import quotas, Washington has offered to drop most of its protection if the European Community and other nations will go along.
The community -- with 10 million farmers, five times the number in the United States -- has balked. Jacques Delors, president of the community's Executive Commission, complained earlier this month at a meeting of European foreign ministers that American negotiators were treating Europeans like "plague carriers."
But Japan, which is reluctant to open up its totally protected rice market, has also balked. Because of Japan's barriers against rice imports, rice in Tokyo costs seven times what it does in the United States.
Although Japan has been a great beneficiary of trade liberalization, the rice issue has kept it from taking a leading role in the round. The Japanese reluctance has been a source of considerable disappointment to Bush Administration officials.
 
 Expanding Farm Exports
 As great as the gulf is on the issue of farm subsidies, agriculture remains the linchpin in the current talks. Washington believes that a sharp cut in subsidies could expand world agricultural exports by $100 billion a year. Congressional agricultural committees are unlikely to support a trade agreement without such a provision.
And other farm exporters like Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia could refuse to make concessions on services and intellectual property that are needed for a package to come together.
Many developing countries are also concerned about what is known as the multifiber arrangement, a comprehensive set of import quotas that have governed trade in textiles since the early 1960's.
Three times in the last five years, Congress has voted for legislation that would make textile trade more restrictive. Supporters could never quite get enough support to overcome Presidential vetoes, but the effort still shows that selling any agreement to Congress that opens trade in this sector, to the detriment of American textile producers, will not be easy.
 
 Role of the Soviets and China
 At last count 107 countries were participating in the GATT talks. But the two most populous countries, China and the Soviet Union, are not. While they have been granted observer status, neither is yet a member, because they have not had the open markets that are required for GATT membership. Both nations have taken steps to open markets, and China might well have been accepted this year had it not been for its crackdown on the democracy movement last year, with the international condemnation that followed.
When the ministers gather in Brussels next week, a final agreement may prove elusive, given the bitter arguments, particularly over agriculture.
Some trade officials in the United States and elsewhere speculate that talks could continue in January.
But deadlines loom. Congress gave the Administration until March 1 to submit an agreement for ratification, after which Congress has 90 days for consultation. Sometime after next June 1 it would vote on the pact.
 
 Fast-Track Authority
 For these talks, Congress authorized what is known as fast-track negotiating authority, which requires that lawmakers approve or reject the entire package as submitted, with no amendments permitted.
Without such ground rules, it would be impossible for an accord already balanced among 107 nations to withstand the pressures for changes from special interests in Washington.
The deadline can be delayed only if the President certifies that progress justifies continuation of the negotiations and neither the House nor the Senate disapproves.

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OCALA, Fla.

 BODY:
A decade or two ago, young Americans fresh out of high school could find a job in construction or sales, in a factory or an office, and make a good career of it. They could wait for raises to come along, buy a car, buy a house and take a trip once in a while.
But now, young people without skills, and in many cases even with them, cannot count on good wages and steady work. Many are stuck in dead-end jobs and find that employers can play them like yo-yos, recruiting them in good times like the 80's, firing them in lean times like now.
 
Low-Wage Economy
 As a fast-growing city of 49,000 in one of America's boom states, Ocala represents what much of the nation has become, just as the old manufacturing hubs of New England and the Midwest represent what it has been. Ocala's multilaned highways are lined with discount stores and fast-food restaurants that cater to the middle-income retirees and the people who work in other discount stores and fast-food shops. 
 A city better known for its surrounding horse farms, Ocala has transformed itself into a low-wage, low-skill, "K Mart economy," as a local official calls it. Indeed, the biggest building under construction here is not a factory or an office building but a $20 million, 36-acre K Mart warehouse and distribution center -- the biggest building in Florida, some here say.
The newest, least experienced workers in Ocala, as in most other Southern communities, are paid the $3.80 hourly minimum wage, which works out to $7,904 a year for a 40-hour week. The Census Bureau reports that a person living alone last year needed an income of $6,311 to stay out of poverty and that a three-person family needed $9,885.
A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Washington, reported that from 1979 to 1988, the incomes of households whose principal earner was under 25 years old fell 19 percent in terms of the food, housing or clothing they could buy. Incomes of families whose top earners were 25 to 34 also fell, by 5 percent, while older families gained a little ground or held their own.
Sue Sowell, who is 27 and divorced and has an 8-year-old son and another child due in December, stopped by the state-run employment service here on a recent weekday. She had just quit a clerical job because of an irresolvable conflict with a supervisor and said she could not find other work because of her pregnancy.
She is engaged to a man who earns $7 an hour at a factory that converts vans to recreational vehicles. But for a while this year his work hours were cut to 28 hours a week, and many of his co-workers have been laid off. Even working full time, she said, "he can't support us."
A 19-year-old man who agreed to be interviewed only if his name was withheld, came to the Job Service office to help a girlfriend apply for work. He had quit school in the 10th grade and spent a few months in prison for a crime he declined to describe. "I was growing up fast," he explained.
At 6:30 most mornings, the young man lines up at the daily labor pool, where builders pick people to do menial jobs. "I get $31 a day and change," he said. He said he gives little thought to the future. "I just go from day to day."
 
The Causes
The Job Market, The Economy
 Even unmarried people who have avoided the traps of crime or drugs and have just themselves to support say their only hope is more schooling. Even then, they cannot be sure of landing jobs that are secure and pay much better than those they have left. More than the young of the past, the youths here are an itinerant lot, who hustle from state to state in search of work.
A year ago, Jerry Pulley, 24, fled depressed Huntington, W.Va., for Ocala. As a high school senior in Huntington, Mr. Pulley had become a certified electrician, the kind of skill that labor experts say the young must learn to make a good living. He completed a year at Marshall University in Huntington, all he said he could afford, and then went into the Marines for three years.
In Ocala, he found a job with an electrical contractor that paid $6 an hour, about half the going rate nationally. He said he often worked 10 to 20 hours a week of overtime, enough to pay the $350 monthly rent on his trailer and $150 in weekly expenses with a little left over. But Florida has seen its construction business fizzle because of overbuilding in the 1980's, and Mr. Pulley's job fizzled with it. The last hired, he was the first laid off.
Mr. Pulley then took a similar job 60 miles southeast of Ocala in Orlando, was laid off, took another job there and was laid off again. Out of money, he gave up the trailer and moved in with a friend. After a month out of work, he landed another $6-an-hour electrician's job.
Mr. Pulley, an earnest, robust young man, is disillusioned. "I'm definitely going to have to get another occupation to fall back on," he said. "I've been thinking about the community college, but I don't have the money to go."
He added angrily: "You know what we don't have anymore? It's when the employee is faithful, the employer is faithful. What we have now is, if they need you they keep you, if they don't, you go.
"You know what else? They really don't care if you've been in the service any more. And what really stinks about it around here is you have a trade and still get paid almost the same as a man who knows nothing."
 
 Differences for Men and Women
 The labor market has treated people like Mr. Pulley and Ms. Sowell quite differently in recent years. Women are paid less than men -- 69 percent as much, on average -- so it is that much harder for a woman to provide for a family than it is for a man. But during the last decade, the gap has narrowed, and many women have gained some ground while many men have lost.
Allowing for inflation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says the average earnings of all men declined 5.3 percent from 1979 to 1988, while for women they rose 5.9 percent. Young college graduates, both men and women who have been working up to five years, realized gains of about 11 percent from 1979 to 1987, the Economic Policy Institute says. But among high school graduates, young men lost 18 percent, while young women lost 3.5 percent.
"Young working people, particularly men, particularly non-college-graduate men, have taken a terrible beating in the job market over the last 20 years," said Richard B. Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard University.
Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington, added, "I am not very sanguine about the current generation of men, unless they do a great deal to educate themselves and get a lot better skills."
Labor economists see little reason to expect much improvement over the next decade for the current crop of young, blue-collar workers and their semiskilled white-collar cousins who work in shops and offices. They say those entering the work force late in the 1990's might fare better. There are fewer of them than when the baby boom workers were pouring in, so the law of supply and demand says they should get more pay.
Some economists add that the ways that the Federal budget deficit, inflation, interest rates and the dollar conspired to drive down wages in the 1980's could change in the 1990's and raise all wages.
But they also say these developments are unlikely to influence more fundamental and seemingly permanent shifts in the workplace. Chief among these are the decline of well-paid manufacturing jobs and the spread of mostly low-paying service and retailing jobs.
"A kid used to be able to drop out of school and get a job with his old man at General Motors," said Arnold Packer, executive director of a new Labor Department commission studying ways of improving the education and preparation of America's workers. "Now the old man is lucky if he can keep his job, and his kid has to start somewhere else at the minimum wage."
 
 Failures of the Schools
 Labor experts cite several other reasons for the plight of the young: the failure of the schools to teach the well-paid skills of the modern workplace; Federal taxation and spending policies in the 1980's that increased the gap in income between the few with high incomes and everyone else; and American industry's efforts to fight foreign competition, often by keeping wages down, rather than by investing in more efficient factories.
As for the young themselves, some people here say that high school and college students are often shortsighted, self-indulgent and overconfident that things will work out.
"They get out there on their own," said Joseph W. Schroeder, manager of the state's Job Service office here. "They want a job, their own place and a telephone. And they find they're unskilled. They haven't been taught to work. In dealing with young people the problem that employers tell me about constantly is that they can't read or write very well. They can't fill out a job application."
Gordon Malmgren, business agent for the local carpenters' union, one of the few unions in Ocala, said, "They're a lot dumber and burned out, half of them." He said people who want to be carpenters "do not have the arithmetic they should," adding, "It was beat into me."
 
The History
The Lure Of Low Wages
 Hellbent-for-growth cities like Ocala magnify the squeeze on the young. The city's population zoomed to 49,000 last year, from 23,000 in 1970. Marion County, which surrounds Ocala, grew to 198,000 over the same period, from 69,000.
The population grew in part because economic development authorities here, as in many Sunbelt towns, encouraged businesses to move here and exploit the area's low wages and non-union climate.
Now Ocala finds itself awash in low-wage businesses, mostly outposts of businesses based somewhere else, that cater to low-income workers and the 21 percent of the local population that is 65 and older.
A quarter of the labor force works in retailing, many part time, at K Mart and Wal-Mart discount stores, Winn-Dixie, Publix and Kash 'N Karry supermarkets, J. C. Penney, Sears and Montgomery Ward department stores, every known fast-food chain and at hundreds of small businesses offering bank accounts auto repairs and hair styling. Most of the workers earn $4 to $6 an hour.
At the same time, the city is largely barren of the entrepreneurial-minded executives and professionals who could use their money and expertise to create home-grown businesses and the foundations for community wealth and diversity.
The result i the "K Mart economy," as City Councilman Mike Finn calls it. "We've had a lot of growth," Mr. Finn said. "But it was just quantity, not quality. Everybody's selling to each other. Our growth was purely explosive. There was no substance to it."
In promoting the area's low wages, Ocala also lured a strain of what people here call "soft tech" manufacturing. Since no high-wage manufacturers nearby offer competition, companies attracted workers by offering just slightly better benefits and wages than the retailers. The companies pay most workers $5 to $8 an hour here, well below the national average of more than $10.
Companies like Martin Marietta Corporation of Bethesda, Md., have kept their engineering and high-paid, high-skilled work elsewhere and sent the semiskilled, hand assembly work to Ocala. Usually they teach the workers a single task, often at little cost to the company. Before hiring workers, Martin Marietta requires that they take 80 hours of instruction for the assembly jobs, at no pay.
"Factories here teach them one skill, and that's all they teach them," said H. C. Jensen, an economic consultant in Ocala. "The thing we do not have here are technically skilled, trained employees like San Jose, Calif."
When demand for the product a company assembles here falls, so can the factory, shattering its employees' sense of job security.
In recent months, Martin Marietta has laid off about 400 of its 1,600 workers. "For our area, Martin Marietta was the job to shop for," a state job counselor said. "You could feel you had a job for life. That's gone."
The best-paid group here are the 600 Federal employees, including postal and office workers, who earn an average of $24,000, or more than $11 an hour. But the Government, facing its own budget problems, is doing little hiring now.
 
The Effects
High Hopes, But Little Else
 On a typical day last month, the Job Service office posted 35 offers for 101 workers. The best offer, for a librarian, paid $9.59 an hour or $20,000 a year, but it required a master's degree and went unfilled for weeks.
The great majority of the jobs paid much less. Among them were 26 that paid the minimum wage of $3.80, and 11 of those were part time. The average for all the jobs was $5.04.
One job seeker was Charles Cox. Mr. Cox and his wife, Teri, left high school in the 11th grade, have been married nine years and have two children, ages 7 and 4. They had considered themselves fairly well off. "We just went to Disney," Mrs. Cox said. "We pay our bills. We do what everybody else does."
She earns $4 an hour working 35 hours a week as a nursery school teacher. Mr. Cox earned $6.40 an hour operating heavy equipment at a limestone mine until he was laid off in October. He has no other skill.
"We may have to relocate him to Miami," Mrs. Cox said. There he could work for his father, who owns a small business operating construction equipment.
Stacey Smith, 19, also visited the Job Service. She has decided that her high school diploma is not enough and that she needs more schooling. She is single and has no children. A bookkeeper and sales assistant for a homebuilder, she earns $225 a week, or about $5.60 an hour.
"I'm making it," Ms. Smith said, "but I don't have any money to splurge. There isn't anywhere to go with this job. You have to have college degrees and experience. I plan to go back to college. I want to be a child psychologist."
Chris Griffin, 23, was another job seeker. He said he had been lured to Florida from New York State with the promise of sun, fun and job opportunities. His mother had moved earlier to Ocala, so he moved in with her. He got a $5.72-an-hour job as a stock clerk at Martin Marietta, but was laid off in October.
"It was a nowhere job anyway," Mr. Griffin said. After a futile search for work that would pay at least $4.25 an hour, he enrolled in the local Central Florida Community College. He is taking a two-year course in police work, studying fingerprinting and other crime laboratory skills, which he expects to lead to a better-paying job with an urban police department.
For 26 weeks, Mr. Griffin said, he will receive unemployment benefits of $150 a week, and the Federal Government, through the Job Training Partnership Act, is paying for his books and his courses for a year. After his benefits and the grant run out, he said he will try to work part time.
The college prepares about 5,000 of its 10,000 students to transfer to universities, although only about half of the 5,000 do, and the rest for jobs that require skills: accounting, hotel management, computer services and a variety of medical specialities.
The president of the college, William Campion, said the average age of the job-training students is 29 and of women studying nursing 34. "They're here to increase their wage-earning skills," he said. "They're tired of being in that vast army of retail clerks, compounded by the fact that their creditors are pounding at the door."
The younger these workers, the greater their expectations of high incomes and a better life. Ms. Sowell, for example, said she fully expects to own a home. "I just can't say when," she said.
But those who are just a few years older are more apprehensive. Gary Colon, 33, brought his wife, 10-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son to town in their home, a trailer, to look for work. Mr. Colon graduated from high school in Queens, and like Mr. Pulley he spent a year in college and later became an electrician. He, too, was laid off after working for a year in Orlando, where he earned $8.50 an hour. And that was after being laid off after three years in Texas.
 
 Don't Want to Be Laid Off'
 "Maybe I'm doing the wrong things," Mr. Colon said. "I'm not really looking for a higher wage, not that I don't want it. I just don't want to be laid off next month and then the next month. I want security for my family and health benefits."
He contrasted his experience with that of his father, who stopped school in the fourth grade but retired with a good pension after a long career as a laborer with an electrical power utility in Puerto Rico. He said his mother never worked. "My father would have gotten mad if she ever even thought of it," he said. "But I want my wife to work, at least part time."
In some communities, workers find some compensation for low wages in low prices, but that has not been the experience of workers who moved here. Ocala's cost of living is about the same as the national average, while the wages are well below.
Ms. Sowell, an articulate woman, has been caught in Ocala's wage and price squeeze. She grew up in De Soto County, south of here, and finished high school there. "I was prepared to go to college," she said, "but I didn't have the money. I met a man, fell in love and decided to have a family instead."
After her boy, Wade, was born, she and her husband broke up, and she and another man moved to Grand Rapids, Mich., where they planned to marry. That relationship failed, too, but she said she was lucky and found a job in a blueprint supply shop there. She started at $6 an hour and in two years was earning $8. With that, she said she was easily able to pay a $361 monthly rent on a two-bedroom, two-bath townhouse and have a telephone, too.
"That was the best job I ever had in the whole world," she said, "and it was a great place to live. But I missed my family in Florida, so I came back." She doubts she could get back her old job in Michigan or any other there. Jobs in Michigan pay more, but they are disappearing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that from October last year through October this year, Michigan lost 95,000 jobs, while Florida gained 190,000.
Here, Ms. Sowell and her fiance live in a mobile home, the best they could afford. "There's no heat, it's falling apart and we pay $75 a week," she said.
She said they cannot afford a telephone or insurance on their cars. And since leaving her job, she said she will have to postpone the final, $94.22 monthly payment on the 11-year-old Ford LTD, with a crumpled rear fender, that she bought a year ago.
A decade ago, about 20 million people worked in factories, which paid high wages, and 15 million worked in stores, which paid much less. Over the decade, the number of retail workers, whether fast-food cashiers or discount store clerks, has climbed to 20 million, surpassing the 19 million who now have factory jobs. At the same time, factory wages have risen but cannot buy as much now as they did in 1980.
 
The Needs
Teaching Skills That Pay More
 A widespread consensus now exists, within the Bush Administration and Congress, in industry and among educators, that vast changes are needed to halt the spread of low-wage, low-skill jobs.
A score of studies have concluded that school curriculums need overhauling to prepare people for high-quality, better-paid jobs, both for the benefit of the young and for the economy. They urge better basic education, better preparation in the requirements of the workplace, and they suggest that vocational schools become more geared to the skills required in the next decades.
"The bank teller who just took deposits has been eliminated by the money machine," Mr. Packer of the Labor Department said. "Now he has to advise me on three types of money market deposits and explain to me why I want this one rather than that one."
By luck or foresight, some people in Ocala have learned the skills that the academics say the economy needs. But their skills serve only to provide a modest income -- and then only if both spouses work.
James P. Egert, 29, and his wife, Dorothy, 26, moved here from New Orleans with their 2-year-old son last summer. "New Orleans has extremely poor schools and extreme racial problems," said Mr. Egert, who is white. "I don't want my son growing up in that. I'll drive a two-year-old car and make $5 an hour so my son can grow up in a town that's nice."
Mr. Egert said he finished high school in Michigan and learned a skilled, sought-after trade, lithography, on the job at a print shop.
As a lithographer for four years in New Orleans, Mr. Egert said his pay rose from $7.50 an hour to $10. After a three-month search in Ocala, he found a printing shop that would take him at only $7 an hour. Mrs. Egert took a pay cut, too. She is a medical secretary, an especially sought-after skill in Florida because of the health care needs of the large retired population. Because of the city's prevailing low-wage level, however, her job at the Ocala hospital pays $7.18 an hour, $2.20 less than she earned in New Orleans.
Mr. Egert said he is struck by the contrast between his own career and his father's. His father worked as a safety engineer at the Dow Chemical Company while his mother stayed home, and he took early retirement with a comfortable pension. The senior Egerts sold their home in Coleman, Mich. They moved to the Florida Keys, where they have established the kind of life that James Egert calls his ideal.
"They live on a sailboat," he said.

HEADLINE: In Manhattan, Vacant Stores Are a Sign of Hard Times

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
There are signs of economic distress all over Manhattan these days, and many of them say "Space Available" or "Store for Rent."
Vacant shops pock lower Fifth Avenue, parts of the Financial District and Broadway on the Upper West Side, where some merchants have gone in and out of business in a matter of months. Even on the burnished stretch of Madison Avenue from 57th Street to 96th Street that is frequented by a platinum-carded clientele, about 30 stores are vacant. 
 Huberth & Peters Inc., a New York Cityreal-estate company, found that 9.75 percent of the retail space in Manhattan was vacant in September, up nearly half a percentage point since June. Michael W. Hirschfeld, the company's managing director, expects the rate to be above 10 percent by year's end. The last time that happened, he said, was in the 1970's.
 
Drop in Rents
 On the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, the rate has already exceeded 10 percent. And in parts of the Financial District, the rate is 20 percent.
Huberth & Peters also found that it now takes an average of almost six months tolease an empty store in Manhattan, twice as long as it did a few years ago.
Another New York real-estate company specializing in store leasing, Garrick-Aug Associates, reported that at midyear 7.2 million square feet of retail space was available in Manhattan. Although this is partly the result of new development, Charles M. Aug, the company's president, said there are now 2 million or 3 million more square feet available than there would be if times were prosperous.
This surplus comes despite a drop of about 20 percent in the average asking price for retail-store rents in Manhattan, from more than $65 a square foot in 1988,according to the company. Mr. Aug said in some areas, including Madison Avenue, where prices had soared as high as $350 a square foot, rents had dropped by as much as 40 percent.
"Manhattan has been the leader in escalation," he said, "and it is the leader in deflation."
At 87th and Broadway, the hand-painted sign of Lillian's Dress Shop still hangs above the storefront even though the store closed a few months ago. Avital D'Lugoff, who shopped there for years, said she remembered the owner, an aspiring singer. "He knew my husband was in show business and he'd always sing opera when I came in," she recalled. "He had a beautiful voice."
She listed a string of neighborhood businesses that have closed recently, including a kosher butcher, a card shop and a "lovely little embroidery shop."
 
Some Areas Do Well
 "With so many stores disappearing," she said, "you have to walk forever, and still you're lucky to find what you need."
The vacancy problem looks somewhat worse than it is, real-estate consultants say, since some empty stores are actually awaiting renovation by new tenants or are in buildings earmarked for redevelopment.
And vacancies are still scarce in many parts of the city, particularly shopping strips in boroughs other than Manhattan, said David A. Smith, Commissioner of the New York City Office of Business Development.
Still, the increase in empty stores along some of the city's busiest streets only compounds the problems of an already troubled real-estate industry. And coming after a shakeout in which several large department stores closed, and just as the crucial holiday shopping season is beginning, the empty stores are silent testimony to a weakening economy and, in particular, sagging retail sales.
"Those vacant stores are telltale signs of serious problems," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Consumers, he said, "are cutting back even when they don't have to."
 
Big Chains Move In
 New York would have even more vacant stores had not some national and foreign retailers, which had largely avoided the city, arrived. National chains now occupy 1.5 million square feet, Mr. Hirshfeld said, compared to less than 300,000 square feet 15 years ago.
Toys "R" Us has opened its first Manhattan store in Herald Square. A rival, Kiddie City, has new stores in Manhattan, too. HMV Records, a British company, has a new store on Broadway at 72d Street, a few blocks north of Tower Records, which is itself opening a book store. HMV has also opened a large store on Lexington Avenue at 86th Street.
Lechters, the kitchen-goods chain, the Bombay Company, which sells reproductions of English antiques, and Merry-Go-Round, featuring trendy clothing, have joined the Gap, Banana Republic and other national retailers in Manhattan.
With other stores in more prosperous parts of the country, the chains can afford to wait for the local economy to bounce back. And in the current real-estate market, they are able to negotiate good deals on Manhattan rents.
 
'Opportunities Out There'
 "There are opportunities out there for guys who want to take them," Mr. Aug said.
Indeed, last week Barneys New York said it planned to open a huge store in an office building on Madison Avenue and 60th Street, a venture that would draw more shoppers -- and doubtless more merchants -- to at least that portion of the avenue. Executives indicated they were not immediately concerned about the current retail slump and said were pursuing long-term goals.
But many small "mom and pop" stores struggling with diminishing profits will have a hard time affording a long-term strategy. And while rents have dropped from the levels of a few years ago, when some merchants were clamoring for commercial rent control, they are often geometrically higher than they were when when many businesses signed their current leases.
In the days when prices were $8 to $10 a square foot on Amsterdam Avenue, retailers could afford to make a mistake, said C. Bradley Mendelson, managing director of the Edward S. Gordon Company, a New York-based real-estate company. "At 50 bucks a foot, it's an expensive lesson," he said.
Even if entrepreneurs are willing to take the risk, banks are more hesistant to finance new businesses, and although landlords are anxious for tenants, they also face the prospect of getting even less for their property next year if a new tenant leaves. That has made some of them more selective, real estate consultants say.
Taxes are another growing problem for some city merchants. "In the last 10 years, my real-estate taxes have increased from $300 to $1,800 a month," said the owner of a Broadway bookstore, who attributed some of the vacancies to a rise in taxes that has been steeper for commercial property than residences.
 
More Homogeneity
 The stresses on Manhattan retailing may to lead to a restructuring in which local, one-of-a-kind merchants continue to be replaced by branches of chains, creating a more homogeneous marketplace that reflects national trends at the expense of neighborhood sensibilities and needs.
On Broadway at 89th Street, the impact vacant stores can have on a neighborhood is becoming apparent. "Flowers are often an impulse buy," said Randy Hirschorn, an employee at Harry's Florist. "We get a lot of business from people who are shopping for other things. With all these stores closing, it's going to get tougher."
The Huberth & Peters survey found that the market for retail space in midtown Manhattan was still strong, with a vacancy rate of just 4.65 percent. Near the intersecton of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, one of the most desirable locations in the world, Galleries Lafayette, the French department store chain, recently acquired the lease of Bonwit Teller, and Bergdorf Goodman opened a men's store -- although only steps away is a store for rent at 9 West 57th Street.
But on the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, the survey found vacancy rates of 12.6 percent and 14 percent, respectively. And in the Financial District, the rate was 20 percent -- "the kind of market, " Mr. Hirschfeld said, "that could take years to recover from."
Mr. Mendelson, who said he did not believe that more stores were becoming vacant but rather that empty stores were staying on the market longer, was skeptical about the prospects of several new shopping areas staked out in the boom of the 80's, including West Broadway in Soho and lower Fifth Avenue.
Although retailers have been opening stores near Union Square Park and West 14th Street is relatively stable, East 14th Street has sections where there are almost more empty stores than occupied ones.
"Going east on 14th, you really have some large gaps and holes in retail businesses," said Robert W. Walsh, executive director of the 14th Street-Union Square Local Developmnt Corporation. "Some people are talking about major drop-offs in business -- 40 to 50 percent. They're hurting. They're suffering."

HEADLINE: Police Rebut Daily News On Violence

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
Senior New York City police officials yesterday rebutted accusations by The Daily News that the newspaper's nine striking unions were engaged in a criminal conspiracy to disrupt circulation through violence and intimidation.
'To date, our investigations show that the acts of of violence and other types of criminal behavior are the acts of individuals and are not part of a coordinated effort," said the Chief of Department, Robert J. Johnston, testifying at a New York State legislative hearing on strike-related violence. 
 Chief Johnston, who appeared at the hearing on behalf of Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown, also questioned allegations made yesterday by The News's publisher, James Hoge, that there had been 700 serious incidents of "harassment, assault and damges to persons and property" since the bitter strike began on Oct. 25.
 
229 Serious Incidents
 The chief said the Police Department knew of only 229 serious incidents, including 107 arrests, 75 of which were of strikers.
The testimony by Chief Johnston -- who was accompanied by Chief of Detectives Joseph R. Borelli, Chief of Inspectional Services Daniel F. Sullivan and Chief of Patrol David W. Scott -- came a short time after Mr. Hoge had angrily reiterated his accusations of a violent conspiracy by union leaders.
The paper's publisher was the lead-off witness at the daylong hearing in Manhattan on a legislation proposed by Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro, Democrat of Brooklyn, that would outlaw the use of professional strike-breakers and replacement workers.
Although Mr. Hoge had given a series of interviews recently on local television news programs, his stormy 90-minute appearance yesterday was the first time he had been subjected to what amounted to a virtual cross-examination on his company's conduct during the strike and in the 10 months of fruitless contract talks that preceded it. Seated at long witness table in the elegant, burgundy-draped hearing room of the City Bar Association's hearing room on West 44th Street, Mr. Hoge was peppered with sharp and sometimes hostile questions from the legislators and their aides.
George E. McDonald, head of the Allied Printing Trades Council, who testified later on behalf on the striking unions, asserted that yesterday was the first time that he or any of the union leaders had been in the same room with Mr. Hoge in two years.
 
Free Enterprise
 Mr. Hoge, in an impassioned statement, said union-led violence and threats were nothing less than a direct attack on the American principle of free enterprise.
"Today it is The Daily News," he said, rapping the witness table with his knuckles. "Tomorrow it could be any other newspaper or magazine engaged in a labor dispute, or any delicatessen and supermarket, or any drugstore. What is involved here is a choice between the rule of law and the rule of force."
Mr. Hoge, promising he would produce documented proof of a conspiracy, told the panel of state legislators -- including Assemblyman Barbaro and Senator James L. Lack, Republican of Suffolk County -- that such a wave of assaults and harassment "could not have been as swiftly mounted as it was and could not be as sustained as it is without centralized planning and production."
But Chief Borelli told the hearing that in all of the cases of strike-related criminality the police had investigated, "each one seems to have involved someone getting upset and doing what they did."
"We don't see a conspiracy, at least not just now," he said in response to questions from legislators.
 
$4 Million in Overtime
 Jeremy Travis, the criminal-justice coordinator for Mayor David N. Dinkins, added that in the 32 days since the strike began, the Police Department had spent $6.7 million on strike-related duty, of which $4 million was in overtime alone.
Some of the legislators at the hearing, like Assemblyman Barbaro, who had expressed public support for the strikers at a union-sponsored breakfast meeting earlier this month, suggested that the root of the violence might have been in The News's decision to hire permanent replacements for the strikers.
But Mr. Hoge, saying the 71-year-old newspaper's 1990 losses would rise as much as $35 million, to $200 million, as a result of the strike, strongly defended his company's legal right to hire permanent replacements.
He also denounced Mr. Barbaro's bill as "a dangerous and unworthy capitulation to criminality" and told reporters after the hearing that he resented what seemed to him to have been an accusatory line of questioning by the legislators.
 
'Entirely Legal'
 "Hiring replacement workers is an entirely legal act, as well as an economically necessary act if this country's industries are to remain efficient and competitive," Mr. Hoge said. "To say that The Daily News or any employer somehow causes unlawful acts of violence by engaging in purely lawful acts is turn on its head our whole sense of right and wrong, of justice and injustice."
At one point, Assemblyman Barbaro asked Chief Johnston whether there was any truth to union accusations that The News's chief security consultant, Richard J. Koehler -- a former City Correction Commissioner and senior police official -- had "personally contacted police field commanders and asked them to limit pickets from exercising lawful strike activity."
Chief Johnston said he was aware only of letters Mr. Koehler had sent to the department complaining of strike-related criminality. But he promised to check with borough and precinct-level commanders to see whether there was evidence of such contacts.
 
Security Assistance
 The chief added that last Jan. 25 -- three months before the unions' contracts expired and nine months before the strike erupted -- Mr. Hoge, Mr. Koehler and other management officials had met with high-ranking police officials, saying they expected a strike and would need security assistance.
The chief said the the department arranged for its intelligence division and other departments to establish a liaison with The News's own security staff.
At another point in the hearing, Assemblyman Barbaro questioned Mr. Hoge closely about The News's hiring of at least four out-of-state security agencies during the strike, which the unions have accused of providing provocateurs. Mr. Hoge said their role had been completely legitimate and promised to supply evidence of this.
 
'Duped' by The News
 The panel heard testimony on this issue from Jim McCully of Clarksville, Tenn., who said he had been "duped" by The Daily News into accepting a security job in which his main duty was to act as "bait" for strikers, then videotape any evidence. A similar account was given by Al Kaminsky, an independent trucker.
During the hearing, which which lasted from 10 A.M. to nearly 5 P.M., two other witnesses -- Thomas F. Hartnett, the State Labor Commissioner, and Eric J. Schmertz, Mayor Dinkins's Commissioner of Labor Relations, sharply criticized The News's refusal to accept repeated offers of mediation by government panels.
Mr. Hoge, asked about this earlier, said The News was determined to continue its use of the services of a Federal mediator in some of the continuing contract talks with the union.
Pressed by Mr. Barbaro over why he would not accept offers of help from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Dinkins or even John Cardinal O'Connor, head of the New York Roman Catholic Archdiocese, Mr. Hoge said he was reluctant to engage the services of any mediator with "a political agenda."
"The Cardinal has a political agenda?" Mr. Barbaro asked. "I take umbrage at that as a Catholic. Please don't tell me that my Cardinal has political aims."
"I'm not," Mr. Hoge replied.

HEADLINE: Dow Edges Up by 5.94 Points, to 2533.17

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
The stock market, following the bond market's lead, reversed its early losses around noon yesterday and closed higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had lost as much as 30 points, crossed into the plus column in the last half-hour of trading, ending at 2,533.17, up 5.94 points. 
 Higher oil prices and heightened Middle East tensions weighed on stocks in the morning. "Bonds generally ignored the higher crude prices," said Dennis E. Jarrett, market analyst at Kidder, Peabody, "and the equity and bond markets then moved in lock step."
The recovery, in light volume, was helped as oil prices retreated later in the day. The oil price on the New York Mercantile Exchange for January delivery ended up $1.05 after having climbed more than $2 earlier in the day as the United States pressed for a United Nations resolution setting a deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
"The bond and stock markets were quite happy to see oil come back down," said Peter J. Canelo, an investment strategist at Bear, Stearns & Company. "But it was still higher than when it started the day. There's not really anything you can point to as being a decisive move by any means."
Financial and growth stocks showed strength in the late move upward. "The market is acting as if the interest rate environement will continue to improve," Mr. Canelo said, "and it's not going to worry too much about oil."
On the Big Board, advancing issues totaled 785, almost matched by decliners, at 728. Trading was light at 131.5 million shares, compared with Friday's extremely light volume of 63.4 million shares. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 1.41, to 316.51.
Among active stocks in the financial sector, Citicorp gained 3/4, to 13 1/8; American Express added 1/2, to 20 1/4, and Federal National Mortgage, or Fannie Mae, gained 1/2, to 30 1/8. Wells Fargo gained 2 1/4, to 54 1/4, and Security Pacific tacked on 1 1/8, to 22 3/8.
MCA was the volume leader, slipping 1/4, to 65 1/8, after the announcement of its merger agreement with Matsushita. American depository shares of the Japanese company gained 2 1/4, to 128 3/4.
 
Stocks Fall in Tokyo
TOKYO, Tuesday, Nov. 27 (REUTERS) -- Japanese stock prices closed lower today. The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 139.35 points, or 0.59 percent, to 23,623.51. About 250 million shares were traded. On Monday, the Nikkei gained 362.58 points.

HEADLINE: Talking Business with Ammerman of Mattel;
Optimistic View Of Toy Industry

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
John W. Ammerman has been chairman and chief executive of Mattel Inc. for nearly four years after serving seven years as head of the company's international operations. He is given credit by analysts with turning around the company's once-flagging fortunes, largely by reinvigorating sales of Mattel's existing products, including the Barbie doll, one of the most successful toy lines of all time. 
 Despite a generally weak retail environment and lackluster results at other toy companies, Mattel's performance this year has been strong, and the company posted record earnings for the third quarter. Mr. Ammerman, who is 58 years old, was interviewed yesterday at the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif.
Q. From the perspective of a toy maker, how is this Christmas retail season shaping up, and what does it tell you about the economy?
A. From Mattel's perspective, this is going to be a very good Christmas. You have to understand that 50 percent of our business or more is outside the United States, and of that total of international business the vast majority is in Europe, where the economy is strong. In the United States, we're also going to have a good Christmas because we have the right products and sound marketing. And as we look at history, toys have done well in periods when the economy is not as strong as you'd like it to be.
Q. Have you noticed any changes in the types of toys being purchased this year? Is there evidence of belt-tightening as parents shop for their children?
A. It's a little early to tell. About half of all toys are sold in the fourth quarter. We'll have to wait until the Christmas season is over to evaluate whether higher-priced or lower-priced toys did comparatively better. One would anticipate that lower-priced toys would do somewhat better in these economic times in the United States.
Q. What is the general outlook for growth in the toy industry?
A. The future of the industry is good. Clearly, if one looks at the amount of money that is spent on leisure-time activities in the United States, it's growing at a rapid rate, so if we can produce products that appeal to children and parents, the outlook is positive. Second, there is a mini baby boom developing, and that bodes well for the 1990's.
It's difficult to look at a particular year and say whether the industry is healthy or not. The levels of inventory that are available in retail stores play a part. If the trade is careful about asset management, they will hold inventories down. Then the results for manufacturers may not be so good, and I think we're seeing that in 1990. Q. Do you see an industry consolidation?
A. Consolidation is clearly occurring on the retail side. Maybe it will occur on the manufacturing side. It's hard to forecast.
On the retail side, consolidation means we have to be more aggressive, and one way we've done that is we have key account management teams that work with major retailers to help them meet their objectives, whether those objectives are inventory turnover or cash flow or return on investment. We have found that our business has prospered with those accounts.
As far as acquisitions go, the issue that we are interested in is core products, core products being those that will endure year after year. Those are the ones we'd be interested in. We're not interested in a company whose volume might be strong today, but that might see its volume disappear a couple of years into the future.
Q. A lot of toy companies invest most of their time and money in trying to develop huge new mega-hit toys, the next Cabbage Patch dolls. You've avoided that strategy. Why?
A. Our basic thrust is our core products -- Barbie, Hot Wheels, our Disney line, large dolls. In the third quarter, our core products accounted for 78 percent of our volume. That gives us the stability to withstand seasonal or cyclical economic trends that might affect others in the industry.
That's not to say we wouldn't be happy to find ourselves with something that does well in a short period of time. In just two years, we're up to a volume of $150 million this year on Disney toys. Incremental volume on Barbie has grown $270 million in three years, to $700 million. That's the kind o mega-hit we're interested in.

Three senior Soviet officials met United States Government representatives today in Washington to lobby for loans to enable Moscow to buy much-needed American grain and meat, Government and trade officials said today.
The Soviet officials also briefed the Bush Administration on the acute food shortage in the Soviet Union and discussed the outlook for future food purchases, they added.
But Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter dealt the Soviet mission a setback when he told reporters that Moscow must liberalize its emigration laws to be considered for such loans. He said United States money for food-aid programs handled by his department was running low and added that no official Soviet request had been made for emergency aid.
The visiting Soviet officials are the chairman of the state commission on food procurement, L .M. Timofhishin; the deputy minister for foreign trade and economic relations, Yuri Chumakov, and the head of the key Soviet grain-importing agency, Exportkhleb, Oleg Klimov.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL FOR MCA;
$6.13 Billion MCA Sale to Japanese

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
MCA Inc., one of the nation's largest entertainment companies, agreed yesterday to be acquired by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company. The deal, valued at $6.13 billion plus stock in a television station, will be the largest purchase ever of an American company by a Japanese company.
The purchase price is $66 a share in cash and shares in an MCA subsidiary that would own WWOR-TV, the New Jersey-based television station owned by MCA. Analysts yesterday valued the deal at about $69 a share, lower than the $75 or more a share that MCA's chairman, Lew R. Wasserman, had been led to believe he would receive when preliminary talks began in September, one person involved in the talks said. 
 MCA stock fell 25 cents yesterday, closing at $65.125, below the offer price, in part because the deal will not close until early 1991.
 
Prospects Deteriorated
 But MCA's board, meeting Sunday, was apparently resigned to the fact that the economy -- and the cmpany's prospects -- had deteriorated since then, and that no rival bidder had emerged. The 77-year-old Mr. Wasserman said in an interview yesterday, "I feel satisfied or I wouldn't have recommended the deal to the board."
Some experts on corporate acquisitions said the Matsushita-MCA deal may well be representative of deals in the early 1990's. They see more American companies being sold to foreigners, particularly the Japanese, for lack of an American bidder. And they expect prices well below what those companies might have sold for in the 1980's, in the view of Arthur Fleischer, the chairman of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, which represented a large MCA shareholder, David Geffen, in the transaction.
MCA, with 1989 sales of $3.38 billion, owns Universal Studios, Universal Pictures, MCA Records, theme parks and the G. P. Putnam's Sons publishing house, as well as a stake in the USA cable network. In addition to the divestiture of WWOR, the company's Yosemite National Park and Curry Company will be sold to an American buyer within a year under terms of the agreement.
Matsushita (pronounced maht-SOOSH-tah) had revenues of $37.75 billion in the year ended March 31 and is best known for its consumer-electronics products sold under the Panasonic, Quasar and Technics names. But it controls an empire of 87 companies in Japan and many abroad, and its interests include computers, industrial equipment and semiconductors. Like its competitor, the Sony Corporation, which acquired Columbia Pictures and CBS Records, Matsushita is following the strategy that a manufacturer of "hardware" like high-definition television sets will not be competitive unless it also controls "software," like movies and recorded music, to play on that equipment.
 
Strength to Compete
 MCA's president, Sidney J. Sheinberg, said yesterday that the company needed such a deal because "size denotes resources -- as you expand, you need more and more to compete."
Critics of the sale feared growing Japanese cultural influence through motion pictures and television programs and loss of American control of an important industry, which is an export powerhouse for the United States. J. Richard Iverson, president of the American Electronics Association, said foreign investors were "picking up everything from womb to tomb in the communications field." He added, "If you control the production of material, the display of material and the manufacturing of equipment, you have a significant advantage in the future information age."
Supporters argued that the sale would bring additional financial resources to MCA, and viewed the acquisition as a sign of America's economic health and an increasingly integrated global economy.
Prof. Henry R. Nau, associate dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University, said: "If it makes sense as a business deal, it's something we should accept. Japanese and American markets are increasingly integrated, and we shouldn't assume that any acquisition is contrary to our interests."
The MCA-Matsushita deal capped days of tense negotiations during which talks collapsed over a $2-a-share difference in price and then resumed again on Thanksgiving afternoon when the offer was increased by the $2. After a 13 1/2-hour meeting on Sunday, the MCA board unanimously approved the offer. Price was not an issue at the meeting, one person involved in the talks said. The deal was announced yesterday once the final details were in place but it ran into additional tensions on Friday night and Sunday night.
 
Took on Momentum
 Neverthless it took on a momentum of its own.
It seemed unlikely that MCA would attract another buyer at a comparable price over the next several years at least, particularly from an American bidder.
Felix Rohatyn, the partner at Lazard Freres & Company, the investment banking firm, told the MCA board during the Sunday meeting that only a handful of companies in the world would be able to write a $6 billion check for MCA.
Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Sheinberg first met with the Matsushita representatives Masahiko Hirata, a specialist in finance, and Keiya Toyonago, a senior managing director, in Los Angeles last month.
Before beginning the talks in New York that began last week, Michel Ovitz, the head the Creative Artists Agency, a talent agency, who brought the companies together, had indicated to Mr. Wasserman that Matsushita would be willing to pay about $75 a share, said two people who were involved in the negotiations. Mr. Ovitz did not return phone calls yesterday. As a result, when the meetings began last Monday and Matsushita offered $60 in cash, Mr. Wasserman said he would not even discuss the offer and made no conteroffer, several people involved in the talks said. One person said some MCA executives wonder whether Mr. Ovitz really did get the $75 figure from Matsushita.
 
Better Bid Sought
 By late Tuesday Matsushita had improved its offer to $64 in cash. Mr. Wasserman, one executive involved in the deal said, asked for a better bid.
By Wednesday, Matsushita informed MCA that $64 in cash was the last and best bid. "We told them we would schedule a board meeting and not recommend the deal," said one person close to MCA. The MCA board was scheduled for a telephone meeting about the price on Thursday.
That evening Mr. Wasserman had dinner with Robert Strauss, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a former United States trade representative, who acted as a go-between. The MCA chairman is said to have indicated that if the Japanese raised their bid by $2 a share, he would recommend it to his board.
About 6 o'clock Thanksgiving morning, Mr. Strauss called Herbert A. Allen, the investment banker from Allen & Company who was advising Matsushita, to suggest that MCA might accept a $66 cash offer. Mr. Ovitz had gone back to Los Angeles, but was involved by telephone.
 
Matsushita Persuaded
 Sometime Thursday morning, the pair persuaded Matsushita to raise its price to $66 in cash. One person involved in the talks said Mr. Ovitz had argued that this was a make-or-break issue and that they had to give a little. When they made the offer to Mr. Wasserman that afternoon, he indicated that he would recommend the deal to the board.
But the end was hardly in sight. Mr. Sheinberg, who was staying at his appartment at Trump Tower with his wife, Lorraine, canceled plans to go to the home of the producer-director Steven Spielberg, in East Hampton, L.I., for Thanksgiving dinner, instead dining at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan.
Throughout the weekend teams of lawyers struggled with the contracts and a number of other issues that made talks extremely tense at several points. But at least two people involved in the talks said that after the price had been settled, they basically expected the deal to close.
 
Important Elements
 One person involved in the talks said one element that was crucial to MCA was that the deal be as airtight as possible so that in the 30 or 40 days until it was completed, Matsushita could not back out. Matsushita, for its part, wanted to assure itself that major MCA shareholders like David Geffen, who owns 10 million shares of the company's 93 million shares, could not tender to another party.
Matsushita sought lockup agreements from such shareholders so that they would agree to tender their shares to Matsushita so long as Matsushita's bid remained outstanding.
Additionally the Japanese company was concerned about signing long-term deals with top management. One person said Matsushita was very worried about what happened at Sony. After Sony acquired CBS Records, friction with its management led to the departure of CBS Records' chairman, Walter Yetnikoff. Sony has found it necessary to put in a new management team and take a much more active role in the running of the company. "Matsushita did not want that to happen," this person said.
Mr. Wasserman made a special arrangement for the sale of his stock. He owns roughly five million shares of MCA stock. But instead of selling for cash, he will receive preferred stock of a wholly owned subsidiary of Matsushita that has been organized for the acquisition. The structure of his preferred stock agreement also became an extremely tense issue.
 
Some Disappointment
 When the board met Sunday, "there was some disappointment about the price," according to one board member who declined to be named. Mr. Rohatyn, in a presentation to the board, argued that if one used the yardstick of other deals, like Time Inc.'s merger with Warner Communications or Sony's purchase of Columbia, this offer was in the best interest of the shareholders.
But some points still remained unresolved as late as yesterday morning.
As part of its efforts to secure the transaction, Matsushita received an option to acquire 16.9 million shares at $71. The effect of the option is to increase the purchase price should a rival bidder emerge. Under the agreement, Matsushita would receive $125 million should MCA accept a higher offer from another party.
Despite the fact that the deal is complete, MCA was still extremely sensitive to possible criticism that it was selling out to the Japanese, who might attempt to make creative decisions. Mr. Sheinberg said: "We impressed upon our clients the fact that our businesses would continue to be run in the fashion they had been run. The idea that the Japanese interfere in making movies and writing books is borderline silly."
 Neverthless, one person close to MCA acknowledged that the thought of Japanese owning two American movie companies is disturbing. And the cultural difference surfaced even at Sunday's board meeting, albeit as a joking matter. Matsushita has a 250-year business plan, one board member said. "Lew told them he has his own 500-year business plan."
The reaction to the deal was varied and strong. Alfred Sikes, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said yesterday that the MCA deal would probably improve the chances that the agency would eliminate regulations that prohibit American television networks from buying Hollywood studios.
Current regulations prohibit the television networks from owning an interest in the shows they buy from Hollywood. They also prohibit the networks from syndicating television programs both in the United States and abroad. Representative John D. Dingell, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has announced hearings on regulations, which prevented the sale of MCA to General Electric, which owns NBC.
If the rules are eased to permit such mergers, industry executives think the Walt Disney Company would seriously consider an offer for one of the networks, probably CBS. Paramount Communications has long been rumored to have some interest in a merger with Capital Cities/ABC. NBC, which is owned by the General Electric Company, has also shown some interest in being able to acquire or merge with a studio.
Federal regulations also prohibit foreign entities from owning American television stations, thus requiring the spinoff of WWOR.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL FOR MCA;
Dedication to Entertainment Has Been Profitable at MCA

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
No Hollywood studio has adhered as closely as MCA Inc. to the theme that "there is no business like show business."
MCA, the parent of Universal Pictures, has always been based in Los Angeles and has not strayed far from its core business of movies and television. For decades it has been run by Lew R. Wasserman, its chairman, and Sidney J. Sheinberg, its president. The two pride themselves on their conservative and businesslike approach to entertainment, even though they live in the heart of an industry that does not always follow those precepts.
At MCA, television and movie productions accounted for about half of the company's $3.38 billion in revenue and half of its $191.8 million in profits last year. 
 MCA's devotion to entertainment has served it well. Universal has built up a library of thousands of movies and has specialized in producing hourlong television programs.
 
Movie Business Has Improved
 Although its film operations ran into problems several years ago, performance has picked up this year under a new chairman of the motion picture group, Thomas P. Pollock.
Now Universal will soon bring out "Kindergarten Cop" with Arnold Schwarzenegger for the holidays. The studio will also release "Havana," a new film by Sidney Pollack, who directed "Out of Africa," that stars Robert Redford.
Earlier this year the studio released both "Bird on a Wire" and "Back to the Future III," both of which did respectably if not superbly at the box-office. The later was produced by Steven Spielberg. Universal has a special arrangement with the popular director who has produced numerous films for the studio.
 
Movies Thrive
 MCA does not break out profits from films separately, but its revenues from its movie business have more than doubled, to $466 million since 1987.
Universal's television production business has run into tough times, as have other television production studios. The problems in television have particularly hurt Universal, since the company specializes in one-hour series. Over the last decade, television stations have preferred to buy rerun rights to half-hour comedies rather than rights to hourlong shows.
Universal Television has been bolstering its comedy production and now has two series, "Major Dad" and "Coach," on the air. But it has also been able to get some value out of its hour-length shows through a circuitous route. Unable to sell reruns to television stations at acceptable prices, it has sold them to the USA Network, an advertiser-supported cable service in which MCA has an interest. That has helped the ratings of USA Network, according to Richard Simon, a media analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
MCA's record business remains relatively small, compared with giants like CBS and Warner Brothers. Now headed by Al Teller, a former top executive at CBS, the label has strength in rhythm and blues and country music and can now have a stronger presence in the pop business with the acquisition of Geffen Records last April for 10 million shares of MCA stock, which were then valued at $540 million. The company, headed by David Geffen, is strong in pop music.
 
Theme Park Troubles
 The theme park business is one area where MCA has arguably not paid enough attention. MCA stubbed its toe badly last summer when it opened its Universal Studios/Florida in Orlando, Fla., without all of the rides able to run.
Nevertheless, Gordon Crawford, a media analyst at Capital Research Markets, believes that the park will eventually run smoothly and the company will begin to expand in Japan and Britain. Last year the theme park and its studio tour in Hollywood generated $1.7 billion in revenues,
Mr. Crawford noted that the business was one with high profit margins, and added that every movie company was becoming aware of the need to merchandise its characters more effectively.
Beyond that, MCA controls the Putnam Publishing Group, which includes G. P. Putnam's Sons, the hardcover publishing house that publshes books by authors like Dick Francis, Tom Clancy and Art Buchwald.
 
Extensive Promotions
 Putnam's paperback arm consists of Berkeley and Jove, two aggressive publishers that do extensive promotion. During the last several years, they are known to have made money while the book-publishing industry was, in general, stagnant or struggling.
The entire MCA empire has been built under the leadership of Mr. Wasserman, who has taken a conservative approach to the economics of the entertainment business. MCA has never been willing to borrow heavily, as have competitors like Warner Brothers, nor has it been willing to expand very aggressively into other media businesses, as other studios have done.
Warner, for example, prospered from its investment in cable television, while MCA preferred to stay in entertainment software. On the other hand, MCA never suffered the losses of an Atari, the game company whose financial debacle hurt Warner so badly.
Essentially Mr. Wasserman has stuck to the businesses he knows best, and he has done so with a relish for his role of a Hollywood leader and the power that brings. Indeed, few in Hollywood had had any idea Mr. Wasserman saw fit to sell his company even as he advanced into his 70's.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Rise $1.05, To $32.95

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Crude oil prices rose yesterday for the third straight trading day. Traders and analysts attributed the gain to the belief that the United Nations Security Council might authorize the use of force against Iraq.
Oil for January delivery soared to $34.25 a barrel yesterday morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before settling somewhat to close at $32.95, up $1.05. The gain followed an increase of $2.27 a barrel Friday and a 72-cent rise on Wednesday. 
 "Basically the oil market is responding to the new fears of war, and since the Thanksgiving holiday, we have had some real tough talk from President Bush," said Peter I. Cardillo, the commodities research director at Jesup, Josephthal & Company, a New York brokerage.
 
Could Reach $36
 Mr. Cardillo said the price of crude could climb to $36 a barrel if, as predicted in news reports yesterday, the Security Council passes a resolution on Thursday sanctioning armed action against Iraq if it does not withdraw its forces from Kuwait by some time in January.
The price of crude slipped back in late trading on rumors that the United States might fail to obtain support from other Security Council members for a Jan. 1 deadline for an Iraqi pullout. But no final decision had been made by last evening.
Traders also cited reports that the Soviet Union had accused Iraq of preventing Soviet citizens from leaving the country and had threatened to take a tougher stance. But crude prices remain well below the record of $41.15 a barrel, reached during trading on Oct. 10.
Oil prices have tended to rise and fall with war fears for nearly four months because of traders' concern that a war in the Persian Gulf could destroy a significant portion of the world's oil production capacity.
 
Oil Products Rise
 Gasoline for December delivery rose 1.8 cents a gallon on the New York Merc to close at 84.20 cents, while heating oil for December delivery rose 3.72 cents a gallon to settle at 92.38 cents. The warm weather in North America this month is holding down the price of heating oil and also of crude oil, as refiners buy less oil to process, said Thomas P. Blakeslee of the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Only a fraction of the oil and refined products consumed in the United States is traded on the exchange. But futures prices are the benchmark for the cash price at which cargoes of crude and refined products actually change hands.
Prices for actual oil and refined product cargoes moved up in lock step with futures prices yesterday, and were unchanged in the late afternoon after the exchange's close of trading, said Andrew B. Shasha, an energy broker at Star Supply Inc. in Englewood, N.J.
 
Supplies Are Abundant
 Energy trading continues to reflect war fears rather than oil supply and demand, said Nauman Barakat, a senior energy trader at Merrill Lynch. Without the possibility of war, the price of oil would be no higher than $25 a barrel, he said.
Indeed, the recent rise in oil prices has come despite abundant supplies. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries produced 22.3 million barrels a day in July, before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, and has been producing 22.8 million barrels in recent weeks, said Ken Miller, editorial director of the OPEC Listener, a petroleum analysis service.
The increase is partly seasonal, because worldwide demand for oil tends to rise during the Northern Hemisphere's winter. But current production levels indicate that the 3.6 million barrels that Kuwait and Iraq were exporting daily before a United Nations embargo was imposed on Aug. 6 have been more than replaced, Mr. Miller said.
Saudi Arabia has led the way, increasing production by about 2.4 million barrels a day. The official Saudi news agency yesterday reported an agreement to set up a joint venture in South Korea to refine and market 175,000 barrels a day of Saudi oil.
"It shows that despite sitting in the middle of all this, they're thinking of the post-crisis period," Mr. Miller said.
Traders probably would have pushed up prices more if recent headlines regarding the possible Security Council resolution had appeared two months ago, Mr. Blakeslee of Pegasus said. "They've heard so many rumors and reports that traders are waiting for it to be signed and sealed before taking action," he said. "It's the 'boy who cried wolf' reaction."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Pricing a Station In Biggest Market

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
JUST what is a television station worth in the New York market? That question will soon be answered, as investors get a chance to buy the first "pure play" available. WWOR-TV is being spun off from MCA Inc. as part of its deal to be acquired by Matsushita.
The figures bandied about yesterday covered a wide spectrum, reflecting questions about how much prices have fallen and whether any companies would step forward and try to buy the station. 
 "My guess is that it is worth $400 million to $500 million," said Harold Vogel, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, who noted that MCA paid $387 million for WWOR in 1987. "The two key factors are that, one, they did improve the ratings, so that is a positive," but he added that the second factor was negative.
"There is a full-blown recession in the Northeast," he said, "and that diminishes the value."
The plan, made necessary by Federal regulations that bar foreign companies from controlling American television stations, is to spin off WWOR to MCA stockholders. The ratio will be one new WWOR share for each five MCA shares held.
Mr. Vogel's estimate works out to a range of $4.30 to $5.40 for each MCA share from the spinoff, in addition to the $66 in cash that Matsushita agreed to pay in the deal announced yesterday. But the stock market appeared not to be convinced of that value. MCA shares fell 25 cents, to $65.125, below even the cash portion of the offer. Part of the discount reflects the fact that the acquisition is not expected to be completed until early next year.
One money manager, who asked not to be identified, said he thought that the station's value was about $4.25 per MCA share, but that he expected the new stock to trade for much less -- $2.50 to $3.
Mario Gabelli, a money manager whose Gabelli & Company owns three million MCA shares, said he thought the station was worth about $300 million, but that the trading value was well below that, about $2 per MCA share, or $10 per WWOR share.
Figures on WWOR operations are sparse, making it difficult to place a value on the station. But that situation should change by early next week, when financial details of the deal are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
MCA said yesterday that the operating cash flow of the station, which is based in Secaucus, N.J., and serves the New York market on Channel 9, was $31 million last year. Since there will be about 18.6 million shares outstanding, that works out to cash flow of about $1.67 per new share, or 33 cents per MCA share. Some analysts speculate that the station has annual revenues of about $150 million.
Based on the cash-flow figure provided by MCA, a value of $4.30 would imply a cash-flow multiple of 15 times, very high in the current market. To justify that range, investors would probably have to assume either that cash flow was likely to rise, or be willing to pay a substantial premium for a station in the nation's largest television market.
The other reason to hope for a high price would be a possible future acquisition of the station. "Anindependent single station doesn't make any economic sense, long-term," Mr. Gabelli said.
People involved in the MCA-Matsushita talks said that after their discussions became known more than one expression of interest was received from possible buyers of the station. But those expressions were not pursued, in part because of concerns that selling the station could delay the deal.
Potential buyers could include the Walt Disney Company, Paramount Communications and Chris-Craft Industries, all of which own at least one independent television station -- a station not affiliated with a network -- but none in New York. Disney and Paramount spokesmen declined to comment; Chris-Craft officials did not return telephone calls.
In the current market for financing, it is unlikely that a much smaller company seeking to expand would be able to get financing for the acquisition, investment bankers say.
Two companies that own independent television stations, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and the Tribune Company of Chicago, are ruled out because they already own New York stations. Mr. Murdoch became an American citizen to allow his company to own stations in the United States.
Speculation about a possible takeover of WWOR could keep the shares trading higher than they otherwise would. Many companies that own independent television stations trade at less than 10 times operating cash flow.
One variable that has not been disclosed is what takeover defenses, if any, will be built into the company when it goes public. Another question is how much debt the company will be carrying. Harold Haas, the treasurer of MCA, said he understood that the station would have no long-term debt, but might have some borrowings for working capital. He said the cash-flow figures did not include any interest payments.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Rebound Strongly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose in a strong turnaround yesterday as dealers shrugged off worries about heightened tensions in the Middle East and rising oil prices and bought securities.
Much of the early decline in prices took place during European trading, when reports first appeared about a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force unless Iraqi troops withdraw from Kuwait by sometime early next year. Those reports helped to push up oil prices. 
 But the selling stopped soon after trading began in the United States, and even though oil prices remained strong a recovery was under way by early afternoon.
 
'No Longer Intimidated'
 "What we saw was a demonstration of the bond market's resiliency," said William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reyolds. "Developments like a sharp jump in energy prices are now being interpreted as a force that almost assuredly will push us into recession. The bond market is no longer intimidated by rising energy prices."
Reports on comments by Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, may also have prompted some buying, market participants said. Speaking in Scottsdale, Ariz., to a business group, he was reported as saying that warding off a recession was now the Federal Reserve's most important priority, but he added that the Fed must not lose its fight against inflation.
The Fed is concerned about the risk of an economic downturn, he said, but suggested that the central bank was not about to ease monetary policy in an aggressive manner. "We've got to be careful not to overreact to today's weak economic numbers," he said.
 
Stronger '91 Growth Seen
 In his speech, Mr. Parry projected that economic growth for all of 1990 would amount to a sluggish five-tenths of 1 percent, but that output would be somewhat stronger in 1991, primarily because of continued export growth.
Whatever the cause, the turnaround in bond prices was striking. In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 103 18/32 late yesterday, up 7/32, to yield 8.42 percent, down from 8.43 percent late Friday.
Early in yesterday's session the benchmark issue was down by as much as five-eighths of a point.
Among notes, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 19/32, up 3/32, to yield 8.26 percent.
In advance of today's auction of new two-year Treasury notes, the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.48 percent. And the five-year notes to be sold on Wednesday were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 7.90 percent.
 
Rates on New Bills Down
 Interest rates on new three-month and six-month Treasury bills fell at the weekly auction yesterday.
Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.02 percent, down from 7.08 percent a week ago. It is the lowest rate on a three-month bill since early August 1988.
Bids on six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 6.96 percent, compared with 7.05 percent at last week's auction. The rate on the new six-month bill is the lowest since the auction of July 5, 1988.
 
Notes by BP America
 Activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by a number of new debt issues, including a $300 million offering of seven-year guaranteed notes by BP America Inc. The 8 7/8 percent notes, which mature Dec. 1, 1997, were priced at 99.56 to yield 8.961 percent, 80 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are guaranteed by the British Petroleum Company, BP America's parent, are noncallable for life.
Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the transaction. The issue is rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Issue From Merrill Lynch
 In addition to the BP offering, Merrill Lynch & Company offered $125 million of two-year, seven-month notes. The 8.90 percent securities, which mature June 1, 1992, were priced at 100, or par, 1.38 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 3/4 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
Merrill Lynch acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was light, market participants said, but despite the limited activity prices of most issues rose by a quarter of a point to half a point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of the most widely quoted issues were unchanged on the day.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

Dollar and Gold Advance As Mideast Concerns Grow

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced moderately against most leading currencies yesterday, as traders reacted to growing concerns about the crisis in the Middle East.
Gold prices moved moderately higher, gaining $2.40, to close at $386.10 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $386.15 an ounce, up $2.40. 
 Analysts said foreign-exchange traders were focusing on the Bush Administration's attempts to win support for a proposed United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing military force to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
Investors tend to view the dollar as a haven during times of political uncertainty overseas.
 
Benefits for the Mark
 Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for the Bank of New York Company, said other currencies -- in particular the German mark -- were also beneficiaries of fears about war. The mark declined against the dollar, but gained against other currencies.
The dollar closed at 1.4870 marks in New York, up from 1.4860 on Friday. The American currency rose as far as 1.4948 marks in New York but then fell back, leaving traders skeptical about the dollar's chances for holding its gains.
Meanwhile, the yen suffered as war speculation raised questions about the Japanese economy. Japan is heavily dependent on the Middle East for its energy needs, importing 99 percent of the oil it uses. The dollar jumped to 129.05 yen in New York from late Friday's 127.10.
The dollar turned in a mixed performance against the British pound. Sterling rose to $1.96895 in New York from late Friday's $1.9668.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.2620 Swiss francs, up from 1.2600; 5.0130 French francs, up from 5.0115; 1,116.125 Italian lire, up from 1,115.50, and 1.16075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16015.
Silver prices rose, with the metal gaining 2.3 cents to close at $4.149 an ounce on the Comex in New York.

Midway Delays A Sale to USAir

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Midway Airlines Inc. said today that it had agreed to delay the closing on the sale of its Philadelphia operations to USAir Group Inc. to give the Justice Department more time to review the deal.
Midway, based in Chicago, announced in October that it would sell its costly Philadelphia operations to USAir, the nation's seventh-biggest carrier, for $64.5 million.
The deal was expected to face tough antitrust scrutiny because it would give USAir, already the largest operator in Philadelphia, authority for routes to Toronto and Montreal, more landing slots, 11 gates and other facilities.
A Midway spokeswoman said the Justice Department "just wished further time to look it over and asked us not to close before mid-December."
Like their bigger rivals, Midway and USAir have been hurt by high oil prices because of the Mideast crisis and a weakening domestic economy. This year the industry is expected to have its worst financial performance since deregulation in 1978.
Midway said in September that it would cut its staff by 500 people, or 10 percent. USAir, which is based in Arlington, Va., has also had to scale back its ambitious growth plans and has announced the layoffs of hundreds of employees.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Repair Jobs Are Going High Tech

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
AS computers, robots and other high-technology equipment play a bigger part in daily life, jobs in high-technology services are becoming one of the fastest-growing employment areas, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Stock market analysts might also want to take a look at companies in the field because of the many changes that are expected. 
 Messages for both job seekers and for analysts are in a new study, "Future Trends II -- Perspectives on the International High-Technology Services Industry in the 1990's." It was prepared by Andersen Consulting, a unit of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Company, for the Association for Services Management International, which is based in Fort Myers, Fla.
In an interview in New York last week, George Keller, the association's executive vice president, said he was concerned about finding enough technicians. His organization represents 6,000 high-tech service executives and professionsls who manage about 500,000 technicians at companies like Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment and I.B.M. The need for these technicians is expected to increase by 50 percent by 1995.
"By the middle of the 1990's, high-tech services will become truly international." Mr. Keller said. He had recently returned from a trip to South Africa, where, he pointed out, managers will face difficulties providing high-tech training to people whose backgrounds and education vary widely. He also said technical services would be greatly needed in Eastern Europe.
Computers have become commonplace in handling airline and train reservations and now handle emergencies such as dispatching police and fire units. Robotics is used in many industries, including manufacturing, printing, and utilities. High-tech services not only involve repairing the hardware but also include maintaining and updating software, consulting and training.
The Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics says the computer service technician field is one of the 20 fastest-growing occupations, along with computer systems analyst and operator, office machine repairer, electronic data processing operator and mechanical engineering technician.
High-tech services appear to be replacing the simpler repair jobs of the past because it is often more efficient to replace some electronic equipment than to repair it. Also, more sophisticated technicians are now needed to keep telecommunications systems and other electronic equipment working.
The Andersen Consulting study predicted that traditional service delivery, a man or women with a bag of tools doing a specific repair job, would be replaced by remote diagnostics. Also, more problem solving and project management will be required of the technicians as service organizations try to focus on training customers to handle equipment and on anticipating customers' needs.
These were among the other findings of the study:
*The Pacific Basin will be the fastest-growing area in terms of electronics revenue, increasing about 16 percent yearly. In Europe, revenue will grow 13 percent; North America will gain 8 percent.
*Some companies are better positioned than others in terms of technical service. The study said the International Business Machines Corporation was well positioned internationally, but the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, while strong in North America and Europe, was weaker in the Pacific Basin. It judged Wang Laboratories to be poorly positioned in all three markets.
*Customers will focus on service performance more than on the instant profitability of the equipment. "Service is one area in which American companies are not only competitive but also extremely well positioned to take advantage of opportunities around the world," Mr. Keller commented.
Electronics manufacturers, understanding that repeat sales will be tied to customer satisfaction, will have to increase and change their training of technical personnel and the managers in charge of the technicians.

HEADLINE: Poland Votes Its Impatience

 BODY:
The first-round results of Poland's presidential election may advance political pluralism. They also reflect explosive social discontent. The winner of next month's runoff will face mounting public impatience for a better life. That's reason enough for America and Western Europe to accelerate existing programs to help Poles and other East Europeans make the transition from Communism. Otherwise, last year's democratic euphoria could become next year's angry disillusionment.
Impatient with the failure of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's policies to bring rapid prosperity, four out of five voters rejected his presidential candidacy. He resigned as Prime Minister yesterday. Solidarity's chairman, Lech Walesa, and Stanislaw Tyminski, a once-obscure businessman, face a runoff next month. 
 Mr. Walesa's campaign stressed his claim that he understood his fellow Poles better than anyone else. Mr. Tyminski portrayed himself as the incarnation of free enterprise. It's therefore difficult to predict their policies. But whatever else they finally stand for, both are friendly toward the U.S. It would insult Poland's hard-won democracy for Washington to play favorites. America's real interest lies in easing the economic anxieties highlighted by the first-round results.
Poles unrealistically but understandably expected that the end of Communism would instantly bring living standards up to West European levels. After decades of misdirected state investment, the most anyone should have expected is a long period of adjustment.
Bravely, the Mazowiecki Government rushed forward with radical reforms, squeezing household budgets and throwing thousands out of work. Now it has paid the price extracted when democratic governments ask for sacrifice without showing convincing results.
Only Poles can make the reforms succeed. But outsiders can help promote that success. What's needed most is debt relief, easy access to international markets and programs to encourage private investment. Western governments have made a start on each, but these efforts now need to be pushed forward.
Germany is preoccupied with reunification, and Washington with the Persian Gulf; Eastern Europe no longer draws the most urgent attention of the world. Yet the cost of more generous relief is trivial compared with that, say, of the superfluous anti-Soviet weapons systems Congress left in this year's budget.
And the stakes are large. The U.S. fought two World Wars and a cold war in part to assure Eastern Europe a democratic future. Poland's democracy has now shown itself a living reality.

HEADLINE: How to Let Arab States Work It Out With Iraq

 BODY:
To the Editor:
What has been peculiar about the debate on President Bush's decision to send additional troops to the Persian Gulf to provide an "offensive capability" (front page, Nov. 9) is that it has been (1) an argument over means rather than goals, and (2) little attention has been given to the effectiveness of other means. 
 For example, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Under Secretary George Ball on the Nov. 13 "MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour," both assumed that the goal should be to force Iraq out of Kuwait, and devoted their arguments to the means for accomplishing that goal.
But only a brief glance at how the situation arose shows how unrealistic such a goal is. A few days before the Iraqi attack on Kuwait, Saddam Hussein called in the United States Ambassador to Iraq, April C. Glaspie. He repeated his complaints that Kuwait had violated the agreements of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on oil supplies and prices, and that Kuwait had stolen Iraqi oil by tapping deposits on the Iraqi side of the border. Also clearly on his mind were the boundaries of Kuwait, fixed by Britain in 1923 in such a way as to deny Iraq a port on the gulf.
Ms. Glaspie, acting on instructions, replied that the United States had "no opinion" on Arab versus Arab conflicts like Iraq's border dispute with Kuwait. Ms. Glaspie later conceded that President Hussein undoubtedly understood this to be a green light for settling his differences with Kuwait by force.
If President Hussein now withdraws under the threat of military action or the actuality of sanctions, it will mean the end of his rule and most likely the end of his life, as well.
On the question of means, Mr. Kissinger approved of President Bush's decision to deploy more troops because it would increase the pressure on Saddam Hussein. He then went on to say that an attack might still be necessary -- and soon. Mr. Ball argued that the pressure should be economic sanctions, and they should be given time, even a year or more.
If the attack that Mr. Kissinger has in mind is by air alone, the experience in Korea and Vietnam suggests that it probably would not work. If the attack includes a land invasion against an enemy as battle-hardened as the Iraqis, dug in to defensive positions and equipped with chemical and biological weapons, American casualties would be horrendous.
As for sanctions, boycotts are not like wartime blockades. With Jordan, Iran and Yemen taking Iraq's side, a boycott is likely to leak.
In either case, in a few months the United States may well find itself standing alone except for Israel, and possibly Britain.
The alternative is to declare that our purpose was to prevent an invasion of Saudi Arabia and that since that purpose has been accomplished, we are turning responsibility over to the Arabs.
The result is most likely to be a negotiated settlement that gives Iraq a slice of Kuwait that includes a port. If the Arabs fail to rise to the crisis, Iraq may well take Saudi Arabia and the emirates. Saddam Hussein would then control 21.5 percent of global oil production. Oil prices would rise. But the United States would finally be forced to take the long-overdue steps to make itself independent of Middle East oil.
More important, Egypt and the other Arab states would be thoroughly alarmed and more likely to take responsibility for containing further Iraqi expansion.

HEADLINE: A Peruvian Is Laying Out Another Path

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
Hernando de Soto was irritated when a journalist credited him with secret authorship of Peru's new anti-drug policy.
"Not one initiative," Mr. de Soto, a Swiss-trained economist, corrected the journalist. "Seven new initiatives." 
 One year ago, Peru's brightest lights flocked around the presidential candidacy of the novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, but Mr. de Soto hung back.
When Alberto Fujimori, a virtual unknown, unexpectedly headed toward victory, he looked around for uncommitted talent. There was Mr. de Soto, a polished 49-year-old son of a diplomat with a stable of experts, a battery of word processors and an international reputation for innovative critiques of Latin American capitalism.
"Fuji was elected on June 10, and on June 13 he called me," Mr. de Soto recalled.
"I take more heat than the Prime Minister," Mr. de Soto continued, referring to Juan Carlos Hurtado Miller.
Indeed, Mr. Hurtado has complained that he is overshadowed by Mr. de Soto, whose title at the presidential palace is "personal adviser."
 
'Crony Capitalism'
 Mr. de Soto had already gained fame from Washington to Zurich for a book, "The Other Path," printed by Harper & Row. In his writing, he compared Latin America's "crony capitalism" of state-imposed cartels and bureaucracy to the aristocratic mercantilism that prevailed in 18th-century Europe and America.
First, he said, Peru's bureaucracy creates legal obstacle courses that serve to keep striving outsiders in an underground, informal economy. Then Mr. de Soto called for slashing red tape to create "popular capitalism."
"The real polarization which racks Peru is the division between those who have access to legal institutions and those who have to work on the edge or outside of them," he said this month at a symposium in Chile on Latin American development.
Addressing the right, Mr. de Soto argued, "The poor should be motors for their own growth." Turning to the left, he argued, "Capitalism is not incompatible with the eradication of poverty."
Today, Mr. de Soto suddenly has political power along with his Freedom and Democracy Institute, a research organization that gets A.I.D. money from the United States Government's and from European foundations.
 
Help for the Excluded
 The seven initiatives from his institute include plans to provide land titles to virtually all of Peruvian property holders; to deregulate Peru's economy; to institute a hearings system to open up closed rule-making procedures; to make the judicial system faster and less class-biased, and to create a free-market agricultural environment that will encourage farmers to try alternatives to coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine.
The policies grow out of a central tenet of "The Other Path" -- that Peru's economic and judicial system must stop excluding people and start opening up or else it will continue to drive poor Peruvians into the ranks of the Maoist Shining Path rebellion.
"More than 75 percent of our prison population -- that means 14,000 inmates -- are detained without having been sentenced," Mr. Fujimori said in September as he announced a policy to thin the population of Peru's overcrowded jails. Under a new pardon policy, most prisoners who have not been tried within nine months of arrest will be set free.
"If you steal a chicken, you can stay in jail for three years, waiting for trial," Mr. de Soto said. "But no middle-class person ever goes to jail for misappropriation of funds."
In October, Mr. de Soto's words were again heard in the President's mouth when Mr. Fujimori pledged to clear away bureaucracy facing coca growers who seek alternative crops, saying, "If farmers want to export directly, avoiding export oligopolies, they will confront the hard reality that the customs bureaucracy first requires them to follow 36 administrative steps in seven public and private offices."
 
'What's That Going to Do?'
 Some Peruvians say Mr. de Soto is filling a vacuum that arose when a dark-horse candidate took office without a program or a team.
"De Soto is making a reputation for himself as a ventriloquist," said Gustavo Gorriti, a journalist here. "Giving titles to peasants, what's that going to do? Now you are going to have coca farmers with land titles."
Mr. de Soto has played an important role in escorting Peru's new Government down the corridors of power. In June,he orchestrated a meeting in New York between Mr. Fujimori and the heads of Peru's multilateral creditor agencies. The meeting helped produce an orthodox economic austerity attack on Peru's hyperinflation.
In a move arranged by Mr. de Soto, Mr. Fujimori announced this month that Ann B. Wrobleski, a former Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, is to help Peru design an anti-drug program that will persuade the United States Congress that Peru is limiting coca leaf cultivation.
And because of a legal quirk, Mr. de Soto's role as overseas salesman for Peru has become increasingly essential to the Fujimori Government. In Peru, Congress must vote to approve each presidential trip outside the country. Lacking a congressional majority, Mr. Fujimori has been unable to travel overseas since taking office on July 28.

HEADLINE: Kiley Resigns After 7 Years as Chairman of the M.T.A.

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Robert R. Kiley, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who oversaw a vast program to rebuild New York City's subways, bus lines and commuter railroads, resigned yesterday after seven years with the agency.
Mr. Kiley, whose resignation was not unexpected, is credited with reversing the deterioration of the nation's largest mass transit system, especially the New York subways, which had been plagued with delays, derailments, graffiti and track fires. Mr. Kiley successfully lobbied the Legislature for an $8.4 billion capital program to overhaul the tracks, switches, signals and stations and to buy new subway cars and buses. But Mr. Kiley leaves with his rebuilding program only half finished and new money in doubt; with service cuts or fare increases virtually inevitable; with ridership levels stagnant or dropping, and with crime and fare-beating at all-time highs. [Page B7.] 
 Mr. Kiley, 55 years old, will become president and chief executive of the Fischbach Corporation, an electrical engineering firm based in New York. He declined to say how much he would be paid, but said it would be considerably more than his current salary of $150,000 a year.
Daniel Scannell, who is the first vice chairman of the M.T.A. board, will assume the responsibilities of chairman until Mr. Kiley's successor is named.
The transportation authority is a state agency that oversees management of thesubways, city and suburban buses, commuter rail lines, seven bridges and two tunnels. The New York City Transit Authority, the Long Island Rail Road, the Metro-North Commuter Railroad and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority all come under the jurisdiction of the M.T.A. chairman.
Transportation authority officials said candidates under consideration for the post included Peter Stangl, president of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad; David L. Gunn, former president of the New York Transit Authority; Franklin E. White, the State Transportation Commissioner, and Fabian Palomino, head of the Jacob Javits Center.
The M.T.A. chairman is appointed by the Governor and requires State Senate confirmation. The officials said they expectedGov. Mario M. Cuomo to appoint someone familiar with New York transit issues, but they did not rule out the possibility of an outsider.
During his tenure, Mr. Kiley hired top managers like Mr. Gunn, who virtually eliminated subway graffiti by putting squads of car washers at the end of each line and who substantially reduced track fires by having trash swept up more often.
Government and transit officials praised Mr. Kiley's achievements at the M.T.A. and said that he would not be easily replaced.
"Bob Kiley's management skill and tenacious resolve in confronting complex problems have improved accountability of the M.T.A. and made subway, bus and com muter rail service safer and more reliable," Governor Cuomo said in a statement. "New York has a vastly improved mass transit system and I regret his departure."
Mr. Kiley's leaves the transportation authority with a legacy of long-term planning and vision that will save the New York metropolitan region millions of dollars in future costs, said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Planning Association, a private research group. Mr. Anderson cited the M.T.A.'s strong administrative and planning staff and the agency's plans to install cutting-edge technology like an automatic fare-collection system.
Mr. Kiley, who once headed Boston's transit system and was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor there, became M.T.A. chairman on Nov. 16, 1983, when Governor Cuomo appointed him to fill the unexpired term of the former chairman, Richard Ravitch, who stepped down to return to private business.
The Governor reappointed Mr. Kiley to a new six-year term in 1987, which expires in June 1993. His departure was widely expected since April, when he announced that he did plan to finish his second term.
 
'A Great Job'
 "I'm not tired or frustrated," Mr. Kiley said at a meeting with reporters yesterday. "It's been a great job, but one that I never intended to spend this long in. It's just time to move on." He said that he informed Mr. Cuomo of his decision to resign last Wednesday.
Perhaps the biggest challenge facing the new M.T.A. chairman will be obtaining Federal and state financing to continue the overhaul of the subway and rail system. With New York State's current budget crisis and limited Federal funds available for local transit systems, the M.T.A. may be hard pressed to find money to continue the capital improvement plans.
Mr. Kiley has said that the agency needs about $15 billion starting in 1992 to continue improving transit service and to pay for the first major expansions of the region's subway and commuter rail systems since the early 1970's.
Mr. Kiley's departure comes as the M.T.A. and its various subsidiary agencies are facing swelling deficits because of a decline in state subsidies. The New York City Transit Authority, the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad are planning or considering fare increases and severe cutbacks in service to help offset the deficits.
 
Difficulties for Successor
 The Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for New York subway riders, said that if New York City is to have a safe, efficient and affordable transit system, Governor Cuomo must appoint a "transit evangelist" to serve as the next agency chairman.
"This is a crucial time in the history of the city's transit system, and we need someone who works hard to win money for the subways, to beat fare hikes, and get more riders," said Joseph Rappaport, the advocacy group's coordinator. "What we don't need is a crony of the Governor who can't make the case for transit or gives in to budget cuts."
Mr. Kiley said yesterday that his successor would have difficulty convincing the Legislature to approve a new capital plan because of the weak economy, but that the transportation authority has made "a good case for getting the money, because we have spent it well in the past."
He said the major disappointment of his tenure at the M.T.A. is the declining ridership on the subways and some commuter rail lines in the past year.
In 1986, Mr. Kiley pledged to increase subway ridership by 15 percent by 1991. But ridership has risen only about 6.5 percent since 1986 and is currently declining. "It's very disappointing to see fewer and fewer people use the system that you are trying so hard to rebuild, but I believe most of the decline is due to a weak economy and loss of jobs," Mr. Kiley said.

HEADLINE: The G(reedy) O(ld) P(arty)

BYLINE: By Benjamin J. Stein; Benjamin J. Stein, an economist, wrote speeches for Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford

DATELINE: MALIBU, Calif.

 BODY:
William Bennett is the first Republican National Committee chairman in memory, maybe the first ever, who is an intellectual. His stock in trade is not cronyism, not the glad hand, certainly not the politician's ready smile. Rather, his credentials are training in history, logic and philosophy, along with fearlessness about new ideas and debating them. It was these credentials that first put him on the map. 
 He will need them all, because the Republican Party is in an identity crisis. The question is: Does the party stand for anything except the wind of the moment and cradle-to-grave coddling of the rich?
Sadly, the days when the G.O.P. stood for responsible government and protection of public finances are long gone. As recently as my childhood, Dwight D. Eisenhower wanted to reduce the deficit and put the Government on a pay as you go basis. Ike did not want to burden posterity with more debt and either more taxes or more inflation to pay it off.
But Ronald Reagan openly and cheerfully said he would tax all future generations far more heavily than the 1980's taxpayer and impose upon them the burden of paying off his largesse to the electorate. This was, by any known standard, the exact opposite of responsibility, and yet it became Republican gospel.
Richard Nixon came into office with a raft of innovations to help the poor: greatly expanded welfare, education incentives for the less well-off, large-scale job training and retraining, set-asides of all kinds for minorities. Many, if not most, did not work. But at least there was an effort at social responsibility, at least a try at reducing poverty and suffering. This, too, was in the days when Republicans thought they had to stand for something, and behaved responsibly.
The Reagan-Bush era has been different. Its attitude toward anyone not rich or middle class has been: "Hell with you, Jack. We're all right -- and you wouldn't vote for me anyway."
The G.O.P. once stood for protecting the small businessman, the small investor, the small saver. A sound currency, a solid expectation that property rights would be protected were integral parts of what Republicanism was supposed to be about.
In the 1980's, the national Republican Party came to stand for protecting those who stole from the small businessman, who looted the small saver, who cleaned out the tills of Main Street businesses. Through deregulation of finance, nonenforcement of securities laws, basically turning over white collar criminal law enforcement to the white collar criminals, the G.O.P. gave the back of its hand to the victims of every manner of financial looting, and opened its palms wide to the looters.
Even in Ronald Reagan's early years, the Republicans stood for a strong national defense. Today, the U.S. cannot confidently confront a third world nation of about 15 million people -- after 10 years of Republican government. So much for a strong defense as a G.O.P. commandment.
Law and order was a G.O.P. strength. Not today. In the era of budget cuts mandated by irrational tax cuts, there is no Federal money to help states with their police budgets, not enough money for the F.B.I., not enough for the I.R.S., not enough for adequate protection on the streets and in the suites.
The music has been avoided at the polls because the Democrats, with rare genius, have put up such personally unappealing candidates for the White House, and probably still will. But winning elections is not the same as governing, and holding office is not the same as having decent principles.
This is all a heartache for a third- generation Republican like little me. For William Bennett, it's a far greater test. He must think about what the nation truly needs and what the G.O.P. must become to meet those needs. Or, he can go to lavish parties and dispense patronage as the chairman of a party that used to mean something but has come to mean wine and roses to its friends, and a hard, cold pavement to those outside the elephant's tent.

HEADLINE: New World for Junior Achievement

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY

 BODY:
Having settled on the product their company would sell -- a singing mug -- the teen-agers in the applied economics class at Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn turned to the question of how much it should cost.
"They decided on $6," said John Piccione, a New York Telephone executive who is the class's Junior Achievement consultant. "They said that was just one dollar more than a vial of crack. That seemed reasonable." 
 For many, the name Junior Achievement evokes an image of middle-class, goody-two-shoes teen-agers assembling their own products and starting small companies after school, often in the hope of embellishing their college applications.
But in the last decade, Junior Achievement has taken its volunteer adult executives and marched into the classroom. And it has increasingly reached out to the poorest urban schools, whose students are most at risk of dropping out of society. Last year, 1.2 million children participated in Junior Achievement programs in 14,000 schools around the nation, up from 1,000 in 1980.
 
Reshaping of Program
 To do this, the 70-year-old nonprofit organization has drsharply reshaped its program. It is still dedicated to teaching young people about the world of business, but it can start as early as elementary school and and its programs are much more varied.
For instance, its newest effort, being tried this year in 18 cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, is aimed at second graders, who are taught about differences between mass and individual production by coloring pictures of doughnuts.
At first, each child is responsible for coloring a whole doughnut. Later, the children are arranged in an assembly line, where one child might be in charge of coloring only the jelly while another does the white icing.
Junior Achievement's original after-school programs still exist, with more than 75,000 participants around the country. In Detroit, for instance, teen-agers working with Michael Judge, a product manager with Michigan Bell Telephone, are constructing bookshelves this semester and selling them for $9. The parts cost $3.
But the program has also been adapted to the classroom. In many high schools, students now participate as part of a social studies or economics class. The manufacturing aspects have largely been eliminated from the school version because they are too time-consuming. But teen-agers still sell stock to create their company, choose a product, elect officers and eventually close down the company, taking their profits home.
 
Encounters Are Revealing
 In inner-city schools, the encounters between executives and students are often testimony to how little contact the students have had with the legitimate business world.
Equating the price of mugs with that of crack is one particularly telling example. But there are others. When Maria Alvarez, a Chase Manhattan Bank executive, gave dividend checks to a group of Manhattan high school students last year, most had no idea what to with checks of any kind.
"I must have gotten calls from every student," Ms. Alvarez said. "One of them called me to say the bank teller had asked for I.D., and I had to explain what could be used as I.D."
This lack of knowledge about the business world does not dampen the students' enthusiasm or creativity, many executives said.
In one of Mr. Piccione's classes, the students recently came up with the idea of selling first aid kits to the owner of a local used-car lot, persuading him to put the kits in the glove compartments of his cars as bonus gifts to customers. The class sold several dozen that way.
First aid kits have prompted other interesting selling techniques. Douglas E. Shallau, president of Junior Achievement of New York Inc., said one Manhattan high school student had sold more than 150 kits in just a few weeks.
When asked how, the student said she had stopped at a local health clinic, got free condoms and put one in each kit. Then, she stood in front of school selling the kits to male students.
"It wasn't exactly what we had in mind," said Mr. Shallau, "but we had to admit that she had absorbed a lot of the things we were teaching, like 'know your market.' "
The thrust into the schools began in the mid-1970's when Junior Achievement, which depended on executives willing to spend at least two evening hours a week with the younsters, began having trouble recruiting volunteers.
"The demographics were changing," Mr. Shallau said. "With more women working, nobody had extra time for evening volunteer work."
So, the organization turned its focus on schools, creating programs for the classroom and urging companies to donate their employees' time. Only the elementary school programs lack volunteer executives helping to teach the courses.
Junior Achievement costs the schools nothing. The organization is financed by corporations, foundations, special fund-raising events and individual gifts. Its budget was $60 million last year. More than 40,000 executives donated their time.
 
Effectiveness of Programs
 How effective are the programs?
The organization makes no claims to single-handedly keeping children in school. But its programs include many of the components considered most effective in reducing dropout rates: role models, activities with tangible results and lessons easily related to life.
One survey, conducted by an independent consultant hired by the Kellogg Corporation, found that in several hundred junior high schools, attendance increased 20 percent on days when the Junior Achievement executives were scheduled to visit.
Students in the program often say the executives are more interesting than their teachers and can speak with more authority about the real world.
"She knows a lot more about this stuff," said Noel Alpert, a senior in Ms. Alvarez's class this year at Manhattan's Park West High School. "Most of the time what we get is whatever is in the plan book. It's the routine. But here she's giving us hands-on stuff. This is someone who is out there every day. A teacher can't do that."
Mr. Piccione, of the mug-selling project, recently went to his class at Prospect Heights, a school that routinely screens its students for weapons, and found a dejected sales force.
"I'm not selling Hondas," said one student, referring to advertisements for the car company that suggest Hondas sell themselves.
Mr. Piccione started a lesson on sales pitches, like "the puppy dog" approach (If you don't buy this I'm going to fail my class, get fired, look stupid . . . ) and the "building an agreement staircase" approach (It's a great mug, isn't it? Kids would really like it, right? I'm sure you want one, right?).
At one point, when the class's attention appeared to be waning, Mr. Piccione changed the subject briefly.
A salesman in his company, he said, could make more than $600 a week. The room was silent, the awe obvious.

HEADLINE: Nairobi Journal;
On KTN, Mr. Big Man Is Often Not in the Picture

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov. 27

 BODY:
For television viewers in sub-Saharan Africa, the diet of nightly news is predictable: the head of state, often referred to in common parlance as the Big Man, is always featured as subject of the first, often endless and always adoring news item. No matter how trivial the occasion, "Mr. Big Man (fill in leader's name) said today" is the common opening.
In Kenya, this has changed in the last eight months as a commercial television station established by the British publisher Robert Maxwell and, surprisingly, the ruling political party in this one-party nation, offers competition to the Government-run television operation. 
 Sometimes President Daniel arap Moi does not appear at all in the newscast of the new station. Sometimes it is a fleeting shot as he leaves or returns to the country. Sometimes he leads the news.
"When it is worth it," said the news editor, Herman Igambi, a veteran of the Government broadcasting station who intuits what will offend State House and what will not. "I explained to State House it doesn't mean we don't like the President. We like him. But I told them it was boring." So far, he said, there have been no complaints.
 
Some Press Rivalry
 The new television station, Kenya Television Network, which reaches about 40,000 viewers in Nairobi, has gone beyond changing its priorities in coverage of the news. In a nation where editors of the three daily newspapers constantly look over their shoulders and Government censorship is common, KTN, as it is known, has engendered some press rivalry.
Mutegi Njau, the city editor of The Nation, the boldest of the three papers, was angry the other day when he noticed that The Kenya Times, the newspaper allied with the new television station, had a report he didn't.
His paper had been called the night before and instructed by President Moi's office not to run an article about a government Minister's marital problems. The Nation agreed. The next morning, Mr. Njau discovered that KTN had broadcast the report and that because television had broken the item The Kenya Times felt no compunction in printing it -- on the front page.
Several weeks ago, KTN did a straight report on the visit of three United States Senators who criticized Kenya's human rights record. In contrast, the Government station ran a report of a saccharine meeting between the Senators and the Finance Minister, George Saitoti, which made no mention of human rights. KTN reported on riots in Nairobi in July, although rather gingerly; the Government station, Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, blanked them out.
"KTN is probably the freest station in sub-Sahara Africa," said Gary Strieker, the reporter for Africa for Cable News Network, who has lived and worked on the continent for 21 years. "Everything else is government-dominated. I can't think of any other place that has a comparable degree of autonomy from the government."
 
Just One Camera
 The network offers not only a sharper newscast, replete with up-to- the-minute graphics and a talented reporter, Kathleen Openda, but also has the rights to CNN's newscasts. Mr. Strieker says KTN is the only station in sub-Saharan Africa to consistently program CNN news at scheduled hours.
The station's headquarters are on the 20th floor of Nyayo House, the red brick main government building in Nairobi, the same place as the security branch of the police, immigration and a few other sensitive government agencies. There, six reporters and four editors, a handful of technicians and cameramen -- with one camera -- produce the nightly news show.
Ms. Openda, 27 years old, has quickly become a star. With a rare camera presence and an agreeably forthright voice -- "a relic of the colonial era," she jokes of the accent developed at a missionary school -- she usually works with the one camera.
On a recent day, she jumped into a station wagon with her crew, much like a television crew in any big Western city, and raced to the airport for mandatory coverage of Mr. Moi's departure for a two-day trip south.
That night, KTN ran a squib of the Moi footage well down in the news; KBC led its news for several minutes with Mr. Moi's departure and arrival in Swaziland -- the night that Margaret Thatcher resigned and the longest-serving member in the Kenyan Cabinet was declared bankrupt and booted out of the government.
 
A Former Teacher
 After the airport, Ms. Openda decided to cover Government moves to clear a slum, one of several such efforts in the last month that have chased squatters from their shanties, leaving thousands of families homeless. Ms. Openda reported on a recent razing at Muoroto, while KBC did not, and she and Mr. Igambi were disappointed that they had missed several other shanty clearances in the week. Their tip proved unfounded, so by noon, Ms. Openda was fretting: she was traveling with the station's only camera and had nothing.
But by late afternoon, she had visited three ministers' offices, one of which came up with what she thought was a reasonable report about a distastrous aphid infection in Kenya's hardwood forests.
Ms. Openda was a high-school literature teacher who read the sports news at KBC part time when she learned of the new television station. She had no journalistic training or experience. "Journalism is similar to teaching," she said. "It's about explaining."
But even so, there is a limit to how much explaining Ms. Openda and her fellow reporters can do at KTN. The station's report on rioting in Nairobi in early July, which started days after the imprisonment of three advocates of a multiparty system, emphasized the economic frustrations of the demonstrators but failed to show the politically motivated hand gestures -- a v-for-victory sign -- shown by many members of the crowd.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
George Bush's Secret Weapon

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WAS it Willie Horton, or the L-word, or the "read my lips" ploy that sunk Michael Dukakis's bid for the Presidency in 1988? None of the above, argues Ray C. Fair, an economist at Yale University who moonlights as a political prognosticator. Mr. Fair, who has just updated his remarkably accurate statistical model for explaining Presidential election results to include the Bush-Dukakis contest, suggests that nothing much can change the predisposition of voters to elect Republicans (especially incumbent Republicans) except parlous economic times.
That is bad news for Democrats, who may be inclined to think they have George Bush on the political defensive. For unless the economy is in absolutely rotten shape, Mr. Fair's equation implies that Mr. Bush will win in a walk. 
 The Fair model of voting behavior, first published in the May 1978 issue of the Review of Economics and Statistics, offers a breathtakingly simple view of Presidential elections. Republican candidates begin each contest at a substantial advantage, Mr. Fair surmises, as do incumbent Presidents. But beyond that, the only factors that seem to have influenced the vote split in the last 19 Presidential contests have been the rate of economic growth during the election year and the rate of inflation over the previous two years. A high growth rate favors the incumbent, of course, while a high rate of inflation favors the challenger.
The election game presented by Mr. Fair is so easy that anyone with a pencil can play. In the latest version of the formula, derived from what statisticians call regression analysis, a Democrat starts with a presumptive claim to 48 percent ofthe two-party vote. If he is an incumbent, add five percentage points; if he is running against an incumbent Republican, subtract five.
Now calculate the incumbent's economic bonus -- or penalty for presiding over hard times. Figure the economy's growth rate in the six months preceding the election. Then deduct for inflation by multiplying the inflation rate by .3 and subtracting from the growth rate. If, for example, inflation has been running at 10 percent, subtract 3.
Add this subtotal to the Democratic candidate's score if the Democrat is an incumbent and subtract it if a Republican is an incumbent. If neither candidate is running from the White House, scrap the calculation: By Mr. Fair's analysis, economic conditions seem to matter only when voters have an individual to credit or blame.
Simple, not to say, simple-minded? Perhaps, but econometricians live or die by the numbers, and in this case the numbers are lively indeed.
The statistical model explains 89 percent of the variation in the vote split over the last 19 Presidential elections. And the average error is just threepercentage points; pollsters sampling thousands of voters a few days before elections rarely do better. For the last six elections, the Fair equation has missed the mark by a stunningly small 1.1 percent of the vote.
The analysis confirms the conventional wisdom that Republicans have assembled a winning combination of interests and issues over the decades: 52 out of every 100 voters lean toward Republican candidates. Some four voters in 100, however, are ready to give the benefit of the doubt to an incumbent President from either party; once a Democrat is in office, he has the edge. If the economy is in deep enough trouble, though, enough voters are apparently prepared to switch parties to overwhelm the combined effect of incumbency and the Republican bias.
The level of income or employment does not seem to affect votes; what does is the rate at which the economy is growing or shrinking. And that will likely make the tough job of beating George Bush even tougher.
As both a Republican and an incumbent, Mr. Bush begins the race with a 56-44 advantage. A recession in 1991 would not hurt him, as long as the economy bottoms out early in 1992. In fact, the Fair equation suggests that it might help him: the economy generally grows most rapidly as it is coming out of a recession.
If, as is entirely plausible, the economy is growing at a 5 percent rate in mid-1992 and inflation is running at 6 percent, Mr. Bush's predicted margin would be 59-41. Only an economy in a free fall -- say, a combination of 7 percent inflation and a -5 percent growth rate would allow a Democrat to squeeze by the incumbent.
Stranger events have happened: In 1980 President Carter was humbled by 9 percent inflation and a -6 percent growth rate. But unless economic lightening strikes again, the Fair equation suggests that it will take at least six more years to dislodge the Republicans from the White House.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
YUGOSLAVIA SEEN BREAKING UP SOON

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
United States intelligence is predicting that federated Yugoslavia will break apart, most probably in the next 18 months, and that civil war in that multinational Balkan country is highly likely.
The predictions, included in a long National Intelligence Estimate produced under the auspices of the Central Intelligence Agency, are unusually firm and sharp for such a document, a senior Government official said. 
 The intelligence estimate runs counter to views of Yugoslavia's future in the State Department, although some specialists in that department also subscribe to the premise.
The intelligence prediction received backing in Yugoslavia on Nov. 15 when Prime Minister Ante Markovic declared: "The acts of the highest state organs of Slovenia, Serbia and, partly, Croatia inevitably lead to a straining of political relations in Yugoslavia and directly threaten the country's survival."
 
Nationalism Is Growing
 The Prime Minister continued, "The situation is characterized by growing nationalism and separatism and an alarming worsening of ethnic relations, all of which is expressed in violence, a drastic threat to public order, peace and citizens' safety,"
According to United States officials who have read the intelligence document, its two basic findings are that "the Yugoslav experiment has failed, that the country will break up" and that "this is likely to be accompanied by ethnic violence and unrest which could lead to civil war."
"It did not predict absolutely that there would be a civil war, but said it was highly likely," one official noted. He said he was "startled by its stark terms."
Yugoslavia, a federation of six republics formed under Tito's victorious Communist partisan army at the end of World War II, has been plagued by increasing internal tensions since the death of Tito in 1980. The stresses in the country of 23 million have been worsened by political rivalry between Serbia, the largest of the six republics, and Croatia and Slovenia, the most prosperous; and by Serbia's repression of its Albanian minority of nearly two million in the region called Kosovo.
 
Democratic Elections Held
 In the spring, Slovenia and Croatia held democratic elections that ended Communist Party rule, while Serbia -- also facing elections -- retains a Communist government under its president, Slobodan Milosevic.
The authors of the intelligence estimate, and virtually every other American official concerned, blame Mr. Milosevic as the principal instigator of Yugoslavia's troubles, both for initiating the latest repression of the Kosovo Albanians and for stirring Serbian nationalist passions.
After an auspicious start with an economic reform program last winter, Prime Minister Markovic has seen his federal authority wither in the face of mounting disputes among the various republics. Slovenia and Croatia have threatened to secede from the federation and Mr. Milosevic has lately pursued a go-it-alone policy for Serbia.
The United States intelligence estimate on Yugoslavia's future is set in this context.
 
Army Termed Fraying
 "I think you can almost write the death certificate now," a Government official who specializes in Yugoslav affairs said recently. He pointed to moves by Belgrade authorities to impose customs duties on goods entering Serbia from other Yugoslav republics and to withhold Serbia's payments to the Federal Government. He also said the Yugoslav People's Army "is beginning to fray."
"I could see a formal breakup by mid-1991," this official said.
Another American Government specialist took a more cautious view of Yugoslavia's future, saying, "I am not willing to write them totally off" at this moment.
The C.I.A.'s pessimism is shared by some State Department officials, including Deputy Secretary Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who served two tours in Yugoslavia, most recently as ambassador, and who is widely respected in the country as a friend.
It is also shared to a degree by American scholars specializing for many years in Yugoslav politics and history -- among them Steven L. Burg of Brandeis University, Charles Jelavich of the University of Indiana and Denison I. Rusinow of the University of Pittsburgh.
Late last month, the House and Senate passed an amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriation law that bars any United States loans or credits for Yugoslavia unless the assistance is directed to a republic "which has held free and fair elections and which is not engaged in systematic abuse of human rights."
The legislation was fueled mainly by members of Congress who desire to penalize Serbia for its repression of the Kosovo Albanians.

HEADLINE: Reshaping a Real Estate Dynasty

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
The Reichmann family of Canada built a fortune by attacking while others were in retreat. They bought office towers in New York at distressed prices in the mid-1970's when the city was on the brink of bankruptcy and developers were running for cover. In the early 1980's, in the midst of a deep real estate slump, they risked billions of dollars building the vast World Financial Center in downtown Manhattan. Both bets paid off handsomely.
Now, the Reichmanns are preparing to make more acquisitions and are reshaping their closely held empire, Olympia & York Developments Ltd., which includes the World Financial Center in New York, the Canary Wharf project in London and energy, newsprint and financial-services operations, all worth perhaps $30 billion.
 
 Goal for Next Century
 The goal is to enter the next century firmly anchored in real estate in the world's three biggest financial centers -- and on a scale few developers could easily match. 
 "New York, London and Tokyo are the three financial and business centers for the world," said Paul Reichmann, one of three brothers who control the Toronto-based empire. "These big centers are necessary for the world economies and they will rebound stronger than their problems."
While the Canary Wharf project and the World Financial Center give the company roots in London and New York, Tokyo has proven more elusive: A proposed $30 billion project with Japanese partners in Tokyo, a first for the Reichmanns, has been abandoned.
To position the company for expansion in the 1990's, the Reichmann brothers -- Paul, 60 years old; Albert, 61, and Ralph, 59 -- are making changes that will provide more financial security and make operations less interdependent and able to function without a Reichmann at the helm.
The family is moving away from bank financing for future investment projects and toward long-term sources of money like pension funds and insurance companies. The Reichmanns believe these sources will be more stable than banks and not subject to shareholder pressure during hard times. The brothers have also embarked on a plan to eliminate all long-term debt from the books of their non-real estate properties.
And because the 14 Reichmann children, now mostly in their late teens and early 20's, are too young to demonstrate an interest in running the business, the brothers are preparing the company to proceed even if there is not a Reichmann in charge. In January, they hired John Zuccotti, the former deputy mayor of New York City, to head the American real estate subsidiary. He is the first outsider to head one of the family's wholly owned companies.
 
 Hints of Trouble?
 They are also seeking to sell a 20 percent stake in the United States subsidiary to a major American financial institution. News of that plan this fall touched off speculation that the Reichmann empire might be buckling in the slumping real estate market -- or, at the least, that its $8 billion Canary Wharf project was in trouble.
But in an interview in his New York office on Park Avenue at 45th Street, the usually reclusive Paul Reichmann dismissed as "children who don't know what they are talking about" those who speculated that the company was pressed for cash.
Indeed, the Reichmanns say worries about their liquidity are exaggerated. They say the Olympia & York Canary Wharf Company, the London subsidiary, has won a vote of confidence from lenders: A consortium of 6 European and 4 American banks has completed the first part of a deal to provide 500 million (about $980 million) of interim financing for the construction project, Europe's largest. In addition, the Reichmanns are reviewing several bank proposals to provide up to 600 million (about $1.15 billion) in long-term financing for the main tower of the project.
The company says the two financings are in accordance with its original timetable for pulling some equity out of the first phase of the development before moving forward. Edward Minskoff, a New York real estate executive who worked for the Reichmanns for 20 years, said that they have typically planned such things -- as well as the sale of the 20 percent stake in the United States subsidiary -- long in advance.
"Timing-wise, it just happened to come when there is perceived weakness in the marketplace, but it doesn't signal weakness in the company," Mr. Minskoff said.
 
 A Substantial Cushion
 The Reichmanns' non-real estate holdings provide a substantial financial cushion. Last year, the non-real estate companies -- including Gulf Canada Resources, Abitibi-Price and GW Utilities -- paid several hundred million dollars in profits to their parent, according to a financier who works closely with the company. Gulf Canada, the giant oil and gas company controlled by the family, has seen its cash flow increase by about $1.5 million a day since the crisis in the Persian Gulf sent oil prices climbing. Much of the cash generated by the non-real estate interests has been paying for Canary Wharf.
Still, there are problems with some Reichmann-controlled companies that are in cyclical industries and that carry large amounts of debt. Last week, for example, commercial paper issued by Abitibi-Price Inc., the money-losing forestry and paper products giant that is 82 percent owned by the family, was downgraded by Toronto's Dominion Bond Rating Service because the rating agency deemed the company's 40 percent debt-to-equity ratio too high, given the downturn in its markets, and saw its ability to service its debt as weak.
 
 30 Years of Growth
 The Reichmann empire has been three decades in the making. The family, Hungarian Jews who fled Austria on the eve of World War II, arrived in Canada in the 1950's. By 1956, Ralph Reichmann had started a tile and floor-covering business, the Olympia Floor and Tile Company, and was soon joined by his parents and brothers. In 1969, Albert and Paul formed York Developments to build warehouses and shortly thereafter, Olympia & York Developments Ltd. was formed.
By 1974, the family had begun First Canadian Place, a huge office complex in Toronto that has proved to be one of the family's great successes. By 1977, the brothers had plunked down $320 million for New York office buildings.
Today, Paul, the brother regarded as the financial mind behind the business, oversees the real estate and financing sides while Albert is chairman of the board of the holding company. Ralph still runs the tile and floor covering business he started in 1956.
The strong real estate base the family built in the 1970's gave the Reichmanns an advantage over other developers in financing growth. Most developers get banks to provide construction financing, usually at higher interest rates than those paid by top-tier corporate borrowers because of the higher risks of these projects, which serve as the collateral.
In contrast, Olympia & York often has enough money to finance the construction phase of its projects. When it does borrow, it gets lower rates than most developers because it guarantees the loan itself, rather than putting up the building as collateral.
Like most developers, the company pays off the original construction loan once the projects are completed with a lower-cost, long-term mortgage from a pension fund or insurance company.
 
 Spewing Out Cash
 During the 1980's, property values appreciated rapidly and the company was spewing out cash, sending the Reichmanns looking for buying opportunities and ways to protect against a downturn.
Like scores of American companies in that leverage-loving decade, Olympia & York took on debt, in addition to spending its own money, to buy major holdings in Abitibi-Price, Gulf Canada Resources and Interhome Energy, and to acquire large minority interests in a host of public companies.
But now, with the economy weakening, real estate values falling and companies struggling to raise cash, the Reichmanns are rethinking their position. They are joining the trend among corporations to cut their debt. "I believe that debt-free companies will have the greatest opportunities in the 1990's," Mr. Reichmann said.
 
 Limits on Debt Levels
 In the Reichmanns' real estate portfolio, debt levels are limited to about 60 percent of the appraised value of the assets, according to Mr. Reichmann. Most real estate companies carry much more debt on their books. The company said debt levels were lower in its non-real estate operations.
Some of the dividends the Reichmanns earn from their investments in public companies are being used to pay down the long-term debt in these companies. In some cases, assets are being sold as part of the strategic focusing on real estate and oil. For example, GW Utilities has agreed to sell its Consumers' Gas Company to British Gas P.L.C. for $915 million (Canadian). GW plans to use the proceeds to pay off about $600 million (Canadian) in long-term debt and to pay a special $10 dividend to shareholders, mainly Reichmann family members. The Reichmanns, who own 89 percent of GW, eventually intend to take that company private.
In addition, Olympia & York is looking to combine some of its oil interests. Eventually, it plans to merge Gulf Canada Resources, in which it owns a 74 percent share, with Home Oil, a unit of GW, and to sell a large pipeline company, Interprovincial Pipeline.
Olympia & York is also looking to raise tens of millions of dollars by refinancing its 10 percent interest in Allied Lyons P.L.C., the British supermarket company.
 
 More Stable Financing
 The Reichmanns are also starting to favor pension funds and insurance companies as lenders, which the brothers regard as more stable sources of capital than banks, which have become cautious real estate lenders and are subject to pressures from regulators and shareholders.
"It is a strategic concept," Mr. Reichmann said. "It costs about one-third of 1 percent more than the kinds of rates we get from foreign banks, but we decided that we would be better off with institutions without certain pressures, and that the time is now to move to a different segment of the financial markets."
The company has already begun to refinance many of its 50 or so office towers in its portfolio in the United States and Canada by bringing in deep-pocketed partners like the major pension funds and some insurance companies.

Pound Dominates Trading As Dollar and Gold Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The British pound, helped by the election of John Major as the country's next Prime Minister, dominated the foreign exchange markets yesterday. The dollar fell against the pound and most other major foreign currencies.
Gold prices slipped lower. 
 The pound surged after Mr. Major, who is currently Chancellor of the Exchequer, which is the British equivalent of the United States Treasury, was assured of becoming the next British Prime Minister.
Mr. Major, who had the support of departing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, fell just short of winning election as head of the Conservative Party in a vote yesterday. But his challengers withdrew from the race and conceded defeat, effectively giving Mr. Major the nation's top job.
The pound rose to $1.9775 in New York, from $1.96895 late Monday. In London trading before Mr. Major's election was assured, the pound rose to $1.9750, from $1.9655 late Monday.
Foreign exchange traders had hoped Mr. Major would win because they were familiar with his policies and expected little change if he succeeded Mrs. Thatcher.
Mike Faust, a currency market annalyst with Money Market Services in Chicago, said sterling's fortune might be short-lived. He said there was speculation among traders that the British Government would lower base lending rates to 13.5 percent from their current 14 percent.
 
 Higher Interest Rates
 Currencies are supported by higher interest rates, so a drop in British rates would make that country's investments less attractive and could send the pound lower.
Mr. Faust said the dollar fell against other currencies amid the belief that the big industrial nations are satisfied with the dollar's low levels.
The dollar fell to 128.35 yen in New York, from 129.05 yen late Monday. In Tokyo earlier, the dollar rose to 128.95 yen from 127.95 yen at Monday's close, and in London, the United States currency fell to 128.30 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.48025 German marks, down from 1.4860; 1.2595 Swiss francs, down from 1.2620; 4.9950 French francs, down from 5.0130; 1,111.25 Italian lire, down from 1,116.125, and 1.16405 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16075.
Gold edged down 90 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $385.20 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $385.00, down $1.15.
Gold fell earlier in London to a late bid of $384.75 a troy ounce, from $387.00 late Monday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing $384.00 an ounce, from $386.50 late Monday.
In Hong Kong, gold fell $1.16 an ounce, to $385.19.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Security Prices Ease

BYLINE: BY KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities eased slightly and interest rates inched up a bit in sluggish trading yesterday, as dealers concentrated on an auction of $12.3 billion worth of new two-year Treasury notes.
Demand for the new notes was fairly strong, market participants said, and bids for the securities produced an average yield of 7.49 percent, down from an average yield of 7.84 percent at the last two-year note sale on Oct. 30. It is the lowest yield on a two-year note since the auction held in late March, 1988. 
 With the yield on the new notes squarely on top of the 7.5 percent level that is widely seen as the Federal Reserve Board's target for the overnight Federal funds rate, analysts said the auction results showed that traders sense the Federal Reserve Board will be easing monetary policy again fairly soon. Unless short-term rates move lower, dealers will not realize a profit on the new securities.
"The two-year came right on top of the funds rate, but by March or April I think rates will be significantly lower, and people are going to kick themselves for not having bought this issue," said Joe Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg & Company.
 
 Treasury Securities Market
 The Fed entered the Treasury securities market to add reserves to the banking system yesterday. The move was something of a surprise, but analysts described the action as an attempt to push the funds rate down from levels the Fed viewed as unacceptably high. Funds were trading at around 7 3/4 percent when the Fed added reserves.
"They wanted to make it clear that funds are at 7 1/2 percent, not 7 5/8 percent or 7 3/4 percent," one Government securities trader said. "This was just a rate protest, not a new policy signal."
Away from the two-year auction, economists said a report that showed that auto sales, at an annualized rate of 7 million units, remained fairly strong for the 10 days ended Nov. 21 was a mild disappointment to credit market participants.
"We don't know how much of this represents sales to fleets, but auto sales are holding up very well, given the sharp drop in consumer confidence and the other signs of recession we have seen," said Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
Mr. Moran said auto sales of six million units or less were levels that were normally associated with an economic downturn.
Early yesterday, the Conference Board reported that its widely watched index of consumer confidence declined to a reading of 61.5 in November from 62.6 in October. The November decline was far more modest than the steep drops recorded in the first two months following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The report had little impact on prices in the credit markets.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 103 14/32, down 3/32, to yield 8.43 percent, up from 8.42 percent late Monday.
 
 10-Year Note Issues
 Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 17/ 32, down 1/32, to yield 8.27 percent.
In advance of today's auction of new five-year Treasury notes, the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.91 percent, up from 7.90 percent late Monday.
Short-term Treasury bills inched higher.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.02 percent, up one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 6.96 percent.
A number of new issues were priced in the tax-exempt municipal bond market yesterday, including the negotiated sale of $168.89 million worth of revenue bonds for the City of Boston.
The bonds, which will be used for the construction of a new Boston City Hospital, are insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
The securities, which range in maturity from 1996 to 2021, were reoffered to investors at yields from 6.65 percent in 1996 to 7.70 percent in 2021.
Investment bankers at Merrill Lynch & Company, which acted as lead manager for the transaction, said this represented the first time the F.H.A. had offered insurance on a hospital issue. The bankers added that without the insurance yields the securities would have been at least a full percentage point higher.
The securities are rated AA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The State of Wisconsin offered $120 million worth of general obligation bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by First Chicago won the securities.
The serial bonds, which range in maturity from 1992 to 2011, were reoffered with yields from 5.50 percent to a maximum rate of 6.90 percent in 2011.
The issue is rated AA by Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for municipal securities, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to up about 1/8 point.

Global Company Recalls Its Roots In Old Brooklyn

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Last August, a rock flew through a window in the office of Thomas J. Kline Jr.
Mr. Kline, the manager of Pfizer Inc.'s Brooklyn plant, where Williamsburg meets Bedford-Stuyvesant on Flushing Avenue, called his security officers. They told him that a group of youths had thrown the stones and then had run to a ramshackle apartment building. Mr. Kline asked that the police be called but wanted no arrests. He expressed hope he might meet the perpetrators. 
 Soon a young man identifying himself as B. B. and another named Angel appeared. Both apologized. Mr. Kline invited them and a dozen others from the group on a plant tour; gave them T-shirts as their clothes were wet from playing in a hydrant, and invited them to order whatever they wanted in the cafeteria.
The same teen-agers -- minus Angel whose brother needs him as a drug lookout -- have been coming back for weekly computer instruction and free meals. The other day, they huddled around computers, each supervised by a Pfizer expert. A favorite program allowed a user to design a city.
"We felt this would be especially interesting to kids who are urban," Janet L. Scherer, systems manager for the 600-employee plant.
"We have become quite enchanted with these young people," Mr. Kline said. "All of us in this neighborhood are in it together."
 At a time when companies and people are fleeing New York, Pfizer is a company that stayed -- and stayed in a ragged, crime-ridden neighborhood that many would term one of New York's worst. At a time when manufac turing is dying here, Pfizer has found both social and economic reasons to maintain and modernize. Pfizer is spearheading the redevelopment of its shabby, shaky neighborhood by instigating a public-private partnership to create 500 new jobs and 400 housing units. The jobs would be created by companies that buy unused space from Pfizer at bargain rates. Pfizer is working with a number of public and private groups on the low- and medium-income housing in both existing and new space.
Carl B. Weisbrod, president of the city's Public Development Corporation, part of the project, calls Pfizer a "terrific' example: "You really have to take destiny into your own hands and shape your own environment. That's exactly what they're doing."
Pfizer has woven itself into the fabric of the neighborhood. Well over half the employees volunteer to do community work, much of it on their own time. Engineers repair appliances in homes for the elderly. Others built a stage for a rock concert sponsored by a community organization. Schools have been adopted, a subway station rebuilt, hundreds of students tutored, Halloween contests judged and financial contributions given to groups as varied as a Hassidic health clinic and a Hispanic day-care center.
"We can't solve all the problems," Mr. Kline said. "But we can make a difference at our doorstep."
Pfizer is a proud Brooklyn institution. It was founded in 1849 by two German immigrants, perhaps attracted by the 57 breweries. It pioneered mass production of penicillin and by the end of World War II made half of the world's supply. A former president, John L. Smith, owned the Brooklyn Dodgers with Walter O'Malley and Branch Rickey, until he died in 1950.
But loyalty has limits. In 1961, Pfizer moved its headquarters to Manhattan. By the 1970's, the company was a multinational force, one thinking hard about leaving a deteriorating Brooklyn altogether. But in 1983, it decided to keep the plant, though on a smaller scale. Chemical operations went elsewhere. What remained was making medicine into pills, capsules and the like.
Economic factors prompted Pfizer to stay. One was that a new pill-making plant would have cost $125 million, forcing the company to raise product costs. Another was reduced utility rates in Brooklyn. A third was a trained work force -- average age 50 years, average experience 25. "We have some of the best tablet operators in the world," Mr. Kline said.
But people are yielding to machines, raising productivity. Even good-natured participation in contests to name robots doesn't disguise the imminent job loss. The hope for employment is that efficiencies will persuade bosses to assign the plant more products.
The redevelopment scheme will help. But in two years of recruitment, Pfizer has found only one company to move into space it is offering at one-third the going price. That was a printer, whose main customer is Pfizer. It has 82 employees, 11 hired since moving. Nine are from Brooklyn, six from the local zip code.
The future? "We think we have a potentially fabulous neighbor for them," said the city's Mr. Weisbrod, declining to elaborate.

HEADLINE: Macy's Loss Said to Reach $66 Million

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
R. H. Macy & Company has told creditors and credit agencies that it had a loss of $66 million in its latest quarter -- a bigger loss than creditors expected and double its $33.1 million loss in the quarter last year, according to a number of creditors and credit agencies.
A Macy spokesman yesterday said the company would not comment on the reports. Macy is expected to report the quarterly loss to the Securities and Exchange Commission in several weeks. 
 The loss in the retailer's first fiscal quarter, ended Oct. 31, would follow a full-year loss of $215.3 million and would be much higher than the $45 million deficit expected by some creditors. Some creditors noted that the period was not nearly as critical a quarter as the current one, which includes the Christmas selling season and January clearances.
The report of the latest loss, however, heightens the general concern in the apparel field that Macy, with more than $5 billion in debt from its 1986 leveraged buyout and from its 1988 acquisition of the Bullock's and the I. Magnin retail chains in California, faces increasing financial pressures while the general retail climate remains cloudy. The Christmas season, during which retailers traditionally register up to 30 percent of sales and as much as 50 percent of profits, is seen as a difficult to predict this year, particularly in the Middle Atlantic States, where Macy has many of its more than 100 stores and where the economy has been especially weak.
Retailing observers attributed the bigger loss to erratic sales during the quarter, with a particular slump in October in stores more than a year old.
The $66 million loss was reported by Macy executives in a periodic progress report it gives to creditors, credit agencies and suppliers, according to creditors. It was not mentioned in a letter sent a week ago by a Macy financial executive to creditors and suppliers that reported other results, like an improved gross margin on sales for the latest quarter over the comparable 1989 quarter and lower inventories through mid-November.
In the letter, Macy said it intended to maintain ample availability of funds under a $475 million revolving bank loan. But in the week ended Nov. 16, Macy said, it borrowed $374 million against that revolving loan. From that point on, Macy said, its borrowing needs were expected to decline.
Although suppliers said they were keeping a close watch on the Macy situation, the largest ones were maintaining a business-as-usual attitude. "We're shipping Macy, and they are paying their bills on time," said Jerome Chazen, chairman and chief executive of Liz Claiborne Inc.

HEADLINE: 3d Fiber-Optic System Installed in Manhattan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
A Chicago company has completed lower Manhattan's third fiber-optic telephone system, part of a national binge of construction of urban systems that bypass the local telephone companies.
The new high-capacity system is intended to provide large corporations with cheap, reliable, high-quality connections to the nearest call-switching centers of long-distance companies and the New York Telephone Company. 
 The system will give New York Telephone more competition for the profitable business of carrying large volumes of calls and data communications among a few skyscrapers in a small area. To the extent that the new system is successful in draining away business traffic, it could also force New York Telephone to seek higher rates for residential customers.
Residential customers have been subsidized by business customers, who tend to be cheaper to serve because their offices are highly concentrated and therefore require the installation of fewer miles of cable.
 
 Pacts to Serve 27 Buildings
 Metropolitan Fiber Systems Inc., a privately held Chicago company, announced yesterday that it had completed construction of its high-capacity system south of Canal Street, and had signed agreements to serve 27 office buildings, including 11 financial services companies. Royce J. Holland, the president and chief executive of Metropolitan Fiber, said the system had been tested and would start carrying calls within a week.
New York Telephone and the Teleport Communications Group, a company similar to Metropolitan Fiber, already have fiber-optic systems in Manhattan. Metropolitan Fiber has also built such systems in nine other American cities in the last four years, and plans to expand its New York system next year to include most of Manhattan plus parts of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.
Among the initial users of Metropolitan Fiber's system is Bear, Stearns & Company. Jeff Marshall, managing director for communications, said the large New York brokerage firm already used New York Telephone, Teleport and its own building-to-building microwave service, but would now begin giving traffic to Metropolitan Fiber as well.
Many local companies have sought alternative cables to local and long-distance switching centers to protect against equipment failures in any one network and to increase price competition. Bear, Stearns has been paying 40 percent more in New York than in other American cities for the standard corporate package of 24 digitally switched local lines, Mr. Marshall said.
Lower prices for telephone service are needed to keep businesses in New York and make them competitive in world markets, said Ronald K. Shelp, the president and chief executive of the New York City Partnership, a 10-year-old coalition of business, government and labor leaders that seeks to improve the city.
 
 Cost of Subsidies
 But part of the higher price of business service in New York reflects the cost of subsidizing rural and other residential service. Private fiber-optic systems undermine this system of subsidies, said Eli M. Noam, a Columbia University economist and former New York State Public Service Commissioner.
"It's a classic cream-skimming situation, where the cream is the above-cost pricing of the short-haul business district," he said.
Mr. Holland disagreed, contending that many of New York Telephone's business services are now provided at cost. Metropolitan Fiber has told the Public Service Commission, which is reviewing New York Telephone's request for an $832 million rate increase, that the phone company may have used revenues from small businesses and residential customers to subsidize construction of its own fiber-optic systems.
New York Telephone denies this.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Up 12.6% in Midmonth

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Propelled by rebates, sales of vehicles made in the United States rose by 12.6 percent in mid-November, compared with sluggish demand in the period last year.
Several analysts said they were at a loss to explain why vehicle sales continued at a fairly steady pace despite a weakening economy. 
 Hefty rebates, averaging $1,400 to $1,500 on many domestic models, "help explain some of the increase in sales over last year," said David Healy, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. in New York. Nevertheless, he said, "It's as if car buyers are oblivious to the fact that we're in a recession."
 
 The Fleet Factor
 Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said he was "flabbergasted" by the figures.
"Fleets have largely finished taking deliveries of 1991 models, so they are not much of a factor" in the latest results, he said.
But other analysts said fleets were the primary factor in the latest sales gains posted by the Big Three.
"Fleets are still a huge part of the equation," said Joseph S. Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York.
Joel Pitcoff, a market analyst for the Ford Motor Company, said, "This is a time of the year when fleet sales represent a higher proportion of overall sales."
The 10 auto makers that manufacture in the United States sold 291,287 vehicles, compared with 255,492 a year ago.
Car sales surged by 16.7 percent, to 182,749. Seasonally adjusted, cars sold at an annual rate of 7.1 million, compared with an annual rate of 6.1 million in the period last year. So far this year, cars have sold at an annual rate of 7 million.
Sales of domestic light trucks rose by 9.8 percent, to 108,538, reversing several weeks of sales declines that auto makers and dealers had attributed to the lower fuel economy of pickup trucks and mini-vans compared with many car models.
The Japanese auto makers with plants in the United States increased light-vehicle sales by 27.5 percent in mid-November, while those of the Big Three increased by 13.4 percent. Japanese "transplants" held 10.6 percent of the American market in the middle of the month, up from 9.5 percent in last year's period.
 
 G.M.'s Rise Nearly 17%
 General Motors sold 77,538 cars in mid-November, up by 16.9 percent from last year. G.M. reported improving sales of several of its small cars, including the Geo Metro and Storm, Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird.
Some larger models also sold well, like Oldsmobile's Cutlass Supreme and Buick's intermediate Regal, and the full-size Park Avenue. G.M.'s light-truck sales rose by 10.6 percent, to 44,180 units, mainly from increased sales of the company's plastic-body APV vans.
Ford's car sales rose 17.6 percent during the period, to 49,364 cars, led by the subcompact Escort. Strong sales gains were also posted by the full-size Crown Victoria and intermediate Taurus sedans -- two models popular with fleets. Ford sold 37,648 light trucks, a gain of 14.6 percent, with sales gains posted by its Explorer four-wheel-drive vehicle and Aerostar van.
The Chrysler Corporation's sales of pickups, Jeeps and mini-vans were flat, however, and the company continued to lose market share in that critical segment. Chrysler sold 22,865 light trucks, a gain of less than 1 percent. Chrysler's car sales increased 10.8 percent, to 22,362 cars.
 
 'Transplants' Fare Well
 The Honda Motor Company posted a gain of 5.2 percent in sales of cars made at its plant in Marysville, Ohio. The Toyota Motor Corporation, which confirmed plans today to expand its plant in Georgetown, Ky., reported sales of 9,025 cars in mid-November, an increase of 53.4 percent. The Nissan Motor Company sold 3,399 Sentra cars, up by 45.9 percent, and 2,709 compact pickup trucks, a decline of 18.6 percent. The vehicles are made at Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tenn.
Among the remaining transplant manufacturers, the Mazda Motor Corporation sold 1,541 cars, an increase of 57.6 percent, and the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation sold 1,383 automobiles, a rise of 39.7 percent.
Subaru of America, which began selling domestically produced cars in the American market last summer, sold 431 autos in mid-November, and Isuzu Motors Ltd., Subaru's partner in a plant in Lafayette, Ind., sold 1,136 light trucks.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 29, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about vehicle sales in the United States in mid-November misstated the overall increase. Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks from Nov. 11 to 20 rose 14.7 percent, not 12.6 percent, over last year's.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Much Wider in 3d Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit, aggravated by rising oil prices and a drop in farm exports, swelled to $29.75 billion from July through September, the worst quarterly imbalance in a year, the Commerce Department said today.
The third-quarter gap between imports and exports widened by a sharp 28.9 percent from a second-quarter deficit of $23.1 billion. Imports climbed 5 percent, to an all-time high of $125.91 billion, while exports slipped six-tenths of 1 percent, to $96.16 billion.
Economists predicted that the deterioration from the second quarter, which had posted the lowest deficit in more than six years, would continue in the final three months of 1990 as rising oil prices further increased America's import bill. Analysts said the slumping United States economy should lower American demand for non-oil imports next year and thus help to narrow the trade deficit.
The July-September imbalance was the largest quarterly deficit since a $29.8 billion deficit in the corresponding period last year. The deficit had been narrowing since that time as an export boom helped sales of American products.
Today's report on merchandise trade, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis, confirmed trends already noted in the Commerce Department's monthly merchandise trade reports. The quarterly report, however, excludes military sales by the United States Government and makes other minor adjustments to the monthly figures.

Bush and the Economy: Any Cure for the Jitters?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
To Presidents, the economy hardly ever looks good. Recession seems to be looming or, if not, inflation is threatening, or the markets are down, or productivity is lagging, or something else is wrong that the voters might hold them responsible for. By the middle of their term, the economist Herbert Stein has observed, Presidents come "face to face with the dreadful prospect" that unless they change course, they might enter their re-election campaign "with an economy in misery."
"This is a condition that frequently afflicts administrations in their second or third year and sets them to searching, open-mindedly or desperately, for new solutions," Mr. Stein, who headed Richard M. Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in his book, "Presidential Economics." 
 Perhaps it was these midterm jitters that led President Bush this year to abandon his stance against tax increases. But if so, it may have been a passing impulse. Although the state of the economy nowadays appears more dismal with each new release of data, there is no indication as Mr. Bush winds up his second year in office that his Administration has much in the way of new economic plans.
In their public statements this fall, top officials have tried to soothe anxiety rather than offer policy prescriptions. Instead of using the harsh word "recession," they have talked about "tough times," "slowdown" and "downturn" (President Bush), "lull" (Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers) and "the downphase of the cycle" (Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady).
Richard G. Darman, the budget director, warned against "neo-neo-ism," which he described as always looking for a "bold new program," and "Hubble-ism," which he defined as launching an idea at full scale before it was properly tested. Instead, Mr. Darman advocated "empirically based analysis." In other words, look before you leap -- hardly a wonder drug for a sick economy.
Before Thanksgiving, Mr. Bush met several times with bankers and business executives. Perhaps afraid to acknowledge that the President had no trump cards in his economic hand, the White House kept the meetings off the official schedule, would not describe what was discussed and would not even give a list of participants.
At the Treasury Department, the center of economic policy-making in past Administrations, attention is focused not so much on the overall economy as on legislation the Administration plans to propose next year to revise Depression-era banking regulations. The changes could eventually improve economic activity by making more loans available. But the measure will take a year to get through Congress, and many more years will pass before its effects are fully felt in the credit markets.
For better or worse, other recent Presidents at the midpoint of their first terms took steps to show the country that they were trying to turn the economy around. At the end of 1962, John F. Kennedy proposed the biggest tax cut in American history up to that time. In 1971, Mr. Nixon imposed wage and price controls. In 1982 and 1983, Ronald Reagan retreated substantially from the "supply-side" philosophy of his first year in the White House and supported a large tax increase and legislation to create new jobs.
But President Bush has much less freedom than his predecessors. Saddled with a $300 billion deficit, he can hardly propose tax cuts or spending increases. New budget rules make it difficult if not impossible for Mr. Bush to expand unemployment benefits, a step taken by all other recent Presidents who faced rising joblessness. And Congress has taken away what used to be one of Presidents' strongest levers, the ability to give the economy a quick jolt by shifting Government spending from one part of a fiscal year to another.
So Plan A, said an Administration official working on economic matters, is to "wait and hope" -- hope that the gulf crisis ends peacefully and oil prices come down, hope that the unemployment rate next year rises no higher than the 6.5 percent now being forecast, hope that the Federal Reserve Board will lower interest rates by at least another percentage point and, above all, hope that a recovery is in full force by 1992.
And Plan B? "Right now," the official said, "there isn't one."

HEADLINE: Chemical Plants Buy Up Neighbors for Safety Zone

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Nov. 21

 BODY:
Prodded by lawsuits over pollution and damage claims from a number of explosions, several of the nation's largest oil and chemical companies are spending millions of dollars to create safety zones by buying up the homes around their plants.
Although some homeowners are eagerly grabbing the offers of up to $200,000 for a house, the efforts are coming under growing criticism from environmentalists who say the companies are dismantling communities rather than than dealing with the root problems of safety and pollution. 
 A quarter of the nation's chemicals and a sizable portion of its transportation fuels are processed in more than 75 large industrial plants along the 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between here and New Orleans. Some of the plants are a tangle of pipes and tanks covering more than a square mile.
 
An Assortment of Concerns
 Stirred by new medical findings and rising concerns about industrial accidents and environmental issues, Louisiana's river communities are aggressively pressing lawsuits and damage claims that are costing the companies tens of millions of dollars.
"There are some things you just should not mix, including houses near these industrial facilities," said Dr. Paul Templet, the state's top environmental official. While he generally supports the idea of the buyout programs, he said the issue has not yet received enough scrutiny from state officials.
Some of the relocation programs are new, and others are continuations of programs that have been under way for years but are attracting new attention because of accidents or lawsuits.
 
A Variety of Programs
 The Dow Chemical Company began a buyout program across the Mississippi River from here last year that could cost $10 million. Five miles south of the Dow plant, the Georgia Gulf Corporation completed a program last year to move 50 families away from its vinyl chloride plant, turning a community founded by freed slaves into a six-acre grove of oaks and pecan trees.
The Exxon Corporation has spent $4 million on a similar progam here in Baton Rouge, and the Shell Oil Company is in the middle of another one down the river. Separate explosions killed two workers last year at the Exxon plant and seven workers in 1988 at the Shell plant, but the companies each say that the purchases of nearby homes began earlier and are not related to the accidents.
Another program is beginning in Ponca City, Okla., where Conoco settled a lawsuit over pollution last July and is preparing to spend $18 million to buy 377 homes along the eastern boundary of its refinery there.
 
Reducing Risk, on Both Sides
 The property purchases are defended by company executives as a sensible approach to moving people out of harm's way. A consultant who helps design the programs said that in addition to reducing the companies' legal risk, it is also good citizenship.
Guy S. Barone, a spokesman for Dow's plant at Plaquemine, La., across the river from Baton Rouge, said: "We have a large manufacturing plant and we have operated it safely. At the same time there is a risk of an acute accident and we want to protect people living adjacent to the fence lines."
Michael J. Lythcott is a consultant for Moran, Stahl & Boyer, the New York relocation company that helped design the program in Ponca City for Conoco and Dow's effort in Morrisonville, a small community adjacent to the plant in Plaquemine. He said that relocation was a new trend in the chemical and oil industries and that such programs were being planned in California, Louisiana, Virginia and West Virginia, though he declined to identify the companies involved.
"From a business sense, it is economically sound," he said. "There are potential toxic torts and if there is an accident it has an impact on worldwide sales. It makes sense in putting a program together instead of waiting for an accident, and lives to be lost." He acknowledged that one problem with relocation is that companies cannot "compensate people for emotional attachment to land or their homes."
 
Criticism by Environmentalists
 Environmental leaders have criticized Dow's program and several others. "Companies are reducing their problems by moving people instead of reducing accidents and pollution," said Mary Lee Orr, the executive director of the Louisiana Environment Action Network, a coalition of environmental groups based in Baton Rouge.
Property owners are also divided by the buyout projects. Most who sold their homes did not have much in the first place and view the offers as the break they needed to move into new and larger homes. But there is also anguish in some communities as neighbors who have lived together for decades are separated.
Nowhere is this more true than in Plaquemine, along the western banks of the Mississippi River just south of here, where Dow is breaking up Morrisonville, a community of 87 white and black property owners, and 110 homes, that was founded after the Civil War by freed slaves.
Morrisonville is situated on 200 acres along the eastern boundary of the 1,800-acre plant, Dow's third largest. The site is the second for Morrisonville. In 1931 it was moved a mile and a half west after the Army Corps of Engineers refused to continue maintaining the levees that protected the town, then 50 years old, from the Mississippi River.
In May 1989, Dow began a novel program to pay landowners $20,000 an acre, and homeowners at least $50,000, and up to $200,000, to get control of the ground for a safety zone.
Dow also offered a minimum of $10,000 to resettle families who rented homes in the town, and it built a subdivision nearly four miles down river where some of Morrisonville's families could move into new brick homes and establish another community.
Most of Morrisonville's families accepted Dow's offer for their property, but only 12 chose to move to the new subdivision, Morrisonville Estates. Doretha Thompson, 78 years old, said she received $80,000 for her worn wooden house no bigger than a sharecropper cabin, and her move to the subdivision is just weeks away.
 
'We Didn't Hold Together'
 "We didn't hold together like I thought we might," she said while helping friends clean mustard greens just picked from the garden. "Now some are down the river, some across, some in town. White and black are scattering."
Hilda King, 54, Ms. Thompson's neighbor and a lifelong Morrisonville resident, also sold her house to Dow and moved to Morrisonville Estates last month. "I got away from all those chemicals, all that noise," said Ms. King, showing a visitor around her new three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath home.
Perhaps 20 other Morrisonville families have remained in their homes, saying Dow's offer is not generous enough. "Dow doesn't pay for attachment to land, for the inheritance that is in this community," said Rosa L. Martin, who lives with her husband, Jack, in a modern brick house so close to the plant that hissing compressors and commands over the plant loudspeakers can be heard inside.
"This spot is worth more to me than anywhere," Mr. Martin, 63, a retired Air Force computer and electronics instructor, said of the community his father joined at the turn of the century."Dow doesn't understand that, but we're still talking."
An explosion on May 5, 1988, at the Shell refinery and chemical complex in Norco, La., just north of New Orleans, killed seven workers and has cost the company at least $40 million in damage claims, with more than 20,000 claims still to be settled.
Shell is buying property from homeowners near the plant, but Norman Altstedter, a company spokesman, said the purchases have been going on for 20 years. "It has been a continuing effort to be a good neighbor," said Mr. Altstedter, "and has not been in response to any industrial accidents or the explosion."
 
$4 Million to Move 110 Homes
 Exxon has spent $4 million to buy and remove 110 homes and businesses in the neighborhoods along the southern and eastern boundaries of its enormous refinery and chemical complex along the river here.
Some of the homes were damaged last Christmas Eve by an explosion at the refinery that killed two workers, injured seven and generated 8,000 damage claims.
Walter J. Eldredge, an Exxon executive, said the company wants to establish a greenbelt around the plant by buying homes and converting them to empty lots. He said the project was started before the accident and was intended to beautify the area.
"I don't believe that," said Curtis Brown Jr., 18, who lives with his parents, a brother and a sister in the Standard Heights neighborhood south of the refinery. "They're scared of another tank blowing up or gas coming over here. When that tank blew up I thought an airplane had fallen on the house. People were running down the street holding their heads."
Mr. Brown said his father declined an offer of $18,000 for the house. "You can't buy a house with kind of money," he said.
Across the Mississippi from Baton Rouge and five miles south of the Dow plant, Georgia Gulf completed its program last year to move 50 families from Reveilletown, another black community formed by freed slaves after the Civil War.
The six-acre parcel that was Reveilletown (pronounced re-VEAL-town) is now a grove of oaks and pecan trees spreading over clipped grass.
 
Exits Began After '87 Suit
 Edward A. Schmitt, the general manager, said Georgia Gulf began buying Reveilletown property in the mid-1970's, only a few years after the chemical plant was built in 1969. "We didn't need the six acres for expansion, but it serves as buffer zone if there was a major release," he said.
A lawsuit over contamination and health complaints in 1987 by 13 Reveilletown property owners was settled a year later and hastened the town's end. The owners who sued moved away after receiving cash. Twenty other families then agreed to sell to Georgia Gulf for $1.2 million. Twelve families moved two miles north to a subdivision near Morrisonville Estates that has come to be called New Reveilletown.
"We have to stop these relocations," said Les Ann Kirkland, a leader of AWARE, a local environmental group. "They're going to slip into normalcy. We can't keep putting price tags on people's history. Instead of removing the people, remove the risk."
Allen Craig, 77, and his wife Mary, 69, are the last Reveilletown residents. They were left behind in a legal dispute with the company handling relocations, but they are hoping to go, too. "I want to leave because everybody else went," said Mrs. Craig.

HEADLINE: After Decades of Rises, Rents Sag in Much of New York City

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
For the first time since the Great Depression, apartment rents are dropping in much of New York City.
Real-estate professionals say rents have dropped at least 5 percent to 10 percent -- and in some cases as much as 20 percent and more -- in a variety of city neighborhoods during the last three years. 
 Rents on luxury apartments have dipped occasionally over the last half-century, but this is the first time that the number of apartments available for rent has begun to outstrip demand even in working-class and middle-class neighborhoods, said real-estate brokers, landlords and other housing specialists.
Ever since World War II, when the city's housing shortage began, a tight rental market and rising rents have been as central to New York's fabric as traffic, noise and glitter. The decline in rents has produced fundamental changes in many of the unwritten rules and rituals that have made finding a decent apartment a distinctive New York ordeal.
 
Haggling Is Possible
 No longer do prospective tenants routinely find it necessary to scour obituaries to discover vacant apartments, or bribe doormen, superintendents or managing agents to gain first rights to a vacancy.
Nor do landlords automatically increase rents to the maximum allowed under the rent-stabilization law, as they have for decades. On renewing a lease, landlords and tenants now often negotiate a rent increase. Landlords also say that when an apartment becomes vacant, not only must they often forgo the rent increase that is allowed by law, but they also cannot attract a new tenant without offering a rent below the previous level.
To people accustomed to the traditional New York housing market, in which landlords held most of the leverage, the new world of renting can be startling.
Thomas Lynch, an investment banker, is moving from Boston back to New York this week after spending seven years away. In the city he remembers, a good apartment was so hard to find that "people actually paid off doormen to find out who had died in the building," Mr. Lynch said.
When he began looking for an apartment two months ago, he said, he discovered immediately that things had changed. The first broker he visited took him into a small room, in which three of the four walls were covered with small filing cards with information on apartments that were available immediately. Because he was looking for an apartment seven or eight weeks before he intended to move in, the broker suggested that he postpone his search.
A few weeks later Mr. Lynch looked at apartments for several days. "I found it very easy to find a lot of apartments," he said.
He selected a small one-bedroom apartment with a private garden in a building on East 64th Street, off Fifth Avenue. He will pay $1,450 a month. The owner first put it on the market at $2,500 a month, Mr. Lynch said.
 
An Apartment Survey
 Apartments in Mr. Lynch's new neighborhood and on the Upper West Side have carried rents averaging about 10 percent lower than those for similar apartments in 1987, a survey by the Feathered Nest, a Manhattan real-estate brokerage, found.
Two-bedroom apartments in good Bronx neighborhoods like Pelham Parkway and along parts of the Grand Concourse, which had rented for $650 a month two years ago, are now renting for $600 to $615 a month, said Michael Laub, a partner in a real-estate company that owns and manages 70 buildings in Washington Heights and the Bronx.
Some Manhattan developers are so hard-pressed for tenants that they have begun to pay the real-estate broker's fee, ranging from one month's rent to 15 percent of the total first-year rent. New York renters have traditionally paid the broker's fee.
The decline in rents does not mean that New York apartments are now a bargain, at least compared with most American cities. It also does not auger much relief for low-income New Yorkers, for whom the shortage of decent, inexpensive housing has long been most acute. Rents in poor neighborhoods have remained stable, housing specialists said.
But the overall decline does reflect a significant softening of the rental market, many owners and brokers say. The last time any New Yorkers experienced rent decreases was in the early 1970's, but then it was limited only to the most expensive apartments, real-estate professionals said.
If sustained, the changes in the rental market might lead to revisions in New York's system of rent regulations. By law, rent control and rent stabilization remain in effect as long as the city's overall vacancy rate is below 5 percent. If it goes above that figure, the regulations are lifted.
No one knows how much the overall vacancy rate has changed in the last three years, or, despite the decline in rents, whether it has changed at all. In the most recent city survey, released in 1988, the rate was 2.46 percent. The next survey will be next year, city housing officials said.
Some landlords, who have long sought a phasing out of rent control and rent stabilization, have begun citing the decline in rents to bolster their argument. They contend that some owners, squeezed by higher costs and falling rents, will be forced to abandon their buildings.
"The market is proving to be an excellent regulator," said Richard Esposito, a partner in Prana Investments Inc., which owns and manages 18 buildings in Harlem.
Tenant groups have long contended that any relaxation of the rent regulations would most harm the poor and elderly, who already are paying disproportionately large shares of their income for housing. Tenants are certain to oppose any changes.
 
Rent Stabilization
 Rent stabilization covers 840,000 apartments, generally in buildings constructed between 1947 and 1974 and those built after 1974 with city tax abatements. Tenants in 140,000 more apartments are covered by separate rent-control rules if they have lived for at least 19 years in buildings constructed before 1947.
Of course, not every apartment is cheaper than it was a year or two ago. New York is a huge city, with many sub-markets. Some developers contended that rents had remained stable in fashionable Manhattan neighborhoods, and they questioned whether the Feathered Nest survey measured actual rents or just initial asking prices. Nancy Packes, the president of the Feathered Nest, said her report surveyed actual rents.
Louis Winnick, a housing economist who has closely studied the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn, said rents had not risen or fell in that neighborhood. But in the adjacent Park Slope section, rents have declined 5 to 10 percent in the last few months, said Bryan P. Gay, a real-estate broker.
"It's no longer just a phenomenon at the top end of the market, but has spread itself through the entire system," said John J. Gilbert 3d, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the largest owners' group.
Richard LeFrak, president of the Lefrak Organization, a leading real-estate concern, said the reasons for the decline were clear: "The laws of supply and demand are at work. It's not that complicated."
The faltering economy has diminished people's willingness to pay high rents at the upper end, where the retrenchment on Wall Street has sharply altered spending habits, and at the middle of the market, in working-class and middle-class housing.
At the same time the weak sales market in cooperative and condominium apartments has stimulated interest in rentals. Many affluent New Yorkers who might ordinarily buy an apartment have decided to rent temporarily because they think sale prices will continue to drop.
 
Renting Instead of Buying
 But a substantial increase in supply offsets any increase in demand, real-estate professionals said. Some of the new rentals are the result of the building boom of the 1980's. Some new buildings were constructed to be rentals, but many were built as co-ops or condos. Some developers, unable to sell their new apartments, have begun renting them instead.
In addition, thousands of individual co-op and condo apartments are being offered as rentals by their owners, often after owners failed to sell them. Many speculators who bought several condo apartments during the roaring 80's are also being forced to rent them in the retrenched 90's.
The rental oversupply is most pronounced at the high end. Two-bedroom apartments in rent-stabilized buildings without doormen on Manhattan's Upper West Side are renting for an average of $1,750 a month, the Feathered Nest found, while similar apartments were renting for an average of $2,150 a month last year.
One-bedroom apartments in newer, unregulated buildings with doormen on the Upper East Side are renting for an average of $1,850 a month this year, according to the survey, while similar apartments rented for about $2,000 a month last year.
Many rent-stabilized building owners in Queens, the Bronx and Upper Manhattan said that when apartments became vacant, they often had to lower rents to find tenants. Under this year's rent-stabilization guidelines, they are entitled to raise the rent on vacant apartments by nearly 10 percent for a one-year lease.
While a boon to consumers, the market shift could hurt some landlords. Rents are declining just as owners are being hit with large cost increases on everything from property taxes to water and sewer bills to heating oil. Many landlords predicted that the financial squeeze would force some owners to cut services and ultimately abandon their buildings.
"This certainly doesn't spell out a positive future for rental housing in New York City," said Mr. Gilbert of the Rent Stabilization Association.

HEADLINE: Pay Abuses in Border Garment Shops

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EL PASO, Nov. 21

 BODY:
On the last Friday in May, Amelia Lambarena reported, as usual, to her job at Diana's Fashions workshop here. But on that day she did not sew a single stitch. The doors were locked, all the machinery had been removed in the night, and there was no sign of the owner, who owed her $700 in back pay.
Through an efficient grapevine she learned that the entire operation had been transported down the block and given a new name: El Paso International Apparel. So she and other stranded employees walked together to the new location, where they confronted the owner of the old shop. He denied that he owned this new operation and said he would call the police if they did not leave. They went home without their money. 
 In El Paso, one of the largest garment-producing cities in the country, contractors who close shops without paying, then reopen under other names, are increasingly common, according to several Government officials and advocates for these workers. Even more common are shops that do not close, but simply refuse to pay their employees for months at a time.
At one point last month the United States Department of Labor estimated that 337 employees were owed $87,330 by 18 El Paso garment industry employers.
It is a symptom, officials say, of the problems of an industry that is becoming steadily less profitable and of a group of workers, mostly poor immigrant Hispanic women who are in the process of applying for legal residency and who are too frightened of deportation to complain.
"The problem is nationwide," said Susan Cowell, vice president of the International Ladies' Garment Worker's Union, "particularly in areas where there are a lot of immigrants, like Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco."
 
'It's the Isolation'
 But the practice of garment industry employers who do not pay their employees appears to be particularly entrenched in El Paso.
"It's the isolation," explained Jeff Hermanson, organizing director for the union, which has taken an interest in the problems of workers applying for amnesty. "El Paso is a long way from the centers of power. It's a lawless atmosphere, and some of the employers have an attitude of lawlessness."
Mr. Hermanson, based in New York City, was echoing a description that is often used by those here who complain that legal protections against such abuses often are not enforced.
Cutting and sewing employs more than 15,000 of El Paso's 500,000 people, according to the Texas Employment Commission. It is estimated that 120 shops operate at any given time, completing contracts ordered by large manufacturers with familiar labels.
These thousands of people and hundreds of small factories are all but invisible to the unknowing observer, however. Most of the shops employ 50 to 150 people each and are hidden behind the unmarked doors of warehouses and houses that look abandoned.
Small shops like these are particularly vulnerable to economic hard times. "As contracts dry up, a lot of these little manufacturers start going under," said Ray Brito, assistant director of the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division office here. He said the problem had worsened in the last year.
 
'I'll Be O.K.'
 "But they refuse to face reality," he said. "They're like players at the craps table in Las Vegas, trying to hang on, thinking, 'If I just get one more contract, I'll be O.K.' "
As a result, Mr. Brito said, "they promise money they know they can't pay. And the workers stay and take it."
Many workers fear their employers will sabotage their applications for legal residency status if they complain, he and other officials said. Other workers keep quiet in hopes that they will be paid if they do not make waves.
In recent weeks, some have begun to fight back. A group called La Mujer Obrera, Spanish for "the working woman," has been tracking factories and owners since May. The group, made up mostly of factory workers, has picketed several and provided assistance to employees who are owed money.
 
Stronger Measures
 This month the employees of a factory called Sonia's held a daylong work stoppage, which ended after La Mujer Obrera negotiated a loan from a local religious group to pay wages owed to workers. The workers also obtained a written agreement, drawn up by a lawyer, in which the owner promises they will be allowed to sell his property and keep the proceeds if future wages are not paid.
The Federal Government has also become involved. A team from the Department of Labor visited 38 factories this summer and found wage violations at nearly half. Mr. Brito said the owners of those factories face fines if the problems are not corrected. Of the factories' 337 workers who were unpaid as of early fall, Mr. Brito estimates that 87 have received a total of $40,000, about half the wages owed, since then.
But employers, employees, government officials and advocates for the workers all agree that only a few factory owners are deliberately abusing their employees. Others, they say, are caught in a changing industry and are managing those changes badly.
Until 10 years ago, the garment factories of El Paso provided stable, well-paid work. They were owned by the nation's largest clothing manufacturers, including Farah and Levi Strauss. Then foreign competition increased and manufacturers found it more economical to close their plants and contract for much of their piecework.
The result was a patchwork of smaller contractors that pay minimum wage without providing any medical benefits and that set production quotas for workers. Never particularly stable, their businesses' futures have become even more questionable as threats of a recession have sharply curtailed contracts from larger manufacturers.
At TNT Manufacturing here, the owner, Rogelio Tinajero, described the last two months as being "like a roller coaster -- up and down." He said that until this summer his two-year-old company was regularly receiving orders for 1,000 garments, but that in recent months the orders had been for only several hundred pieces.
In an interview he said that he was afraid he would not be able to meet his next payroll and that he might have to close the factory. Soon after, the company laid off 38 workers and reduced the hours of the 12 who remained.
 
Caught by Change
 The changes in the industry come at a time when other changes are taking place in the workers' lives. Most factory employees are Hispanic; a majority entered the United States illegally and are in the process of applying for amnesty under the Immigration Reform and Control Act, according to Cecelia Rodriguez, head of La Mujer Obrera.
One qualification for amnesty is that workers must show proof of steady employment, and this may be in the form of pay stubs or a letter from an employer. Because of this, many employees continue working for employers who do not pay them on time, if at all, fearing that the employer will rescind certification that he has already signed.
Which is why Prisiliano Valdez, an employee of Diana's who was owed wages when it closed, continued to work for the man he says is the owner, Hector Gutierrez, at El Paso International Apparel.
Mr. Valdez said in an interview here that the day before Diana's closed, he was handed a slip of paper with the address of El Paso International and told to report there the following day. "Only certain people got them," he said. "I guess the ones who wouldn't complain."
 
'He Is the Boss'
 When he arrived at the new location, he said, he recognized the sewing machines with which he stitched the thick edges of pockets on denim jeans and the same shorts on which he had been working. He said that Mr. Gutierrez was at the new location and that he "acted like he is the boss."
Like Mrs. Lambarena, he said, he was owed money from the old factory. Despite that, he said, he continued to work for the new factory because "I wanted to have a job and I had hopes that he would pay me." Five weeks later, he said, he found another job and left El Paso International. He still had not been paid for his work at Diana's.
At El Paso International a man who said he was Mr. Gutierrez said he did not own the company, but merely managed it. He said he could not say who the owner was. When asked further questions, he said he did not have time to talk "because I'm working." He said that he would not be able to talk later in the day and that he could not receive calls at work because "there is no phone." The pay telephone on the wall behind him, he said, does not receive incoming calls, and he said he did not have a telephone at home.
Several weeks later, in response to a complaint from La Mujer Obrera, some of the machines at El Paso International were impounded by the sheriff and auctioned for $1,500, which will be divided among the workers who are owed back wages by Diana's.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
DEMOCRATS PRESS BUSH TO PUT OFF MILITARY ACTION

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
With the United Nations Security Council due to approve a resolution later this week authorizing the use of military force against Iraq any time after Jan. 15, Senate Democrats urged the Bush Administration today to delay taking military action and give economic sanctions more time to work.
As the Senate Armed Services Committee opened hearings on the Persian Gulf crisis, Senator Sam Nunn, the chairman of the panel, once again questioned the need for rushing into combat with Iraq. Senator Nunn's caution was generally echoed by the nine other Democrats at the hearing. 
 Some conservative Republicans expressed concern that the hearing was playing into the hands of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq by suggesting that the United States lacked the will to use military force and disclosing that there were divisions in the United States.
 
'Lighting Our Own Fuse'
 "Time is working on our side," Senator Nunn said, suggesting that economic sanctions would be effective in prompting President Hussein to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
"We are lighting our own fuse," the Georgia Democrat complained to reporters after the hearing, saying that the Administration had limited its options by building up a large military force in the gulf and shelving plans for troop rotations.
In Baghdad today, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz expressed defiance in the face of efforts to make Baghdad's forces pull out of Kuwait. Mr. Aziz dismissed the importance of the proposed United Nations resolution that would authorize the use of force to oust Iraq from Kuwait, saying that his country would "never succumb to pressure." [Page A14.]
 
A List of Questions
 The Congressional hearings, which grew out of concern that President Bush would go to war without consulting Congress, represent an effort by Mr. Nunn and his Senate colleagues to influence American policy even as the Bush Administration continues to threaten Iraq with a winter war unless Iraqi forces leave Kuwait.
Senator Nunn, whose views on military issues carry great weight in the Senate, began the hearing by reading a list of questions that he said should guide the national debate over possible offensive action against Iraq.
"The question is not whether military action is justified; it is," Mr. Nunn said. "The question is whether military action is wise at this time and in our own national interest."
"Is it in our vital interest to liberate Kuwait through military action by a largely American military force?" he asked. "Will economic sanctions force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait?"
"How long can we sustain over 400,000 American troops in Saudi Arabia," Mr. Nunn continued.
"Should our military objectives extend beyond the restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty to the elimination of key aspects of Iraq's offensive military capability, particularly their ongoing nuclear efforts?"
"How durable is the multinational coalition?" he also asked.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, the second-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said separately that President Bush, through an envoy, should initiate talks with President Hussein.
The talks, he said at a breakfast meeting with reporters, should not be for negotiations but rather to explain United States intentions in the Middle East, which Mr. Hamilton said might not be clear to the Iraqi President.
 
Schlesinger Testifies
 The first witness today, James R. Schlesinger, Defense Secretary in the Ford and Nixon Administrations, told the Committee that economic sanctions would be successful in forcing Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait if only the Administration would give them time to work.
Mr. Schlesinger, who also served as Director of Central Intelligence, said that an early "official estimate," which he suggested committee members would hear more about in a closed-door intelligence briefing later in the day, held that it would take a year for the sanctions to take effect. "It now appears to be working more rapidly than anticipated," Mr. Schlesinger said.
"In three months time, civilian production in Iraq is estimated to have declined by some 40 percent," he said. "Oil exports are essentially nil and export earning have dropped correspondingly. The hoard of hard currency, necessary to sustain smuggling, is dwindling away. The economic pressure can only grow worse."
But Mr. Schlesinger asserted that the effectiveness of economic sanctions would be diminished if President Hussein believed that the underlying American goal was not just to liberate Kuwait but also to eliminate Iraq's military ability or remove Mr. Hussein from power.
 
'Sound Advice,' Nunn Says
 He also asserted that an American military victory over Iraq "may result in an enmity directed at the United States for an extended period, not only by Iraq and its present supporters, but ultimately among the publics of some of the nations now allied to us."
Senator Nunn said in an interview later that Mr. Schlesinger had provided "sound advice" that paralleled his own counsel to the Administration.
"The real cost is lives," said Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Democrat, indicating agreement with the thrust of Mr. Schlesinger's presentation.
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said of economic sanctions in a statement, "Instead of eliminating troop rotations and adding huge numbers of American forces, the President should be displaying American staying power for the long haul."
 
Glenn Expresses Concern
 Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat, also expressed concern that President Bush would order an attack "before the embargo has had time to really bite and to be effective."
Senator Nunn said he agreed with the Administration's decision to seek a United Nations resolution authorizing force to build pressure on Iraq.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Carrier's Pilots Confidently Face War

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ABOARD THE U.S.S. MIDWAY, off Saudi Arabia, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The F-18 Hornet fighters catapulted off the Midway's deck in a scream of engines and a shimmering pall of jet exhaust.
Flight crews ran to and fro on this 45-year-old carrier, lining up fighters for a takeoff assisted by a power catapult that hurtled the planes off the deck so fast that they accelerated from zero to 150 miles per hour in two seconds. 
 At the last instant, the fighters shot into space, where, like supersonic knuckleballs, they briefly wobbled and floated before suddenly roaring up into the clear winter skies of Arabia.
The operation gave an impression of enormous raw power harnessed to hurl warplanes into the sky from the squat platform of the Navy's smallest and oldest aircraft carrier. During the Vietnam war, her planes flew tens of thousands of sorties against Hanoi when she operated in the South China Sea.
 
'Land on a Postage Stamp'
 The sleek fighters returned as furiously as they departed, slamming down at nearly full power on just 190 feet of deck, considerably less than on longer, wider and newer carriers. A hook trailing the aircraft snags a lateral deck cable, jerking them to a shuddering stop and often leaving the pilot staring over the edge of the deck into the sea far below.
"You fly through the eye of a needle and land on a postage stamp," said Lieut. Dave Leppelmeier as he described landing on a pitching runway.
The Midway, which was commissioned in September 1945 and survived Congressional proposals to scrap it a few years ago, is part of what will soon be the largest deployment of American warships since World War II, according to Rear Adm. Daniel P. March, commander of the Carrier Group Five Strike Force of the Seventh Fleet.
There are three United States naval battle groups, each led by an aircraft carrier, already in the region. They will be joined by three more battle groups under orders from President Bush.
 
More Ships Than Used in Vietnam
 In addition to a carrier, a battle group includes computerized missile-bearing destroyers and frigates, among other ships. Admiral March estimated that there would be well over 60 American warships in the theater within the next month, more ships than were deployed at any one time during the Vietnam War, he said.
The ships from the United States appear to have sealed these seas to Iraqi shipping, senior officers said.
Capt. J. W. Parker, commander of Destroyer Squadron 15, said that since Nov. 1 the Midway-led flotilla of eight ships has been intercepting about 100 boats per day by radio to check their nationality, cargo and destination.
He said no Iraqi-flagged ship nor Iraqi-bound ship had tried to enter these seas, which are now restricted under the United Nations embargo.
 
Ship Destinations Monitored
 "I think Iraq has probably come to the conclusion it can't get in this way," Captain Parker told a group of reporters visiting the Midway today.
Captain Parker did not rule out that ships bound for Iran could unload material to be shipped overland to Iraq. But officers said such traffic would appear to be minimal. They added that every passing ship is watched to be sure that it does not try to unload in either Iraq or Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
His account would appear to indicate that the maritime embargo against Iraq, while slow to affect the Iraqi economy, is as effective as Navy ships can make it.
 
Iran Cooperating With U.S. Ships
 And officers aboard the Midway said Iran appeared to be making an effort to cooperate with Navy forces in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
In what seemed to be a strong sign of neutrality in the surging military deployment, Iranian surveillance aircraft and helicopters have taken special care to make radio contact, identify themselves and then maintain distant positions requested by American commanders as the Midway recently steamed through the narrow Strait of Hormuz, the officers say.
Capt. James M. Burin, commander of the carrier's fighter air wing, said Iraqi planes and radar made no attempt to make contact with American fighters deployed in the exercise, indicating a continuing Iraqi policy of caution.
The Midway carries a crew of 4,300 and some 60 aircraft, including approximately 30 of the Navy's newest F-18 jet fighters. It is guarded 24 hours a day by jet fighters, special radar and electronic-jamming planes, air surveillance aircraft and armed helicopters, as well as by accompanying destroyers armed with missiles and radar systems that can pick up an oncoming aircraft hundreds of miles away.
The pilots of the Midway's F-18 fighter squad said they are on full alert and combat ready. They trade fighter radio call signs such as "Lefty," "Big Wave Dave" and "Bones" to one another as they whip past the Midway's viewing bridge, called "Vultures Row" by gawking sailors who sometimes watch the aerial show.
 
Iraq Pilots Get High Marks
 "Things are changing so fast right now," said Lieut. Comdr. Jeff Ashby, one of the Midway's F-18 pilots. "We don't know from day to day how they will go." .
Others appeared to step over the line separating confidence from cockiness.
"I just refuse to believe that a third-world person who rides a camel can be as smart as I am," declared Lieutenant Leppelmeier, an F-18 pilot, referring to Iraqi pilots.
Saudi pilots who have studied the Iraqi airforce speak with greater prudence. They give Iraqi pilots high marks for having combat experience and for being skilled with laser-guided weapons and jamming devices.
Almost all crew members interviewed said they hoped Iraq would pull out of Kuwait and avoid a war, although all said they were ready to fight if the time for fighting comes. A heady few, like Lieutenant Leppelmeier, said they were looking forward to battle.
"Sure," the F-18 pilot replied when asked if he wanted to fight. "I'm 30, can't keep a girlfriend and can't save a dime."

HEADLINE: Shop? Many Say, Only if I Must

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
"SHOP till you drop" may have been the mind-set for the 1980's. But these days, a new phenomenon is emerging: the shopping dropout.
With the crucial holiday selling period under way, retailers are blaming the sagging economy for forecasts that range from cautious to bleak. But interviews with scores of market researchers and shoppers suggest that growing numbers of people have become averse to shopping even if they have the money to buy. They cite lack of time, dissatisfaction with service and merchandise, and changed priorities. 
 "In the 1970's, shopping was entertainment," said Laura Petrucci, a partner in the management consulting group at the Marketing Corporation of America in Westport, Conn. "In the 1980's, it was the quest for trendy merchandise. In the 1990's, it's a mission: find it, buy it and get out."
These purposeful buyers, unlike the shoppers who foraged for fun in years past, may be less open to the seductive displays and promotions that retailers rely on to bring about impulse purchases. Several surveys in the last year show mounting disaffection for shopping at the same time that some of the nation's most prestigious retailing chains have been struggling to survive the effects of debt-financed changes in ownership.
Now, with the industry facing difficult times, consultants like Ms. Petrucci say stores must become more sensitive to the barriers that make shopping a chore: cumbersome security devices attached to clothes, too few clerks, limits on the number of items that can be taken into dressing rooms, inconvenient hours and confusing or inefficient store design.
Some shoppers agree. "In a department store, the process of trying something on and paying for it takes an unbelievable amount of time," said Dea Breitman, a publicity agent in Los Angeles. She prefers shopping in discount stores, not only because of the prices but because she finds the merchandise is displayed better.
Retailing chains continue to expand selling space and plan new stores on the assumption that when the economy improves, shoppers will return in droves. "But we think attitudes have changed sufficiently so that's not going to happen," said Barbara Caplan, a vice president at Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, market researchers in Westport. "The emphasis now is more on life than style."
In an annual survey of 2,500 adults, Yankelovich found this year that even among people who said they liked to shop for clothes, the percentage who found the experience frustrating and time-consuming rose to 66 percent, from 60 percent in 1989. The respondents were interviewed in person for the survey, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.
Women's attitudes toward clothes shopping have big consequences for retailers because their apparel purchases dwarf those made by men. But in the Yankelovich survey, changed feelings were evident.
The number who said they liked to shop for clothes dropped to 44 percent this year from 47 percent last year. Although that is not a major change, Ms. Caplan said it is striking considering that 55 percent would rather shop for food. Ms. Caplan said she believes that is because consumers are very likely to find what they want, and fast, in a grocery store.
Other surveys show similar attitudes, and not just about clothes shopping. In a November poll of 1,255 adults for Business Week by Louis Harris & Associates, nearly half of the respondents said they spend less time shopping than they did five years ago. Only 6 percent described shopping as their favorite leisure activity, while 63 percent said it was drudgery, or worse. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The attempt to limit the time spent shopping was especially evident among the 25 women whose incomes average $120,000 and who share their thoughts on shopping each year with the Marketing Corporation of America. Fifteen of them buy Paul Mitchell shampoo, Ms. Petrucci said, not because they are so attached to it but because it is sold at their hair salons.
While market researchers consult with a variety of retail clients, many chains do not avail themselves of these insights. Representatives for Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus said their stores commission little or no research on consumer attitudes. They said they kept in touch through the daily give and take on the sales floor.
"The relationship between the customer and the sales associate is a very personal one," said Jan Roberts, a spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus, which is based in Dallas. Beyond that, computerized inventory systems also tell store executives what merchandise is selling well.
Many of these stores recognize that an unserved customer may never come back. Their chief responses have been a return to commissions to motivate salespeople and a new emphasis on the personal shopper, a salesperson who will select items for a busy customer or simply help navigate the store.
Saks Fifth Avenue, for instance, has increased the staff of its One on One personal-shopping service in the last year, from 10 to 18. "When you have nine floors of a store, sometimes it is very frustrating," said Nancy Mickelson, manager of the service at the Saks in Manhattan.
But the market researchers say retailers need to look at the way people's lives and levels of tolerance have changed.
"We recently did a focus group in a mall, and one of the major complaints was that the tags were hidden inside the clothes," said Judith K. Langer, who has her own market research company in New York. But, she added, the stores' managers insisted that was necessary because the merchandise would look too messy with tags hanging out.
Small irritants like that loom large for harried consumers. "We're finding that people want to conserve time to spend with their families," said Jeffrey St. Clair, who manages consulting projects for Retail Planning Associates, in Columbus, Ohio. "I think that's putting pressure on stores."
It is certainly putting pressure on shoppers like Barbara Wankoff, who holds a job and has a young child, a combination that leaves her little spare time. Interviewed this month at the new Nordstrom in Paramus, N.J., a clothing store she praised for its unobtrusive but efficient service, she said: "My life is more hectic than it used to be. I have to go in and out."
Lives like hers, says the Direct Marketing Association in New York, have helped fuel a 60 percent increase since 1983 in the number of people who shop by mail or phone. Retailers have learned from the success of the catalogue merchants, and they are increasingly offering mail-order shopping themselves, said Chet Dalzell, the association's spokesman.
Some retailers reject the notion that people are shopping less because they have less time for it. "We always have time for the things we like and we don't have time for the things we don't," said Ralph Holt, a divisional vice president of marketing for Lazarus, a department store chain based in Cincinnati. He believes that changes in attitudes about the importance of clothing are a more likely cause of sluggish sales.
But the conviction that people want to help themselves, and fast, was crucial in the design of the year-old Abraham & Straus store in Manhattan, where executives say sales have exceeded expectations. Signs are clear and simple, the layout is open, and the store is relatively small. "As you ride the escalator, you can see where everything is," said John Hoeller, vice president and general manager of the store.
Target, a discount chain with a wide variety of merchandise that has stores in much of the country, used the responses from 80,000 customer-comment cards received each year to design its new store in Apple Valley, Minn., a suburb of St. Paul, to allow for efficient self-service, similar to that provided in a supermarket. It has wide aisles, clearly displayed signs, plenty of cashiers and easy return policies. Items are displayed the way people buy rather than the way a store's buyers buy.
"We put shampoo and hair dryers and combs together," said Gail Dorn, a spokeswoman for the company. "We put the shoelaces with the shoes," rather than in the toiletries or notions section, which is common.
Traditional department stores often make self-service difficult, perhaps because luxury stores believe that their customers prefer cosseting to convenience and because financially strapped stores must make do with curtailed staffs while being vigilant about costly inventory.
Myrna M. Egeth was recently shopping at Macy's in Manhattan, looking through clothes by Mary Ann Restivo. But because all the clothes are locked up with hoops and chains, requiring sales assistance, "I would be unlikely to ask to try something on," said Ms. Egeth, who lives in Manhattan.
A survey by Management Horizons, a retail-consulting company in Dublin, Ohio, indicates that Ms. Egeth's feeling is typical. Seventy percent of 500 shoppers surveyed said they would not ask to try on locked-up clothes. "It is a device that deters not only shoplifters, but shoppers," said Sharyn Brooks, vice president for consumer research.
But some shoppers remain unfazed by such obstacles. Fran Omero, who works in Manhattan and attends college part time, shops at Macy's on her lunch hour.
"I'm here every day," she said. "You picked a sick person. I think it's an outlet. It's better than drugs or alcohol or cheating on my husband."
But Ms. Omero, a recreational shopper that many retailers would consider the norm, is no longer typical, if she ever was. Market researchers say women are becoming more like men in their shopping habits, dispassionate about the experience and unwilling to tolerate inconvenience.
Ian Grant, a telecommunications engineer in New York who not only shops there but often in Philadelphia while visiting family on weekends, may be much closer to the average shopper today. "If they're not quick, I'll just leave the stuff on the counter and walk away," he said.
Speed is only part of the service problem. Shoppers, regardless of their income, are also looking for value, retailing analysts say, and cascading markdowns have made them cynical about pricing.
They are frustrated, too, when they cannot find what they want. That may happen more frequently now with an older population, said Walter K. Levy, a consultant in New York who specializes in retailing. "Customers have a greater sense of who they are," he said, "and they are less inclined to buy into the trend of the moment."
But that does not mean that people are not eager to buy. "There is a mismatch between customer need and what the stores are providing," Mr. Levy said. "There is a lot of latent demand out there that is not being satisfied."

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
The Horse Before The Cart

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Here are three reports from the American Dream:
* Young people "fresh out of high school" are having a hard time finding "good wages and steady work," a New York Times survey discovered. Household incomes where the principal earner is under 25 fell by 19 percent in the decade ending in 1988. 
 * Ulster County, New York, officials have proposed an 82 percent property tax increase for 1991, on top of a 42 percent increase in 1990. Taxpayers, predictably, are up in arms.
* The Times reported recently that numerous working people in New York City, like many in Moscow, are having to share apartments or houses, being unable to find or afford their own.
Similarly grim examples are common everywhere, and you don't need three guesses to find the common denominator among them: a stumbling United States economy that even George Bush admits is "sluggish."
That's a mild word for an engine performing at far less than capacity, in which unemployment nearing 6 percent has come to be regarded as normal. Not too many years ago, 4 percent employment was the national goal; 3 percent was sometimes achieved, and many wage employees earned high incomes. Now the overall economy not only is producing too few jobs; the new service-dominated economy is providing too few good jobs at substantial wages.
One consequence is that too little revenue is being raised to finance governments confronted with strong, in some cases rising, demands for public services. A second consequence is that insufficient savings for the future are being accumulated -- and the cost of a good education system should be counted as a savings for the future.
Attempting to remedy this situation by reducing the Federal budget deficit puts the cart before the horse, despite claims from both parties and from President and Congress. What is needed, instead, is a bold program to expand aggregate demand -- to increase the purchasing power of the American people. That means jobs, putting people back to work.
To hear recent Presidents and Congresses tell it, the only economic enemies to be feared are inflation and budget deficits. Little is said about unemployment and underemployment and the millions of Americans too discouraged to seek a job. Yet these are the chief causes of shrinking demand and the consequent "sluggish" economy.
A program to expand employment and increase demand would get the horse out front where it belongs, pulling the cart along; because in the long run it would also reduce the Federal deficit, probably more than the recent "deal" or any other in prospect. That result would not be immediate, but neither will negotiated deficit reduction; and anyway, the American insistence on quick fixes and overnight results is one of the nation's most prevalent weaknesses.
As employment and demand increase, a stimulated economy will begin to produce greater revenues -- not only for the Federal Government but for starved states and cities. That will make possible expanded public investment in improved education -- perhaps the single greatest need for the American future -- and in such other necessities as redeemed and expanded infrastructure (highways, bridges, sewage and water systems, etc.).
Investment in such necessities -- they are more than merely desirable -- will also be useful beyond its effect on revenues. Expanded job opportunities for young people, for example, may have some good effect on crime rates. Better health care, particularly for children (in a country where an eighth of the population has no medical insurance and millions get no or inadequate treatment) will mean a healthier work force, just as better education means a more capable work force; and both will contribute to greater productivity and renewed American competitiveness.
Apologists for the recent budget deal claim that it should cause increased private investment because of a reduction in interest rates expected to follow reduced Federal borrowing. But there's been little evidence since the budget deal that the Federal Reserve can or will reduce rates sufficiently to produce the promised effect; and there's no proof, anyway, that lower rates, if realized, will cause business to invest in a sluggish economy.
What will cause increased private investment, as numerous economic studies show, is strong and growing demand. That can only come from high employment, good wages, a productive people.

HEADLINE: New 'S' and Old 'U' in U.S.S.R.

 BODY:
If Mikhail Gorbachev has his way, the post-Socialist Soviet Union will remain the U.S.S.R. By making it the Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics, he hopes to keep it from degenerating into disunion. Depending on what he means by the word sovereign, it's an outcome Americans can welcome. As the Bush Administration recognizes, the U.S. is better off helping a pluralist Soviet Union than encouraging many separate Soviet states.
Mr. Gorbachev's strategy for preventing a breakup makes sense: to negotiate a new treaty of union that devolves some powers from Moscow to the republics. A vote on his draft was blocked in the Russian parliament yesterday, pending fuller debate. But a treaty along these lines could reduce centrifugal forces in the republics. That would allay concern in Washington and elsewhere that the Soviet Union is about to come apart. 
 Full sovereignty is the rallying cry of independence movements throughout the Soviet Union. Understandably, it is the devout goal of the three Baltic republics, which never chose to be associated with Moscow. But elsewhere, leaders say what they really want is a bigger share of the power Mr. Gorbachev wants to keep. He says he's prepared to take power from the ministries in Moscow and hand it over to them.
Soviet republics already enjoy far more of the trappings of sovereignty than do America's states. Many have foreign ministers of their own, and Byelorussia and the Ukraine even have their own seats in the U.N. Despite these appearances, the Soviet Union is a unitary state, much more centralized than, say, the U.S.
Under Mr. Gorbachev's predecessors, the Politburo decided everything from the price of bread to who was party secretary in Sverdlovsk. Under these circumstances, devolution of power makes sense. But there have to be limits. If all the republics represented in the new Federation Council must approve changes in economic policy, tiny Turkmenistan could veto what mighty Russia wants.
And empowerment of the republics will raise fears among minorities who look to Moscow to protect them against domineering neighbors, like the Gagauz in Moldavia and the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh.
For Mr. Gorbachev to devolve control is to leave many decisions to the market. But transforming a command economy to a market economy leaves officials with lots of tough decisions to make -- and no stars to steer by.
Boris Yeltsin and other radicals appeal to nationalist sentiment by seeking greater authority from Moscow. They may be pushing themselves into a dilemma. If they accept the powers that Mr. Gorbachev may be prepared to concede, they'll saddle themselves with new, potentially unpopular responsibilities. To refuse his offer would undercut their own demands for greater sovereignty.
In time, a better balance of authority can be struck; what's missing so far is a structure that devolves actual decision-making. The Soviet Union can endure and prosper only if it pushes many decisions to the market and delegates others down to the republics, localities and the people. The strength of Mr. Gorbachev's union depends on how sincerely he means to share sovereignty.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Thatcher's Lengthened Shadow

 BODY:
Margaret Thatcher may be finished. But the selection of John Major to succeed her as Prime Minister suggests that Thatcherism is not. Mr. Major was her chosen heir. Of humble origins, he epitomizes her spirit of enterprise and individualism. And he was judged the most reliable custodian of her social and economic policies.
Mr. Major won by a surprisingly large margin over two opponents, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine, whose challenge to Mrs. Thatcher last week impelled her to resign. Mr. Heseltine, who had been favored, suffered from the perception that he was impatient to rework parts of the Thatcher legacy. In particular he favors some state intervention to help British industry, anathema to both Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Major. 
 Mr. Major is not, however, a Thatcher clone. He has neither her ideological rigidity nor her abrasive manner. And he is certainly shrewd enough to know that Mrs. Thatcher's sudden fall -- and his own meteoric rise -- owes much to her habit of confusing disagreement with disloyalty. He became Foreign Secretary when Mrs. Thatcher fired Sir Geoffrey Howe because he challenged her on Europe. And he became Chancellor of the Exchequer when Mrs. Thatcher brutally undercut Nigel Lawson on the same issue.
Furthermore, on the two issues that brought Mrs. Thatcher down -- her resistance to Britain's integration into the European Community and her regressive poll tax -- Mr. Major has indicated a willingness to listen to competing views.
But for the most part, Americans can expect little change in Britain's policies. Mr. Major's belief in free markets matches Mrs. Thatcher's. He is equally warm in his admiration for the U.S. Indeed, he strongly supported the Cabinet's decision Sunday to add 14,000 more British troops to the forces deployed against Saddam Hussein.
Britain's longest-lasting Prime Minister in this century has now been replaced by its youngest. Mr. Major's path won't be easy. Britain suffers from both recession and rising prices. And he must heal his divided party in time for the general election scheduled for mid-1992. But his chances of doing so are surely greater than Mrs. Thatcher's would have been.

HEADLINE: We Can't Afford More Delay on Hudson River Waterfront Park

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The defeat of New York State's environmental bond (news story, Nov. 8) eliminated the source the state planned for its contribution to the Hudson River waterfront park. Parkland in lower and midtown Manhattan amounts to about 4 percent of the city's park space per resident, a token share.
To delay construction of the waterfront park will simply add more dollars to the hundreds of millions already lost to inflation because the state had no plan or highway alternative for the Westway trade-in.
The state and city must apply for the maximum waiver as a scenic easement. This would eliminate the need for Albany and City Hall to take $40 million each from their budgets to repurchase the Westway property. Other fund sources to explore:
* Federal highway funding is available for scenic enchancement of the waivered areas, which could help pay for necessary landscaping.
* A continuous bikeway and walkway need not be an appendage to the highway to qualify for highway funds. Where feasible, they could be separated from the noise and pollution of the highway and incorporated in the scenic landscaping.
* Millions of dollars that the state has been realizing from leases in the Westway corridor should be used for repairs along the waterfront.
* Additional funds are available to restructure piers as staging areas for highway construction
These financing options should be considered in planning the park, and work should be started now to rehabilitate the piers. In this way, losses due to inflation can be held at a minimum, and we can at last make the Hudson River waterfront park a reality.

HEADLINE: Earning Success

 BODY:
To The Living Section:
Having experienced late in life the trauma of losing what had been a comfortable, if not luxurious, life style, I can have some sympathy for those yuppies who are learning that life is earnest, life is real ["Young, Successful but Between Jobs," Nov. 7].
The difference between my generation and theirs is that most of mine earned the success they achieved. Many started with jobs paying $85 a month or $10 a week with lunch. We had to do without many of the things we wanted so we could have the things we needed.
We made a lot of sacrifices so those that followed us could have choices we never had. I suppose it does require that both husband and wife work if they are to maintain a standard of living that includes BMW's and Porsches, $90 jeans, $135 sneakers, $1,000 camcorders, skiing in Aspen and surfing in Hawaii before the age of 40.
Too much too soon has often been the downfall of many people in every generation, but never before did so many have so much to lose. The "Thirtysomething" crowd will just have to learn the economic facts of life the hard way.

HEADLINE: Soviet Union on Its Way to a Market Economy;
Help Is Needed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"After the Cold War: Frozen Chaos?" (editorial, Nov. 13) is long overdue and more timely every day.
Aid to the Soviet Union is something we must consider in the event that the Soviet distribution system breaks down this winter and that hunger or even famine grips certain areas of the country. This contingency planning is needed even if most reports from observers indicate that the trouble rests with a breakdown in distribution, rather than with basic food shortages.
A deep and dangerous crisis looms just over the horizon in the largest country on earth, and the cause of it cannot delay our humanitarian, as well as our self-interested response. We Americans have a stake in preventing extreme suffering and the resulting social chaos in the Soviet Union.
But, in the long run, providing emergency assistance will not help rectify the deficiencies of the Soviet system -- deficiencies that are also problems in Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. The solution lies in establishing effective distribution systems in these countries, introducing modern techniques of marketing and, most important, helping them structure a legal framework that encourages development of a free market and a regulatory framework to prevent hoarding, gouging and black market activities -- the rule of law.
I am proud to be devoting a good deal of effort to the work of the Institute of East-West Business Dynamics at New York University. The institute represents a coordinated attempt by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the American private and public sectors to develop a crash program to train experts in marketing and distribution, as well as to provide training for newly elected parliamentarians.
Ours is a United Nations-generated approach to stabilize the economic and legal systems of formerly centrally planned economies. It is nonideological and has strong bipartisan American support.
In addition to planning for emergencies, we must also help the new democracies in Europe to develop the wherewithal themselves to make a successful transition to market economies.

'Why I Voted "No" '

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Why I voted "no" for the environmental bond: During the Depression in the 1930's, New York City had a great idea. It put a 2 percent sales tax on luxury items to help the unemployed. The tax was to be removed after the Depression. Instead of its being removed, New York State also put a sales tax on those items.
During the same Depression another great idea was born, Social Security, to provide security for our aged by putting a small tax on income. Now the Social Security tax is no longer small, and the money collected is used to balance the budget -- never the original intention!
Somewhere down the line gasoline was taxed to maintain roads and bridges. Why weren't the road and bridges maintained?
A 25-cent toll was placed on bridges and tunnels to cross the Hudson and East Rivers, to be removed when the bonds were paid up. The bonds were never paid up. The bridge tolls have been increased to $2.50 to cross from one borough to another. The money is used for purposes other than maintaining the bridges and tunnels.
I voted "no" on the environmental bond because I believe the money will not be used to clean up the environment and the bonds will not be repaid.
To restore credibility, taxes on consumers must be reduced; money must be spent as intended and bonds paid up to reduce government expenditure.

HEADLINE: Kohl's Campaign Foe: Standard-Bearer Who Leaves Party and People Cold

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The campaign posters show Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democratic standard-bearer in the German election, with a gentle smile and a white shirt. The slogan is "The New Way."
But the man who rises to the throaty cheers is the vintage Lafontaine, with a dark-purple shirt and a razor-sharp repertoire of irony, indignation, polemics and sparkling intelligence. 
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl has insisted that unification will not raise taxes, Mr. Lafontaine declared, starting a favorite assault. "How can anyone lie so miserably?" he said, stripping off his jacket as if to underscore his identification with the indignant burgher.
"It's just like in America," he continued. "There, the President said before the election, 'no taxes, read my lips.' " Mr. Lafontaine delivered that line in English, and then dropped his voice for the clincher. "Of course, Kohl would never say that." Mr. Kohl speaks no foreign language, and the student-dominated crowd responds with glee.
 
Returns More Combative
 After about an hour, Mr. Lafontaine exited to rowdy cheers from a standing audience. But outside, a longtime Social Democrat shook his head, sighed and said, "Very entertaining, but no chancellor."
That, in brief, is the consensus of most Germans as they near their first election as a free and united nation in 58 years. Public opinion polls are unanimous that Mr. Kohl, the "unification chancellor," and his center-right coalition will win big.
In April, when a deranged woman stabbed Mr. Lafontaine in the neck with a kitchen knife and nearly killed him, some of those who watch politics here speculated that he would return subdued and cautious.
He did return with a brutal scar, 12 permanent bodyguards and, he admitted in a recent interview, a fear at the start of every public appearance. He no longer mixes with the public or signs autographs after an appearance.
But he returned if anything more combative, challenging Mr. Kohl on everything from monetary union to the date of political union. Der Spiegel magazine wrote that he has become even less compromising with his party.
 
Looked 'Death in the Eye'
 "He touches with his hand the scars at his neck and says, they just have to take me the way I am," the magazine quoted him as saying.
Introducing Mr. Lafontaine in Bonn, Horst Ehmke, a longtime Social Democrat and a local candidate, referred obliquely to the assassination attempt.
"He's not an old man, but he has had to look death in the eye," he declares to applause.
Yet for all his brilliance on stage, wrote Hans Ulrich Kempski of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Mr. Lafontaine "does not mobilize feelings, because the fire that speaks out of him shines brightly, but does not warm."
 
Criticism From Schmidt
 Privately, the Social Democrats agree. But when Helmut Schmidt, the former Chancellor, said publicly to a Dutch interviewer that Mr. Lafontaine would not win and did not deserve to, the party exploded in anger, insisting that the comments were not authorized and barring the Dutch newspaper, Algemeen Dagblad, from Mr. Lafontaine's campaign train.
The problem for the party was probably less what Mr. Schmidt said about Mr. Lafontaine than the public confirmation he offered that the grandees of the Social Democratic Party are unhappy with their standard-bearer and are clearly keeping their distance.
In any case, what Mr. Schmidt said in public was considerably gentler than what he has been saying in private about Mr. Lafontaine since the early 1980's, when the maverick from the Saarland was a leader of the campaign against new NATO missiles and Mr. Schmidt was the Chancellor who agreed to accept them.
In a celebrated comment, Mr. Lafontaine said Mr. Schmidt's sense of duty and steadfastness were "secondary virtues" also suitable for "running a concentration camp."
 
Miscalculation on Unity
 It was that sort of cheek that brought Mr. Lafontaine to the prominence he now has, and that seems poised to undo him. He was chosen as standard-bearer in December, when the Social Democrats believed that unity was far off and that the times demanded a fresh generation.
Intelligent, 47 years old, quick, fast-moving, twice married and now living with a career woman, Mr. Lafontaine was supposed to offer a contrast to the staid, old-fashioned Mr. Kohl at a time of dynamic movement.
But German unity undermined all the plans. The Social Democrats were slow to recognize the imminence of unification, and Mr. Lafontaine miscalculated the inherent patriotism of the moment by publicly speaking out against East German refugees and then trying to block economic union, almost causing a split within his own party.
On the night of German Unity, Oct. 2, as the German flag rose over the Reichstag and the leaders assembled there began singing the national anthem, Mr. Lafontaine stood in stony silence.
 
Little Grist for Campaign
 All the while, Mr. Kohl unerringly moved with the public will, setting a schedule for unity that no one had believed was possible, ushering it through domestic and international resistance and emerging as the German unifier.
At the same time, the collapse of Communism led to a broad crisis throughout the political left, leaving the Social Democrats trying to conceal the fact that they still call each other comrade and used to proudly hold what they called dialogues with the fallen governments of Eastern Europe.
All that has left Mr. Lafontaine with pitifully little to campaign on. He had hoped in the summer that the economic hardships of unity would set in earlier, but that has yet to show political effect. He had hoped to trip up Mr. Kohl on taxes, but then Mr. Kohl admitted that taxes would rise -- though he insisted that unity was not the reason. And after opposing unity, Mr. Lafontaine has been compelled to skirt the theme of fatherland.
His basic diet is a potpourri of Social Democratic standbys -- restructuring the economy, penalizing polluters, abortion, child care, and banning nuclear power. But at a time when the challenge of unifying Germany and salvaging Eastern Europe stands so high, such issues do not have the same immediacy.
 
Kohl's Patriotic Message
 The current issue of Der Spiegel had Mr. Lafontaine's image on its cover as a red-nosed acrobat balancing atop the Brandenburg Gate over the words, "The Lonesome Candidate."
The latest polls by the Allensbach Insitute show the Christian Democrats favored by 42.9 percent of the voters and their coalition partners, the Free Democrats, by 10.8 percent, for a majority in the new parliament of 600 members. The Social Democrats, by contrast, stand at 33.4 percent.
Mr. Kohl also ranks far above Mr. Lafontaine in personal popularity -- 2.1 to 1.1 on a scale of negative 5 to 5.
The relative certainty of Mr. Kohl's victory, and a nation somewhat fatigued by a year of innumerable "historic moments" and emotional highs, has moderated the campaign and the interest in it.
 
Tumultuous Politics Expected
 For the first time since he came to office in 1982, Mr. Kohl has enjoyed the luxury of campaigning as national leader and statesman. He radiates confidence at his rallies -- he is the man who brought unity, and his message is unabashedly patriotic and triumphant.
He is almost haughty in his references to the opposition Social Democrats -- he refers dismissively to Mr. Lafontaine as "that man from Saarbrucken," and he makes a point of referring to the opposition only as the socialists to taint them with the discredited ideology of the east.
For many Social Democrats, the issue now is less what will happen Sunday than whether they have a chance at the next general election in four years.
A decade ago, one of the party's leaders, the late Herbert Wehner, predicted that if the Social Democrats went into opposition they would stay there for 20 years. The strength of Mr. Kohl and the disarray on the left has left many Social Democrats fearful that that prophesy might come true.
But the huge travails that lie ahead for the Germans and for Europe are certain to be reflected in tumultuous politics. Some Social Democrats have argued that the next four years are best weathered in opposition, and that with time the Protestant Prussians and Saxons of eastern Germany will return to their traditional place on the political left.
Recent polls show that the gap between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats is already beginning to narrow. In only week, Mr. Kohl's party dropped 1.7 points, while the Social Democrats nudged up 1.4 points.
The more immediate question is whether the Social Democrats will stick with Mr. Lafontaine. He has said he will return to the Saarland state, of which he is premier. But some of his followers, including Gerhard Schroder, premier of Lower Saxony, have declared him "the symbol of the Social Democrats for the 90's."

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Bulgarian Communist Stalwart Says He'd Do It All Differently

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's deposed Communist dictator, long regarded as the East bloc leader most subservient to Moscow, looked back on his long political career during an interview here on Monday and said it was all a big mistake.
"If I had to do it over again, I would not even be a Communist, and if Lenin were alive today he would say the same thing," said Mr. Zhivkov as he sat in his granddaughter's luxurious villa on a hillside above Sofia, where he remains under house arrest. 
 Mr. Zhivkov, 79 years old, ruled Bulgaria for 35 years before being forced to resign just over a year ago. He said he began to doubt the Communist system in the mid-1950's and realized after the rise of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Soviet Union that Communism's underpinnings were faulty.
"I have been a soldier, I have been a Communist, it is my deep belief and conviction that I served my people and my country," Mr. Zhivkov said. "But I must now admit that we started from the wrong basis, from the wrong premise. The foundation of socialism was wrong."
 
Prefers Pure Marxism
 "I believe that at its very conception, the idea of socialism was stillborn," Mr. Zhivkov said. "We should have gone back to the original Marxist sources and had socialism develop within a highly developed capitalist world."
Mr. Zhivkov laughed at a statement by his one-time East German counterpart, Erich Honecker, that Communism would rise again. "This is utter nonsense," he said grinning.
"Now perhaps we have to cling to the United States," Mr. Zhivkov said. "If I were ruling today, I would go and decisively strike a deal with the United States. I say this not just for pragmatic reasons but out of a deep conviction. In fact, Bulgaria should do this as soon as possible."
But pragmatism was apparent, both in what Mr. Zhivkov said and in his decision to grant an interview. Bulgaria is broke, its former Soviet patron is preoccupied with its own difficulties, and Mr. Zhivkov is facing corruption and embezzlement charges.
 
The 'Vandals' in Power
 Openly bitter and afraid of imprisonment, he appealed to his old foes, the Western democracies, for support against the "vandals" in Bulgaria's present Government, who he says are trying to make him the scapegoat for all the nation's ills. The governing party in Bulgaria now calls itself the Socialist Party, and is a reformed version of the old Communists. The head of state is an anti-Communist.
"I am not legally responsible," Mr. Zhivkov said of his time in power. "I made political errors, but I have not committed a crime against my people or the world."
"I appeal to the West to check to see whether Todor Zhivkov or his family have even a single dollar abroad," he said. "I am facing corruption charges, but in fact I have only my clothes and the money I had in my pockets when I was arrested."
He said he survives on a small monthly pension.
Despite his reputation here as an old-style, hard-line Communist leader in the mold of Leonid I. Brezhnev who thwarted reform, Mr. Zhivkov said that in the 1980's he surrounded himself with pro-Western advisers and was energetically trying to turn the country toward the West.
 
Quotes Gorbachev
 As evidence, he showed what he said was a transcript of a 1987 meeting he had with Mr. Gorbachev. In the transcript, Mr. Gorbachev upbraids Mr. Zhivkov for picking advisers who "think of making Bulgaria a mini-West Germany or mini-Japan."
"Such orientations concern us," the Soviet leader reportedly said. "You should distance yourself from these people because all answers and solutions to the tasks we are facing should be sought in socialism and in its dynamic development, not elsewhere."
Mr. Zhivkov said Bulgaria had no choice but to cast its fate with the Soviet Union and its system after World War II, and that this is the prime reason for the country's present woes.
"We were surrendered to Stalin's camp," he said. "Bulgaria would certainly be far ahead of where it is now if it had been Western-oriented."
 
'Just Rhetoric'
 Such comments contrasted sharply with virtually all the public pronouncements he made while in power. He was reminded of a typical passage made 20 years ago in which he said that the Soviet Union and Bulgaria "act as a single body, breathing with the same lungs, and nourished by the same bloodstream."
"That was just an image, just rhetoric," Mr. Zhivkov said, waving his hand. "Those were different times."
Mr. Zhivkov said he knew of the existence of labor camps and of political killings that were carried out in Bulgaria and elsewhere in Eastern Europe even before 1956, when Nikita S. Khrushchev denounced some of the crimes of the Stalinist period. The former Bulgarian leader said, however, that he and his associates could do nothing to stop the terror.
"We were aware that we were not in a position to get out of the orbit we were circling in," Mr. Zhivkov said. "It was impossible for us to break apart from the system, and the reason for that was not the personality of Todor Zhivkov."
"Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin divided the world into two zones," he argued. "Bulgaria fell into the Soviet political division headed by Stalin and the Soviet Union. Even in 1956, it was impossible to make a historic leap. That would have resulted in events like those in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968."
 
Denounces '68 Attack
 Labeling the Warsaw pact invasion of Czechoslovakia an outright case of foreign occupation by the Soviet Union, Mr. Zhivkov said that he and Bulgaria had no choice but to go along because the Kremlin had Bulgaria's economy in a stranglehold.
"From today's point of view, I've no doubt that it was an occupation and that nothing can justify it," the former Communist Party leader said. "But at that time we were allies and we had to participate. I could do nothing by myself. I was not exactly ordered to participate, but I could not refuse. It had nothing to do with personal courage. The fate of our country was at stake. The Soviet Union could have cut us off economically, and we would not have survived for more than a month."
Mr. Zhivkov rejected allegations that he and Bulgaria were in any way involved in the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square in May 1981. Mehmet Ali Agca, who was arrested for the attack, had told his interrogators of his links to Bulgaria's secret police.
"Can you imagine a government doing such a thing?" he said. "Can you imagine me going to Brezhnev and asking him to do this? These are all imaginary things -- just like all those stories about the Pope."
 
Denies Any Bulgarian Connection
 "Ask your intelligence services," he said, charging that Western intelligence organizations had spread false information about a Bulgarian connection with the shooting of the Pope. "They know more about this than I do."
Mr. Zhivkov said that soon after taking power he resigned himself to improving Bulgaria's economic lot, and he expressed pride in the country's progress under his leadership, lamenting its current problems.
"The nation is on the verge of self-destruction, national suicide," Mr. Zhivkov said. "It doesn't matter anymore whether the system is called socialism or capitalism."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Chinese Official Leaves in Doubt How He Will Vote on Iraq at U.N.

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 28

 BODY:
China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, suggested today that he would not vote in favor of a United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq.
His comments were ambiguous. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China could veto the resolution, although most diplomats believe this is unlikely. An abstention by China would diminish the international support that President Bush would like to have before moving to drive Iraqi troops from Kuwait. 
 It is possible that Mr. Qian's comments were intended to increase his bargaining power in negotiations with the Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, before the vote. In exchange for supporting the resolution, China would like the United States to drop sanctions and its criticism of Chinese human rights violations.
Mr. Qian tried today to dispel any notion that China had promised the United States that it would vote for a resolution endorsing the use of force if Iraqi troops do not leave Kuwait by Jan. 15. He said, "Such reports are groundless."
 
'You Will Know After I Vote'
 In a brief meeting today with reporters at the airport before flying to New York for the Security Council session, Mr. Qian refused to specify whether China would veto the United Nations resolution or abstain. Asked whether he meant that China would not vote for the resolution, he replied, "I think so."
 When pressed on whether China would veto the resolution, he replied, "I didn't say so." Asked if China would abstain, Mr. Qian said, "You will know after I vote."
The United States will have one final chance to lobby Mr. Qian before the vote, as Secretary of State Baker is expected to meet Mr. Qian after his arrival in New York and before the Security Council session, expected on Thursday.
On Tuesday, Bush Administration officials said that Mr. Qian would make an official visit to Washington at the invitation of Mr. Baker. The official visit would symbolize an end to the 18-month-long chill in official relations since the military crackdown in Beijing in June 1989. But an Administration spokesman said Mr. Qian's visit would not constitute an "exchange" and would therefore not contravene the Administration's ban on exchanges with senior Chinese officials.
 
Regained Some Legitimacy
 Mr. Qian, however, said he saw no difference between contacts and exchanges, and said that his visit would be a "fairly important" event in American-Chinese relations.
A deputy trade minister, Gu Yongjiang, is also scheduled to visit the United States, on Dec. 10-14, at the invitation of J. Michael Farren, Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade.
China has gradually regained some of its legitimacy in the world after many Western countries scaled down ties in response to the crackdown. But China would welcome a return to normal relations with the United States because it would help restore lending and commercial ties as China's economy is in its worst slump in more than a dozen years.
The World Bank has resumed lending to China, but not at the levels that preceded the crackdown. Although Iraq is an ally, China has viewed the Gulf crisis with a bit of relief because attention has been diverted away from China's human rights issues.
 
Editors Charged With Sedition
 Because of its position on the Security Council, China has been able to assume a significant role in United Nations actions toward Baghdad, and Mr. Qian recently concluded a few weeks of hectic diplomatic activity, visiting several Middle East capitals.
While China's recent role may help boost its profile in the world, there are signs that China is continuing a tough line against dissidents jailed after the crackdown in June last year. Two men, Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, were charged last week with counter-revolutionary sedition and trying to overthrow the Government.
Relatives of the two men, who are well known for their peaceful efforts to promote democracy and economic change in China, were notified of the charges. But they were not told when the trial would be held. Hundreds or thousands of other people are still in Chinese prisons or labor camps for their role in the democracy movement.
So far, China has voted in favor of the United Nations resolutions against Iraq. Initially it emphasized its opposition to the use of force, but in recent weeks there has been a change of emphasis, so that officials now say that so long as there is a glimmer of hope, peace should be pursued. Mr. Qian echoed this position again today.
Diplomats have said that China could be positioning itself so that it could eventually announce that there is no longer even a glimmer of hope for a peaceful resolution and that thus it is obliged to endorse a use of force against Baghdad.

Saudi King, Hardening His Stand, Dismisses Any Dealing With Iraq

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 28

 BODY:
On the eve of a United Nations vote on military action against Iraq, the King of Saudi Arabia appears to be taking his toughest stand yet against the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, warning that if he does not withdraw from Kuwait, it will "be a tragedy for Iraq."
Both senior Saudi officials and Western diplomats here expanded on the King's statement by warning that war was near. In what appeared to be a hardened stand, they declared that if fighting began, a major objective would be not only the freeing of Kuwait but also the destruction of Iraq's chemical, nuclear and biological weapons capacity. 
 King Fahd made his most extensive and outspoken public statement on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in a Monday night meeting with Saudi newspaper editors that was reproduced in the local press today. Diplomats here say many of his comments reflect statements that he has previously made in private, and the significance is that he has now made them in public.
Diplomats and Saudi officials said the King's statement was a clear message to the Saudi people to prepare for war and a final warning to Iraq that with the expected favorable United Nations vote, war was imminent.
 
Only One Solution
 Appearing to lay to rest any possible doubt about Saudi Arabia's commitment to support an attack on Iraq, King Fahd declared that "no other solution will be accepted" except total and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
The Saudi ruler dismissed Iraqi appeals for negotiations to determine the conditions for possible future withdrawal from Kuwait.
"Negotiations on what?" he asked. "To compensate the aggressor? I don't think anybody will even consider it."
Other Saudi officials followed up on King Fahd's statements in interviews, saying that even if Iraq withdrew, Saudi Arabia would seek United Nations sanctions to force Iraq to pay compensation for the destruction of Kuwait and to strip Iraq of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
"The only way to make this area stable is to get rid of his missiles, chemical weapons and nuclear capability -- and reduce the armed forces," said an influential Saudi official referring to President Hussein. "Iraq cannot be a military state."
 
Virtually Certain Targets
 A Western diplomat who asked not to be identified further, said the United States would almost certainly destroy Iraqi chemical, biological and nuclear weapons installations if war began. The diplomat said it would be foolish "to put the most frightful weapons of the enemy off bounds" during an attack on Iraqi forces.
"No one in this region wants to live next to somebody who's putting the kind of money and effort this guy is in these weapons," the Western diplomat said.
The statements by the King and the other Saudi officials appear to dispel questions raised last month when the Saudi Defense Minister, Prince Sultan al-Faisal, made comments that were interpreted as perhaps softening the Saudi stand against Iraq.
In a society attuned to nuance and highly attentive to statements made by its ruler, King Fahd's unusually harsh and frank public statements denouncing Iraq appear likely to have a significant impact on the debate that continues in private here about the wisdom of going to war.
 
Some Doubt Is Expressed
 In the privacy of their offices and homes, some prominent Saudis continue to express concern about the political, social and economic cost of war with Iraq and a large American military presence here.
As if in answer to such doubters, the normally soft-spoken King threw down the gauntlet, accusing Mr. Hussein of personal betrayal and detailing his fears that Iraq would have invaded Saudi Arabia if the United States and other countries had not intervened.
The King said he had asked Iraqi and Kuwaiti officials to meet to discuss their differences, but that "a few hours later I was astonished to learn that the Iraqi forces had invaded Kuwait.
"Then I realized that after Kuwait, it would be the turn of the eastern part of the kingdom," King Fahd said at his meeting with editors, referring to Saudi Arabia's border region next to Kuwait.
"We never thought of an Arab state invading another Arab state," he said in apparent bewilderment and anger. He added that the day after the invasion, Mr. Hussein "called me and sent his deputy to tell me that he had annexed Kuwait."
 
'A Blessing From God'
 Realizing the Saudi Army was no match for the Iraqis, King Fahd said he asked for outside support. He told the newspaper editors that the military backing he received from "major countries" was "a blessing from God."
"I believe that all Saudi citizens consider what we did was a wise and logical action," he said. "Most of the big powers in the world responded to our call in no time."
His statement appeared to be an explicit signal to religious fundamentalists and other critics of the arrival of American and other non-Muslim troops here that the monarchy firmly backed the foreign military presence and was not interested in hearing more criticism on this or any other sensitive issue at a time of national crisis.
"He is saying, 'cool it guys, there are bigger things at stake here,' " said a Western diplomat who termed the King's speech a major statement of Saudi policy.
In interviews over the last two days, a number of Saudi officials echoed the King's hard line, expressing concern that Mr. Hussein might in the end withdraw from Kuwait and preserve both his army and his weapons of mass destruction.
 
U.S. Resolve Questioned
 They emphasize that Saudi Arabia no longer feels it can live with such an army and arsenal on its doorstep.
But several officials said they feared the United States would in the end not have the will to fight what might prove to be a difficult, politically unpopular war.
Their comments appear to reflect a worry that, having taken a hard stand against Iraq, Saudi Arabia is now extremely vulnerable and needs American backing more than ever.
"We're paranoid about it," an influential Saudi official said. "We're afraid you'll pull out."

HEADLINE: New York Offers Plan to Reduce Haulers' Rates

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
In a move that could cut the cost of doing business in New York, the city proposed yesterday that the rate that private garbage haulers charge commercial customers be reduced.
The city's Consumer Affairs Department said that cutting the top rate for picking up garbage -- now the highest in the nation -- by 7.5 percent would save the city's 250,000 businesses millions of dollars. They now pay private haulers more than a $1 billion a year. 
 The city has regulated the haulers since 1957 but has never lowered their rates. Yesterday, the haulers said that they would fight the proposal.
Private garbage pickup is a big cost of doing business in the city, particularly for smaller concerns, and such costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. Although the proposed 7.5 percent decrease may not result in less expensive consumer services, it could lead businesses to delay price increases and give them more breathing room in a weakening economy.
 
Thousands in Savings
 The Consumer Affairs Department estimated that Macy's at Herald Square, for example, could shave more than $35,000 a year from its annual garbage collection bill of more than $500,000. Con Ed spends $2.1 million, and could save more than $140,000, the department said.
A deli or grocery now spends about $15,000 a year, according to the Korean-American Small Business Service Center, and these costs could decline by $1,000 a store.
The Consumer Affairs Commissioner, Mark Green, said yesterday that the rate-cutting proposal is based on an analysis of financial information supplied by haulers showing that their costs had fallen in recent years. The proposal would decrease the maximum rate to $13.60 a cubic yard of garbage, from $14.70.
"We cannot accept an excessive rate that taxes businesses and consumers," Mr. Green said yesterday at a news conference.
Representatives of several business organizations welcomed the proposal, but the private hauling industry vowed to fight it.
 
A Hearing, Then a New Rate
 "We cannot operate at that rate," said Salvatore Spinelli, a lawyer for the Council of Trade Waste Associations, a group representing many private haulers. He said the department had improperly calculated haulers' costs.
Mr. Green said he expected the rate to take effect within 60 to 90 days. The rate can be formally adopted after a public hearing is held, and one is scheduled for Jan. 9. It would then go into effect 30 days later. Mr. Spinelli said the haulers plan a court challenge if the reduced rate is adopted.
The announcement came at a difficult time for the private garbage-hauling companies. They are facing the possibility of a strike next week by members of Local 813 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 2,100 private sanitation workers in the city. The two sides met yesterday, and a strike vote has been scheduled for Sunday.
Private haulers pick up about 40 percent of the city's garbage, or some 10,000 tons a day. The Sanitation Department collects the rest from residences and institutions.
Mr. Green characterized the city's private hauling businesses as a cartel that limits entrance of new companies into the field and keeps prices artificially high. Law-enforcement officials go further. They say the industry is controlled by organized crime, but representatives of the industry vehemently deny that.
Mr. Green said a lower rate was justified because haulers' cost of dumping garbage at landfills had declined and because of technological improvements that enable trucks to compress garbage more effectively, making each load more profitable. Mr. Spinelli, of the trade waste association, said the city had overstated both changes.
Private haulers last received an increase in the fall of 1988, when the rate rose to $14.70 a cubic yard from $10.66. They were given that raise because the city greatly increased the cost of dumping at its Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island.
Instead of paying the higher dumping charge, private haulers began shipping garbage by truck to less expensive out-of-state landfills. Last year, the city tried to readjust the rate, Mr. Green said, but the haulers refused to supply the necessary financial information. The department has since received most of the information it needed to determine a new rate.
"The carters have a right to a fair rate," said Marilyn Dahl, director of government affairs for the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, representing about 1,500 businesses. But she added that "anything that reduces the cost of doing business in New York City is something to be welcomed."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up After Comments By Greenspan About Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday on comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that suggested United States interest rates would remain at their current levels.
Gold prices were narrowly mixed. 
 The dollar advanced after Mr. Greenspan voiced concerns to the House Banking Committee about the dollar's recent weakness.
But Mr. Greenspan also spoke to one of the market's big concerns when he suggested that no further cuts in interest rate were likely soon.
The dollar, like all currencies, is supported by higher interest rates. When yields are up in this country, American investments become more attractive to foreigners, who then buy dollars to purchase the securities.
The dollar has fallen recently amid prospects that United States rates would come down because of the weakening economy. The dollar has also dropped as overseas rates moved higher and made foreign currencies more valuable.
The pound, meanwhile, fell yesterday as traders feared that British interest rates would soon decline under the new Government of John Major. Sterling advanced on Tuesday after Mr. Major's selection as head of the Conservative Party and the next Prime Minister, but concerns about interest rates and some profit taking turned the pound around yesterday.
Sterling dropped to $1.9695 in New York, from $1.9775 late on Tuesday. In London earlier, the pound fell to $1.9723, from $1.9750 late on Tuesday.
The dollar jumped to 130.10 Japanese yen in New York from late Tuesday's 128.35. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell to 128.90 yen, from 128.95 yen on Tuesday, and in London, it rose to 129.02 yen.
Richard Levine, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said concerns had been voiced in the market about the Japanese economy, which he said could experience the same kind of debt problems as the United States.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Tuesday, included: 1.4860 German marks, up from 1.48025; 1.2700 Swiss francs, up from 1.12595; 5.0140 French francs, up from 4.9950; 1,118.10 Italian lire, up from 1,111.25, and 1.16445 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16405.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold finished unchanged, closing at $385.20 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $384.70 an ounce, down 30 cents.
In London, gold rose to a late bid price of $385.50 an ounce, up from $384.75 late on Tuesday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $384.50, up from $384.00 bid late on Tuesday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.04 an ounce to close at a bid $387.23.
On the Comex, silver rose 2.4 cents an ounce, closing at $4.124. But the metal fell earlier in London, to a late bid price of $4.10, from $4.12 late on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Orders Rose For Durables Last Month

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
A surge in demand for commercial aircraft helped push durable goods orders up a sharp 3.6 percent in October, the best gain in five months, the Commerce Department said today.
The jump in orders last month was far above Wall Street economists' expectations of a modest rise of five-tenths of 1 percent from September levels. But excluding the transportation component, total orders in October fell four-tenths of 1 percent, after rising one-tenth of 1 percent in September. 
 "There isn't any sign in these numbers of an upturn," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass., "It's perfectly consistent with the economy being in a recession."
But Russ Sheldon, an economist with the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the durables report, even after the heavy sales of aircraft were removed, offered hope that any recession would be short-lived and mild.
"The underlying trend looks too strong to be consistent with all this news of recession that we've had," he said. "It's the brightest ray of hope we've had among all these dismal indicators."
 
Crucial Part of Economy
 Durable goods, which are products intended to last three years or more, are a crucial part of the manufacturing sector of the economy, and orders for these relatively expensive items are closely watched as an indicator of the economy's health.
The overall October increase to $129.4 billion followed a revised 1.6 percent drop in orders during September and was the largest monthly gain since an increase of 4.1 percent in May.
Still, many private economists contend the economy has slipped into recession in the final three months of 1990, and they said they were not overly impressed by the report.
"Aircraft account for the entire increase," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch Government Securities. "We are moving down and not up."
Analysts noted before the report was published that the Boeing Company reported it had received orders for 107 new aircraft last month worth about $10.7 billion.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation who sees a weak economy, said, "The numbers do not change the scenario at all.
 
"Surge in Transportation
 Over all, orders for all types of transportation goods rose 14.8 percent in October, after falling by 6.1 percent in September.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods, an indication of business investment in new equipment, rose 8.3 percent last month, after a gain of 6.7 percent in September.
Military orders fell 10 percent in October, after a 6.1 percent decline in September.
Excluding military items, orders for durable goods rose 4.5 percent in October, after a 1.3 percent drop in September.
The department revised its estimate for September orders to show a 1.6 percent decrease instead of the 1.4 percent drop reported on Oct. 31.
Shipments of durable goods rose by 1.8 percent in October, in contrast to September's 3.3 percent drop. Unfilled orders, an indicator of future activity, were up six-tenths of 1 percent last month, after rising one-tenth of 1 percent in September.
Among specifc sectors, electrical machinery orders rose 1.9 percent in October, after a 6.9 percent decline in September, and orders for nonelectrical machinery fell 1.5 percent, after gaining 5.5 percent in September.
Primary metals orders were up 4.9 percent in October, after declining nine-tenths of 1 percent in September.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
As Folksy Replaces Trendy, Wigwag Magazine Thrives

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
TRENDY, caustic magazines like Spy and Details that chronicle and criticize the lives of powerful, or often merely glamorous, people were the rage in the late 1980's -- but now it is hip to be square.
Media analysts say one of the few successful new magazines this year is Wigwag, a folksy publication that takes a serious look at politics, issues and life in America. 
 Although the overall advertising environment for magazines is dismal, Wigwag picked up 202 pages of advertising for its first full year of publishing, which ended in September. What is more, Wigwag is attracting some ads from the kind of advertisers, like car companies, that usually avoid little magazines.
That is a small achievement compared with the thousands of ad pages that some large magazines publish each year, but analysts say Wigwag's showing is significant for a new publication with a circulation below 100,000.
The magazine's second year is also off to a good start. Samuel Schulman, the magazine's publisher, said that during the fourth quarter of this year the magazine published 90 pages of ads, a 22 percent increase from a year earlier.
"Wigwag is one of the bright spots in the magazine industry," said David Verklin, the media director at Hal Riney & Partners, which is running ads for the new Saturn car in the magazine. "I have been very impressed. It is far more inviting than most of the new magazines I see."
Wigwag, which is published 10 times a year, is attracting advertisers like Grand Marnier and Absolut. Such advertisers used to flock to magazines like 7 Days, which was the darling of New York's hip downtown social set until it closed in April.
"Wigwag is the magazine for this decade, which is more serious," said Claude Fromm, the media director at TBWA, the New York agency that creates advertising for Absolut and Grand Marnier. "We like to be in the magazines that are hot, that reach the consumers who are leading the way."
Jack Decker, the president of Decker, Decker & Freas, a magazine consulting firm, said that "even though it's a tough marketplace, Wigwag is making it because they found the right niche."
What Wigwag offers is a magazine that appeals to young, well-educated readers. Mr. Schulman said 82 percent of Wigwag's 85,000 readers were college graduates. The median age of its readers is 39 years old and the median household income is $53,000, he said.
Loosely modeled after The New Yorker, where some of its founders once worked, the magazine publishes articles about politics, the arts and science, as well as humor and fiction. Wigwag's most distinctive -- and popular -- feature is derived from its name, which means to signal someone home. The "Letters From Home" section features funny and sometimes poignant real-life tales from people living in big and small towns across the country.
More serious magazines are generally gaining in popularity, analysts said. In the last year, publications like The Atlantic and The Economist have seen their circulation and ad pages increase significantly.
"Advertisers aren't interested as much now in reaching the glitzy and greedy crowd," Mr. Fromm said. "They want to target a more limited and influential quality audience."
Wigwag has The New Yorker to thank, in part, for its success. Some analysts said many readers disenchanted with the changes at The New Yorker might have jumped over to Wigwag, enabling the new magazine to increase its circulation quickly without relying on expensive direct-mail subscription campaigns.
The next hurdle for Wigwag is amassing a circulation of several hundred thousand readers so it can attract a wide range of large national advertisers.
"The big question now is, will the magazine find the resources to help it grow substantially?" Mr. Verklin said. "In the long run, the key to survival will be pumping up the circulation."

HEADLINE: To Many Britons, Major Is Unknown

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
If Government leaders around the world are not too sure who John Major, Britain's new Prime Minister, is, they shouldn't feel too bad. A lot of people in Lambeth, the working-class borough in south London where he grew up and began his political career, aren't too sure either.
"I didn't have a clue who he was until last week," when he stepped into the spotlight as a contender to succeed Margaret Thatcher," said Tony Kelly, a 33-year-old construction worker. 
 Throughout Britain, people were still in shock today, trying to adjust to the fact that after 11 1/2 years in power, Mrs. Thatcher was gone. Whether they loved or hated her, virtually everyone in Britain knew where the warrior against socialism stood on things.
 
'Better That He's Younger'
 But despite the many interviews with Mr. Major that have appeared since last Thursday, when he entered the race to succeed her, many Britons confess that they don't know much about the low-key, quiet-spoken man who has served as Chancellor of the Exchequer for 13 months and who has been in the Cabinet for 3 1/2 years.
"I did want him to get it, but I don't know why" said Jackie Jeavons, 16, as she waited for a train at Victoria Station in central London. Could it be that he is 47, while the other contenders were in their 50's and 60's? "It's much better that he's younger," she agreed.
At The Atlantic, a pub in the poor Brixton section of Lambeth that is frequented by blacks, Clint Davis and his friends were struggling to size up their new Prime Minister. "He's a mystery man," said Mr. Davis, a 29-year-old electrician who works for British Aerospace P.L.C. "I hadn't heard of him until he was named Chancellor."
He is hardly the only one. In August 1988, when Market and Opinion Research International Ltd. showed a photo of Mr. Major to 1,891 people, only 2 percent could identify him.
 
Heralded in the Press
 It really has only been in the last week, when newspapers and television programs heralded him not only as a leading candidate to succeed Mrs. Thatcher but also her choice, that the public began to take him seriously as a potential leader, according to opinion polls.
"He wasn't considered a real contender among the general public," said Simon Braunholtz, a senior research executive at Market and Opinion Research. "He doesn't have a strong identity."
To Americans, who probably know a lot more than they want to know about their Presidents by the time they get elected, it might seem strange that such a relative nobody could suddenly be the leader of the British people.
But it was not the people who chose him: it was the 372 Conservative Members of Parliament. And they ignored what most opinion polls taken in the last week indicated: that Michael Heseltine, a former Defense Secretary who has campaigned to succeed Mrs. Thatcher for nearly five years, would have the best chance of enabling the Tories to win a fourth-consecutive general election.
 
A Strange Result
 One could also argue that Mr. Major was not the overwhelming choice of the Tory M.P.'s: he received 185 votes on Tuesday, or 2 less than a majority, and only won after the two other contenders -- Mr. Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, withdrew and threw their support to Mr. Major.
Even to many Britons, who have had centuries to get used to the fact that they have no direct say in choosing their leader, it is strange that a mystery man is suddenly in No. 10 Downing Street.
While Mrs. Thatcher was a relative nobody when she ousted Edward Heath as Tory leader in 1975, she then served as opposition leader in Parliament for more than four years and thus was well-known by the time she became Prime Minister in 1979.
"Major's not the people's choice," Marcus Samuels, a 63-year-old semi-retired local government worker, said as he nursed a drink at The Atlantic in Brixton.
 
Complaints of Britons
 Up the street at the Prince Albert, a pub mainly frequented by whites, Alison Bumstead, a 25-year-old single mother and Labor Party supporter, agreed: "The country should decide who is Prime Minister. It shouldn't be just the Conservative M.P.'s."
After some 30 years of not voting, Colin Harris, a marriage registrar, sees Mr. Major's ascension as only another reason not to start doing so now. "It's not true democracy at work," he said.
One thing he and many Britons resent is the fact that those running to represent a constituency in Parliament don't have to live in it. And in the case of the country's other major party, Labor, local party members can have their choice disregarded by the central party organization.
Another sore point for Britons is that unlike in many other countries with parliamentary systems, the number of seats that a party holds in Britain's House of Commons may have little to do with its share of the vote. In the last general election in 1987, the Conservatives won 57.7 percent of the seats with only 42.2 percent of the vote.
 
How Major Is Judged
 Mr. Major, who left school at 16 to work as clerk and laborer and who was unemployed for a while, says his ambition is to turn Britain into a truly "classless" society. But since he has been vague on detail so far and is widely seen as Mrs. Thatcher's creation, it is hardly surprising that most are judging him on the basis of what they thought of her.
In Brixton, where most vote Labor, that means people are not embracing him as the hometown boy. "He's Margaret Thatcher's lap dog. He won't last very long," said John P. McCaffrey, a retired truck driver.
At Victoria Station, it was easier to find more people willing to give him a chance.
"We expect him to carry on," said Kenneth Northall, stevedore from Seaford, Sussex. A Tory supporter, he said he was "very pleased" with the choice, although "I would have expected him to be Prime Minister five years from now" given that he "hasn't had a lot of prominent positions as such."

HEADLINE: Shifts in Deposit Insurance Weighed

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is exploring a wide array of ways to alter the Federal program that insures bank deposits, including basing the premiums paid by banks to the insurance program upon their financial health, Treasury officials and senior regulators said today.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Bank Insurance Fund, which is at its lowest level since its creation 56 years ago, is under considerable financial strain. Some experts have predicted that the onset of a severe recession could make it insolvent, leading to a taxpayer bailout of the industry. 
 To avert such a situation, Government officials are preparing a report on deposit insurance that is expected to be completed next month. Officials emphasized that no consensus had emerged on many elements of the plan, which would likely encompass several major changes in the present payment system for banks and the insurance coverage for customers.
Nonetheless, certain key provisions are becoming apparent, and more may be made public on Friday, when Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady speaks at a meeting of members of the Securities Industry Association in Boca Raton, Fla.
The Treasury Department has already signaled its decision not to lower the $100,000 limit on Federal insurance coverage of deposits, but officials have said that the department would probably propose limits on the number of accounts that can be insured.
The debate over deposit insurance within the inner circle of the Bush Administration is a small but significant aspect of a much wider plan under consideration. In their report, Treasury officials expect to use the difficulties of the Federal deposit insurance system as a basis for overhauling banking laws that go back to the Depression.
The report is expected to provide a framework for top lawmakers in the House and Senate who have said they will begin hearings early next year aimed at fashioning legislation.
Among the measures expected to be proposed is a substantial revision of the Glass-Steagall Act, which restricts the ability of banks to move into other businesses, notably securities underwriting. While there is strong agreement among most senior Administration officials and regulatory heads that Glass-Steagall should be modified, important differences remain over how extensive and quickly revisions should be made.
 
Adjusting Premiums
 One proposal strongly under consideration, known as risk-based premiums, would give the F.D.I.C. the ability to tie the premiums paid by banks to the level of their capital and income. This year, institutions pay a flat rate of 12 cents on each $100 of deposits, and in 1991 the rate will increase to 19.5 cents.
L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C., said that researchers at the agency had begun working with industry analysts to come up with a formula for risk-based premiums and that the Treasury officials had been receptive to an idea under which banks with lower capital and income would pay higher premiums.
Under another proposal, which was disclosed today in an article in The Wall Street Journal, banks would be required to purchase preferred stock from the F.D.I.C., a move that could generate between $14 billion and $28 billion depending on the size of the purchases. The Treasury is considering a requirement that banks must purchase between 50 cents and $1 worth of the stock for each $100 in deposits. The stock could be included in the banks' capital base.
A Treasury official who insisted on not being identified said that the department had already ruled out bolstering the bank insurance fund by borrowing money or using the interest from the $37 billion in bank reserves the Federal Reserve holds.

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Up By 1.7% in 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The Commerce Department reported today that the economy expanded at a 1.7 percent rate in the third quarter, a tenth of percentage point less than previously estimated. But private analysts said the figure masked the progressive economic contraction that started in the late summer.
The third quarter "started fast but died at the finish line," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the Pittsburgh National Bank. A solid advance in national output in July, he said, appeared to be followed by a flat August and by rapid deterioration since then. 
 The National Association of Business Economists announced on Tuesday that three-quarters of its forecasters believed that a recession had already begun, with 34 percent of these pessimists saying it began during the third quarter.
 
'Meaningful Downturn'
 And in his most negative assessment to date, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, told Congress today that a "meaningful downturn" during October and November, if continued, would result in the first shrinkage in gross national product -- the total output of goods and services -- since 1986.
Two straight quarters of a shrinking G.N.P. constitute a recession, according to a popular definition.
The Commerce Department also reported today that orders for durable goods rose 3.6 percent in October, reversing a 1.6 percent September decline that had initially been estimated at 1.4 percent. Analysts noted, however, that much of the increase was in orders to Boeing Company and other companies for aircraft that will not be built for years. If transportation equipment is excluded, orders for durable goods fell by four-tenths of 1 percent last month. [Page D24.]
John B. Taylor, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, called the durable orders results "fairly positive," but private analysts tended to regard them only as evidence that the economy was not in a free fall.
 
Slowdown in Spending
 Today's reports on the revised G.N.P. and orders for durable goods were consistent with assumptions that the economy was progressively weakening. Spending on personal consumption, for example, rose at a slower pace than previously thought -- a 3.2 percent annual rate instead of 3.6 -- and business inventories fell at a rate of 4.4 percent instead of 1.7 percent.
Many analysts had expected inventories to contribute to an upward revision in G.N.P., but instead this sector helped to pull it down. While the reasons for inventory shifts are never entirely clear -- a decline, for example, could result either from strong sales or from lower orders by pessimistic retailers -- a buildup had been expected to increase third-quarter production figures.
There was, however, a substantial advance in exports, with a revised $7.4 billion increase more than offsetting the combined revised decrease of $5.7 billion in personal consumption and inventories, the report showed.
Today's report also included the first aggregate data on the profits of American corporations, including private ones and farms, for the third quarter.
Profits from current production fell at an annual rate of $11.7 billion, or 3.8 percent, following a 3.3 percent rate of increase in the second quarter. Current-production cash flow -- the internal funds available for corporate investment -- fell $13 billion, or 3.2 percent, nearly twice the spring's quarter's advance.
Over all, corporate profits after taxes rose 6.7 percent in the third quarter, after falling six-tenths of a percentage point in the second quarter. And profits before taxes increased 5.4 percent in the third quarter, after rising eight-tenths of a percentage point in the previous quarter.
 
Pickup in Inflation Rate
 Today's G.N.P. report of a 1.7 percent rate of growth in the summer quarter, up from four-tenths of 1 percent in the spring, also showed that inflation was a bit faster than initially thought. The fixed-weight price index, which assumes that the composition of output remains unchanged, ran at a 4.2 percent pace instead of 4.1 percent, while the so-called deflator was 4 percent instead of 3.4 percent.
G.N.P. expressed in current dollars, instead of constant 1982 dollars, rose at a 5.8 percent pace in the summer instead of the 5.3 percent estimated last month. But the increase reflected inflation, not output.
Data included in the revision of the gross national product for the third quarter of 1990 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates:

	 	 	Current Prices	 	 		 	 		Last	 Pct.		Quarter	 Chg.	Gross National Product	$5,520.6	5.8	Consumption	3,697.6	8.5	Business investment	532.4	12.9	Inventory change	9.7	N.A.

HEADLINE: Banks Rush to Sell Assets by End of Year

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Department stores are not alone in having end-of-the-year holiday sales.
Many of the nation's largest commercial banks, hurt by losses on real estate loans, are trying to sell big chunks of their businesses, like credit card operations, business loans and even branches. 
 Arranging sales before the end of the year would make the Dec. 31 financial statements of these banks look better and cast a more positive light on a disappointing year. But regardless of when the sales occur, they signal a major adjustment in the way bankers are viewing their business. After years of expanding into new businesses and markets far from home, many banks are retrenching to concentrate on fewer businesses where their expertise is greatest.
"Like many others, we are focusing our efforts in the things we do best," said David A. Spina, chief financial officer at the State Street Bank and Trust Company in Boston. State Street, a leader in custodial and record-keeping services for mutual funds, recently agreed to sell its $425 million credit card business to a unit of Household International Inc., the consumer finance company.
The idea of shrinking in size does not come easily to bankers, most of whom have spent their careers pushing for growth. But with an increase in bad real estate loans and the threat of mounting losses on other kinds of loans as the economy weakens, regulators are encouraging banks to strengthen their financial positions.
"The regulators' scrutiny of those loans is intense enough to make everybody want to reduce their holdings," said one banker who spoke on the condition he not be identified. "There is a strong desire among many banks to sell loans before year-end."
Selling loans and other assets reduces the size of a bank but increases its capital. Even if the sales do not produce a profit, a bank's financial condition appears to be stronger after assets are sold because its capital is spread across a smaller base.
One quick fix sought by many bankers is the sale of credit card businesses. These operations can often be sold quickly and at attractive prices because they are highly profitable.
By far the largest such attempt is by MNC Financial Inc. in Baltimore, which was hurt by real estate losses at its Maryland National Bank subsidiary. The company expects a profit of more than $1 billion from the sale of its card business, which earned more than $300 million last year and is the fourth largest among banks, with $6.8 billion of loans outstanding.
 
$10 Billion in Card Loans
 "There are more bank card businesses for sale now than were sold during the first nine months of the year," said Robert K. Hammer, a specialist in selling card businesses and chairman of an investment banking firm bearing his name in Newbury Park, Calif. He said that about $10 billion of credit card loans are now for sale, "and I expect several transactions will be announced before year-end."
At the Southeast Banking Corporation in Miami, executives hope that the sale of their $900 million credit card business will offset a $86.9 million loss in the third quarter and help replenish the bank's capital, which has been eroded by losses on real estate loans.
Home equity loans are another kind of consumer product that bankers are eager to sell. Yesterday, the Shawmut National Corporation in Hartford sold more than $500 million of securities backed by home equity loans. Shawmut is also seeking a buyer for its $450 million credit card business.
Other banks, unwilling to part with credit card businesses, are trying to sell loans they made to businesses. Buyers range from other banks to insurance companies and mutual funds. Among the most frequently offered loans are those made to highly indebted companies as part of the financing for leveraged buyouts.
 
Dismayed by Discounts
 But to the dismay of bankers, many loans for leveraged buyouts that are paying interest and are not now threatening to default can be sold only at discount prices. The discounts could result in losses for banks and cause regulators to question whether similar loans on banks' books are worth as much as shown.
Charles Kiley, a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company who handles loan selling and trading, said many bankers had been unwilling to accept the losses that would result if they cut prices sharply. "We are seeing more banks interested in selling loans," he said, "though that is not to say that there is more selling going on."
Peter M. Lupoff, a former banker who is now managing director at M. J. Whitman & Company, a New York firm that specializes in trading bank loans, thinks buyers are playing a waiting game. "There is a scant amount of cash available and buyers are clever enough to know that the closer they get to year-end, the better the prices are likely to become," he said.
 
Scrutiny of Insurers
 In addition, demand from insurance companies for loans has also dropped substantially because, like the banks, insurers are under greater scrutiny from their regulators. A new rating system being developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, for example, may judge the credit quality of many bank loans so harshly that insurance compaies would be required to set aside more reserve funds for bad loans than they do now.
"In anticipation of the new ratings, a lot of insurance companies have become much more cautious about what they will buy," said Martha C. Briley, president of Prudential Power Funding Associates, a unit of the Prudential Insurance Company of America.
To make selling loans easier, bankers have begun listing their offerings on electronic video services, where they may be seen by potential buyers. McCarthy Crisanti & Maffei, a New York firm that rates corporate debt and operates an electronic news service for corporate and mortgage-backed securities, began a new service in June listing corporate loans offered for sale.
A unit of the Bankers Trust Corporation was the first to list its offerings with McCarthy Crisanti, and was quickly followed by Chase Manhattan, Barclays Bank and a few other foreign banks. Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical have signed up for the service and several other banks are studying the possiblity, said Lindley B. Richert, senior vice president at McCarthy Crisanti.
 
Seeking Quality Ratings
 In another effort to whet buyers' appetites for loans, bankers are talking with analysts at Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation about obtaining quality ratings on loans for the first time. This independent analysis of loans could make some buyers more comfortable.
For some banks, selling entire businesses is an alternative to the difficult process of finding buyers for individual business loans.
Marine Midland Banks Inc. in Buffalo recently agreed to sell to the Ford Motor Credit Company most of the Marine Midland Automotive Financial Corporation, a unit that finances car dealers and buyers.
The Chase Manhattan Corportion is seeking a buyer for its 15-branch consumer banking business in Spain. Anticipating tough competition from European banks when national barriers to trade and finance come down in 1992, Chase is also looking to sell its British credit card business, industry analysts said.
 
Buying Savings Branches
 Closer to home, Chase is taking advantage of the desire of some New York-area savings banks to sell their less profitable branches. In October, Chase announced an agreement to buy two branches with $330 million of deposits from the Dollar Dry Dock Bank of New York. It said it expects to acquire more branches from other savings banks before the end of the year.
The First Fidelity Bankcorporation, the largest banking company in New Jersey, announced last week that it would sell the Fidelcor Business Credit Corporation, a $500 million commercial finance subsidiary with nine offices, to the CIT Group. The CIT group was owned by the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation until last year, when 60 percent of the company was sold to the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan.
Some of the largest sales are expected at Citicorp, whose $234 billion of assets make it the nation's largest banking company, at more than twice the size of the second-ranking BankAmerica Corporation. The bank has already indicated plans to sell $6 billion of loans and other assets in the final quarter of 1990. Thomas H. Hanley, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, estimated that by early 1992, as much as $25 billion, or nearly 10 percent of the company, may have been pared away.

Investors Seeking Safety in Foods

BYLINE: By H. J. Maidenberg

 BODY:
AS economists argue over whether the nation is in a recession or about to enter one, more investors are seeking safety. Regardless of the state of the economy, they reason, people still eat every day. As a result, the normally stodgy food sector of the market has again become attractive.
Thanks to abundant harvests of basic farm products and growing consumer acceptance of a variety of new products, many food manufacturers have been able to increase their dividends by double-digit percentages this year. 
 As a group, food stocks have outperformed market averages so far this year. As of yesterday's close of the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks was down 7.92 percent for the year to date, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was off 10.03 percent.
By comparison, the index of 22 milling and baking company stocks compiled weekly by Milling & Baking News, Kansas City, Mo., the leading journal of the industry, was up 5.95 percent, to its highest level since late last July, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices soaring and most share prices tumbling.
Whether the food companies will be able to sustain or increase their profit margins in 1991 will largely depend on energy costs, which are a much larger industry expense than the cost of raw materials. Food industry analysts think they will.
"While low prices of grain, oilseeds and other basic food ingredients have taken some of the sting out of the doubling of energy costs, the industry is also benefiting greatly from volume-building new products and the increasing health consciousness of consumers," said Morton I. Sosland, publisher and chief editor of Milling & Baking News.
With prices of wheat, corn, oats and oilseeds hovering near seasonal lows, the cost of energy is the food industry's main problem. The reason is that much of the industry's raw materials and almost all the finished products are transported by road. The amount of energy used in processing food products is significant, but not nearly as much as in transportation.
Gone are the days when neighborhood bakeries were a community fixture. Since World War II, the food industry has become concentrated in relatively few manufacturing centers and thus is more vulnerable to rising transportation costs.
Offsetting the near doubling of oil prices in recent months, Mr. Sosland said, is the food industry's success with profitable products like frozen baked goods. At the same time, consumer concerns about health and fitness are increasing the use of enriched breads, pastas and cereals.
Enriched bread and hamburger buns usually provide more nutrition than the contents of the sandwiches, and health-conscious consumers are eating more protein-rich pasta than ever before. Also, ethnic foods like pizza and Mexican tortillas have become part of the average diet.
These developments have combined to make shares in food companies a leading defensive sector, said Nomi Ghez, food industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "Normally, the food sector was at best an unglamorous group with slow growth," she said. "Today, the food sector is not only outperforming a weak stock market, but providing investors with double-digit increases in dividends that have averaged 14 percent thus far in 1991."
Among some examples Ms. Ghez cited was the 14.3 percent increase in the annual dividend by H. J. Heinz, to 96 cents a share; Hershey Food's 15.4 percent rise, to 90 cents; Quaker Oats' 11.4 percent gain, to $1.56. Also, General Mills raised its payout 16.4 percent, to $2.56, and Conagra, 16 percent, to 69 cents.
"Were it not for the near doubling of oil prices, food company share prices would be at their 52-week highs," she said.
William M. LeFevre, senior vice president and market strategist at Advest Inc., said the food manufacturers were also benefiting from a decline in exports of grain and oilseeds. "While the drop in exports has made it more economical for processors like Archer-Daniels-Midland to convert more corn into ethanol fuel blends, it has also reduced costs for poultry," he said. "So we will be seeing more fast-food chains featuring chicken in the near future."
Following are the stocks in the Milling & Baking News index: Anheuser-Busch, Archer-Daniels-Midland, Borden, Bridgford, Campbell Soup, Conagra, CPC International, Flowers Industries, General Mills, H. J. Heinz, Hershey, International Multifoods, Kellogg, Lance, Midwest Grain Products, Philip Morris, Quaker Oats, Ralston Purina, Sara Lee, Seaboard Flour, Tasty Baking and Vie de France.

HEADLINE: Catalogue Sales Lag

 BODY:
The pace of Christmas catalogue sales is even slower than that of retail sales in stores because catalogue companies are hampered by prices set many months ago, Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail Federation, said yesterday at a news briefing in New York.
Prices fixed six to nine months ago, when the catalogues were being produced, are higher than those now found in stores, where much discounting is taking place, she said. 
 Ms. Wells said that general merchandise, appliance and furniture sales in December should show a gain of 3 percent over December 1989. But because price inflation in those goods averages about 2 percent a year, the real increase in sales should only be about 1 percent, she said.
She also said she expected real personal expenditures to increase 1.1 percent during the current economic slowdown. That would be only one-tenth of a percentage point less than in 1989 and is higher than in the recessions of 1974 and 1980, when consumer spending dropped. She did not say how long a recession might last.
Separately, the Conference Board said Americans would spend about $37 billion on Christmas gifts this year, or about 4 percent less than last year. This would come to $325 per family compared with $335 in 1989.

HEADLINE: Cuomo to Forgo Inaugural Ball, Citing Expense

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Dismissing a ceremony as expensive and a celebration as inappropriate, Mario M. Cuomo said today that his inauguration to a third term as New York's governor would be a strictly private affair.
In contrast to his 1987 festivities here -- attended by almost 5,000 people and highlighted by a 19-gun salute, a Beethoven symphony and an "I Love New York" medley -- the Governor's inaugural on Jan. 1 will probably be held in the study of the Executive Mansion and attended only by family members, the Governor said. 
 For Mr. Cuomo, whose penchant for introspection is legendary, a day spent quietly in his chambers or with his diaries might not be any less enjoyable than one spent popping champagne corks with masses of admirers.
Still, the move is unusual -- several officials here said they could not recall a Governor forgoing the inaugural ceremony -- and it will deprive the Capitol of a colorful ritual that has served to brighten up the Albany winter once every four years.
In a brief statement, Mr. Cuomo said that a formal inaugural, estimated to cost between $60,000 and $70,000 in state money, would be unbecoming "at a time of national economic crisis." He recently proposed cutting $1 billion from the state budget and laying off up to 10,000 state workers, and he said that eschewing the ceremony was part of his effort to share in the "inconvenience, sacrifice, even pain" of the state's fiscal turmoil.
"I hope the people of New York will understand that my purpose is to express our gratitude," he added, "and to reaffirm our commitment to the idea of family -- in all things -- pleasant and difficult."
Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, Attorney General Robert Abrams and State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, all re-elected earlier this month, said through aides today that they, too, would not hold a public celebration for their inaugurals.
Mr. Cuomo will give no inaugural speech and may not have any public schedule on New Year's Day, he said in an interview tonight.
Asked whether he would miss the ceremony, the Govenor said: "Yes. But I was not brought up to demean the value of $70,000. And it's difficult for me to believe that any of us in our family could fully enjoy ourselves knowing that we had called for the layoffs of thousands of public employees."

 BODY:
Mercedes-Benz A.G. said it wanted to increase production of commercial vehicles next year. The company, a unit of the German industrial giant Daimler-Benz A.G. said it wanted to step up worldwide production by 3.7 percent, to 270,000 units, in 1991.
Helmut Werner, a member of the company's management board, also announced a "wide-ranging, ambitious" cost-cutting program that was aimed at saving the company 1.8 billion marks, or about $1.2 billion, by the mid-1990's. Overseas sales of Mercedes vehicles, mainly in Brazil, South Africa and the United States, have begun to feel the effects of the worldwide economic downturn.

HEADLINE: Graduate Schools Fill With Foreigners

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Long considered a safe harbor for scholars from abroad, American universities are being flooded by waves of foreign graduate students who are changing the face of higher education and exposing in many ways the nation's declining ability to produce its own researchers, scientists and academicians.
Over the last two decades, the number of Americans earning advanced degrees has declined, leaving empty seats that have been filled by foreigners. The percentage of doctoral degrees earned by noncitizens has swelled from 15 percent in 1972 to 26 percent last year. 
 The smaller number of deAmericans in graduate school can be partly attributed to a decreasing college-age population, with the end of the baby boom. But educators are concerned that fewer and fewer college-age students are interested in or capable of handling graduate studies.
Foreign graduate students are found in every field but especially in technology and the sciences, where well-equipped American research laboratories are the envy of the world. Foreigners now earn half or more of the degrees in those fields and practically dominate in some places, like the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where 734 of 887 full-time students are from Asia, or the civil engineering department at the University of Texas at Austin, where 205 of 355 graduate students come from other countries.
 
'A Know-Nothing Country'
 The growing presence of foreign scholars may be proof of the quality of American universities, and in many cases may enhance that quality. But some educators see problems. They say the noncitizens are receiving financial aid from the universities that could go to hard-pressed American graduate students. They also worry that the United States is heading for trouble because many of these students will return home, taking their training with them. That will benefit their countries, but deprive American industry of scientists and American universities of professors.
The biggest concern is that the United States is jeopardizing its future by not producing enough of its own academic high achievers.
"We face the serious problem of becoming a know-nothing country," said Neville R. Kallenbach, chairman of the chemistry department at New York University, where only one of 15 first-year graduate students is American. "That's what deep down really bothers me."
Already, universities have come to rely on international students to keep graduate programs filled, and by all accounts their numbers will continue to grow. At some schools foreign applications outnumber domestic ones, and in some departments more than 80 percent of first-year students come from overseas. Foreign scholars run laboratories, lead research efforts and teach ever more undergraduate courses.
 
Xenophobia Rears Its Head
 "Our university research system is dependent on the supply of foreign graduate students," said Manfred J. Cziesla, director of the office of international affairs at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "Without them now it would collapse."
For the most part, concerns about the surge of foreign students have been based on academic issues, not xenophobia, but some of those fears have surfaced. In 1987 the Massachusetts Legislature approved, then quickly repealed, a law requiring foreign students to pay much higher tuition than other students. Elsewhere, attempts have been made to bar foreign students from sections of research libraries containing closely held information.
But the more pressing concern, most experts say, is not that there are so many foreign students enrolled in graduate programs but that there are so few Americans.
Since the early 1970's, the number of doctorates granted has remained about the same but the number of Americans receiving them has dropped. Educators believe American students are driven away by the long years and near poverty that go with graduate study. It is far easier, they say, to go directly into the work force with a bachelor's degree.
 
The Wages of Poor Schooling
 Recognition is growing that many American students cannot make the grade in the demanding graduate and postgraduate levels because they have not received adequate training and motivation, especially in the sciences, from kindergarten through college.
"Our graduate schools are extremely attractive internationally," said Peter D. Syverson, director of information services for the Council of Graduate Schools, a national organization. "We get terrific applications from abroad, but not the same level and quality of applications from American students."
In every field surveyed by the Council of Graduate Schools, the percentage of Americans earning advanced degrees declined over the last two decades.
The drop has been steepest in technology and the hard sciences, where the work is among the hardest and the salaries generally lower than in professional fields like medicine and law. A survey released this month by the American Mathematical Society showed that 57 percent of the 933 mathematics doctorates awarded last year were given to noncitizens.
Students from other countries have filled seats once held by Americans. For instance, foreigners at Columbia University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences have increased 47 percent in the last five years. At the University of Pennsylvania, nearly 43 percent of the graduate students in the college of earth and mineral sciences come from other nations. Half of the electrical engineering graduate students and almost 58 percent of the civil engineering students at the University of Texas are noncitizens.
 
Once Europe, Now Asia
 In 1986, foreign applications actually outnumbered domestic ones at Ohio State University, which has one of the largest graduate-school populations in the country. About 23 percent of its 10,493 graduate students are foreigners.
The new academic immigrants reflect the shifting economic and political world. Europeans once dominated but now students from Taiwan, Korea, India and the People's Republic of China outnumber all others. Most of the students are men but the number of women is rapidly increasing.
The chemistry department at Rutgers University, for instance, has around 160 students, about 100 of them noncitizens and most from the People's Republic of China.
"If this keeps up," said Dr. Martha A. Cotter, vice chairwoman of the department, "in another 15 years it's not going to be 'My teaching assistant has an accent,' but 'My professor has an accent.' "
The Chinese students wear jeans and carry backpacks like their American counterparts, but they tend to study and socialize together, apart from other students. Dr. Cotter is concerned that foreign graduate students around the country now seem to be drawing more criticism than earlier waves of foreign scholars.
 
An Element of Racism
 "I'm not sure if there isn't a little element of racism, in that people get more upset about lots of Chinese people than they do about lots of European people," Dr. Cotter said.
At the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, 60 of 160 graduate students are noncitizens. Most receive about $20,000 a year in financial aid from the university, including payment for their work as teachers of undergraduates.
The foreign students at Courant are first-rate mathematicians. But, like graduate students at other universities, many are also first-time teachers with limited command of English, which can cause problems.
"Some come and a year later sound like Americans," said Jerome Berkowitz, deputy director of the institute. "There are others who come and 10 years later they are still incomprehensible."
Mr. Berkowitz said N.Y.U. helped graduate students learn teaching methods and master English skills. The students who have the most trouble being understood, he added, are sometimes restricted to grading papers or working in a lab.
 
Baffling Jokes and Strict Visas
 Many of the students have studied English in school for years before they arrive, and it is the culture, not the language, that confuses them.
"In Taiwan I was learning English from the ninth grade," said Ping Chiang Lyu, a 31-year-old Ph.D. candidate in chemistry at N.Y.U. who has taught several undergraduate classes. "But I still cannot pick up on the jokes."
Some institutions became so dependent on the stream of foreigners that admissions standards are bent to get them in. At the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, 73 percent of full-time graduate students are noncitizens. The percentage was even higher when the former director of the graduate school recruited heavily from universities in India, including some whose students, it was later found, could not meet American standards.
Professors say the great bulk of foreign students are competent, even brilliant, scholars and researchers. But because they are in the United States on temporary student visas, most are forced by immigration laws to leave after they get their degrees.
 
Staying in America
 Increasingly, foreign students are trying to extend their stay. According to a survey of doctorate recipients by the National Science Foundation, 57 percent of foreign students who had made definite plans wanted to stay in the United States.
Of those who wanted to stay, 33 percent planned to extend their student visas by pursuing postdoctoral work. The remaining 24 percent said they were going to look for jobs either teaching or working in industry, which entails a two-year process to prove that there are no qualified Americans to take the position.
But eventually, most foreign students return home. Some see this as a way to improve the image of the United States abroad and to help less developed countries expand their economies.
"The growth of knowledge is a good in itself," said Hanna H. Gray, president of the University of Chicago, who is chairwoman of the Association of American Universities.
 
Shortage of Home-Grown Talent
 But others fear that by training and supporting so many scholars who will not work here, the United States is wasting valuable resources.
"We're very concerned about shortages of skilled people, particularly in the sciences and engineering, computer science and mathematics," said Harris N. Miller, coordinator for the Business Immigration Coalition, a group of multinational companies that has lobbied for revisions to immigration law.
Congress has approved some of those changes, including a measure to triple the quota for skilled professionals to 140,000 a year from 55,000. President Bush has said he would sign it.

HEADLINE: Aquatic Pest Turns Up Early in Hudson

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER

 BODY:
The zebra mussel, an aquatic pest that fouls the intake pipes of power plants, has been found in the Hudson River for the first time, scientists who have been tracking its spread eastward from the Great Lakes said yesterday.
The mussels, which had not previously been seen east of the central section of the Erie Canal, were found in the Hudson on a piece of wood in Haverstraw Bay off Croton Point in Westchester County. They were identified yesterday by experts at the New York Zebra Mussel Information Clearinghouse at the State University of New York at Brockport. 
 "It is the first confirmed North American sighting of the mussel outside of the Great Lakes drainage basin," said Charles F. O'Neill Jr., project supervisor of the Brockport center.
The zebra mussel, named for its dark brown stripes on a light tannish shell, has produced environmental problems elsewhere. Reproducing prolifically, it clogs the intake pipes of power plants and devours microscopic plants at the base of the food chain for freshwater fish.
"It should be worrisome for anyonewho has a pipe in the river, any muncipality or any utility," said Charles I. Keene, director of natural history at the Museum of the Hudson Highlands in Cornwall. "The mussels will plug up the pipes."
A native of Europe, the mussel was first found in the United States in 1988 in Lake St. Clair, east of Detroit, presumably deposited there by oceangoing ships using the Great Lakes. Without any known natural enemies to attack it, the mussels reproduce quickly: females produce as many as 40,000 eggs a season. The mussels often cluster around water-intake pipes, which provide a moving source of food.
 
Sooner Than Expected
 From Lake St. Clair, they have spread rapidly as far as Duluth, Minn., on the western end of Lake Superior, along the western edges of Lake Huron, along the shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario and into the St. Lawrence River.
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has estimated that the expanding population might add as much as $500 million a year in expenses for public utilities, water companies and factories and loss of business in sports fishing, marinas and motels along the inland waterways of the nation.
Though biologists had predicted that the mussel would sooner or later infect the Hudson River -- perhaps in a year or two -- its presence in the river so soon surprised them, Mr. O'Neill said. The discovery came as a sidelight to a collection for a scientific display on biological filtering at the Museum of the Hudson Highlands. On Oct. 1, a small party led by Christopher Letts, an educator for the Hudson River Foundation, went into the river at Haverstraw Bay to collect marine specimens. They gathered grass shrimp, sticklebacks, barnacles and a piece of wood covered with various marine growths. The stick was carried back to the museum and placed in an aquarium.
Last week, Mr. Keene examined it. "I was taken completely by surprise," he said. "I noticed something peculiar on the stick, some mussels. I took a couple off, and looked at them under a magnifying glass but they didn't look like any native mussels I had ever seen."
 
'A Lot of Questions'
 Mr. Keene said they did not look like zebra mussels either, because they were smaller -- about a quarter of an inch in diameter -- and lighter than he thought they would be. He sent them to Brockport for identification.
"We have a lot of questions about how they got there," Mr. O'Neill said, noting that the zebra mussel, a fresh-water organism, is not usually found in salt water like the lower Hudson River.
To combat the zebra mussel, utilities have flushed pipes with treated water, cleaned intake screens by hand and used chlorine and other chemicals.None of the methods has proved to be economical or nonpolluting.
Four major power plants are close to the site where the mussels were found: the Lovett and Bowline plants of Orange and Rockland Utilities, just across the river, and Indian Point 2, operated by Con Edison, and Indian Point 3, operated by the New York Power Authority, a few miles to the north.
 
'March Across the State'
 "We haven't found any zebra mussels yet," said Jim Lois, a spokesman for Orange and Rockland.
Cliff Spieler, a vice president of the Power Authority, said samples were taken yesterday but no visible signs of the mussels were found.
"We were fully aware of their march across the state," said John Holsapple, manager of water quality programs for the New York Power Pool, which represents all the state power plants. "We knew they were coming, but it was a bit of a surprise to see them so soon."
None of the experts had any explanation of how the zebra mussels arrived at Croton without any signs of them appearing east of their last sighting, in the Erie Canal near Rochester.
Mr. O'Neill also said it was too early to say if the zebra mussels have formed a major colony at Croton.
He offered three possibilities for how the mussels could have been transported from the Great Lakes: on a European ship discharging ballast water in the Hudson, on a pleasure boat from the Great Lakes transferred to the Croton River or the Hudson or, more unlikely, on a piece of wood floating down through the Erie Canal, the Mohawk River and the Hudson.
"The river is certainly going to be the site of intense scrutiny by scientists now," Mr. O'Neill said.

2 Ex-Military Chiefs Urge Bush to Delay Gulf War

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff urged the Bush Administration today to postpone military action against Iraq and to give economic sanctions a year or more to work.
"If in fact the sanctions will work in 12 to 18 months instead of six months, the trade-off of avoiding war with its attendant sacrifices and uncertainties would, in my view, be worth it," said Adm. William J. Crowe, who appeared with Gen. David Jones. 
 "It's curious," Admiral Crowe continued, "that some expect our military to train soldiers to stand up to hostile fire but doubt its ability to train them to occupy ground and wait patiently."
The testimony by the two retired officers before the Senate Armed Services Committee was significant because it reflects a strong current of opinion within the active military and because the two men remain influential with Congress. The hearings took place as the United Nations Security Council prepared to meet Thursday to vote on a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq does not pull out of Kuwait.
In recent weeks, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, and Gen. Alfred Gray, the Marine Corps Commandant, have urged that the United States avoid a rush toward war and give economic sanctions more time to work.
 
Kissinger Opposes Delay
 The remarks by Admiral Crowe and General Jones were warmly received by the committee's Democratic members, who have called for restraint by the Administration.
But in his appearance before the panel, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger argued that the United States could not afford to wait a year for the sanctions to work because the prolonged presence of American forces in Saudi Arabia would destabilize the country and other moderate Arab states.
"The issue in Arabia is not American staying power but the host country's domestic stability," Mr. Kissinger said.
"Conditions in the gulf are not even remotely comparable to Europe or Northeast Asia," Mr. Kissinger said. "There, American forces contributed to domestic stability. In Saudi Arabia they would threaten it."
The sharply conflicting assessments were a microcosm of the escalating debate over American policy in the Persian Gulf.
The Bush Administration's decision earlier this month to almost double the number of American troops in the Persian Gulf and to seek a United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force in an offensive against Iraq shattered the bipartisan Congressional support for the Administration's gulf policy that developed in August when President Bush announced that he was sending American troops to Saudi Arabia for defensive purposes.
The two former military chiefs, whose testimony came before Mr. Kissinger's, echoed the assessment of former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, who testified on Tuesday, that the economic sanctions would be effective in persuading Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait if only the United States would give them time to work.
 
Anti-U.S. Sentiment
 In his testimony, Admiral Crowe, the top military chief in the in the later part of the Reagan Administration and the first year of the Bush Administration, also argued that an American strike against Iraq would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Arab world.
General Jones, the top military official during the Carter Administration and the early part of the Reagan Administration, said he also believed the embargo would work and expressed concern that the American military buildup would create pressure for premature action.
"As we build to 400,000 troops, however, the support, morale, training, cultural and readiness problems rise sharply the longer the troops remain in forward garrisons," General Jones said. "My main concern with this latest scheduled reinforcement isn't that we might choose to fight, but rather that the deployment might cause us to fight -- perhaps prematurely and perhaps unnecessarily."
Mr. Kissinger agreed that the growth in the size of the American force in Saudi Arabia would make it more difficult to extend their stay there. Mr. Kissinger argued that that merely strengthened the case for taking military action against Iraq early next year.
 
Muslim Month of Fasting
 If the economic sanctions have not forced Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait by the spring, a situation that Mr. Kissinger suggested was very likely, the United States would face a decision of going to war against Iraq or risking contributing to the destabilization of Saudi Arabia.
"I do not believe we can maintain 400,000 troops much beyond the spring of next year," he said. "I am nervous about the period that begins with Ramadan."
"By the time it is evident that sanctions alone cannot succeed, a credible military option will probably no longer exist," said Mr. Kissinger, who remains an influential figure among White House officials.
General Jones sought to balance his call for patience by sending a clear warning to President Hussein.
"The country is unified in seeking that he does not succeed," the retired general said. "How badly he is hurt is his choice. If we take military action, we're not going to stop in Kuwait.

HEADLINE: GREENSPAN SAYS NATION'S ECONOMY IS IN A DOWNTURN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Government's most influential economic policy maker, today became the first top official to say publicly that the nation's economy is actually shrinking.
Although others in the Government have acknowledged that the economy is growing little if at all, Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress today that economic activity had been contracting since last month, largely because of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. 
 Many private economists have reached similar conclusions, but none have access to the wealth of data that Mr. Greenspan has.
 
The Effects of a Downturn
 A shrinking economy, or drop in the gross national product, means less business activity, higher unemployment and a much larger Federal budget deficit, as tax revenues decrease and spending for unemployment compensation and welfare programs rise. If the situation got bad enough, the Federal Reserve would probably lower interest rates to give the economy a lift, but Mr. Greenspan would not say today whether that was his intention.
Testifying before the House Banking Committee, he said of the economy, "All indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate output occurred as we moved through October and into November."
Asked if that meant a recession had begun, Mr. Greenspan replied that it was too early to tell whether the slide would last long enough to amount to a recession. But he added, "What we're looking at is a gradual decline, which, if it persists, will give us a fourth-quarter G.N.P. which is negative."
 
A Year-End Decline
 That means he expects the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, to be less from October through December than it was from July through September.
The Commerce Department reported today that the economy grew at a rate of 1.7 percent in the third quarter, marginally less than initially estimated. Most of the growth came early in the period, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. [Page D1.]
The official definition of a recession is a decline in the gross national product for two consecutive quarters.
So far, Mr. Greenspan said, the weekly economic data he analyzes did not indicate that a serious recession was in the offing. "It's still a mixed case," he said, "but there's no question but that the economy, at least as of a week or so ago, was still easing."
Two weeks ago, President Bush said he was worried about the possibility of recession, but he and his advisers have given no clue of what policies they might adopt to turn the economy around. In any case, their options are limited, and they probably have less influence over the economy than Mr. Greenspan, whose authority is independent of the President's.
 
 Holding Sway Over Rates
 Mr. Greenspan is so influential because the Federal Reserve controls some interest rates and can affect others. As is his habit, he refused today to discuss his plans in that area.
Still, two observations he made before the Banking Committee could be read as an indication that he was prepared to drive rates somewhat lower, although not necessarily immediately. Mr. Greenspan said he was concerned about a continuing tightening of credit by banks, and he also said that the threat of inflation seemed to have moderated in recent weeks.
Since July, the Federal Reserve has allowed the Federal funds rate, a rate it controls directly, to fall from 8.25 percent to 7.5 percent, and many economists expect it to drop to 7 percent by early next year. The Federal funds rate is what banks charge for overnight loans, and changes in it can lead to changes in commercial and consumer interest rates.
 
 Bond Prices Unchanged
 Mr. Greenspan's comments were viewed as mildly positive for the credit markets early in the session, as participants anticipated lower rates eventually, but other factors also affected the market throughout the day and the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond ended unchanged.
When he is asked about interest rates, Mr. Greenspan tends to talk in riddles. Today, for example, Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican, suggested that current economic conditions "militate rather forcibly" for lower rates.
Mr. Greenspan responded: "The evidence suggests that the maximum real economic growth occurs with a stable, noninflationary economic and financial environment. And if that were consistent with an easier monetary policy, then I would agree with you on the general proposition. I'm not sure it is. It may be in certain cases. It may not be in other cases."
Mr. Greenspan said that he paid close attention to surveys of public attitudes and that he knew the confidence of businesses and consumers was now very low. But he said, "It is clearly the case that the world out there when you look at the hard data is not in as bad shape as it feels."
 Economic activity in many parts of the country and many segments of the economy has been declining for months, but there are signs of strength. In parts of the Middle West, for instance, economic activity is still robust, Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan said the economic contraction was mainly the result of three factors: rising oil prices, "the enormous uncertainty about how and when the tensions in the Persian Gulf will be resolved" and the tightening of credit by banks. The interaction of these elements, he said, "is apparently creating a greater suppression of economic activity than the sum of the forces individually."
"A significant part, even a major part," of the economic decline "is Persian Gulf related," he said, and he suggested that the Federal Reserve could do little to counteract that factor.
 
 'The Transfer of Wealth'
 "We must not lose sight of the fact," he said, "that there is no policy initiative that can in the end prevent the transfer of wealth and cut in our standard of living that stems from higher prices for imported oil."
On the other hand, Mr. Greenspan said he had considerable "anecdotal evidence," though little hard data, that what he called the credit crunch had worsened since the summer, and he suggested that this was one force dragging down the economy that the Federal Reserve could respond to.
"We shall want to make certain that money and credit remain on appropriate growth tracks, with due attention to the credit situation," he told the lawmakers.
Although economists agree that credit is less available to many businesses than it ought to be in the current economic climate, they disagree on the main cause. Some say banks have become reluctant to lend either because Government regulations have become too strict or because the banks are uneasy in light of the savings and loan debacle. Others say the main problem is that interest rates are so high that businesses cannot afford to borrow.
In either case, a reduction in borrowing results in less investment and less economic activity generally.
In July, when the Federal Reserve began to lower rates after holding them steady for more than six months, Mr. Greenspan said the tightness of credit was the deciding factor.
Since then, he, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and even President Bush have encouraged bankers to be more forthcoming with loans to creditworthy customers, but unless interest rates come down, their pleas may have been in vain.
 
 Bank Rule Under Study
 Mr. Greenspan also confirmed today a report in The Wall Street Journal this week that the Federal Reserve was studying whether to lower the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold in reserve in currency or in interest-free deposits at the Federal Reserve.
A reduction in the reserve requirement, which has not changed in more than a decade, would increase bank profits and might encourage them to lend money more freely.
Mr. Greenspan said the matter had been under consideration since the summer. "We have not come to a conclusion," he said, "because there are lots of pluses and minuses, but we are looking at it."
In an aside, he also expressed concern to the committee today about the recent decline in the dollar's value on the currency markets. Partly in response to those comments and to his apparent inclination to not reduce interest rates further just yet, the dollar strengthened today against most major currencies.
 
 Some Economists' Views
 Mr. Greenspan's view that current data do not suggest a serious recession was seconded by private economists who testified after him at the Banking Committee hearing today.
Charles L. Schultze, who was chairman of President Jimmy Carter's Council of Economic Advisers and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he expected a recession but that it "should be noticeably less severe and the inflation consequences far less than those with which the economy was afflicted after the previous two oil shocks."
Alan Sinai, a prominent forecaster who is president of the Boston Company Economic Advisors, said he expected a moderate recession lasting until the middle of next year.

HEADLINE: Argentina and Brazil Renounce Atomic Weapons

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Moving to soften a long dispute with the United States just days ahead of a visit to this area by President Bush, the Presidents of Brazil and Argentina formally renounced the manufacture of nuclear weapons today at a meeting on their border.
Presidents Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina promised that their nuclear potential, the most advanced in Latin America, would be used for "exclusively peaceful ends." 
Meeting on the Brazilian side of the Iguassu Falls, they signed an accord to open negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency to set up a system of international safeguards and inspections and promised to begin inspections of each other's nuclear installations within 45 days.
Neither President said anything about eventually signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which has always been viewed in the two countries as an assault on national sovereignty.
If they join the more than 130 countries that have signed the nonproliferation accord, Argentina and Brazil would be required to submit to international controls and regular inspections by the international agency.
Both emphasized the agreement's voluntary, bilateral nature, with Mr. Menem, in remarks after the signing, saying it was part of a "global treatment of the different aspects of integration that will permit us to preserve the equilibrium necessary for peace, regional security and democracy."
Jose Luiz Carvalho, president of Brazil's National Nuclear Energy Commission, said in a television interview today in Rio de Janeiro that "all nuclear materials -- enriched uranium, plutonium -- will be checked and counted down to the last gram."
The agreement was brought about not so much by the changing international climate as by improving relations between the two countries, each now in its second term of civilian government.
The nuclear race between the historically antagonistic neighbors began during their periods of military rule, but neither is known to have actually produced a nuclear weapon.
The accord comes when both countries are putting aside some of their traditional nationalism and looking to their Latin American neighbors, the United States and other rich countries to help improve their economic situations through trade and investment. The trip that Mr. Bush is to begin Sunday to five South American countries -- Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela -- is expected to focus on his promise to create a hemispheric free-trade zone.
Last month, the Collor Government announced that it had uncovered a 15-year-old military program to make a Brazilian atom bomb and had halted the program.
In November 1983, shortly before giving up power, the Argentine military Government announced that it had the technology to enrich uranium at its plant at Pilcaniyeu, but it is not believed to have ever done so to the level needed to make fuel for nuclear explosives. Argentine civilian governments have always said they had no interest in nuclear weapons.
Both countries use nuclear power. Argentina's two functioning nuclear power plants have been plagued by failures and shutdowns in recent years, and construction of a third has been virtually halted by economic problems.
The accord signed today, a result of contacts begun between the two governments five years ago, says the two countries are prepared to reach an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations body, on the basis of "mutual accountability and control."
It further says that once that pact is completed they will proceed to abide by the Treaty of Tlatelolco, under which most other Latin American nations have committed themselves to keeping the area free of atomic weapons.
Argentina and Brazil signed the 1967 agreement, but neither nation has abided by it, citing a clause that the treaty does not formally go into effect until all the countries in the region have signed. Cuba is the sole holdout.
The United States and some European countries have long pressed Argentina and Brazil to subscribe to either the Tlatelolco Treaty or the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
But the two South American countries complained that the treaties seemed intended to prevent developing countries from enjoying the peaceful technological advances that industrialized countries have obtained as a side effect of nuclear weapons development.
Both Mr. Menem and Mr. Collor seemed to have that point in mind still with the last phrase in their agreement, which says that before abiding by the Tlatelolco Treaty they will make efforts toward "the updating and perfecting of its text."
 
MOVE WELCOMED IN U.S.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- The White House and State Department today had no official comment on the announcement by Brazil and Argentina, but an Administration official called it "something we have always promoted."
"We're very happy to see it happen," said the official, speaking on condition that he not be identified.
Private organizations that oppose the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials also praised the two nations' action. The president of the Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute, Paul L. Leventhal, called the pact "an important breakthrough for global efforts to halt the further spread of nuclear weapons and for averting a nuclear arms race in Latin America in particular."
"This still remains an agreement in principle, however, and Argentina and Brazil should act promptly to ratify the Tlateloco Treaty" and carry out other terms of the accord, he said.

HEADLINE: Reservations On Upswing At Eastern

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Martin R. Shugrue, the trustee of Eastern Airlines, buoyantly told a news conference yesterday morning that bookings at Eastern reservation centers were 15 percent higher than had been expected, now that the carrier had beaten back the pressure to liquidate and the bankruptcy judge had given it $120 million with no strings attached.
Independent travel agents confirmed in interviews that they were booking more passengers on Eastern. 
 Peter Sontag, the chairman and chief executive of US Travel Systems, a major agency in the East, said that customers who had been uncertain whether Eastern would remain in business over the holidays were reassured by the judge's order.
"We've seen an increase in bookings today," he said. "Whether this moment of joy will last through spring is questionable."
 
'Eastern Is Getting Stronger'
 "Eastern still has a long way to go in proving to us that there is going to be consistent performance," Mr. Sontag added.
Steve Heydt, senior vice president of marketing for Liberty Travel, a large travel agency that is major user of Eastern, also said that the decision of Judge Burton R. Lifland had led to an increase in reservations. He said the ariline's bookings were already improving, thanks to its offer of an unrestricted $79 one-way fare between New York and Florida.
"Eastern is getting stronger," Mr. Heydt added.
Mr. Shugrue, relishing his victory yesterday morning in the news conference at the Holiday Inn Crown Plaza in midtown Manhattan, said that an unusually high number of calls were being taken at Eastern reservation centers, and that about three-quarters of the callers were booking flights compared with the usual half.
While some analysts publicly said Eastern might have a chance to reach its goal of breaking even by March, privately they were pessimistic, because of forces beyond Mr. Shugrue's control, like the Persian Gulf crisis and the weakening economy.
 
Walking a Fine Line
 The threat of war with Iraq has more than doubled the price of aviation fuel since last August, although prices have come down recently. Meanwhile, major carriers have seen their bookings drop, and have begun a series of promotional fares to attract more business.
Consequently, Mr. Shugrue will have to walk a fine line in the next few months, doing everything he can to turn the airline around while also taking into account the interests of the unsecured creditors and telling them and Judge Lifland if he believes that a turnaround has become impossible.
Yesterday morning Mr. Shugrue said he had been called by the heads of two trade associations of travel agents assuring him that the agents would book passengers on Eastern. That would address a major problem for Eastern; many travel agents have urged customers to book on other airlines because of fears that Eastern could shut down and leave them stranded.
Mr. Shugrue, in trying to keep the line going, will seek to sell off more of Eastern's assets to build up the airline's cash position and will continue to search for another carrier that may want to buy Eastern.
While major carriers like United, American, Delta and Northwest have said that they were interested in pieces of Eastern -- notably, the international routes and gates -- none has yet made an offer for the entire airline.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
U.S. Seems Baffled by Soviets' Disarray

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
With the Soviet Union under increasing domestic stress, Bush Administration officials say they are baffled about how to respond and increasingly worried that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will have to use military force to maintain control.
Administration officials say that while they are considering an emergency shipment of medical supplies to Moscow, to help the Soviets deal with shortages caused by faulty production, they do not believe that there is anything more they could do at this time that would really help Mr. Gorbachev or stabilize events inside his country. 
 This is partly because officials in Washington say they believe that despite some alarming reports to the contrary, the Soviet Union will not experience any famine this winter.
 
A Distribution Problem
 The food shortages there, American officials insist, are not a production problem but a distribution problem. American officials say that they, unlike the Germans, are unwilling to simply give emergency food assistance on the assumption that anything would be helpful, because they are convinced it would be subjected to the same waste, hoarding and black-marketeering as Soviet food production.
These officials say they desperately hope that Mr. Gorbachev will remain in power because they see him as a cooperative partner for everything from arms control agreements to dealing with Iraq at the United Nations. Yet they say that investing in his economy before he has instituted a serious free-market reform program would be throwing away money.
While the Bush Administration has begun -- ever so slightly -- to hedge its bets on Mr. Gorbachev by opening more lines of communication with radical reformers and leaders in the 15 republics, it is reluctant to take this very far for fear of further eroding Mr. Gorbachev's position.
"We have considerable stakes in the foreign policies of Gorbachev," a senior official ssid. "We can, will and must do business with the central Government and Gorbachev, because our relationship with them has paved the way for the world to change, and no one should forget that. Beyond Gorbachev lies the unknown."
 
'Increasing Concern'
 "We don't count Gorbachev out by any means, but we see his options narrowing," the official said. "I would say there is increasing concern here that he will soon find himself boxed in and will have to resort to coercive force to hold things together."
Any crackdown by the Soviet leader could seriously complicate the Administration's relations with Moscow, precisely at the moment when its cooperation is most needed for dealing with Iraq. Fears of such a situation were heightened on Tuesday when the Soviet Defense Minister, Marshal Dimitri T. Yazov, said that his armed forces had been instructed to use force to defend military installations, monuments and servicemen against threats in rebellious republics.
The Administration's hesitation to adopt more far-reaching responses to the fragmentation of the Soviet Union also appears to be a result of the fact that President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and other senior officials are so distracted by the Persian Gulf crisis that they have been unable to focus on the magnitude of events now unfolding in Moscow.
Officials say events in the Soviet Union are unfolding in such a confusing and contradictory manner that producing some overarching strategy to deal with them all would be impossible.
 
Famine Discounted
 On the most immediate question of economic assistance, a senior Administration official said, "All of our evidence says that there is no famine in the Soviet Union."
The official added: "There are ample food stocks, but the problems are hoarding, black-marketeering and a breakdown in the distribution system. If we were to give food, we would run into the same problems that the indigenous supply is. You can't just parachute in food. People say we supported an economic stabilization fund for Poland and not for the Soviets, but the Poles had a comprehensive economic reform plan. You knew exactly what you were feeding into. Here, there is no such thing. It is a black box."
Asked why the Administration could not follow the German example, the official replied: "People are looking into a black box and maybe some are more willing to run the risk of working in there than we are. Remember, the Russians haven't even asked us for anything yet. It is abundantly clear that we would respond if there were a real emergency, but there is no food emergency."
That approach to the Soviet question appears to be widely supported in Congress.
 
Food and Warheads
 "I would be a little more forthcoming on the food and humanitarian side, but beyond that I don't have any real bones to pick with the Administration's policy," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East. "We have to make our decisions on aid on the basis of whether it will be effective, not to score political points."
Always in the background when the question of Soviet disintegration is being discussed is the question of what might happen to the Soviet Union's 12,000 nuclear warheads, dispersed in virtually every Soviet republic.
 
Importance of Russia
 "One can't discount anything," a senior Administration policy maker said. "That said, the sort of nightmare of the crazed nationalist general threatening nuclear holocaust for his cause is probably a misplaced fear. We assume, and again nobody can be absolutely certain, that there are enough dual and overlapping controls in the system that you would have to be dealing with a very big conspiracy in order to get control of these weapons from the center."
The official concluded that the Administration's "working assumption" is that as long as there is a central authority in the Russian republic -- that is, as long as it doesn't fragment along with the Soviet Union as a whole -- there is little danger of a breakdown in the systems for securing, releasing and launching Soviet nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: AFTER SCARE, SUIT BY APPLE FARMERS

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: YAKIMA, Wash., Nov. 28

 BODY:
A group of apple growers filed a lawsuit today against the CBS and its news program "60 Minutes" and an environmental group, seeking compensation for declining sales during a scare over the growth chemical Alar.
The industry has estimated that growers lost more than $100 million following the news program's report on Feb. 26, 1989, about a study, "Intolerable Risk: Pesticides In Our Children's Food," by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental group named in the suit. 
 The report concluded that Alar, the trade name for the chemical daminozide, posed a particular risk of cancer in children, who eat and drink larger amounts of apples and apple products for their body weight than adults do. Alar was used to make the crop ripen uniformly on the tree so that the apples could be harvested all at once. It also helped the fruit retain its firmness and color.
 
 Voluntarily Removed
 The report was disputed at the time, but sales and wholesale prices of apples plummeted. Some school districts temporarily pulled apples from lunchrooms. Signs appeared in grocery stores advertising apples free of the chemical.
Alar was voluntarily removed from the market in October 1989 by its manufacturer, the Uniroyal Chemical Company. The Environmental Protection Agency banned it from all food uses in May.
The reaction was felt most acutely in Washington, where more than 60 percent of the apples that are sold in the nation's supermarkets are grown.
The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court by a group of 11 Washington apple growers, seeks to represent the estimated 4,700 growers of red apples in the state. It seeks unspecified damages running to millions of dollars.
The lawsuit contends that growers suffered economic losses as a direct result of "false, misleading, scientifically unreliable statements of the defendants."
 
 'Fundamental Issues' Seen
 Burt Chestnut, an apple grower from Wenatchee who is a plaintiff in the suit, said: "The gain is for agriculture in general nationwide, that we stop this misleading information by the media and scare tactics by environmental groups. We want the media to be responsible."
Steven Berzon, a lawyer representing the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the lawsuit could have a chilling effect on public activism.
"Beyond Alar, this suit threatened by a small group of Washington growers raises fundamental issues of free speech and the right of citizens to petition the government on important questions of public policy," Mr. Berzon said.
A spokesman for "60 Minutes," Roy Brunett, said: "We believe the broadcast highlighted an important public health matter. It was well researched and well documented."

HEADLINE: Dinosaur Displays Closing for Renovation

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
The American Museum of Natural History, which houses the largest collection of fossils in the world, has begun closing down its immensely popular dinosaur exhibitions as it initiates a five-year renovation project, the institution's most ambitious such remodeling since it was founded in 1869.
Displays as familiar to generations of children as the Empire State Building will be swept away, to be replaced by old bones in dramatic new guises. 
 The Hall of Early Dinosaurs has already been partly closed, and in February, it will close completely for two years. The destruction of a famous blue-and-white chalk mural depicting various Jurassic-period dinosaurs was under way yesterday. The Hall of Late Dinosaurs (which contains Tyrannosaurus rex, the museum's superstar) will remain open until February 1992, but will then close for nearly three years.
At a news conference yesterday, museum officials said the long-overdue modernization would make the museum's dinosaur displays the most impressive and informative in the world. But some schoolchildren touring the museum were dismayed to learn that some familiar Mesozoic friends were temporarily off limits.
 
Classification at Issue
 A more formidable critic is Dr. Edwin H. Colbert, the museum's own former curator of vertebrate paleontology, who in 1953 directed the remodeling of the dinosaur halls that are now being replaced. Dr. Colbert and other paleontologists' main complaint is that the museum will no longer group dinosaur fossils chronologically, but will instead group them according to shared physiological characteristics, even if they did not live at the same time or in the same place.
Thus, for example, the horned dinosaur triceratops, which was an ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaur, will no longer be displayed next to its contemporary arch enemy, Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a saurischian (lizard-hipped) dinosaur.
George D. Langdon Jr., the museum's president, acknowledged that some museumgoers wished the dinosaur exhibits would never change, while others approved of the museum's plans. "The fact is, we must change to maintain our position as the great institution we are," he said. "New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art carried out a modernization program that was eminently successful, and we must do the same."
Mr. Langdon said contributors had already pledged $20 million for the project, and that New York State and City administrators had been supportive. Despite the straitened economic climate, he said, the museum is confident it can raise the rest of the needed money.
The refurbishing and modernization of the museum's fossil exhibits will produce some spectacular new displays, including a 55-foot-high cast of a dinosaur fossil that will tower over visitors as they enter the cathedral-like Roosevelt Rotunda from Central Park. The fossil replica will be displayed rearing on its hind legs to protect its fossilized baby from a fossil allosaur. The cast is being prepared in Toronto from bones of the real fossil supplied by the museum.
 
It's Huge, but Is It Real?
 The barosaur replica will be by far the largest dinosaur ever displayed anywhere in the world. But Dr. Colbert expressed disapproval. "I think that when a kid looks at a dinosaur skeleton, he or she wants to know that it's the real thing, not a cast," he said. "If you have to replace some missing bones with casts, that's fine, but something of the real animal should be there."
Dr. Michael J. Novacek, a paleontologist and the dean of science at the museum, replied that it would have been impossible to mount so large and heavy a fossil in such a dramatic pose. The comparative lightness of cast bones, however, made the construction possible. Several real bones from the huge beast will be displayed elsewhere in the museum, he said.
"The major organizational change," Dr. Novacek said, "is that a visitor will be able to walk around the entire floor of fossils, moving logically from one evolutionary phase to the next. In the new sequence, a visitor will start in an orientation center and then move through the hall of primitive vertebrates, the hall of saurischian dinosaurs, the hall of ornithischian dinosaurs, the hall of primitive mammals, and the hall of late mammals. The entire span of vertebrate evolution will be encompassed by the fossils."
The renovation will include new artwork and models, dramatic lighting, computer animation, interactive computer explanations, and possibly some dinosaur robots. The displays will also summarize some major scientific debates, including the debate as to what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
 
Correcting Some Errors
 The project will also give the museum's experts time to correct some errors dating from the 19th century. The most widely publicized of these errors is in the museum's brontosaur (or as some paleontologists prefer to call it, apatosaur), the 150-foot behemoth that has dominated the Hall of Early Dinosaurs since the hall opened on May 21, 1953. Pictures of the Nine-Mile Quarry Brontosaur, named for the quarry from which it was excavated in 1898, have illustrated countless publications, including a 1954 cover of Colliers magazine. But in the 1970's paleontologists realized that the skull mounted on the fossil was actually that of a camarasaurus -- a completely different animal. The museum has never replaced the skull, but since last year it has displayed an acknowledgement and explanation of the creature's wrongheadedness.
Dr. Colbert, who, with Henry Fairfield Osborn, was one of the main architects of the museum's world-famous dinosaur exhibitions, believes remodeling and renovation of the museum are essential. "A museum has to change or it withers," he said. But he objects strongly to part of the scientific philosophy underlying the museum's planned modernization, a system known as "cladistics."
The traditional system for ranking and relating different types of organisms places each type on an evolutionary tree, which suggests not only kinship by evolutionary sequence. Cladistics, on the other hand, compares the "characters" (distinctive physiological characteristics or antecedents) of one organism with another, and adds up the shared characteristics, without specifying the lines of descent. The more matching characteristicsthat are found between two organisms, the closer is their presumed kinship.
The British Museum (Natural History) was embroiled for a decade in a bitter debate between supporters of cladistics and their tradition-minded opponents, and Dr. Colbert said the debate had affected the Museum of Natural History as well. In that debate, the cladists overwhelmed their opponents and the museum has been organized on cladistic principles.
"Cladistics has resulted in serious errors of classification," he said. "A kitten may have been born in an oven, but you can't assume, as the cladists might, that the kitten is therefore a biscuit."

HEADLINE: When the Need to Help Won't Take Early Retirement

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: ASHEVILLE, N.C.

 BODY:
GEORGE KREIDLER, 71 years old, drives a Chevy Cavalier with "A Touch of Class" on his license plate. "You have to have verve," he said.
A former linebacker for the Green Bay Packers with the shoulders to prove it, Mr. Kreidler retired six years ago after 31 years supervising the construction of oil refineries and chemical and nuclear-power plants for the Bechtel Corporation. 
 At age 65, after living all over the country and raising "five girls, one boy and a dog," he settled in Asheville. He now plays a lot of golf and bridge, but his daily routine also includes supervising house construction for the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity, singing with a group of troubadours composed of "16 men and one lovely lady," and taking part in a program at the North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement, in which he is the mentor to a young university athlete.
Founded in 1987, the center, which is on the campus of the University of North Carolina in the gentle furrows of the Blue Ridge mountains, represents the "institutionalizing of an informal trend," said its director, Ronald J. Manheimer. In contrast to a more hedonistic, leisure-oriented view of retirement, the center, which is part of the university, is combining volunteerism and community service with the national movement toward retirement-age learning.
"We're looking at new roles older people are playing and new norms of what it means to be an older person," said the 47-year-old Dr. Manheimer, a philosophy professor by training whose unglamorous campus office is down the hall from the wildlife parasitology laboratory.
Many who have flocked to Asheville represent a new breed of active, independent retiree, for whom a need to help society at large is as important as personal enrichment. " 'Creative retirement' is obviously a catchy phrase," said 61-year-old Charles E. Lilien, a retired foreign service officer and former managing director of First Boston International, now active with the center.
But he added, "As a concept it's useful, because through the center we have an institutional home, an entity that serves as an armature, like a sculptor uses."
While some of its concepts might not be new, the center's comprehensive approach has attracted the attention of many educators and gerontologists. Participants, who number around 2,000 a year and find out about the center mostly by word of mouth, take part in activities that include a College for Seniors; programs that provide mentors for young people; a "leadership for seniors" program that enlists retirees to tutor elementary and high school students; off-campus reading discussion groups, and an annual Senior Wellness Day offering everything from health screening to mall-walking.
Participants share a commitment to social responsibility and the idea that older students "can also be leaders," Dr. Manheimer said. Most of the current crop moved to the region before the center's founding. Although many had audited courses and had volunteered for civic causes, "finding the paths to these roles isn't always easy," he said.
Mr. Kreidler, for example, said the opportunity to counsel a young college athlete about his academic performance and career direction "just tickled me."
"If I've helped some young fellow get associated in life," he said, "I've made my life more full."
"We knew about beer and women," he added, referring to his own college days. "There were many times if someone had squared me up I would have gotten more out of college."
The center's existence reflects broad social and demographic trends, said Harry Moody, the deputy director of the Brookdale Center on Aging at Hunter College in New York. "The notion of creative retirement is bubbling up from the grass roots," he said. "Many options held out to older people view life as a big playpen, but the unfortunate truth is they don't necessarily inspire a purpose in life."
Cathy Ventura-Merkel, a senior education specialist for the American Association of Retired Persons, said older people are increasingly interested in "sharing their wisdom, not retiring from life."
There are more retirees nowadays, and they are better educated: the older population is healthier, the number of people taking early retirement is rising, and their median educational level is going up -- to 12.1 years in 1988, as against 8.7 years in 1970. In 1989, people reaching age 65 could expect to live an average of 17 years longer. The numbers will reach an apex between the years 2010 and 2030, when members of the baby-boom generation turn 65, Ms. Ventura-Merkel said.
Until fairly recently in history, retirement was considered a "brief period of life that only a fraction of the population would experience," said Ken Dychtwald, the chairman and chief executive of Agewave Inc., a market research and consulting concern in Emeryville, Calif. But now, older Americans can expect to spend 20 to 25 percent of their lives retired.
Among the first generation of long-lived retirees, this period was symbolized by leisure, by verdant freshly mowed communities that suggested, Mr. Dychtwald said, "recreationland instead of Disneyland." But values are being reappraised, he said: "The new vision of retirement intermingles work, play, learning and service."
That intermingling was on display in Asheville during a cookie and decaffeinated-coffee break in a bioethics class at the College for Seniors in Owen Hall, when the students -- among them an auto dealer, a nurse, a chemist, an English teacher, three physicists, two doctors, an insurance executive and two clergymen, all retired -- began a noisy debate over whether there should be a market in human body parts.
College classes are taught and attended by the retirees, who pay a fee of $80 a semester. The College for Seniors is one of the center's approaches to what Dr. Manheimer called "imaginative pathfinding." There are more than 130 such institutes for retirement-age students across the country.
The morning also saw 19-year-old Paige McKenzie -- a Phil Collins fan and physics major -- huddled over a spectrometer with her 66-year-old mentor, Edward Schurtz, who has a predilection for baggy sweatshirts, bridge games and classical music.
Miss McKenzie was not sure at first what to make of her older tutor, a retired Du Pont chemical engineer with a Ph.D. degree. And he was not sure what to make of her, since "when I went to school you didn't find young women majoring in physics."
But this "intergenerational research team," as the school calls it, has a dual mission. Mr. Schurtz is getting back into scientific research, while Miss McKenzie gets the benefit of his years at Du Pont and the message, he said, that "she's not alone."
The center operates on a yearly budget of $300,000 to $400,000, about a third of it from the state and the rest from grants and membership fees. Currently it is wrestling with several problems, like how to keep the retirees involved in the program as they age and lose some mobility. There is also the question of how to reach out to the region's rural, less-affluent and less-educated population. This year the center sponsored a conference about how similar programs might be set up elsewhere.
The center's founding was an acknowledgement of the significant economic and social contributions of the region's relatively privileged retired "amenity migrants," who have long been drawn to western North Carolina's climate, mountains and cultural milieu. The new immigrants are well educated and affluent, spending an average of $16,791 a year in routine purchases and doing volunteer work for an average of 7.4 hours a week, according to a recent study by the center financed by the Appalachian Regional Commission, an economic-development agency.
The volunteerism is not solely altruistic. Evelyn Smith, 64, taught kindergarten and nursery school in private schools in Montgomery County in Maryland for 20 years. She said that when she was approached by center volunteers about tutoring at a public school in Asheville, William Randolph Elementary, she was prompted to do it "because I'm concerned about inequality in our schools."
But there were other motivations. "It makes me feel youthful," she said of helping 7-year-old Kita Banner with her reading. "I'm not doing it to be goody two-shoes."
"Teaching is something I know I can do," she added. "It's nice to be able to do the thing you're good at."
Long on life experience, center participants like Mrs. Smith seem attuned to what makes their generation special. When asked his qualifications for tutoring grade-school students, Marcus D. Beck, who taught school for 21 years after working as a locomotive engineer, listed his job experience on the application. Then he added a P.S.:
"I have my act together."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 4, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Home Section on Thursday about the North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement referred incorrectly to a participant, George Kreidler. He was a blocking back for the Green Bay Packers in the 1940 exhibition season, and later played with the team's farm club. He was not a linebacker.

HEADLINE: Architects Show How to Set a Grand Table

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
NINE years ago Nan Swid and Addie Powell went into business "to design functional, mass-produced objects for the home by well-known architects," in Mrs. Powell's words. Now, after proving that a pitcher designed by Richard Meier can be a suitable vehicle for Kool-Aid, the two women are about to introduce the Architects' Collection, a limited-edition series of household items that happen to cost $5,000 to $35,000. 
 The collection goes on display Tuesday at the SwidPowell showroom in Manhattan (213 East 49th Street) and the partners are a bit nervous about their latest endeavor. "After all," Mrs. Powell asked, "who does these things in a recession?"
They do.
And to top it all off, on Saturday they are celebrating the publication of "SwidPowell: Objects by Architects" ( Rizzoli , $35), a kind of family album of the first steps of their progeny, at the Rizzoli Bookstore on West 57th Street in Manhattan. Several of their famous architect friends will join them to autograph the new volumes.
All the goings-on recall the days when the partners were starting out on their adventure of bringing architects' designs to every dining-room table. Until 1982, both worked at Knoll International, the modern-furniture company. Mrs. Swid, whose husband, Stephen, was Knoll's co-chairman from 1978 to 1986, was a design director in product development and Mrs. Powell a vice president in sales.
"At the time," Mrs. Swid said, "it seemed that all design was coming out of Europe and Japan. We felt this generation of architects could do it, too."
The fact that some of the top architects of the day also happened to be good friends made it all the more congenial. The fledgling partners gathered a group that included Joseph Paul d'Urso, Stanley Tigerman, Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel, Robert A. M. Stern and Mr. Meier in a private room at the Four Seasons, a favorite watering hole.
"Philip Johnson was there as everyone's leader," Mrs. Swid said. "After lunch, everyone went back to their drawing boards."
No design fees were to be paid to the architects; the architects would get royalties from the sale of their products. In what seemed less time than it takes to get most architectural jobs out to bid, "we found we were in a real business," Mrs. Swid said. "It's called tabletop."
After the initial collection appeared in 1984, including 18 dinner plates that retailed for $50 to $80 each, it was on to gift wares: a $125 cookie jar in the shape of a little building by Mr. Tigerman; a Meier key ring and money clip ($60 each) and a baby collection. They have sold more than 25,000 five-piece place settings ($190 each) of Gwathmey Siegel's black-and-white Tuxedo dinnerware and introduced children's versions -- pink for girls, blue for boys.
Now, instead of marrying architects' visions to mass-production methods, the partners have given the designers an opportunity to do whatever they want.
"Think of it as fashion design, when the designer comes out with the extreme and fun wedding gown," Mrs. Swid said. "We asked the architects to parallel that. We gave them total creative license.
"Usually we give the architects strict guidelines," Mrs. Swid went on, "specific price points and what kinds of products they should be thinking about."
The resulting collection was made by young silversmiths and jewelers out of a king's ransom of precious materials: silver, mother-of-pearl, lapis lazuli, ebony and onyx. This time nobody told Mr. Tigerman to design a fluted sterling silver tureen with wing-shaped handles and feet made of rose quartz spheres (limited to 20 at $30,000 each).
Nor was Frank Gehry discouraged about the high price of lead crystal goblets in the shape of fish, balanced on asymmetrical bases (250 sets of six glasses are planned at $5,000 a set). "One of the most difficult," said Marc Hacker vice president of design and development at SwidPowell. "The base is cast glass, the bowl hand blown. The problem was how to marry the two."
Nor was Robert Venturi's centerpiece a piece of cake. The sterling silver tripod holding a porcelain sphere adorned with Matisse-like decorations ($20,000 each, edition of 20) was "extraordinarily difficult," Mr. Hacker said. "It looks pretty simple, but it was like trying to send someone to Mars."
Peter Eisenman's 10-candle candelabrum -- an intricate interlocking structure of L-shaped black polished chrome elements (an edition of five at $15,000 apiece) -- must have been an engineering feat, while George Sowden's sterling-silver and black-marble bowl (an edition of 20, at $12,000 each) offers a deceptively simple variation on the paper doily.
While most of the pieces reflect postmodernism, the candelabrum by David Palterer ( 25 at $7,500 each) seems to hark back to a more fanciful era. It is described in the SwidPowell catalogue as "a fluted column of Medici marble resting on a gold-plated disc supporting a gilded bronze casting of a Mount Sinai twig."
Then there is Mr. Stern's contribution, described in the catalogue as: "A sterling silver ice bucket with eight columns supporting a circular beam with triglyph motifs. The lid has a radiating tile pattern edged with a sea scroll and is capped with an urn supporting a gold flame finial. The columns sit on a stepped base and surround a drum of etched cobalt blue glass."
Or, if you care, it looks just like the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens. Only 20 are to be made, at $20,000 each.
"We've already gotten calls from Japan," Mrs. Powell said. "But the most fun will be the first sale."
Mrs. Swid is already looking ahead to the day when her company completely takes over its small building in the group of town houses known as Amster Yard. "That's when we'll be the House of SwidPowell," she said. "Dior will have nothing on us."

Two hundred and fifty sets of Frank Gehry's fish-shaped goblet ($5,000 for a set of six) are planned. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Changes Don't Improve College Entrance Test

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The revisions to the Scholastic Aptitude Test that go into effect in spring 1994 (front page, Nov. 1) further discredit the College Board as a responsible guardian for the S.A.T. The S.A.T. under the College Board has always measured, and will continue to measure, not a person's aptitude for success in college, but an individual's ability to perform well on a poorly designed test. 
 The essay section of the revised test, for example, will be part of the verbal section graded on a 200-point to 800-point scale. I am curious as to how the Educational Testing Service plans to assign an intrinsic value to an essay written in 20 minutes by a teen-ager in a highly stressful situation. I am skeptical of the company's claims that it can effectively categorize the writing skills of prospective college students, many of whom might find it difficult to write something profound on a subject in which they have no interest.
The credibility the College Board seeks in assigning David Gardner, president of the University of California, to head the panel that reviewed the changes vanishes when one considers that the State of California threatened to stop using the S.A.T. if the proposed essay section was mandatory, rather than optional.
Another strange tactic to improve the S.A.T. can be found in the revised math section. If one of the College Board's goals is to make the test less culturally and economically biased, why allow calculators? Will the Educational Testing Service supply calculators to children who cannot afford one or to children who have not been coached to bring one?
The S.A.T. is obsolete. A test that has made references to such concepts as royalties and dividends in the verbal section is not culturally unbiased. The best way for colleges and universities to evaluate their applicants is through transcripts, recommendations and achievement tests for specific areas of knowledge, such as foreign languages, history, physics.
Although many colleges profess to downplay S.A.T. scores in their admissions, a great number of students are accepted into highly competitive schools because of S.A.T. scores, and many other students are rejected because of S.A.T. scores.
The only group that stands to benefit from S.A.T. revisions are the coaching services that prey on fears of parents that secondary schools will not prepare their children for the S.A.T.

HEADLINE: Keeping Commodities Exchanges in New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The decision of the commodities exchanges to remain in New York City (news article, Nov. 7) and expand their work forces demonstrates the importance of city-state action when employers are reconsidering their commitments.
This victory for New York also proves that public incentive programs count when our local economy's competitiveness is tested. Mayor David N. Dinkins and the Urban Development Corporation chairman, Vincent Tese, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's representative, and Deputy Mayor Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero led a team that designed an incentive package attractive enough to keep the exchanges from accepting a somewhat larger offer from Jersey City, but prudent enough to make New York a big net gainer in jobs and taxes.
The state-city coalition saved us an industry that contributes $1.3 billion a year in salaries, goods and services to our community; employs 11,700 men and women, and generates $164 million in revenue annually for City Hall and Albany. The $138 million in benefits to the exchanges provided by our municipal and state governments is a sound investment that will be repaid to the public treasury many times over.
No less significant, Mayor Dinkins, Mr. Tese, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero and their colleagues have reinforced the city's standing as the country's financial capital. For all this, they deserve every New Yorker's congratulations and gratitude.

HEADLINE: Governador Valadares Journal;
You Might Say, This Is the Town Uncle Sam Built

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GOVERNADOR VALADARES, Brazil

 BODY:
In the vast, arid interior of Minas Gerais State rises a tidy, thriving city that residents call "Brazil's best American town."
Lacking any visible source of income other than ranching, Governador Valadares is sprouting high-rise apartment buildings. The tallest, with an Art Deco motif, is called the Empire State Building. Around the central square, teen-age girls shop for outfits at Benetton. Boys sit on park benches, reading Mad magazine in Portuguese. 
 When money exchange shops started to outnumber tractor dealerships, locals knew a fundamental change had taken place. "Almost all the families here now have a relative in the United States," said Ilca Quirino dos Santos, surveying her neighborhood from her veranda.
The sound of hammering emerged from the shell of a building next door. A two-story house for her son, Carlos Alberto, was being built with weekly remittances from his job washing dishes in a Boston restaurant.
 
Unbroken Flow of Emigrants
 The lure of working illegally in the United States, traditionally associated with Mexico and the Caribbean, has reached down to Brazil, with 153 million people South America's most populous nation.
Disillusioned after a decade of economic stagnation, inflation and politicians' unfulfilled promises, Brazilians are migrating north in a flow unbroken by the inauguration this year of Fernando Collor de Mello, a President who promises a "new Brazil."
Although no reliable figures are available, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians are thought to be working in the United States. Historically, those most prone to emigration are residents of this city of 250,000 people.
The United States connection dates from World War II, when American planes took off regularly from here carrying mica, then an essential material for making radios. In return, the American Government helped to combat malaria and to build the town's water and sewage system. After the war, American businessmen started coming here as the city became a trading center for semiprecious stones.
America "was always something palpable," said Lana Mara de Castro Siman, a regional historian.
 
A Nest Egg Is the Aim
 In the 1960's, unemployment spread after loggers cut down all the tropical forest around here. Young men started making the 10-hour bus trip to Rio de Janeiro, the first step in the journey to the United States.
"The Brazilian is not an emigrant -- he is generally earning a nest egg for life in Brazil," said Jose Victor Bicalho, a psychiatrist here.
Fascinated by the exodus, Mr. Bicalho traveled in 1989 to Framingham, Mass., where an estimated 6,000 Brazilians work. Supporting himself by washing dishes in a steak house and pressing clothes in a dry cleaner's, he studied the emigrants.
The profile that emerged was of a single man under 35 years of age with a high-school education or less. Virtually all of the group surveyed said they planned to return to Brazil within three years.
Eighty percent said they shared an apartment with five or more people to save money and 92 percent said they spent less than $300 a month on rent, food and transport. Mr. Bicalho found that Brazilians most commonly worked as dishwashers, busboys, hotel maids, gardeners, factory workers and supermarket checkout clerks. But with the United States enjoying a per capita income 10 times that of Brazil, the last in Boston are the first in Governador Valadares.
Livio Rodrigues Gomes, a cook's helper in Framingham, is the owner of Livio's bar here, on the second floor of the city bus station. "It is very hard in Brazil to earn any real money," Mr. Gomes said shortly after returning from a two-year stint in a Framingham steakhouse.
With his savings, he put a new floor in his house here, bought a $6,000 station wagon, spent $3,000 on a medical operation for one daughter and paid for a $3,000 wedding for another. Over all, the estimated 10,000 Valadarenses living in the United States are believed to send home more than $20 million a year.
 
The Money Goes for Cows
 The dos Santos household uses a classic hedge of rural Brazil against inflation -- all surplus remittances are invested in cows.
"He earns $800 a week and sends home $400 a week," Mrs. dos Santos said, leafing through an album containing photos of Carlos Alberto in New England. Before going there last year, he earned $25 a week helping his father drive a milk truck here.
Claudia dos Santos, his 22-year-old sister, exclaimed, "I would give anything to go the United States."
But Miss dos Santos, like many residents here, has run into a brick wall at the United States Consulate in Rio de Janeiro. Consular officials who issue visas for this part of Brazil say that the overall refusal rate has averaged 19 percent over the last three years. But travel agents here, where several agencies have closed in recent months, charge that the consulate routinely denies most visa applications from residents of "Brazil's American town."

HEADLINE: PAKISTANI OFFERS ATOM ISSUE TALKS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said today that he was ready to open talks with Washington on Pakistan's nuclear program, the central issue in what officials here call Pakistan's most serious crisis in relations with the United States in more than three decades.
But the new Prime Minister added that his Government, elected on a platform of greater economic self-reliance for Pakistan, is prepared to live with the consequences if negotiations, scheduled to begin next Thursday, fail. 
 Mr. Sharif took office on Nov. 6, a month after all aid to Pakistan was suspended by the United States Congress because of developments in Islamabad's nuclear program.
He said in an interview today that "there are certain conditions that we cannot accept."
"We've got to live honorably," he said. "Our self-respect is very dear to us." He did not elaborate.
 
Advances in Arms Program
 American officials say advances in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program in early 1990, apparently in response to fears of a possible war with India over Kashmir, were clearly unacceptable under American laws governing aid to Islamabad.
Because the Bush Administration could no longer certify that Pakistan was not building a nuclear weapon or that American aid was dissuading Pakistan from building one, Congress cut off aid to Islamabad, which had been running at $500 million a year.
All major parties in Pakistan have at one time or another backed a nuclear arms program. Public opinion polls here support Islamabad's belief that it has the right to develop a nuclear deterrent so long as India, which detonated a device in 1974, has one.
Many Pakistanis are sharply critical of Congressionally mandated certification process that they say single out Pakistan not only on the nuclear issue but also on narcotics control and the general progress of democracy.
They believe that because the civil war in neighboring Afghanistan is slowly grinding toward resolution, the United States no longer needs Pakistan as a conduit for assistance to the Afghan rebels.
Mr. Sharif's Islamic Democratic Alliance made "American interference" a potent issue in its campaign for the Oct. 24 national elections, accusing the former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, of compromising national sovereignty because of her close ties to members of the American Congress.
 
Peaceful Uses Promised
 On his first full day as Prime Minister, Mr. Sharif said he would step up the country's nuclear energy program, but he stressed that the effort would be devoted exclusively to peaceful ends and that he was "against the destructive use of atomic power."
But today, speaking in his official residence, he said it would be a mistake to "mix up" the aid issue and his calls for self-reliance, which are prompted by Pakistan's long-term economic failures.
"There should be some day in our history when we learn to stand on our own," said Mr. Sharif, an industrialist and the first Prime Minister not to come from the landed aristocracy of Sind Province. His father was a self-made man.
Mr. Sharif added that since the nationalization of industries and banks in the 1970's, Pakistan has been on an economic slide that must be arrested from within its own resources.
"It has come to the point where we have been borrowing money for nondevelopment expenditures," he said. "Can any nation run like this? It is suicide."
 
Koreans Once Came for Advice
 He said that in the 1950's, South Koreans were coming to Pakistan for development advice.
"Now look at South Korea," he said, implying a contrast with Pakistan, one of Asia's poorest nations.
Mr. Sharif says that he has assigned committees to draw up plans for the privatization of industries and banks. He wants to attract investment and build up economic sectors that earn hard currency, including tourism. He wants to make Pakistanis start paying income taxes.
In the interview, he said he was framing legislation to deal with rising violence and the spread of narcotics trafficking and drug abuse. Pakistan has 1.5 million heroin addicts in a population of 114 million.
His new Minister for Narcotics Control is Raja Chandra Singh, a Hindu with no links to powerful Pakistani Muslim families, some of which are suspected of being involved in the drug trade, along with Afghan exiles.

HEADLINE: Consumers Said to Retrench As October Spending Stalls

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Consumer spending, the driving force behind eight years of economic expansion, did not budge in October, the Government said today. Analysts viewed the report as further evidence of a recession.
"The consumer has retrenched," said Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. "It clearly supports those who say we're in a recession." 
 John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said, "It looks like consumer spending will be negative in the fourth quarter," and the gross national product will decline in both the current quarter and the first three months of next year.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, was unchanged from September at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.73 trillion, the Commerce Department said. Personal incomes rose just one-tenth of 1 percent, to a $4.71 trillion rate.
The marginal increase in incomes failed to match the six-tenths of 1 percent increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index in October. It was also the smallest gain since incomes were unchanged in August 1989. Spending had posted gains each month since last May, when it was unchanged.
 
 Incomes After Taxes
 Disposable incomes, or incomes after taxes, also inched ahead one-tenth of 1 percent, down from a four-tenths of 1 percent gain the previous month. It was the smallest gain since after-tax incomes fell one-tenth of 1 percent last April.
The spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation. When adjusted, spending actually fell seven-tenths of 1 percent after a two-tenths of 1 percent increase in September. Disposable income dropped five-tenths of 1 percent, even more than the four-tenths of 1 percent declines in the previous two months.
"Consumer spending can survive a lot of things -- temporary shocks, consumer confidence, oil surprises -- but three months in a row of negative disposable income suggests that people are going to have to cut back even more," Mr. Silvia said.
Indeed, Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, noted on Wednesday that shrinking employment and the number of hours worked were causing personal income to decline while rising energy prices "are squeezing many household budgets."
"This drop in real purchasing power, along with plunging consumer sentiment, does not bode well for the near-term trends in consumer demand," he told the House Banking Committee.
It was the first look at consumer spending in the final quarter of the year. The department on Wednesday revised personal consumption in the third quarter down from a 3.6 percent annual rate in its initial report to 3.2 percent, suggesting spending was slowing toward the end of that period.
"There was weakness across the board" in October, Mr. Benz said.
A key component of the income category -- wages and salaries -- fell $9.3 billion after gaining $16.7 billion the previous month. It was the first decline since November 1989, when it dropped $7.6 billion.
Mr. Silvia said the major prop in the one-tenth of 1 percent gain in overall personal income was transfer payments like unemployment insurance and cost-of-living adjustments in the food stamp program -- both further evidence of a weak economy.
Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percent of disposable income -- edged up to 3.8 percent, from 3.6 percent in September. The September rate was the lowest since a 3.5 percent rate in January 1988 and an indication that consumers are having to dip into their savings to pay for their purchases.
Americans' savings rate for all of 1989 was 4.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Murdoch Hopes for Pact To Defer $5 Billion Debt

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The News Corporation hopes to reach an agreement with bankers by early January on a new financing agreement that would defer repayment on about $5 billion in debt for the next three years, an executive close to the company said yesterday.
The Australian-based company, headed by Rupert Murdoch, has amassed a large debt by aggressively expanding internationally into newspapers, book publishing, movie and television production, television stations and magazines. 
 But unexpectedly slow asset sales, economic weakness in Britain and Australia and a sluggish advertising market in the United States have made it tough to keep up with debt payments.
 
 Meetings With Bankers
 Mr. Murdoch has met over the last few weeks with groups of bankers in Australia, Europe and the United States to outline a proposal to consolidate some $6.5 billion in bank loans otherwise due by mid-1993.
An executive close to Mr. Murdoch, who insisted on anonymity, said yesterday that Mr. Murdoch had made the proposal because principal payments were coming due that the company would have trouble paying.
Under terms of the proposed package, only $1.4 billion in bank loans would have to be repaid by December 1993, the executive said. The company would then hope to renegotiate the remainder by early 1994, he said.
In exchange for permitting the debt deferral, the bankers would get higher rates of interest and other fees. The company has also told the bankers it plans to sell about $1 billion in assets over the next two years.
 
 $600 Million Bridge Loan
 As part of the refinancing proposal, the News Corporation would get a $600 million bridge loan that would have to be repaid in mid-1992. The bridge loan would give the company the ability to make interest payments, meet business expenses and allow extra time to arrange asset sales. "We hope to have it finalized by the end of December or early January," the executive said.
Under its existing loan agreement, the News Corporation would have had to pay back $2.4 billion in both bank loans and public debt by next June, another $1.4 billion by June 1992 and another $3 billion by June 1993.
The new agreement would require no repayments by next June, $1.2 billion including the bridge loan by June 1992 and another $800 million by June 1993, with the chance for delaying the final payment until December 1993.

HEADLINE: Clash of Free Trade and National Interest

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Free trade is wonderful, most nations agree -- except for those instances where it impinges on some powerful national interest.
The Japanese bar rice imports, for instance, to protect the politically influential rice farmers. The United States politely insisted that the Japanese voluntarily limit the number of cars they ship to the American market. The Europeans erect walls against Japanese cars, American semiconductors and American pork and beef. 
 Now, as ministers from more than 100 governments gather in Brussels next week for trade talks, such exceptions are seen to be strangling the rule of free trade.
And in recent years, some of the 105 nations that belong to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body that oversees trade, have increasingly been using safeguards, escape clauses and anti-dumping measures in GATT rules to create barriers to free trade.
Negotiators at the talks next week -- known as the Uruguay Round because the talks began in Uruguay four years ago -- will try to write rules that set clear, objective procedures to prevent countries from building such barriers.
The backbone of GATT, which was drafted in 1947, is unconditional most-favored-nation treatment. That means that any reduction of tariffs or other trade concession made by one government to another is automatically extended on a nondiscriminatory basis to all governments belonging to GATT.
In earlier rounds of negotiations during the post World War II era, GATT nations have managed to reduce tariffs by 75 percent, greatly increasing world trade. But the surge of imports has brought joblessness in some areas and other domestic problems. The protectionist exceptions to the rules were intended to provide nations with a means to address such problems -- in the short term.
One such step that has become widely used is anti-dumping measures -- duties that a government imposes when it finds that an imported product is sold for less abroad than in the nation where it is produced. This is regarded as unfair pricing, a way of building market share in foreign markets.
The biggest cases in the United States have involved steel from Europe and textiles from the Far East. In Europe, dumping charges have been levied chiefly against Japanese consumer electronics.
 
 'Protectionist Measure of Choice'
 The U.S. Council for International Business, the American affiliate of the International Chamber of Commerce, has found that in the last decade, the United States, the European Community, Canada and Australia have brought 800 dumping cases, more than half of which have led to the imposition of penalty duties.
"There is no question in my view," said Robert J. Morris, the council's senior vice president, "that anti-dumping actions have become the protectionist measure of choice."
As part of the process of forging a single European market by 1992, the European Community wants to apply restraints selectively against imports of Japanese cars and other consumer products.
But the United States and many third-world nations argue that such selective restraints open the door for collusion.
On the issue of dumping, however, the United States and the European Community are on the same side. Under pressure from domestic industries, they have submitted proposals that would make it easier to win dumping penalties.
Japan and other Asian exporters and most third-world countries, oppose such steps.
 
 Used Against West
 But some Asian nations, including South Korea, are pressing their own anti-dumping actions against Western companies.
Earlier this year, E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company and the Hoechst Celanese Corporation complained to the International Trade Commission, a Federal agency that investigates trade petitions, that South Korean chemical companies were dumping polyethylene terephthalate, a resin used to manufacture soda bottles, at prices below "fair value" in the United States market.
Now the South Korean Government has begun an investigation of Du Pont and Hoechst Celanese to determine whether they are selling below "fair value" the chemical substance polyacetal, used to make plastic goods, in the South Korean market. The South Koreans are also investigating a Japanese company, Asahi Chemicals, on the same grounds.

HEADLINE: U.S. Backs World Bank Environment Unit

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Industrial and developing countries agreed in Paris this week to establish a new fund within the World Bank devoted to protecting the global environment.
The United States, which had resisted the formation of such a fund, has now conditionally agreed, Bush Administration and bank officials said today. 
 Under the agreement, a three-year pilot program would provide $1 billion to $1.5 billion for projects like preserving tropical forests and biological diversity, protecting the marine environment and promoting the efficient use of energy to slow global warming.
Supporters of the fund said it would help build environmental concerns into the development process in the poorer countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia. Development in many if not most of these countries now emphasizes rapid industrialization, economic growth and export expansion without regard to the effect on ecological systems.
The United Nations Environmental Program and the United Nations Development Program will help oversee the new fund, a World Bank statement said today.
The United States, which had hedged on supporting the establishment of such a "green window" inside the World Bank, agreed in Paris to back it, said Leandro Coronel, a bank spokesman.
 
Bank's Record Criticized
 An Administration official who insisted on anonymity said the United States' support of the fund was a conditional compromise.
One condition, he said, was that any contributions to environmental projects beyond what the United States is now contributing to the World Bank would be made through the United States Agency for International Development rather than through the bank.
Another condition was that loans to developing countries for environmental purposes could be forgiven only if the benefits of the loan were global in scope as opposed to benefiting only the receiving nation.
Environmental groups in this country, however, strongly oppose entrusting the fund to the World Bank. They contend that the bank, despite protestations of concern for the environment, continues to back ecologically destructive projects like broad-scale lumbering operations.
Larry Williams, director of the Sierra Club's international program, said, "Environmentalists all agree that a green fund is desperately needed to help the developing countries deal with their environmental problems. We are, however, extremely concerned about the World Bank's ability to manage such a fund, given its dismal environmental record."
"We would much prefer a fund be established and operated either by another existing international agency or possibly by some new entitity," Mr. Williams said. He added that the environmental groups may soon come up with their own proposals for establishing a fund for dealing with global environmental problems.
Glenn T. Prickett, a research associate of the Natural Resources Defense Council, asserted that the World Bank "has not shown a real interest in working with environmental groups and the public in the developing countries to see that its projects in those countries are environmentally sound."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Black-Owned Media Fear Being Cut First

 BODY:
ADVERTISERS feeling the chill wind of a recession are quick to rethink where they are placing their ads, and black-owned media are worried that they will be the first to be frozen out.
Executives of black radio stations, magazines and advertising agencies say their audience is often forgotten or dismissed during a recession, largely because it is perceived as jobless, low spending and the first to clamp pocketbooks shut in economic hard times. 
 Advertisers are snipping away at their budgets while nervously harping at their media buyers to spend wisely, because they badly want to eke out the largest amount of big spenders from the least amount of placement in publications, radio and television stations.
"When the ad business suffers from a cold, black media are susceptible to pneumonia," said Bill Froelich, general sales manager for WBLS-FM, a black-owned radio station in New York. "Certain advertisers have told their agencies, 'Let's not use black radio,' and they are leaving us," he said, attributing the decision to misperceptions of black consumers. "Blacks are perceived as not having money to spend, without educational status and not in jobs, which is really not the case."
Mr. Froelich said that a recent Scarborough report that profiled WBLS listeners found that their income was on a par with other New Yorkers. He cited that as proof of value of the black marketplace.
Other black media experts agreed that large advertisers and their ad agencies seemed too quick to shift spending away from black-oriented media.
"This strategy is often used by advertisers," said Ken Smikle, president of the African American Marketing and Media Association. "People wrongly assume that a recession will hurt low-income people and that therefore all black consumers will be spending less," he said. "But blacks are not monolithic."
Mr. Smikle said that black consumers spend $263 billion a year.
Joseph Ostrow, executive vice president and worldwide media director at Foote, Cone & Belding Communications Inc. in New York, acknowledged that black media might suffer during general cutbacks in ad spending, but he maintained that in the long run they were disproportionately hurt.
"Clearly, in difficult times everyone is fair game," he said, "but what tends to happen is that you focus on target groups. I think if blacks are secondary targets, they tend to suffer."
Samuel Chisholm, president and chief executive of the Mingo Group, a black-owned advertising agency, contended that hard economic times were actually best for tapping into the black market.
"I hypothesize that the black consumer market is a bit more recession-resisitant," he said. "Because of our willingness to downgrade in the job market and the fact that we do get Government assistance, our purchases are primarily staples."
Advertisers often hope to grab black consumers through the general media, but many in advertising and publishing view that as ineffective.
"'Reaching is not selling," said Jeff Burns, vice president of the Johnson Publishing Company, which publishes Ebony magazine. "By and large, media buyers do not sit down and think of black media, and many refuse to address the fact the black consumer has the wherewithal to purchase their products. But black media is a direct invitation from the marketer to the consumer to make the purchase."
"He's absolutely right," Mr. Ostrow said. "It's really a question of mindset, and there is no question that the closer you get to where a person is coming from, the more likely" the ad will reach the intended consumer.
Mr. Froelich emphasized that black media groups could help their own cause by working to break down ignorant perceptions of black consumers. "When you speak with an agency person, what you often hear is, 'Black's don't . . .' as in: 'Black's don't drive our cars. Blacks don't eat our food.' But advertisers that we have been able to sit down with and talk to have been able to see that we have something of value."
He cited the General Foods Corporation, the Toyota Motor Corporation, and several banks as advertisers that have increased their spending. He added, "It's a long, hard process, but we're getting there."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against Yen And Mark

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar surged yesterday, jumping more than 2 percent against the Japanese yen and more than 1 percent against the German mark.
The rally, which pushed the dollar over the 1.50 level against the mark and 133 against the yen, is the first significant break upward for the dollar in months. It comes after a long decline that has pushed it to repeated lows against the mark and the Swiss franc. 
 Much of the jump yesterday, traders said, was a response to the tensions in the Middle East, which were fueled by rumors of shooting, later denied, and to reports that troops had been put on special alert status in preparation for a possible Iraqi strike. Late in the day, the United Nations Security Council, in a 12-to-2 vote, authorized the use of force against Iraq.
 
 Big Drop for Yen
 The yen, which fell the most, is also hurt from concern about the Japanese economy and from the fear of a string of business failures after the Kyowa Company announced its bankruptcy filing this week. The yen has also fallen sharply against European currencies, including the mark, reflecting a negative feeling about the currency that is temporarily overshadowing the bearish sentiment for the dollar. A prediction of an earthquake in Tokyo this weekend also unsettled the yen.
But some traders said they saw the start of a little rally for the dollar that could be supported by gulf tensions and the ususal dollar buying at the end of the year that comes with the closing of corporate books. They contended that the market had tried, but failed recently, to push the dollar even lower, and so was now considering the potential for an upward move.
"I thought the move was going to take place over a two-or-three-week period," said Robert A. White, a vice president at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. "But it all happened in one day."
He said the sharp jump reflected the thinness of the market; also, many people, still betting on a decline in the dollar, were caught short and had to scramble to buy to protect themselves from large losses.
Many investors and traders use stop-loss orders to avoid or limit their losses, and the American currency moved through several of these levels.
"Traders here are reacting less to negative news," added Andrew Smith, the executive vice chairman of London & Bishopsgate International Inc. in New York. "The market was looking for reasons to take the dollar up." He thinks many traders are misreading the signs pointing to a lower dollar.
Victor M. Polce, a vice president at Algemene Bank Nederland in New York, argued against yesterday's jump in the dollar being the sign of a new rally. "The fundamentals still point to the dollar going down," he said, adding that the bank advised its clients not to buy dollars in this atmosphere, despite the dollar's rise.
The United States economy is in decline, Mr. Polce said, and interest rates here are still expected to decline, while they are expected to stay level or rise abroad, making the dollar a less attractive investment.
In late trading, the dollar was at 133.20 yen, up from 130.10 on Wednesday and up from 127.15 the day before Thanksgiving. Against the mark, the American currency was at 1.5043, up from 1.4863 on Wednesday and from 1.4760 last Wednesday.
The pound, which closed at $1.9430, down from $1.9685, also dropped sharply against the dollar yesterday, partly because of comments from the new British Prime Minister, John Major, who said he opposed the imposition of a single currency for Europe.
The comment could be interpreted to mean that Mr. Major would not be as willing as thought to ease away from the adamant opposition of the former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to such a move.

HEADLINE: GORBACHEV TAKES BLAME FOR CRISIS

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 29

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pronounced himself and other Communists "guilty before the working class" today in a discussion of responsibility for the country's economic crisis and political paralysis.
Speaking to nearly 1,000 delegates to the 28th Moscow City Communist Party Conference, he said the Soviet Union faced increasing difficulties with food shortages, ethnic conflicts, crime and "a battle of laws that has led to a paralysis of power." 
 "The reasons," the Soviet leader said, are "errors in the actions of central organs, above all in the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and including the actions of the General Secretary and President."
Mr. Gorbachev is both President and General Secretary of the 18-million-member party.
He promised in his hourlong speech to take immediate steps to increase food supplies. He also reiterated his determination to hold the restive republics together.
 
Takes 'Personal Responsibility'

 Mr. Gorbachev said the party leadership's defeat in recent elections around the country could be attributed to its failure to address workers' concerns.
"We are guilty before the working class, I think, all of us, and I personally take responsibility," he said.
The speech appeared intended to disarm his critics, led by Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian republic, by accepting a measure of blame while vigorously asserting that the party is on the road to renewal and can solve the country's problems.
A poll published today in Izvestia indicated the number of people who "fully trust" the party fell from 27 percent in December 1989 to 14 percent in July. Izvestia gave no details on the polling.
Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin differ the best methods for achieving a market economy, and the Russian Parliament has said it has the right to pass laws superseding national ones.
Nearly all of the 15 Soviet republics have taken similar steps toward autonomy. Several have stopped shipping food outside their borders, aggravating the shortages in major cities.
 
GRAIN CURB MAY BE EASED
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 (Special to The New York Times) -- Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter said today that President Bush may ease restrictions on granting the Soviet Union credits to buy American grain this year.
"The President did indicate to me that he is prepared to have the matter fully reconsidered and I am encouraged at his willingness to do so," Mr. Yeutter told reporters after a speech to the National American Wholesale Grocers Association.
Soviet officials indicated this week that they could not fulfill their commitment under the current U.S.-U.S.S.R. Long Term Grain Agreement to buy 1.2 million tons of wheat and 600,000 tons of corn in the final quarter of 1990 without the credits.
In the past, Mr. Bush has insisted that Moscow first liberalize its emigration laws before granting agricultural credits. But Mr. Yeutter seemed to suggest the President could ask Congress to waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 trade law that bars normal tariff treatment to countries restricting people from leaving their countries. The amendment was passed to encourage the Soviet Union to allow Soviet Jews to emigrate.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Protecting Banks In a Severe Slump

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IN his meeting with bankers in Washington yesterday, President Bush sought to reinforce the message they have been getting from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan: that the Government is well aware of its responsibility not only to protect the safety and soundness of commercial banks but also to insure their economic viability.
Such a commitment now would require an overhaul of the banking regulations adopted during the Depression, when the aim was to restrict commercial banks from engaging in investment banking or other functions, which they were thought to have abused. Although Mr. Bush and Secretary Brady have not yet been specific about details, the Administration is moving to support legislation next year that would enable American banks to become competitive in the functions they can perform and where they can operate. 
 However welcome the President's message may be to large money-center banks and some regional banks, if not to thousands of smaller banks around the country, he did not directly address the most immediate and very real worries of the bankers about the state of their balance sheets and the adequacy of their capital to protect them against insolvency, now that the economy has slid into what Mr. Greenspan called a "meaningful downturn."
That sounds like a euphemism for recession, but Mr. Greenspan, who said the downturn did not come until "we moved through October and into November," wants to wait a while longer to see if the slide continues before using the R-word. Michael J. Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, has made recent statements in close agreement with Mr. Greenspan's appraisal, also refusing to call it a recession yet.
But euphemisms often quickly acquire the powerto alarm as much as the terms they seek to avoid. Some bankers and bankruptcy lawyers, frightened by the "meaningful downturn," are already using the D-word -- depression -- to describe the nation's economic prospects. It is worth noting that "recession" was coined in 1936 as a euphemism for "depression."
Euphemisms aside, everyone knows that a severe slump would impose heavy pressures on the banks and that a widespread banking crisis would seriously worsen the downturn. Hence, the real question cannot be avoided: How worrisome is the condition of the banking system? The markets, hailed for their efficiency by conservative politicians and economists alike, have spoken eloquently on the subject by marking down the values of bank securities. Both official regulators and private bank analysts have insisted that many of the largest American banks must strengthen their capital base or face excessive risks.
Thomas R. Hanley, managing director and chief bank analyst of Salomon Brothers Inc., finds that the sharp drop in bank stock prices since late August suggests "increasing investor caution about bank credit quality." He has used "harsher" and what he considers more realistic reserve requirements to judge their capital adequacy, including 10 percent reserves for highly leveraged transactions and 20 percent for commercial real estate. When he did so, he found that at 18 leading banks, reserve needs soared to $35.3 billion from $12.9 billion. Those 18 would need $14.3 billion of additional equity to meet a projected 1992 year-end capital ratio of 4 percent.
To raise $14.3 billion, the banks would have to shrink assets by $356 billion, cut dividends in half by $5.9 billion, or reduce their expenses by 10 percent a year to raise $35.5 billion over the next two and a half years -- or use some combination of these. Mr. Hanley said that 11 of the 18 biggest banks could reach their capital requirements by some combination of the three methods, but that the others could not and should seek mergers.
"Under regulatory encouragement," he said, "we believe that managements' attention will turn to mergers as the obvious alternative toward increasing" their efficiency of capital use.
Mergers may prove to be the real core of the Administration's effort to overhaul the American banking system. One side effect of consolidation, Mr. Hanley suggested, "should be to drive excess capacity out of the system, with eventual benefits for pricing flexibility." Some of the would-be merger candidates or providers of capital to hard-pressed American banks could be other banks or nonfinancial corporations, but that would also require regulatory change.
To gain time for regulatory overhaul and mergers to save the most threatened institutions, a steep decline in the economy must be prevented. This puts the primary burden on the Fed to supply sufficient reserves to keep the economy stable and shore up the banking system.
The Fed, with Administration and Congressional backing, stands ready to rescue leading banks threatened with sudden insolvency. That it can and will protect the financial system is the main reason for believing that the present unhappy condition -- the "meaningful downturn" -- will not lead to another Depression.

When Skies Are Blue, So Are the Forecasters

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 29

 BODY:
After four years of drought, with the state's reservoirs as dry as mud flats, weather forecasters here are swamped with angry calls and letters every time they say it's a beautiful day because the sun is bright and the sky is blue.
"Folks are so sensitive that you don't even dare say a day like today is 'nice,' " said Bob Haulman, the morning weatherman for KPIX-TV, the CBS affiliate in the San Francisco Bay Area. "So what do you call a day that's sunny and 60 degrees? Do you call it a terrible day? A sort-of-O.K. day? It puts limits on you." 
 Conversely, it is no longer politically correct to talk about the "threat of rain," according to Joel Bartlett, a meteorologist at the ABC station, KGO-TV. "It's the 'hope' of rain, the 'promise' of rain," Mr. Bartlett said. "You change your definitions."
The so-called rainy season has begun here, a time of wishful thinking in a state that has not seen normal precipitation since 1986, is already rationing water and is bracing for a cataclysm of Dust Bowl proportions.
While Southern California is drier, the obsession with winter storms is fiercer here in the north, where the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada feeds the rivers and reservoirs from the Oregon border to Mexico.
"The Sierra is our Federal Reserve Bank of water," Mr. Haulman said. "We've been through a recession and we're headed for a depression."
Day after day, from November to March, forecasters in the Bay Area scan satellite pictures from the National Weather Service, looking for signs that a transoceanic storm is about to slip through the weakening Pacific high pressure system and belt the North Coast.
Instead, more often than not in recent years, the approaching storms disintegrate before they reach land or get pulled in a northeasterly direction by the jet stream, drenching Oregon and Washington but leaving Northern California with no more than a dusting or a drizzle.
Then the forecasters face a different kind of wrath from friends and neighbors who demand to know why it did not rain or snow. "They think we're responsible for the weather," Mr. Bartlett said. "I tell them we're in sales, not production."
The forecasters admit they fight the impulse to tell viewers what they want to hear. "All the facts don't point in the same direction," Mr. Bartlett said, "so you have to overcome the tendency to forecast what you'd like to see happen."
Even without the wishful thinking, weather forecasting is more daunting from the West Coast than the East. Storms arrive here after crossing a vast ocean, largely untracked by the monitoring stations that follow a weather system once it reaches land.
"If a given storm is a book, we only see the title page," said Brian Hackney, another member of the weather team at KGO-TV. "We begin to write the book that the East Coast reads."
Then there is the matter of the nation's cranky geostationary weather satellites. There are supposed to be two of them, 22,300 miles above the United States. But one is broken, so the other is positioned closer to the Atlantic in the summer to track hurricanes, and nearer to the Pacific in the winter to track storms.
When there were two functioning satellites, the one relied on by California meteoroligists was positioned at 120 degrees west, near Reno. The single satellite, at this time of year, is at 90 degrees, over Indianapolis.
"We're just not seeing as much of the Pacific now," said Orman Granger, a professor of climatology at the University of California at Berkeley.
As a result, more often than not the California forecasts are plain wrong, as they have been in recent weeks.
First, in mid-November there were predictions of a storm so promising that KPIX rented a satellite truck and sent Mr. Haulman to the mountains. For two days, shivering in the cold, he broacast live from the side of Interstate 80 near Donner Pass. Only two disappointing inches of snow fell.
Again last Sunday a storm was forecast, less plausible than the last, or so KPIX thought, and so Mr. Haulman stayed home. About 10 inches of snow fell in the Sierra, with rainfall ranging from three-quarters of an inch in Kentfield in Marin County to a fifth of an inch in downtown Oakland.
Rival stations mocked KPIX for rushing to the summit at the hint of snow, but Mr. Haulman shrugged off the criticism. "This is not a puff story," he said. "This is life or death. Another year of drought and it's unthinkable what will happen."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Off in a Hectic Session

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Rumors of shooting in the Middle East, later denied, pushed down the prices of Treasury securities during a hectic session yesterday, one in which dealers had to cope with disparate pieces of information.
A report showing that personal incomes grew barely at all and that consumption was flat in October helped to push prices up early in the day. So did a speech by Richard F. Syron, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who said that the economy had fallen into recession, as well as a sharp rise in the value of the dollar. 
 "The economic data were very weak," said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank. "After adjusting for inflation, consumption was lower in October than it was during any month since May. There is no strength there at all."
 
 Syron's 'Honest' Remarks
 Analysts said Mr. Syron's remarks were markedly different from those offered by other Federal Reserve officials in recent days. On Wednesday, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told Congress that economic output was likely to decline in the fourth quarter, but he stopped short of saying the economy had moved into recession. Earlier in the week, a Fed governor, John P. LaWare, cast doubt that the economy was all that weak.
Mr. Syron's comments were "honest," said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data, a Boston bond analysis and advisory firm. "He said that given the debt overhang, a potentially big recession is out there," she said. "But the market knows we are in a recession. As a consequence, I don't know how much improvement in interest rates we are going to get on that story."
Rumors of war began early in the afternoon, and prices began to slide. Subsequent denials that fighting had broken out failed to stem the decline.
 
Waiting for Vote at U.N.
 Trading ground to a close before the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution authorizing the use of force in the Persian Gulf if Iraq does not leave Kuwait by Jan. 15. But market participants said traders had expected passage.
Nervousness about the gulf situation pushed down prices in the secondary market for Treasury securities by as much as half a point.
In late trading yesterday, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 102 27/32, down by half a point, to yield 8.48 percent. Late on Wednesday, the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.43 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 5/32, down by 10/32, to yield 8.32 percent. The two new Treasury issues auctioned earlier in the week also fell in price.
By late in the day, the 7 7/8 percent five-year notes sold on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.96 percent. And the 7 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.58 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.02 percent, down by 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. But six-month bill rates rose by a basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.01 percent.
 
 Interbank Market Calms
 Meanwhile, traders said conditions in the interbank market for short-term loans calmed considerably yesterday from the chaos of recent days.
"On Wednesday, banks were paying almost any price to lock up funds," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. "But now, they have adopted a much more cautious and careful stance."
Three-month Eurodollar deposit rates were largely unchanged at an offered rate of 8 1/2 percent.
In a delayed reaction to activity in the Eurodollar market, rates on certificates of deposit that mature in early January shot up by 40 basis points yesterday, to 9 percent.
In large measure, the scramble for money in the interbank market represents an effort by large banks to borrow money to dress up corporate balance sheets at the end of the year.
 
 Heavy Debt Issues
 Issuance of new debt in the investment-grade corporate bond market was heavy again yesterday.
Highlighting the issues priced was a $200 million offering of 35-year debentures by the Consolidated Edison Company of New York, the first taxable issue offered by the giant utility since 1974.
The 9.70 percent debentures, which mature on Dec. 1, 2025, were priced at $99.75, to yield 9.725 percent, or 1.25 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020. The securities are noncallable for five years.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the transaction. The securities are rated AA-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AA-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
 Bonds for New York Agency
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Dillon, Read & Company acted as lead manager for a negotiated sale of $175 million in securities for New York's Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.
The issue consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1992 to 2007, and two term issues that mature in 2011 and 2021.
Yields on the serial bonds range from 5.60 percent in 1992 to 7.05 percent in 2007.
The 7 percent term bond maturing in 2011 was priced to yield 7.17 percent. The 7 percent term bond maturing in 2021 was priced to yield 7.235 percent.
The securities are rated AA by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poor's.
 
 Corporate Bonds Down
 Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said prices of most issues slipped by about three-eighths of a point.
Widely quoted issues in the secondary market for tax-exempt muncipal bonds fell by about a quarter-point, traders said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week that ended on Nov. 19. The third, broadest measure, M-3, fell by $700 million.
The money report had no effect on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: G.M. CUTS OUTPUT IN THE LATEST SIGN OF ECONOMIC SLUMP

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest industrial company, said today that it was sharply cutting back its production for the rest of the year because of the weakening American economy.
The cutbacks reflect the company's pessimistic outlook for American car and truck sales, which General Motors said had been made worse by the economic uncertainty since the Persian Gulf crisis began and dwindling consumer confidence. 
 Robert C. Stempel, the General Motors chairman, said that the weaker sales would mean the company's financial performance would "decline significantly" in the fourth quarter of 1990. Auto analysts say the company would almost surely lose money during the last three months of 1990.
 
Anticipating a Recession
 "Auto makers are paring back production in anticipation of a recession-type environment," said David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan, Stanley & Company.
The announcement by General Motors came as the Commerce Department reported today that consumer spending, which fueled the country's eight-year economic expansion, showed no gain in October. [Page D1.] And in a speech today, President Bush said the gulf crisis was having a "very bad effect on our economy," although he said he thought it would not be "long-lasting." [Page D2.]
 
A Reduction of 9.3%
 General Motors said that it would build 111,000 fewer cars and trucks in North America in the fourth quarter of 1990 than the 1,186,000 it had previously planned, a decrease of 9.3 percent. Moreover, the previous production target had been shaved by 181,000 cars and trucks earlier in the year.
In the third quarter of the year, G.M. built 1,192,751 cars and trucks in North America; during the fourth quarter of 1989, G.M. built 1,289,252 vehicles.
The company's step suggested that it viewed a recent pickup in 10-day auto sales as an aberration, with the uptick mainly reflecting unusually weak sales in the period a year earlier. And G.M., like all the Detroit auto makers, is fighting to hold its share of the American market against continuing gains by Japanese rivals like the Toyota Motor Corporation, which announced this week that it would double its car-making capacity in Kentucky.
Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the Pittsburgh National Bank, termed the General Motors announcement "a pre-emptive approach," attempting to bring production into line with falling demand for cars before costly inventories of unsold vehicles pile up. In the past, Detroit auto makers often moved slowly to cut back production, acting well after the economy began to contract and aggravating their troubles when excess inventories piled up.
 
New Production Philosophy
 Since his promotion to president earlier this year, Mr. Stempel has been an advocate of a new production philosophy at G.M. of keeping inventories lean. In the past, the company had a tendency to build more vehicles than it could sell. Consequently, G.M. was often forced to offer enormous rebates to get rid of its unsold cars.
"We are determined to keep our inventories in line with demand," Mr. Stempel said.
A G.M. spokesman said the company was also reacting to its own forecast for reduced demand for cars and trucks by retail customers.
In a speech to be delivered tonight to the Fort Wayne, Ind., Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Stempel said: "Many people have been taking a 'wait and see' attitude toward major purchase decisions. For the auto industry, this has translated into weaker automotive demand."
While Mr. Stempel did not explicitly forecast a fourth-quarter financial loss for his company, he said that "the abnormally low level of North American quarterly production, an increased mix of less profitable vehicles, high marketing costs and labor and other economic cost increases not fully recovered in price are adversely impacting our fourth-quarter North American earnings and cash flow."
 
A Significant Decline
 "As a result," he continued, "G.M. expects its 1990 overall fourth-quarter financial results will decline significantly relative to our recently released third-quarter results, excluding the special charge," he said. Auto makers record revenue and profit when they sell vehicles to dealers.
Before a $2.1 billion special charge in the third quarter covering some permanent plant closings, G.M. earned $109 million, or 2 cents a share, in the period, which was extremely weak for a company whose quarterly revenue topped $30 billion.
Ronald A. Glantz, an automotive analyst for Dean Witter Securities in San Francisco, said, "No question, G.M. will be in the red in the fourth quarter." Mr. Glantz said that G.M. would post a loss of between $180 million to $240 million.
"There's no question this action makes sense," Mr. Glantz said. "If G.M. overbuilds now, it's going to have to give them away later."
 
Early Closings Possible
 G.M. declined to say which of its more than 100 plants in North America would be affected by the production cut. Since only three more weeks remain in the fourth quarter before the company shuts down for the Christmas holiday, it is likely that some assembly plants will close early. G.M. may also reduce the work shifts in some plants from two to one, cut overtime hours or reduce the speed of production.
Most auto workers are protected against layoffs by income-security provisions of G.M.'s new three-year labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union, signed in September.

HEADLINE: 3 Fiscal Monitors Press New York City on Budget

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
New York City's three official fiscal monitors said in separate reports yesterday that the city's current budget remained, at best, precariously balanced and that the Dinkins administration must take even more aggressive steps to confront much deeper troubles next year.
The state monitors -- the Financial Control Board, the Municipal Assistance Corporation and the State Comptroller's office -- while differing on details, said the city had only begun to make the hard choices about what programs to cut or consolidate, or how to improve productivity to keep the budget balanced. 
 The monitors agreed that expected cuts in state aid and any further weakening in the economy could throw the current budget out of balance, despite Mayor David N. Dinkins's recent cuts to close a gap that had been estimated at $388 million. State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said he believed the city still faced a gap of about $300 million in the fiscal year that ends on June 30.
Amplifying on their past warnings, the monitors said the problems would be even worse next year, when the city faces a projected overall shortfall between revenues and expenditures of at least $1.6 billion. The actions it has taken so far will close only about $300 million worth of that gap, the monitors said.
 
'The Real Problem'
 "The real problem the city has is they need $1.3 billion worth of ideas," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the Financial Control Board.
He said a number of the city's expectations for next year, including assumed increases in state and Federal aid and the state's taking over $165 million in local Medicaid costs, were "nonstarters" that had not been updated since July and should be abandoned.
Quentin B. Spector, executive director of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, said the question was "whether the city is acting fast enough and forcefully enough now to avoid even bigger problems later and whether the possibility of a realistic plan for next year is slipping away."
Mr. Spector's report suggested that even if $40 million in contingency cuts that have been outlined for this year's budget were not needed now, they probably would be next year, and so should be made now to save money faster. The contingencies include layoffs of teachers, closing six fire companies, cutting garbage collection and reducing parks maintenance.
"Aside from reinforcing the seriousness of the city's dilemma, making these cuts now would generate as much as $20 million of savings that would not be available if the measures were effected" next year, Mr. Spector said.
 
A Comprehensive Plan
 The city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said: "We have a comprehensive plan coming in from the agencies next week. If we have to expedite some of these actions, we'll do it." But he said the city was still waiting to judge the precise effects of cuts in state aid and other uncertainties.
City agencies are to submit by Monday their recommendations for closing next year's budget gap. Mr. Michael has ordered most agencies to outline how they would trim up to 17.5 percent of their budgets, with 10 percent in cuts and 7.5 percent in contingency cuts to be made if conditions worsen. Officials have said thousands of layoffs might be needed, and Mr. Michael has told agencies to consider shutting down nonessential programs.
Asked about the monitors' concerns, First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the administration was aware of the scope of the problems and was pursuing solutions for inclusion in its preliminary budget for the next fiscal year, to be issued in January.
"It ain't over yet," he said.
 
'More Dialogue' With State
 Mr. Proctor of the control board said the city should step up its efforts to persuade the state to relieve it of mandates that, in some instances, require certain numbers of workers to perform certain functions, and to coordinate whatever tax proposals it might make with the state, which is struggling to close huge budget gaps of its own.
"It's December now," Mr. Proctor said. "What's the strategy that's going to get you to January? Maybe it's time to have more dialogue with the state."
Mr. Proctor also suggested that the city should consider consolidating or eliminating some agencies that have duplicative functions, including a number of economic development agencies, or that might not be affordable in a time of retrenchment, including various planning, study and analytical offices or functions required under the new City Charter.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Quayle Says Delaying War Would Increase Risks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle sought today to counter Democratic lawmakers who have urged a delay in any military action against Iraq, saying that putting off war would enable Iraqi forces to tighten their grip on Kuwait and might eventually lead to greater American military casualties.
"The longer we refrain from action against Iraq, the more time Saddam Hussein has to tighten his grip on Kuwait, and the harder it may be to break that grip, if and when war comes," Mr. Quayle told students at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J. "Does patience today risk greater American casualties tomorrow?" 
 In recent weeks, the Bush Administration has cited a host of reasons for forcing a resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis, including the continuing destruction in Kuwait, the holding of hostages, threats to the economy of the United States and the world and Iraq's drive to develop nuclear weapons.
Mr. Quayle's suggestion that delaying military action might increase American casualties was a new step in the Administration's effort to win public suport for its policy.
In Congressional testimony in recent days, former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger and two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff argued that giving sanctions a year or more to work would gradually diminish Iraq's military powers.
"I believe our relative military position improves every day," Adm. William J. Crowe, the top military official during the Reagan Administration and the first year of the Bush Administration, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.
Mr. Quayle's speech -- in which he cited concern over the plight of people in Kuwait, the need to minimize American casualties and concern over Iraqi nuclear weapons program as factors that limited American patience -- came as Administration officials said President Bush planned to meet this weekend at Camp David with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the gulf situation. Officials also said today that the alert level of American and British forces in the gulf had been increased as a precaution against potential Iraqi retaliation for today's United Nations Security Council resolution. At this point, however, it appears that Baghdad seems to have settled on a strategy of outwaiting the Americans.
Mr. Quayle spoke as the Senate Armed Services Committee continued hearings on the gulf, receiving conflicting recommendations from two former Pentagon officials, a military expert and three specialists on Iraq.
Richard N. Perle, an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration, told the panel it was imperative that the United States act to reduce Iraqi's military powers and argued that the multinational coalition against Iraq might unravel if the Administration waited a year or more to see if economic sanctions would work.
 
Questions on the Aftermath
 "And what of the American role in the aftermath of a settlement in which Saddam and his military survive to fight another day?" Mr. Perle asked. "Are we to remain in Saudi Arabia with military forces adequate to assure that he will not strike again?"
Mr. Perle argued, as did former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, that any American military action should involve air strikes and not a ground assault against heavily fortified Iraqi positions.
But James Webb, Navy Secretary during the later part of the Reagan Administration, argued against early military action.
"Does anyone really believe that we can launch an attack in January, then secure, occupy and stabilize Kuwait and withdraw from Saudi Arabia by March?" Mr. Webb said, referring to arguments by Mr. Kissinger and others that the United States must taken decisive action before Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting.
"The President's mistake in sending so many troops should not be compounded by a further error in using them in a premature, unprovoked ground offensive," Mr. Webb added.
Middle East specialists later gave the panel assessments of economic sanctions.
"The progressive shutdown of Iraqi industry and deterioration in the ability to provide vital services should become evident, even to distant observers, some in the second quarter of 1991," said James A. Placke, an international-affairs consultant.
He said such a shutdown could prompt Mr. Hussein to try to negotiate a compromise with Washington but added that even then Iraq might not agree to a total withdrawl of its forces from Kuwait.

Excerpts From U.S., Kuwaiti, Iraqi and Chinese Remarks on the Resolution

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements by officials of the United States, Kuwait, Iraq and China at a meeting of the Security Council today. Remarks by the Kuwaiti, Iraqi and Chinese representatives were transcribed as they were read by United Nations translators.
 
James A. Baker 3d: Secretary of State
I would like to begin today's discussion with a quotation that I think aptly sets the context for our discussions today. The quotation is as follows:
"There is no precedent for a people being the victim of such injustice and of being at present threatened by abandonment to an aggressor. Also, there has never before been an example of any government proceeding with the systematic extermination of a nation by barbarous means in violation of the most solemn promises made to all the nations of the earth, that there should be no resort to a war of conquest and that there should not be used against innocent human beings terrible poison and harmful gases."
Those words, I think, could well have come from the Emir of Kuwait, but they do not. They were spoken instead in 1936, not in 1990; they come from Haile Selassie, the leader of Ethiopia, a man who saw his country conquered and occupied much like Kuwait has been brutalized since Aug. 2.
Sadly, colleagues, that appeal to the League of Nations fell ultimately upon deaf ears. The League's efforts to redress aggression failed and international disorder and war ensued. History has now given us another chance. With the cold war behind us, we now have the chance to build a world which was envisioned by the founders of this organization, by the founders of the United Nations.
We have the chance to make this Security Council and this United Nations true instruments for peace and for justice across the globe. We must not let the United Nations go the way of the League of Nations. We must fulfill our common vision of a peaceful and just post-cold-war world.
But if we are to do so, we must meet the threat to international peace created by Saddam Hussein's aggression. And that is why the debate that we are about to begin will, I think, rank as one of the most important in the history of the United Nations. It will surely do much to determine the future of this body.
Our aim today must be to convince Saddam Hussein that the just and humane demands of this Council, and of the international community, cannot be ignored. If Iraq does not reverse its course peacefully, then other necessary measures, including the use of force, should be authorized. We must put the choice to Saddam Hussein, in unmistakable terms.
 
Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber: Foreign Minister of Kuwait
It is true that Kuwait is a tiny state in terms of its size and population. But thanks to this massive and overwhelming international support, which is being rendered by you on the basis that justice is a true shield of peace now, we find that Kuwait is indeed a power that carries significant weight.
After all these efforts and all these resolutions and that time which is measured by my people in minutes as they continue to bleed profusely, no one really can now claim that the international community has not given to Iraq full opportunity to comply with the international will or for that matter that the world community has not offered good feasible grounds for a peaceful settlement and the elimination of the prospects for war and saving the region a real holocaust the consequences of which no one perhaps can predict except God the Almighty.
Nor can anyone really claim that the international community did not pay due attention to any forthcoming signals or really meaningful Iraqi initiatives in response to the Security Council resolutions. Channels of communication with the Iraqi regime are full of good prospects for achieving a just peaceful settlement.
Indeed there are many formulae and avenues that can indeed lead to peace. But the intransigence of the Iraqi regime is the real reason that is pushing the region at this point to a conflagration that we do not want to see. . . .
Mr. President, the Iraqi regime has sought to deflect attention from its crime against world peace by invoking issues that have nothing to do with its aggression against Kuwait, like citing the danger of the foreign presence in the region. Iraq is the first to know that it is the real reason for that presence.
It cited the question of hostages in order to create a humanitarian issue without paying due attention to their dignity. Indeed, it dragged them into its adventurous schemes in a desperate attempt to create a link between its aggression against Kuwait and its occupation and the expulsion of its people and the question of Palestine which is, alas, the first victim of its aggression.
It continues to exploit it for a cheap propaganda ploy. It calls for an Arab solution which it is the first to dissent from and reject later and then utilize that following sowing the seeds of dissention into Arab ranks.
Crude exploitation of these questions exposed the tactics of the Iraqi regime to gain time and to cause divisiveness and playing on emotions and sentiments. But the Arab world, the Islamic world and the international community found out the truth, defined the road, set the goals and demonstrated firm unity and resolve. And this is represented, Mr. President, in the draft resolution now before the Council.
 
Abdul Amir al-Anbari: Iraqi U.N. Representative
Mr. President, Iraq calls for peace. It desires peace not for us alone but for the entire Middle East region. Iraq advocates such a peace, we desire such a peace on the basis of the implementation of all Security Council resolutions in a just manner and in keeping with one standard based on justice and fairness.
Iraq has embodied this approach in the initiative declared by Mr. Saddam Hussein, the President of Iraq, on the 12th of August. He proposed an integrated and comprehensive manner for dealing with all the problems of the Middle East through the Security Council and on the basis of international law so as to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of all parties so that the peoples of the region may enjoy peace, stability, prosperity now and in the future. The American Administration has rejected this initiative before even examining it. It has imposed its refusal upon others. The problems of the Middle East are not isolated one from the other. It has common historic roots. What is tangible is of that one problem is often the cause for the eruption of other problems. It could also be the result of the vestiges of a chronic problem that remains without solution. Therefore the linkage between problems is a natural and logical method. Any separation is artificial. It disregards the organic link, the historic link and the political link between these problems.
The American refusal of this reality is prompted by suspicious motivation that has no link with the interests of the people of the Middle East. It is a premeditated policy to impose domination on the fate of a region for purely imperialist designs. It is indeed an exercise in politial hypocrisy that the American position embodies a contrary or opposite linkage with the problems of the Middle East since they call for separation at the same time they try always at procrastination to avoid the resolution of the Palestinian problem in spite of the fact that Palestinian blood is shed every day as well as the continuation unimpeded of Israeli crimes. Is this because we are Arabs? Is this because the problems of the Middle East cannot be resolved by one standard, the standard of international law and the charter, which the United States alleges to espouse?
The question which must be raised now is the following -- will the Security Council rise to the level of responsibility for imposing a just and lasting peace through an integrated approach to dealing with all the problems of the region? The response to this question constitutes your historic mission. On our part, we are continuing on our road. Peace is our goal. We work for it. We desire it. If war is imposed upon us by the United States, this will be our destiny. I wish to reaffirm to you that our people will not kneel. We will rise to the level of responsibility because we are calling for a right. We are defending this right against injustice and tyranny.
 
Qian Qichen: Foreign Minister of China
Through my visits, I feel deeply that members of the international community share common grounds on the gulf crisis on two points -- namely, they all oppose the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait, and call on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait immediately. While at the same time, they all wish to see that the gulf crisis be settled through a peaceful means. Today, when the Foreign Ministers of member states of the Security Council are meeting here once again, I believe that such common grounds are also shared by us.
Mr. President, the United Nations, as the international organization for the maintenance of peace and security, is responsible both to international security and to history. It should act with great caution and avoid taking hasty actions on such a major question as authorizing the member states to take military actions against another member state.
The reason why China has voted in favor of the previously adopted 10 relevant resolutions is that though the sanctions measures, as stipulated in those resolutions, are severe, they fall out of the domain of the use of force.
However, in this draft resolution about to be adopted, the wording "use all necessary means" is used, which in essence permits the use of military actions. This runs counter to the consistent position of the Chinese Government -- namely, to try our utmost to seek a peaceful solution. Therefore, the Chinese delegation has difficulty voting in favor of this draft resolution.
On the other hand, the gulf crisis arises as a result of the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait, and Iraq has thus far not taken any practical steps on the key question of troop withdrawal from Kuwait. In this connection, we have noted that this draft resolution has called on Iraq to fully comply with Security Council Resolution 660, and the subsequent relevant resolutions urging Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait immediately. Since China is in favor of this position, China will not cast its veto on this draft resolution either.
Mr. President, the Chinese Government still hopes the international community should maintain and strengthen its political, diplomatic and economic pressure on Iraq. As long as there is a gleam of hope for peace, efforts should be continued toward this end.
The Chinese Government wishes to once again urge Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait immediately, and Kuwait's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and legitimate Government should be restored. The Chinese Government once again calls on the international community to use all possible opportunities and ways and means and continue to try its best for a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Crisis Could Handcuff Wilson in California

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 29

 BODY:
With the state's deficit expected to rise into the billions of dollars next year, California's incoming Governor, Pete Wilson, will take office in January facing a fiscal crisis that could severely restrict his adminstration's programs.
Mr. Wilson, who must present an outline of a balanced budget on Jan. 10, three days after he takes office, did not rule out the possibility of some form of new taxes in his recent campaign for the office. 
 This week, Gov. George Deukmejian called for a special session of the Legislature in an effort to cut $1 billion to balance his final budget.
But few analysts or politicians expect significant action to be taken before January to reduce the deficit, which is expected to reach $4.3 billion in Mr. Wilson's first year in office.
 
Weakening Economy Blamed
 "Clearly, these are issues best worked out with our new Governor when he takes office," said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, a San Francisco Democrat.
In an interview today Gray Davis, the State Controller, attributed the budget gap to a weakening economy and a series of voter-imposed limits on government programs and spending. "Mr. Wilson has to confront the possibility of a tax increase during a time of a softening economy, precisely the worst time," Mr. Davis said.
But he said he foresaw the possibility of "a multiyear budget approach which would allow expected revenues in the next fiscal year to help compensate for shortfalls this year."
Although Mr. Wilson himself joined those calling for immediate action, legislative leaders, noting the political difficulties in cutting programs, expressed little enthusiasm for dealing with the departing Governor.
Indeed, even as Mr. Deukmejian held a news conference on Wednesday to call for a special session, Mr. Brown was closeted in a meeting with Mr. Wilson.
The estimate of a $4.3 billion shortfall next year came from a finance commission under the chairmanship of the State Treasurer. The commission estimated that economic growth in 1991 would be only about 5 percent, mainly because of higher gasoline prices, low consumer confidence and tightening credit.
At the same time, the commission forecast an 11 percent increase in state expenditures, including cost-of-living increases, an expanding school population and a rise in welfare and health services, along with payment of bills deferred from this year's budget.
This shortfall, combined with the need to replenish a nearly exhausted $1.3 billion budgetary reserve, could produce the greatest potential budget deficit in the state's history.
Some analysts said even that forecast by the state commission seemed overly favorable. "Frankly, it's anyone's guess right now," Mr. Davis said. "And if shooting starts in the Persian Gulf, all bets are off."
Fred Silva, fiscal adviser to David Roberti, a Los Angeles Democrat who is President pro tem of the State Senate, said, "Realistically, the gap is probably between $5 billion and $6 billion."
The total state budget for 1990-91 is $55.6 billion.
"Revenues are not growing fast enough to supply the baseline expenditure needs of the state," Mr. Silva said. "And these aren't frivolous programs and Cadillac human service delivery programs. We close hospitals in the state these days."
 
Growing Demands Expected
 Brad Williams, director of economic and revenue forecasting for the Commission on State Finance, which issued the estimate of a $4.3 billion shortfall next year, said he expected the demands for state services to grow even faster than the population in the next few years.
Part of this growth in demand comes from the current economic downturn, which makes increasing numbers of people dependent on state welfare services. But even without this, Mr. Williams said, more immigrants are using government services, more and longer prison terms are increasing the cost of prisons, and the cost of medical services are continuing to grow.
Mr. Deukmejian plans to meet with legislative leaders on Monday to talk about his call for a special session. But the Legislature is not required to take action, or even to stay in session to consider his proposals.

HEADLINE: Trying to Hold Down the Garbage Pile

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW CASTLE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Ruth Stumacher was minding her own business, doing her weekly shopping at the Gristede's here when she was caught red-handed.
No, her fingers hadn't dipped into the bin of chocolate-covered almonds. Her offense was graver: she had piled in her cart a few packs of juice boxes, each with its own straw, and all wrapped in plastic. 
 "These containers are terribly over-packaged and aren't easily recycled," Mrs. Stumacher was warned by Roberta Wiernik, a League of Women Voters member leading an "environmental shopping" tour down the aisle. The handful of women taking the tour nodded knowingly; Mrs. Stumacher, who is 66 years old, put the juice boxes back.
As garbage-disposal problems grow across the metropolitan region and much of the country, a new campaign is under way to persuade people not to produce so much trash in the first place.
 
Changing Buying Habits
 In small ways, like the League of Women Voters tours in this northern Westchester County town, as well as through county and state efforts, a new concept is being branded on the consciousness of consumers who are in many cases only starting to get the swing of recycling: pre-cycling.
Pre-cycling means being conscious of buying habits and their effect on the amount of trash going to ever-shrinking landfill space. Ways to demonstrate that awareness range from buying in bulk to avoid extravagantly packaged products to choosing recyclable containers to shunning disposable or poorly made goods, whether a diaper or a lawn chair able to endure only one season.
In December, new regulations will take effect in New York State authorizing manufacturers to use official state emblems on labels designating a product as "recycled," "reusable," or "recyclable," if the packaging meets certain standards.
Rhode Island has recently begun a similar labeling program.
In January, Suffolk County will begin a demonstration project on waste prevention that will track the shopping patterns of 50 families over three months, using a $20,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency.
"The state has set up a hierarchy of waste-management options, and the first is reduction, while the second is reuse and recycling," said David F. Newton, the recycling coordinator for the Suffolk County Department of General Services. "There's a tendency to jump over No. 1 toNo. 2. We've got to back up and realize that we're never going to get anywhere unless we first reduce our garbage."
The push to generate less garbage comes as recycling is taking hold in many places. In Westchester, for instance, residents last year recycled about 50,000 tons of solid waste, double the amount recycled in 1988. But in the same 12 months, as the population held steady, the actual amount of solid wasterose 3 percent.
"We have to recognize that by increasing our recycling but simultaneously increasing our generation, we're working against ourselves," said James J. Hogan, Westchester County's director of resource management.
The same is true at the state level. Last year, New Yorkers reused or recyled more than three million tons of all kinds of waste -- trash, yard debris, commercial waste and sewage sludge -- representing an estimated 15 percent to 20 percent of the state's total waste.
"Ten years ago, we were doing almost nothing with recycling," said Norman H. Nosenchuck, director of the State Department of Environmental Conservation's division of solid waste.
But the statewide garbage pile continues to grow, and New York's three-year-old Solid Waste Management Plan aims to halve the output of waste by 1997 through reduction strategies as well as reuse and recycling.
 
'A Greater Awareness'
 "What we're really talking about is a societal change from our immediate-gratification, throwaway mentality to a greater awareness of the consequences," Mr. Nosenchuck said. "As we insist on environmentally safe disposal and close landfills and dumpsites, the economics will drive a good part of this."
Nationally, the outlook is less certain. An estimated 180 million tons of household refuse and institutional waste were generated in 1988, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That number is expected to rise to 216 million tons in 2000. Currently, about 13 percent of the waste is being recycled, and packaging accounts for more than a third of all solid waste, a share that has grown steadily for three decades.
Solid-waste experts, environmentalists and government officials recognize that consumers are, to a large extent, at the mercy of what they find in the stores. To that end, groups and individuals in New York are trying to win legislation penalizing package-happy companies while at the same time mounting public pressure against the worst offenders.
While the imposition of a tax or fee on such products has not passed the State Legislature, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in June signed into law regulations reducing the number of heavy metals and hazardous constituents like lead, chrome and cadmium -- which are used in ink -- in packaging sold in the state.
In addition, the new state packaging regulations, going into effect Dec. 14, should bring emblems to labels by early next year. State officials hope the regulations, intended for the consumer's benefit, will serve as a carrot of sorts for manufacturers eager for the marketing appeal of the state emblems -- and willing to change their packaging ways in exchange for it.
But as environmental officials and private organizations wait for corporations to come around, they are hard at work on the other end of the equation, urging people in tours like the one here, for example, to shop only with canvas or string bags and to have their names removed from all third-class mailing lists.
"I must get one a week from Victoria's Secret," complained Lynn Pasquale, a 31-year-old mother and homemaker from Chappaqua, her 4-year-old daughter, Stephanie, squeezed in her shopping cart during the tour.
Mrs. Wiernik, the tour guide, pointed out products, most of them designed for quick cooking, that she considers extremely wasteful. There was Aunt Jemima's Pancake Express, a clear plastic bottle filled halfway with pancake mix. With water and a shake, the yield is six pancakes, an eighth of the amount in a regular-size box.
The Quaker Oats Company, which makes Pancake Express, has been criticized by environmental groups for Pancake Express, and even won the Wastemaker Award from Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey.
But Ronald G. Bottrell, a Quaker Oats spokesman, said the company intended to keep Pancake Express on the market because of competition from similar convenience products. "There are a lot of things package designers have to consider," he said. "Right now the hot button is the environment and many people are basing their purchasing decisions on that. But it may be that we can't satisfy everyone."

HEADLINE: Neediest Cases Fund Assures New Life and Home for Child

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
This year, before Anna Valentine died of AIDS, Rosa Cruz swore that she would take care of her friend's 10-year-old daughter. By the end of September, only a few days after the funeral, it appeared that the promise might be hard to keep.
The child, Desiree, had already moved into the one-room Bronx apartment where Ms. Cruz lived with her son Jesse and two cats, but city social workers threatened to take her away. 
"They were telling me I had to get a bigger place if I wanted to keep Desiree," Ms. Cruz said in an interview Wednesday night.
She knew of a two-bedroom apartment, but her welfare check had left her with no savings for a security deposit or the increased rent. Through her church, she was referred to the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York. They gave her $615, a caseworker helped her obtain additional housing benefits, and she moved into the apartment in October.
 
79th Annual Appeal
 The emergency relief was provided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which this week began its 79th annual appeal for contributions to help the sick and the poor of the New York metropolitan region. The Times pays for the campaign's overhead and gives all the money to seven charities that are to use it specifically for direct services for the needy.
The Neediest Cases money has provided shelter for homeless people, job training for the unemployed and assistance to families being torn apart by drugs and AIDS.
Ms. Cruz said she did not want to see Desiree placed with a stranger or be placed in the drug-infested housing project where an elderly and sick grandmother lives. "Anna was my girlfriend," Ms. Cruz said. "I figured that this was the least I could do for her."
The two women had hit it off from the moment they met in school eight years ago. Even though Ms. Cruz disapproved of the drugs her friend used, they had no problem finding things to talk about. They argued about The National Enquirer, compared beauty tips and traded stories about their children.
They even shared a boyfriend. When Ms. Valentine stopped seeing Desiree's father, Juan Rodriguez, Ms. Cruz went out with him, with no hard feelings.
In the last few years, as Ms. Valentine's AIDS worsened, Ms. Cruz grew worried about Desiree. She was not going to school, her hair was becoming tangled and knotted, she used "a lot of four-letter words," Ms. Cruz said.
On Wednesday night, Ms Cruz talked about the changes that have occurred.
In the last few weeks, Ms. Cruz said, Desiree has become "boy crazy." She has a crush on a neighbor. She swoons over the teen-age idols in the band New Kids on the Block. But she is still a child who loves to sing along with a tape of the music from "The Little Mermaid" and play with Barbie dolls.
Desiree is adjusting to her new life, Ms. Cruz said, and is doing better in school.
"A few weeks ago she called me 'Moms,' " Ms. Cruz said. "I asked her if she was sure that was what she wanted to call me. She said, 'Yes, you're my mom now.' "

HEADLINE: Electronic Bond Auction Founders

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
An effort to distribute a new corporate bond issue through an innovative electronic auction foundered earlier this week, when the U S West Financial Corporation chose to sell its bonds through Merrill Lynch & Company rather than Capitalink, a New York company that has been promoting the electronic system.
Capitalink, whose owners and promoters include J. P. Morgan Securities, has been trying for more than a year to find companies willing to break with tradition and sell their bonds directly and electronically to investors. 
Ordinarily, corporations sell their bonds to securities firms that act as underwriters, or middlemen.
 
 Was to Have Been New Issue
 A $100 million issue of three-year notes for U S West Financial earlier this week was the closest Capitalink has come to handling a new issue. U S West Financial asked Capitalink on Monday for an indication of what interest rate it would likely have to pay for the bonds.
Financiers involved in the deal said yesterday that Capitalink found potential buyers for the bonds, with a tentative interest rate of about 1.05 to 1.1 percentage points higher than three-year Treasury notes.
The rate was more than U S West wanted to pay, the financiers said, and 24 hours later it signed with Merrill Lynch to sell the bonds at a cost to the company of 1.04 percentage points above three-year Treasury notes.
 
 'No Firm Commitment'
 David A. Jeffrey, Capitalink's president and founder, said, "We had looked at the possibility of an auction, but there was no firm commitment to hold an auction, and no bids were ever collected."
Analysts said yesterday that when Capitalink asked investors for indications of the interest rate they would want on a new bond, the investors were likely to give a high rate, because they did not want to undercut their bargaining position.
Steven J. Rohrbach, the chief financial officer at U S West Financial, declined to comment yesterday on the financing. The company is a part of U S West, which was created in the breakup of the Bell System in 1984. Its companies serve the Rocky Mountain region and the Northwest.
 
 Others Finding It Tough
 Capitalink is not the only electronic system to encounter slow going. A new system for trading privately placed securities, called Portal and sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, has also been poorly received. Analysts say issuers and investors in that market prefer to arrange their transactions privately, without being displayed for others to see.
So far, Capitalink has had more success in finding investors willing to sign up for its system than in finding corporations willing to use it. U S West Financial was one of 19 companies that have amended prospectuses filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow for the possibility of selling bonds at an electronic auction, but none have done so.
The 140 investors who have signed up for Capitalink are investment advisers, pension funds and insurance companies.
 
 More Underwriting by Morgan
 Early last year, when J. P. Morgan Securities joined with Capitalink, officials at the Morgan unit saw the electronic auction idea as a way for a newcomer to break Wall Street firms' tight grip on the corporate bond underwriting business. The electronic would be best suited to good-quality corporations that are known to investors.
But since June 1989, when the Federal Reserve allowed the Morgan unit to underwrite corporate bonds, it has been very successful in joining the Wall Street firms, participating in about 100 new bond issues. Yesterday, for example, J. P. Morgan Securities joined Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs & Company as one of only three firms handling a $200 million bond issue of the Consolidated Edison Company of New York.
Despite its success in joining other securities firms, an official at J. P. Morgan Securities who asked not to be identified said yesterday that the firm was not withdrawing its support of Capitalink. "We still think the idea is intellectually sound, and is a sensible alternative way of distributing some kinds of bonds," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sued Over Drug to Increase Milk Output

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
A public interest group sued the Department of Agriculture today, charging that it had helped begin a million-dollar public relations campaign for an experimental drug whose safety was still being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration.
The suit was filed in Federal court here by the Foundation on Economic Trends, which is waging a national campaign against the drug, a genetically engineered growth hormone intended to increase a cow's milk production. 
 The suit contends that the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board, which was set up by Congress to help increase the consumption of dairy products, had joined the drug's manufacturers and dairy trade associations in seeking to assure the public that the product was safe.
The drug, bovine somatotropin, also known as bovine growth hormone, is currently going through the Food and Drug Administration's approval process. Federal law prohibits the promotion of a new animal drug while it is still under investigation.
Yvonne Dock, a spokeswoman for the dairy board, had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. A spokesman for the Department of Agriculture, which was named as a defendant because it oversees the dairy board, said his office had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it.
 
Issue of Safety
 An Agriculture Department spokesman, William Grigg, denied that the review process had been tainted, saying that the safety of the product to humans had already been proved. He said the effects on the cattle and the environment were still being studied. "The substances are already present in the milk we drink anyway," he said. "The amount is in the same ball park."
The pharmaceutical companies that make the drug strenously objected to the charge that they were trying to influence the drug approval process. The four chemical manufacturers -- Upjohn Company, Monsanto, the American Cyanamid Company and Eli Lilly & Company -- have spent more than $500 million on research and development of bovine growth hormone.
The hormone is the first genetically engineered drug for use on farms to go through the review process.
Surveys show as many as 80 percent of American dairy farmers are opposed to the drug because of the public reaction to hormone-treated milk.
 
Petition Is Filed
 Jeremy Rifkin, who heads the Foundation on Economic Trends, also petitioned the F.D.A. today to stop any promotion of the product by agency officials and to end the practice of putting milk into the market from cows that have been experimentally injected with the hormone.
"This is a three-year pattern of collusion," he said. "The National Dairy Board sat in meetings with the trade associations and companies and conceived of strategies to promote the hormone."
In March, letters from the National Dairy Board to concerned farmers said the group was not promoting the drug, nor would it begin an educational campaign until after the drug was approved, because to do so would violate Federal law. But documents obtained by Mr. Rifkin's foundation through a Freedom of Information Act request show that in February the board awarded a $1 million contract to a Washington public relations firm to promote the product. Mr. Rifkin made the documents available to The New York Times.

HEADLINE: Once Again Bush Says Economy Will Improve

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
After meeting with his economic advisers, President Bush reiterated his confidence today that the nation's economy would improve soon.
In a brief speech to the Association of Bank Holding Companies, meeting here this week, the President said: "We are in a period that concerns me of a sluggish economy. Some are saying 'recession,' and some are saying 'slowdown' and some are going 'downturn.' But one positive thing is that most if not all people are suggesting that whatever it is, it won't be long lasting." 
 This is the same basic position Mr. Bush has taken in speeches, news conferences and interviews for several weeks. He has not said what if anything he intended to do to try to counteract the situation.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress on Wednesday that the economy was actually shrinking. He was the first top Government official to take that position. Mr. Bush referred in passing to Mr. Greenspan's testimony, calling it "rather eloquent."
 
 Effect of the Gulf Crisis
 In his off-the-cuff remarks to the bankers, Mr. Bush broke little new ground. He made these other points:
*The Administration will offer legislation next year to overhaul "outmoded" banking regulations and allow banks to enter areas of business from which they are now barred.
*He is sympathetic to the view of some bankers that "excessive zeal" of regulators was at least partly responsible for what he called a "credit crunch." Without specifying what he had in mind, he promised to try to "relieve a little pressure" on the bankers from the regulators next year.
*While the crisis in the Persian Gulf was having "a very bad effect on our economy," the effects on the economies of Eastern Europe and third world countries had been "devastating."
 
 Impact of Regulations
 The only proposal that seems certain is one to rewrite laws enacted during the Depression that limit the capacity of banks to operate across state lines and prevent them from expanding into areas like underwriting securities, selling insurance and operating mutual funds.
"The regulatory system that served us very well, indeed, from its inception in the 30's is today, in my view, increasingly outmoded, as likely to prevent banks from staying competitive as it is to allow them to serve customers and sustain confidence in the system," the President said in his speech today.
 
 Trouble With Conservatives
 Mr. Bush met this morning with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the budget director, Richard G. Darman, along with other advisers, to discuss economic and domestic policy for next year. The White House would not say precisely what was discussed.
Before his State of the Union address and budget presentation early next year, Mr. Bush will have to resolve an apparent disagreement between Mr. Darman and some lower-level advisers with links to the conservative wing of the Republican Party.
The conservatives, who deplore the budget agreement Mr. Bush struck with Congress, have been advocating another push for a capital gains tax cut and other tax breaks that they feel would stimulate the economy. Under the new budget law, any tax cuts would have to be offset by tax increases elsewhere or by spending reductions.
Mr. Darman, who was one of the main architects of the budget deal, seems to prefer that attention be focused on how to make programs more effective within the agreed-on spending limits.

U.N. GIVES IRAQ UNTIL JAN. 15 TO RETREAT OR FACE FORCE; HUSSEIN SAYS HE WILL FIGHT

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council voted 12 to 2 with 1 abstention today to authorize the United States and its allies to expel Iraq from Kuwait by force if President Saddam Hussein does not withdraw his forces by Jan. 15.
Security Council members plan to observe "a pause of good will" until that date by taking no further actions against Iraq and concentrating on diplomatic efforts to promote a peaceful settlement. 
 But the United States and several other Council members with forces in the region warned that this 47-day respite would end abruptly if Mr. Hussein harmed any of the thousands of foreign hostages he is holding in Iraq or Kuwait or made other provocative moves.
 
12 Support Resolution
 The resolution authorizing force was supported by 12 of the Council's 15 members, including the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union, which are permanent members and have a veto over decisions.
China, the fifth permanent member, abstained rather than exercise its veto. The country's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, condemned Iraqi aggression but maintained that the Council should avoid "hasty actions" that could lead to a war with "serious consequences" for the whole world. [Excerpts from the speeches, page A10.]
Eight of the Council's 10 rotating members supported the resolution. They are Canada, Finland, Romania, Ethiopia, the Ivory Coast, Zaire, Colombia and Malaysia. Yemen, the Council's only Arab member, joined Cuba in voting against the resolution.
 
A First for China
 It was the first time China had failed to vote for a resolution against Iraq since Mr. Hussein's forces captured Kuwait on Aug. 2. The Security Council has adopted 12 resolutions against Iraq since the Persian Gulf crisis began, including measures demanding its unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait and imposing a strict economic embargo. Among the rotating members, only Yemen and Cuba have ever voted against or abstained on any of these resolutions.
The vote marked only the second time -- the Korean war was the other instance -- that the Security Council has invoked its power to sanction the use of force to counter aggression. To underscore the importance of the vote, all the Council members were represented by their Foreign Ministers, with the exception of Yemen and the Ivory Coast.
The resolution does not explicitly authorize the use of military force against Iraq, but it empowers members "to use all necessary means" to uphold previous Security Council resolutions demanding that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait.
Iraq's United Nations representative, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, called the resolution "an act of aggression" against Iraq that reflected "America's imperialistic ambitions, which have become glaringly evident, especially in our Arab region."
"If war is imposed on us, our people will not kneel," he said.
Bush Administration officials had lobbied for weeks to gain support for the resolution, and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d acted as chairman of the meeting. In an opening statement to a packed Security Council chamber, he reminded the members of the League of Nations' failure to combat aggression in the 1930's.
"History now has given us another chance. With the cold war behind us, we now have the chance to build a world which was envisioned by this organization, by the founders of the United Nations," Mr. Baker said, adding, "We must not let the United Nations go the way of the League of Nations."
 
'In Unmistakable Terms'
 "If Iraq does not reverse its course peacefully, then other necessary measures, including the use of force, should be authorized," he said. "We must put the choice to Saddam Hussein in unmistakable terms."
In his closing address, Mr. Baker said Mr. Hussein represented a threat to the stability of the whole Middle East because of "the vast arms he possesses, the weapons of mass destruction he seeks."
At a news conference after the vote, Mr. Baker was asked whether he had promised Soviet leaders to get their approval before using any force after Jan. 15. Mr. Baker strongly hinted that he had, saying Washington had made it clear to all its important coalition partners that it wanted "to keep them fully informed and to consult with them" at every stage.
 
Soviets See Turning Point
 The Soviet Union also cast the resolution as a turning point in international affairs that could lead to a more credible role for the United Nations in preserving international peace and resolving conflicts.
Saying the world is "entering a time of political maturity," the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, warned that those "who break the peace must know all available means will be used against them."
He told reporters later that Moscow was not planning to send any armed forces to the gulf despite the resolution approved today. "I'm not sure such a step would get the support of the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies, and without that we couldn't do it," Mr. Shevardnadze said, referring to the highest Soviet legislative entities.
But he warned that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had the power to send forces into action without permission from these assemblies if the lives of Soviet citizens are in danger.
"If even one Soviet citizen is harmed I cannot say what the consequences might be, but they would be very, very serious," he said.
The United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union all emphasized that the Council's members contemplated no further action against Iraq before Jan. 15. But they indicated that they would abandon such restraint if Iraq harmed any of its hostages, and they said its leaders would be held personally responsible.
They also pointedly reminded Iraq of its obligation to refrain from using chemical or biological weapons under the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which also allows nations attacked by such weapons to reply in kind.
 
Peaceful Intent Stressed
 Most of the Foreign Ministers emphasized in their statements that the resolution authorizing force was intended to promote peaceful settlement by convincing Mr. Hussein that he must give up Kuwait unconditionally.
Britain's newly reappointed Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, called it "a strong bid for peace," saying the Iraqis "may have persuaded themselves the military option was a bluff." If the measure succeeds in freeing Kuwait, he said, it would represent "a very remarkable exercise in collective security."
Many Council members have said the United Nations cannot credibly punish Iraq for its aggression against Kuwait while turning a blind eye to Israel's continued occupation of the Arab lands it seized after the 1967 war.
While saying there was no formal link between the gulf crisis and the Palestinian question, Mr. Shevardnadze said that the freeing of Kuwait should lead to "a comprehensive settlement" in the rest of the Middle East and that the five permanent Council members have "a very special role to play."
 
Cuban Accuses U.S.
 Only the Cuban Foreign Minister, Isidoro Malmierca Peoli, accused the United States of deliberately shielding Israel from Security Council pressure.
Malaysia's Foreign Minister, Abu Hassan bin Haji Omar, said he would not allow "the Palestinian problem to be shunted aside."
The resolution approved today "demands" that Iraq withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait but decides to allow it "one final opportunity" to do so "as a pause of good will."
But if Iraq does not pull out by Jan. 15, the measure authorizes the countries with forces in the gulf to "use all necessary means to uphold and implement" the previous Security Council resolutions demanding such unconditional withdrawal.
While it does not speak of military force as such, it says the Council is acting under Article 7 of the Charter, which allows the United Nations to seek to reverse aggression by military action if economic boycotts and other more peaceful means do not succeed.

HEADLINE: Car-Racing Dreams Fulfilled

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO

 BODY:
ON an island where the possession of a driver's license can sometimes carry a social stigma, it might come as a surprise that there is a place where you can race around in circles as fast and as long as you want and never have to worry about a summons or a cocktail-party slight.
The secret of such guilt-free motoring is to do it with a vehicle that's one-twenty-fourth the size of the real thing (or about two-thirds the size of your shoe) and to do it at a slot-car racing center. 
 Manhattan Raceway, which opened in June on Broadway at 19th Street, has four tracks, varying in length from 40 to 155 feet, on which to race the tiny electric cars. If you vaguely remember something similar from your childhood, that's because slot-car racing -- along with respectable billiard parlors -- is a bit of 1960's cultural flotsam that has washed ashore once more.
For a generation in the midst of its prime child-raising years, a rebirth of slot-car racing satisfies more than a craving for nostalgia. It's a new way to entertain children who have become bored with the two-dimensional world of video games. (And for a reporter who has followed auto racing for 25 years, it's a chance to experience his sport vicariously.)
As the name implies, the cars race around on eight-lane tracks, with a plastic rudder at the front of each car holding it in its respective slot -- up to a point. It's the ability to find out exactly how fast you can go around a turn without sending the car flying off the track that makes slot-car racing a challenge. Or a frustration, depending on how often you have to leave your seat, walk over to right your car, and sit down again.
"The only drawback is, they should have somebody putting the cars back on the tracks," said Norman Livingston, a 30-year-old Manhattan resident who was making his second visit to the raceway recently.
As they say with a shrug at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, that's racin'.
But it wasn't discouraging Mr. Livingston, whose idea of success was much larger than one-twenty-fourth scale. "You never know," he said, "I could be the next Tom Cruise."
His sister, Joannah, may be one of his competitors when his days of thunder arrive. "I took a career test, and they said I should be a race-car driver," she said. For the time being, she works for the New York City Board of Education.
Both of them said they had owned slot cars as children, during the hobby's birth in the late 1960's.
"A lot of people who come here say the same thing," said David Da Silva, a 32-year-old real-estate entrepreneur in Manhattan who, with Pat Gray, a New Jersey car salesman, is co-owner of Manhattan Raceway. "It brings back memories."
"Some people even have 25-year-old cars," he said.
On a recent Saturday night, Jeff Siedenberg, Jody Schwarz and David Strumpf sat at a table amid the whine of tiny electric motors, waiting for some track time. (On weekend nights, the wait can be as long as 45 minutes.) "We just had some time to kill between things," said Mr. Siedenberg, a 40-year-old economic professor. "It was something I couldn't afford as a kid, and I can now."
"This is the only chance I get to have a car," added Mr. Strumpf, a 36-year-old computer specialist. "You can afford to park these."
"This is better than an after-dinner drink," said J. P. Shields of Manhasset, L.I., who was there with Denise Guarino of Port Washington.
Indeed, an unscientific sampling of raceway customers showed that many were there in the limbo between dinner and a movie (there is a multi-screen theater across Broadway).
What they find is a diversion somewhere between video games and driving a radio-controlled model car.
Unlike the latter, slot cars don't require you to steer, which makes them a lot less frustrating for young children and klutzy adults. The only thing you control is the car's speed, by pulling a trigger on a pistol-grip controller that plugs into a console at each track.
After about a half-hour of yelling "Blue, blue," or "That's in the green" to tell any unfortunate spectator which of the color-coded lanes your car belongs in, your trigger finger should be sensitive enough to keep the car on the track long enough to actually have a race with the person next to you, which is when you discover the advantage over video games.
"The difference between doing this and playing Nintendo is this is more interactive," Mr. Da Silva said. "It's more social."
 
Cappuccino, Too
 Although Manhattan Raceway isn't the only slot-car racing center in the metropolitan area (there are centers in Westchester County and Long Island), it is the only one in New York City, and the atmosphere is more Monaco than dragstrip. Television monitors show videotapes of auto races, and the walls are decorated with racing posters and prints. It also brings a singularly cosmopolitan slant to the hobby: if you like, you can sip a cappuccino or espresso as you race.
If your original slot cars went to Mom's Auto Wreckers years ago, you can still race. Rental of a car and control is $1 for 15 minutes, $2 for a half-hour and $3 for an hour. No damage waivers are necessary.
Added to that fee is track time, at $2.50 to $3 for 15 minutes, or $7 to $9 an hour, depending on the track.
The raceway's longest and most challenging track, the King, is available only to customers with their own cars. Only one other track poses more than the most rudimentary challenge, so anyone who goes there more than twice (with or without children) is going to want to own a car.
Manhattan Raceway sells stripped-down models from $19.50 to $27.50, with a controller costing $22.50. A call to a few hobby shops might find a better deal. At the Ferrari end of the scale, a hand-built racer costs $225.
As they say in the pits at Daytona, if you want to make a small fortune in auto racing, start with a big one.
Manhattan Raceway, 893 Broadway, is open from noon to 2 A.M. Monday through Saturday, and noon to midnight Sunday. Telephone: 473-5095.
 
Slot-Car Addresses
 If you are serious about slot-car racing, or live in Westchester County and want to try it, Elmsford Raceway at 380 North Saw Mill River Road in Elmsford, N.Y., is, like stock-car racing's Southern 500, the granddaddy of them all.
Opened in 1966 by Luis Del Rosario Jr., the three-track operation has survived the ebbs and flows of the hobby's popularity and is still run by Mr. Del Rosario and his wife, Barbara.
"This has a definite parallel to the way people react to real cars as a sport and a hobby," Mr. Del Rosario said in tracing the cycles in his business.
Now he is starting to see some of his original customers again. "They're bringing their kids and getting back into it themselves," he said. "Which makes me feel old, of course."
Elmsford's prime attraction is the 220-foot-long Nuvolari track, named after Tazio Nuvolari, the famous Italian driver of the 1930's who was known as the Flying Mantuan. The track, which was the site of slot-car racing's international Olympiad in 1984, includes a steeply banked turn and tight switchback corner.
Even the simplest track, a figure-eight, is long enough to offer a little challenge. A half-hour of track time, including a rental car and controller, is $4 or $5. If you have your own car, an hour of track time is $7. The phone number is (914) 592-5375, and the hours are noon to 11 P.M. Monday to Friday, 11 A.M. to 11 P.M. Saturday, and noon to 9 P.M. Sunday.
On Long Island, there are two tracks run by Islip Miniature Speedway. One is at 310 Main Street in Holbrook (516-471-4986) and the other at 3209 Horse Block Road in Medford (516-696-6967). The hours are noon to 10 P.M. Monday through Saturday, and noon to 9 P.M. Sunday. With a rental, track time costs $3 for 15 minutes, $5.50 for a half-hour and $9.75 for an hour. The longest of the four tracks at Medford is 155 feet and the longer of the two Holbrook tracks is 130 feet.
A more detailed list of tracks can be found in each issue of Scale Auto Racing magazine, which has offices at 2634 Robert Road, Aransas Pass, Tex. 78336.

HEADLINE: Guatemalan Military Makes Elections a Hoax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your news article on Guatemala's election (Nov. 11) is another example of uncritical devotion to the United States Government interpretation of events in Guatemala. The election is called "a significant step for the United States-backed effort to end a tradition of military dictatorship and build a working democratic system."
Then you report that the only voices allowed to be heard without fear of military retribution are those of the right and far right. I have just been to Guatemala and have witnessed the hollowness of the political debate, where the most significant issues of land reform and the military's fascist control of society are never mentioned. It requires a willing suspension of disbelief to declare the process democratic. You accept the United States Government's premise that holding an election, even if it is a life-threatening proposition for anyone left of the military to participate in the process, is proof of democratic reform and a vindication of United States policy.
The United States continues to finance the army despite its participation in suppressing and killing. The most consistent theme one hears in speaking to average Guatemalans is resignation about politics. You attribute this to impatience with the parliamentary process. But no matter who wins the election, until the army is drastically reformed and reduced, electoral politics will be a cruel game perpetrated on the people of Guatemala to assuage the consciences of those who supply arms and money to the army. As long as advocates of land reform and economic reform risk their lives just to speak out, you can't call what is happening in Guatemala a victory for democracy.
To rationalize the army's control of real power in the country as "the only bureaucracy that works" is a cynical approach to Guatemala's political landscape. The same efficiency is employed in the ruthless suppression of the people.

HEADLINE: Job Applicant's Lot Isn't Happy Either

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Editors Wanted; English Helpful," Ken Jacobson's commentary on the quality of editorial job applicants, based on responses to an advertisement for his publication, Metals Week (Op-Ed, Nov. 14), is unfair.
Lapses in grammar and spelling are, of course, unacceptable, but Mr. Jacobson should consider what the more competent applicant is up against.
Too many classified advertisements provide an inadequate description of the position offered, leaving the applicant to guess the employer's needs. Even then, promoting one's own virtues does not always come easily, especially if the individual is young. Small successes are invariably magnified and, very often, enthusiasm is the would-be employee's single greatest asset.
Most young job applicants understand perfectly well that their cover letter and resume should reflect their professionalism. This is why many cover letters unintentionally end up sounding pompous. Finding a job is one of the most frustrating things in life, and a cover letter may be as much an expression of desperation as an indication of potential.
In the future, it may be easier for applicants simply to tell the truth: "Look, I need a job, and your $21,000-a-year position seems just about as good as the next."

HEADLINE: Guatemalan Military Makes Elections a Hoax;
Voice of the People

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Even if we accepted your anti democratic philosophy -- surprisingly similar to your arguments for Gov. Jim Florio's antidemocratic New Jersey tax plan -- that Guatemalans are incapable of making the right decisions at the polls, your logic in "Democracy Fails in Guatemala" (editorial, Nov. 14) is incorrect.
You agree that the outgoing Christian Democratic President, Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, failed miserably to:
(1) control the corrupt and murderous army, and
(2) straighten out an unfair, mercantilist economic system.
Not only do I agree with you, but the Guatemalan voters agree, too. The Christian Democratic candidate (as corrupt and ill suited for the job as Mr. Cerezo) lost badly. The candidates who came in first and second, and face a January runoff, vowed:
(1) to clean up the army and get it under civilian control through the force of their leadership, and
(2) to remove statist privileges in the Guatemalan economy that have favored only the well-connected oligarchs because of its highly regulated structure.
Perhaps their economic programs were not as socialistic as you -- judging by your absurd recommendations for economic growth -- would like. But the Guatemalan people know far better than editorialists sitting in their clean offices in New York what is wrong with the Guatemalan economy. And they voted for the men they think will do the best job in cleaning it up.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
An Architect of the Reagan Vision Plunges Into Inquiry on Race and I.Q.

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
One thing Charles Murray knows how to do is generate controversy. In 1984, his book "Losing Ground" argued that social programs did more harm than good and proposed, as "a thought experiment," that the country simply abolish them.
A visitor to White House offices recalls a Reagan aide brandishing the book aloft as a sort of Exhibit A when advocating program cuts. The President himself cited it in attacks on the welfare system. Liberal academics combed through census tapes seeking to discredit his thesis. 
 That may not be Mr. Murray's last uproar. Now at the American Enterprise Institute, a public policy research center here, he sits at an important crossroads of ideas and politics. Collaborating with Richard Herrnstein, a Harvard psychologist who has in the past been in the center of disputes about heredity and intelligence, he is asking one of the most explosive questions a social scientist can pose: whether there are differences in intelligence between blacks and whites that help explain differences in their economic and social standing.
 
Departure From Institute
 "There is no way to exaggerate the sensitivity of the issues we're involved in," said Mr. Murray, who argues that the issues are too complex, and his views still too subject to change, for him to publicly discuss them.
Not only is the pressure on Mr. Murray in the personal sense. His decision to wade into the subject has put him in the middle of think-tank politics. Though Mr. Murray was by far the best-known scholar at the Manhattan Institute in New York City, the conservative policy research group was reluctant to follow him into this thicket, and he left, after an eight-year association, taking with him an annual foundation grant of about $100,000 for salary, overhead and other expenses.
Other influential research institutes had reservations as well. One question is whether the enterprise institute is risking a damaging controversy, or instead adding a prominent scholar who will help it be as central to intellectual activity in the 1990's as it was in the early days of the Reagan era.
Christopher DeMuth, who worked on deregulation in the Reagan White House and is now president of the enterprise institute, says he decided to recruit Mr. Murray on the basis of his past work, without studying the details of his current project.
"I think he's a very bright social scientist who does very good work," he said.
 
Faith in Murray's Work
 As for the work on race and intelligence, "people have written responsibly and irresponsibly in the area," said Mr. DeMuth, adding that he had faith that Mr. Murray's product would fit the former description.
But many of Mr. Murray's colleagues, in Washington and elsewhere, describe themselves as torn between their regard for his intellectual integrity and their concern over where such research has led in the past. Some also worry that his concentration now on I.Q. tests is leading him away from the nonracial precepts of "Losing Ground."
"So Charles, are you a racist?" asked an editor who has published Mr. Murray's work, only half-jokingly, when the two of them met for lunch recently.
"I've started to keep a journal, because people do say that a lot," Mr. Murray said.
Defending the work in an interview, Mr. Murray said the discussion of racial differences would play only a small role in a book that would take a much broader look at the way individual characteristics, like intelligence, patience and diligence, affect success and failure.
Asked if he had concluded that differences in intelligence helped to explain the relative standings of black people and white people in America, he said: "Read the book. There is absolutely no simple answer I can give you."
William Hammett, president of the Manhattan Institute, said he thought Mr. Murray had little to gain in terms of useful knowledge as a result of his inquiry and much to lose in terms of adverse publicity.
Asked to articulate his objection, Mr. Hammett had difficulty choosing his words, saying he feared headlines like "White Scholar Suggests Genetic Inferiority," but assuring that Mr. Murray "would never fall into that."
"When you say this stuff it just sounds bad," he said. "I have to rethink this damn thing."
 
Better to Work Elsewhere
 While Mr. Murray could have stayed at the institute, he said, they both agreed it would be better if he pursued such work elsewhere.
After leaving New York, Mr. Murray also discussed the project with the Brookings Institution, which has a reputation as being more liberal than the American Enterprise Institute. "We also thought that the project was an interesting one on which no one could pass judgment until it's finished," said Bruce MacLaury, the Brookings president.
Since Mr. Murray already had a grant from the Bradley Foundation, a large Milwaukee-based foundation, Brookings could offer him an office withoutfacing the question of whether to place him on its staff, Mr. MacLaury said. The racial aspects of the research would have made the decision to offer him a staff position more difficult, he said.
Defying convention seems a habit with Mr. Murray, who said it has been the way since at least his undergraduate years. On the rare occasions when circumstances forced him to wear a necktie, he said, he took pains to make sure the narrow end was longer. "If I got it wrong, I would retie it," he said, in a tone that wobbled between pride and self-reproach.
Neckties aside, Mr. Murray, who is 47 years old, enjoyed a conventional upbringing in Newton, Iowa, where his father worked as an executive for the Maytag Corporation and his mother raised a family.
"On both sides of the family, they were really an American story of working hard and being rewarded for it," he said, describing the one kind of social program he believes in.
When Mr. Murray graduated from Harvard University in 1965 with a bachelor's degree, he said, he did not yet consider himself a conservative. He views his years in the Peace Corps, which he said he had joined more as an adventurer than a humanitarian, as the beginning of a long education in the hubris of social engineering.
 
A Pattern of Failure
 He spent two years in Thailand, telling villagers how to build toilets, but concluded that he had contributed nothing. After returning to the United States he embarked on a career as an analyst with the American Institutes for Research, a private company that works for foundations and governments in evaluating a broad range of social programs. But the more dealings he had with inner-city programs to reduce teen-age pregnancy, crime or other social ills, the more he saw a pattern of failure.
With "Losing Ground," his disillusionment became the conservatives' manifesto.
While there was nothing new in the argument that Government policy had destroyed the incentives for the poor to avoid crime and find work, the elegance and detail that Mr. Murray summoned on its behalf was. Many officials in the Reagan Administration had said the same thing, but "Losing Ground," which was published by Basic Books, gave the viewpoint its intellectual architecture.
From the start of his frontal assault on the welfare state, Mr. Murray has understood that potentially volatile racial questions lurk close to the surface. He noted in "Losing Ground" that talk of welfare dependency was often accompanied by "a good deal of mean-spirited (often racist) invective," and he took pains to insist that his was a race neutral argument.
"This book is not about blacks and whites," he says when asked about the current work. It is mostly about the tensions between America's egalitarian philosophy and the unequal way in which talents are distributed, he said.
Researchers have consistently found that groups of American blacks score on average about 15 points lower in I.Q. tests than groups of whites. But there is much disagreement about what that means. Some social scientists have argued that the gap is caused by differences in socioeconomic status and other environmental factors. Others have assailed the tests as relying on a narrow conception of intelligence.
Many argue that so-called scientific claims about racial differences in intelligence have turned out to be wrong. They say that such research has a discredited history of justifying violence and oppression.
"There is such a discrepancy in what's known by the specialists and assumed by the nonspecialists," Mr. Murray said.
Mr. Murray's collaborator in the new research, Professor Herrnstein, attracted national attention in 1971 when he predicted that as society became more meritocratic, individuals with low I.Q.'s would congregate on the bottom of the economic scale, intermarry and produce offspring with low I.Q.'s. Protesters accusing him of biological determinism -- unfairly, he argues -- disrupted his classes and tried to get him dismissed from the university.
He has largely been silent on issues of race. But this year, in The Public Interest, a conservative journal, he attacked a report by the National Academy of Sciences on the state of black America. He said the report had overemphasized racial discrimination in explaining the status of blacks and had ignored "intractable race differences" in I.Q. test results. Modern science did not know what caused the difference, he said -- inheritance or environment -- or how to cure it.
Among those unpersuaded of the value of Mr. Murray's new project is his friend and fishing partner, Ed Crane, president of the libertarian Cato Institute. Mr. Crane said that he once hoped to lure Mr. Murray to his research organization, and that he had talked to him briefly about the current project, but did not offer him a position.
"It's not an area that I wish to get involved in," said Mr. Crane, who was otherwise full of praise for Mr. Murray's work.
Asked whether he shared Mr. Murray's view that the subject had unfortunately become taboo, he said, "I think that sometimes taboos serve a legitimate social function."

HEADLINE: Henry M. Caudill, Who Described Appalachia's Poverty, Dies at 68

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Harry M. Caudill, a Kentucky lawyer, professor and author whose eloquent description of life in poverty-ridden Appalachia inspired Federal relief efforts beginning in the 1960's, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound yesterday at the Appalachian Regional Hospital in Whitesburg, Ky. He was 68 years old.
Mr. Caudill, who had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, shot himself in the head with a .38-caliber handgun at his home in the Cumberland Mountains near Whitesburg, said Pat Gish, an owner of The Mountain Eagle, a weekly newspaper to which Mr. Caudill frequently contributed. 
 Mrs. Gish said that in accordance with Mr. Caudill's wishes in a living will, no extraordinary life-saving measures were taken before his death.
In 1963 Mr. Caudill's first book, "Night Comes to the Cumberlands," focused nationwide attention on the plight of Appalachia's residents. President John F. Kennedy appointed a commission to investigate conditions in the region and his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, made Appalachia a keystone of his War on Poverty.
In the succeeding quarter-century, more than $15 billion in aid was spent in the impoverished mountain region covering parts of 13 states. But Mr. Caudill and others who continued to study the region concluded in 1986 that the forecast was still bleak and that only marginal improvement had been made in the lives of millions of rural residents of Appalachia.
 
Maverick Legislator
 Mr. Caudill, who was born in the Whitesburg area, was a descendant of the earliest settlers who arrived a century and a half ago to scratch out a living on farms and in coal mines. He went to Whitesburg High School and, after serving in the Army in World War II and being wounded in combat in Italy, graduated from the University of Kentucky with a law degree in 1948.
He practiced law for nearly three decades and served three terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives, where he was a maverick legislator who fought, largely unsuccessfully, to end the state's many political fiefdoms at the county level.
A strenuous orator who liked to quote in a sonorous mountain drawl from the Bible, Shakespeare, Tennyson and Dickens, he was principally concerned with improving public education, conserving land and resources and reforming the judiciary. He co-sponsored a 1954 law that set minimum support levels for public schools and imposed a sales tax to pay the cost.
In the late 1960's Mr. Caudill became chairman of the Congress for Appalachian Development, a coalition seeking to strengthen self-government in the region. He lobbied extensively in Washington and lectured around the country to draw attention to Appalachia's problems and what he saw as its promise.
 
Compiled Own Text
 In 1977 he gave up practicing the law to become Professor of Appalachian Studies at the University of Kentucky. Having no suitable textbook on the region, he compiled his own. With his wife, Anne, as his secretary, he wrote articles that were published in The Atlantic Monthly, Reader's Digest, The Nation and Audubon Magazine, among other journals.
He wrote nine books after "Night Comes to the Cumberlands." Most of his writing dealt with problems like the ravages of surface mining, unemployment caused by automation, the inadequacies of welfare programs and the need for development of electric power to rebuild Kentucky's industrial base.
He formally retired from his chair at the university in 1985 but continued to write and lecture on issues involving Appalachia.
In addition to his wife, the former Anne Frye, he is survived by two sons, James of Louisville and Harry F. Caudill of Lexington, Ky.; a daughter, Diana Grace of New Albany, Ind., and two grandchildren.

 CORRECTION:
An obituary headline in late editions yesterday about an author who described life in Appalachia rendered his name incorrectly. He was Harry M. Caudill, not Henry. The obituary is reprinted today on page 31.
