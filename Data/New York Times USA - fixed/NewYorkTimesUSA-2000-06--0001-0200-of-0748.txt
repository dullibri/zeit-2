HEADLINE: Behind a Death on the Street, a Life on the Stage

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
After nearly 25 years in the business, Randolph Walker knew better than to bank on an audition. Still, when he headed home last week after trying out for a bit part in a movie called "Dummy," he could not help feeling a little hopeful.
Life as a New York actor demands a difficult combination of realism and optimism, and Mr. Walker had perfected it, scraping by on the odd bits of work that define daily existence for so many people in the profession. 
 It was on his trip home to West 43rd Street last Monday that Mr. Walker was fatally struck by a double-decker tour bus at Ninth Avenue and 45th Street, setting off a wave of outrage against the operator of the bus, problem-ridden New York Apple Tours.
The reaction in theater circles was more than anger or sadness at seeing a 71-year-old man struck down. New York's acting rank and file, who live the rare highs and relentless lows of the city's performing arts, had lost one of their own.
To some workaday actors Mr. Walker was a familiar face from countless casting calls for "mature man, 60 to 75." To others he was a gracious fellow cast member, happy to mentor and befriend younger colleagues. To the actors who knew him as Ran, and even those who didn't know him at all, Mr. Walker embodied their struggle: a working actor aiming for the big break even as he tries to make ends meet, a devoted performer willing to take roles in remote dinner theaters or obscure downtown workshops because of a love of the stage, a survivor who -- with the exception of a couple of Christmases on the sales floor at Brooks Brothers -- proved it was possible to tough it out without waiting tables or working for a temp agency.
"There are so many actors who don't work at all, and here was a guy who supported himself as an actor," said Todd Heughens, 38, who became close friends with Mr. Walker 14 years ago while working on a Boston production of "1776." "So I think he took great pride in that."
Indeed, Mr. Walker in many ways typified the life of a certain tier of New York actor. He lived in Manhattan Plaza, the government-subsidized apartment complex mainly for performing artists on West 43rd Street where tenants pay 30 percent of their income as rent, an amount adjusted annually. Generally, a friend estimated, Mr. Walker paid about $500 a month for his 18th-floor studio overlooking the Hudson River.
He went to the theater whenever he could, availing himself of the occasional discounts available to members of the profession. Sometimes Mr. Walker would be invited to final dress rehearsals, known as gypsy runs, by friends in the cast.
Aside from playing a minor role in one Broadway show, Mr. Walker worked at a level that included dinner theaters, which generally pay $300 to $600 a week; print advertisements, which can pay $100 to $500; and workshop productions, which often don't pay at all. Despite painful dry spells, Mr. Walker always got another job eventually. His income, though, fluctuated from year to year.
"He could land a tour and have a good year," Mr. Heughens said, "but he could have a year where he earned under $30,000."
Mr. Walker had to work 20 weeks of the year to get unemployment insurance. His main concern was reaching that cutoff -- and, with the exception of one year, he always did. This hurdle aside, Mr. Walker was consumed with getting auditions and then making the most of them. Even knowing the odds, friends say, he would get his hopes up every time.
"He had a lot of auditions but also a lot of rejections," said Stephen J. Morello, 82, his companion of 21 years. "You know how the theater is -- you have to be a certain age and have a certain look."
Because his survival depended on working, Mr. Walker never turned anything down. Six feet tall and 165 pounds, with gray hair and brown eyes and a resonant voice, he was generally cast in small character parts. Butlers, undertakers and Scrooges were his bread and butter.
In a regional production of the musical "Annie," for example, he played Drake, the head butler; in a regional "Man From La Mancha," the innkeeper. He also did a few turns on soap operas like "As the World Turns" and "One Life to Live." Mr. Heughens, now an art director, described this as "under-five work," when actors are hired for the day and have fewer than five lines.
Robert Petito, who directed Mr. Walker in plays produced by his former Off Off Broadway acting company and now runs La Stanza Verde, a restaurant on Theater Row, said that "people like Ran get lost in the shuffle."
"He should have been doing so much more dramatic work or sophisticated comedy," Mr. Petito said.
Mr. Walker was happy to travel to Muskegon, Mich., to play a couple of roles in "Camelot" or to be a judge in a background scene in one of the "Godfather" movies or to portray a man who founded an evaporated-milk company in a television commercial or to be the taped tour guide for the Museum of the City of New York.
"He usually played funeral directors," said Michael Hartig, Mr. Walker's agent, who represented the actor for about 20 years. "He had a very charactery look, right out of the movies in the 40's. If he had gone to Hollywood, he would have had a big career."
There are many different union contracts for actors based on a production's venue, and Mr. Walker usually worked at one of the lowest pay scales. Casting directors, who ultimately send their recommendations on to the director of a production, say that Mr. Walker seemed to feel that nothing was beneath him.
"The money was less important," said Steven DeAngelis, a casting director at Grey Worldwide, the advertising agency, who cast Mr. Walker in various parts. "He was willing to audition for every kind of job. A lot of actors' first words are: 'What contract is it? How much is it paying?' His were: 'Who wrote the music? Who is the director?' "
What made all the anonymous bit parts worthwhile were the occasional meaty roles Mr. Walker landed in serious plays -- even if they were produced in out-of-the-way places for no pay. "Ran was the kind of performer for whom the work was the reward, the process was the reward," Mr. DeAngelis said.
Friends say that Mr. Walker was particularly proud of the performance he gave in the Heritage Theater Company's production of "Taking Sides" last month at the United States Custom House in Lower Manhattan, where, for $3 a day in car fare, he played Wilhelm Furtwangler, the controversial German conductor who did not join the Nazi party but sympathized with aspects of the totalitarian regime.
Mr. Walker apparently found the experience of having a leading role was disorienting. "He hadn't done a role of that size in so many years," Mr. Heughens said. "He kept saying, 'How am I going to remember the lines?' "
It was a workshop production for invited guests. In a letter to the theater company's founder and artistic director, Thomas Luce Summa, Rhoda Nathan, president of the Bernard Shaw Society, wrote: "I thought that Randolph Walker's Furtwangler was extraordinary. He managed to break your heart and generate skepticism about his behavior at the same time."
Mr. Walker had been a charter member of the Heritage, an Off Off Broadway company, for 30 years. Mr. Summa said his company had for the last five years been planning to do "The Merchant of Venice" with Mr. Walker in the role of Shylock, but Mr. Walker kept having to pass in favor of projects that paid the rent. "Every time we'd start, Ran would get a part," Mr. Summa said.
"He did so many small parts in musicals. His part in 'The King and I' on Broadway was a small part. It wasn't a challenge."
Indeed, appearing on Broadway once -- as Mr. Walker did as Sir Edward Ramsay in the 1976 revival of "The King and I," with Yul Brynner -- can be a mixed blessing, Mr. Heughens said, "like your career peaked."
Although Mr. Hartig sent Mr. Walker out on various casting calls, friends say Mr. Walker also hustled on his own, combing the trade papers for auditions, keeping in touch with directors he had worked with about whether there might be a role for him in their future projects.
Mr. Walker was tough on himself. "He wished he was a little more ambitious," Mr. Heughens said. "Maybe he could have made a little more of a name for himself or worried about money a little bit less."
Mr. Walker belonged to a small circle of older men who go up for the same parts, regularly running into one another in the waiting room outside the casting room door. Nevertheless, the people who were part of this group say Mr. Walker was noncompetitive in the extreme, that he told his friends about roles he was seeking so they could try to get them also, that he was happy for them even when they won parts he had wanted.
"We competed a couple of times for roles," said Keith Perry, 69, a fellow actor who became a friend. "We shared disappointments. There was never a jealousy in Ran."
Mr. Walker also gained a reputation for mentoring younger cast members. "When he worked on shows, they would gravitate toward him," Mr. Hartig said. "He was kind of like Santa Claus. He always had time to talk to them, to share his knowledge and his expertise."
In large part, those who knew Mr. Walker say, this generosity stemmed from the fact that Mr. Walker simply felt lucky to be working in the theater after so many years of having stayed away. Soon after his 1951 marriage to a fellow drama student he met during freshman year at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., Mr. Walker left the theater to become a banker. "I think he realized it was almost impossible to make a living that way," said Eleanor Walker, the actor's former wife.
The Walkers had two children, a son who died at 16 in a fire and a daughter, Katharine Hoffman, who lives in a Chicago suburb with her husband, Richard, and their two teenage sons.
After his divorce in 1976, Mr. Walker came to New York to try to return to professional acting. "I think he felt like his whole life had started all over again," said Nagle Jackson, former artistic director of the McCarter Theater Center in Princeton, N.J., who in 1990 directed Mr. Walker in his adaptation of "A Tale of Two Cities." (Reviewing the play for The New York Times, Wilborn Hampton said Mr. Walker "presents a detestably wheedling Barsad.")
Although years ago he had a triple bypass operation, Mr. Walker had a youthful spirit and seemed strong. He and Mr. Morello traveled every year together and had been planning a trip to Venice in September.
Although Mr. Walker did not look at his acting career as a model for up-and-coming actors, friends say it was a shining example to many of them nonetheless.
"This is a life you choose, and he chose this life and he was going to make it work," Mr. Heughens said. "Sure, he would rather be doing a Broadway show, but if that didn't come his way, he wasn't going to chuck it all, either."

No Softbank Deal for Nippon Credit as Deadline Passes

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 31

 BODY:
The Softbank Corporation, Japan's leading Internet company, was dealt a setback today in efforts to acquire a large insolvent bank nationalized by the government, which said it would seek other possible buyers.
An investment group led by Softbank had won the exclusive right to negotiate the purchase of the Nippon Credit Bank three months ago, in what was described at the time as a deal with far-reaching implications for Japan's banking and Internet industries. But the deadline for reaching an agreement, which had already been extended once, expired today with little progress made on the terms. 
 The Financial Reconstruction Commission, the regulatory agency overseeing the overhaul of Japan's troubled financial sector, said it intended to keep talking to the Softbank-led group, which includes the Orix Corporation, one of Japan's largest leasing companies, and the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company. But the agency said it would also talk to other potential bidders.
Regulators said they could not agree with the Softbank group on the scope of Nippon Credit Bank's bad- loan problem and the value of the collateral backing those and other loans. "Those three each had an opinion over how to estimate and deal with bad loans," said Shoji Mori, a senior commission official. "The situation at the final meeting was that we were far from reaching an agreement."
In a statement, the Softbank-led group, which had tentatively offered 100 billion yen, or about $938 million at current exchange rates, for the bank, said it would continue the pursuit of Nippon Credit.
Some financial analysts were betting that the Softbank group would win the bank, one of two big banks nationalized during Japan's financial crisis in 1998.
"They have a credible business plan, and they want the bank," said Dean Perry, an analyst who tracks nonbank financial companies at ING Barings.
Government officials, speaking privately, said the failure to meet today's deadline reflected political concerns arising over how much responsibility the government would be forced to accept for loans that sour after the sale.
The commission has recently been criticized by politicians over the terms of its deal to sell the Long-Term Credit Bank, the other nationalized bank, to an investment group led by Ripplewood Holdings L.L.C., an American investment fund.
Long-Term Credit Bank has emerged as the largest creditor of several firms that have recently gone bankrupt or asked their creditors for substantial debt forgiveness. Under the terms of Ripplewood's agreement, the government must take responsibility for bad loans that arise from such circumstances, reducing Ripplewood's risk.
Political concerns about the sale of these banks have come as the country prepares for contentious parliamentary elections that could weaken the power of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party.
Approval ratings for the cabinet led by Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori plunged to a record postwar low this week, according to a poll done by the Asahi Shimbun.
Despite the setback to Softbank, some analysts welcomed the possibility that it might not be acquiring Nippon Credit.
"We thought this was a very expensive way to buy a banking license that came with too much legacy management," said Thomas Rodes, who follows Japan's Internet industry at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney.
The failure to reach a deal by today's deadline did not come as a complete surprise. Japan's Internet business community has buzzed with rumors that Softbank's ardor for the deal was cooling.
Yoshitaka Kitao, the president and chief executive of the Softbank Finance Corporation, Softbank's financing subsidiary, has been debating the wisdom of buying into Nippon Credit Bank openly with Masayoshi Son, the Softbank founder and chief executive, who wants to use the bank to finance the fledgling companies that have historically lacked access to bank financing here.
Mr. Kitao has questioned whether Softbank can assume the risk of a bank that has a sizable portfolio of bad loans, particularly at a time when Softbank's own financial structure is considered shaky. The company has a speculative credit rating, its stock has fallen more than 73 percent since February, and earnings plunged 77 percent in the fiscal year that ended March 31.
Mr. Son has dismissed such concerns, saying Softbank has more cash on hand than the total of its debts due for the next eight years.
"We have enough reserves to repay all debts at once if we want," he said at a news conference last week.

HEADLINE: Changes in Welfare Bring Improvements for Families

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
A rigorous, large-scale evaluation of changes in welfare in Minnesota has found extremely positive effects: higher earnings and income for parents, less poverty, an increase in marriage rates and marital stability and improvements in children's behavior and school performance -- a combination never seen before.
Results of the study, issued today by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research center, were hailed by conservatives and liberals alike. 
 They said the study provided the first firm evidence that changes in welfare policies could lead to increases in marriage and marital stability, a central goal of many people who rewrote federal and state welfare laws in the last decade.
Gordon L. Berlin, senior vice president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, said, "The Minnesota Family Investment Program produced substantial, far-ranging improvements in the lives of single parents who were long-term welfare recipients."
Minnesota required welfare recipients to work, but allowed them to continue receiving modest amounts of cash assistance at the same time. Minnesota's program was more generous than those of most other states, and more expensive, but it was also more effective in achieving the stated goals of the federal welfare law signed by President Clinton in 1996.
In Minnesota, welfare workers went out of their way to emphasize that if welfare recipients took jobs, even low-wage jobs, they would be financially better off than if they stayed on welfare. When a person took a job, the state would not count 38 percent of monthly earnings in calculating the amount of cash assistance. This policy was intended as an incentive for people to work.
In an interview, Michael T. O'Keefe, commissioner of human services in Minnesota, said: "One of the longstanding criticisms of the old welfare program was that it broke up families. This new study provides the first solid evidence that a welfare system focused on employment can stabilize families and improve the well-being of children."
The investigators said they were surprised by the size of the changes they found in the last few years:
*The proportion of welfare recipients with jobs rose by 35 percent, and many of the jobs provided stable full-time work. (Half of single parents worked under the new welfare program, compared with 37 percent under the old program.)
*Earnings increased by 23 percent, to an average of nearly $8,000 a year for each person working.
*Average income, from earnings and welfare combined, rose 15 percent, to $10,800 a year.
*The proportion of welfare recipients with health insurance coverage rose to 69 percent, from 61 percent.
"These changes led to remarkable changes in family life," the report said. Domestic abuse decreased by 18 percent, marriage rates increased by 50 percent, and parents said their children performed better in school and had fewer behavior problems.
The results were achieved in a robust economy, when unemployment is low. Economists say the real test of the new programs could come in an economic downturn.
The results raise questions for conservatives, who have tried to get poor people off welfare and into jobs as fast as possible. One such question is how much extra they are willing to spend to achieve other goals, like an increase in marriage and a reduction in separation and divorce.
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, said the findings vindicated the welfare strategy of Republicans in Congress, who encouraged marriage as one of the explicit goals of the 1996 welfare law.
"This study shows that if you mandate work, but couple it with a generous approach to welfare, you can increase employment, reduce poverty and -- most gratifying -- get more stable marriages with less violence between partners," Mrs. Johnson said.
Current and former Clinton administration officials were delighted with the results.
"I don't think we've seen anything quite like this before," said David T. Ellwood, a professor of political economy at Harvard, who was a top welfare official in the administration from 1993 to 1995.
Olivia A. Golden, an assistant secretary of health and human services, said the Minnesota study was "enormously important."
Minnesota not only required welfare recipients to take jobs quickly, as most other states have done, but spent additional money to encourage the formation of two-parent families, Ms. Golden said.
"Never before have we seen such clear evidence that more families became or stayed married," she said. "Never before have we seen that the rates of women experiencing domestic violence decreased from a welfare program."
Lisa A. Gennetian, a co-author of the report, said, "In Minnesota, we found the first strong evidence that changing the rules of the welfare system can actually increase the likelihood that single parents get married and that two-parent families stay together."

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Hit 5-Month Low in April

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
New-home sales fell in April to their lowest level in five months, government figures showed today, indicating that six increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve over the last year may be starting to cool the economy.
Sales declined 5.8 percent last month, to an annual rate of 909,000 units, with the biggest slumps in the Midwest and West, the Commerce Department said. A month earlier, sales rose 5.8 percent. 
 Purchasing managers in the Chicago area also reported today that their factory index fell this month, and the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators dropped in April for the second time in three months.
"The numbers reflect a little softer economy in the second quarter," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "It suggests that what the Fed's doing to cool the economy may be achieving some results."
Mortgage rates have been rising since the Fed started raising borrowing costs in June 1999. The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage rose last week to 7.25 percent, the highest level in more than nine years.
The manufacturing index of the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago fell to 53.9 in May -- the lowest since September -- from 56.5 in April. An index of prices paid for raw materials declined to 64.4 in May from 69.4 in April.
Other regional purchasing manager reports released today from New York, Milwaukee, Cincinnati and Detroit all showed slower activity in May. The national purchasing managers report for May is scheduled to be released on Thursday.
The Conference Board's leading indicators index -- considered a gauge of economic performance six months from now -- dropped 0.1 percent in April after rising 0.1 percent in March and falling 0.3 percent in February. The April decline was led by reduced factory demand for consumer goods.
The level of home sales in April was the lowest since November's annual rate of 895,000 units. The monthly decline was the largest since a 7.2 percent decrease in September. Sales in March were the strongest since a 995,000-unit pace in November 1998.
The median price of a new home fell 2.2 percent, to $161,400 in April -- the lowest since it was $160,000 in October -- from $165,000 a month earlier.
Even with April's decline, the rise in mortgage rates has done little to slow housing. New-home sales for the first four months of the year are 3.4 percent higher than they were in the period a year earlier.
Still, analysts say they expect to see further cooling in home sales and construction if rates continue to rise. Last week's average rate on a one-year adjustable mortgage was the highest since April 26, 1991, Freddie Mac said. One-year rates averaged 6.80 percent in April, more than a full percentage point higher than a year earlier.
That is important because buyers have flocked to adjustable mortgages as fixed-rate loans have become more expensive. Almost a third of all mortgage loans these days are adjustable.

HEADLINE: A Wall on Trade Between U.S. and Europe

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: LISBON, May 31

 BODY:
President Clinton and senior European Union officials met today on four major trade disputes dividing them but failed to make any progress, a senior administration official said.
The issues were apparently so difficult that Mr. Clinton, Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, and Prime Minister Antonio Guterres of Portugal, who currently holds the rotating European Union presidency, did not even make a serious attempt to resolve them. 
 They spent 20 minutes of their 75-minute working meeting at the Queluz Palace, a small-scale version of Versailles outside of Lisbon, discussing trade. The rest was devoted to Russia and security issues like Kosovo and European defense. Their hourlong working lunch focused on economic issues, like commerce on the Internet, and infectious diseases.
In an unusually blunt public assessment for such a high-level meeting, Lael Brainard, the deputy national economic adviser, made no effort to put a positive spin on it.
Briefing reporters, she described the trade talks as "a lively and frank exchange on areas where our views differ." Asked specifically whether any progress had been made on outstanding issues, Ms. Brainard said, "There was no progress at this meeting."
The meetings today, on the first stop of Mr. Clinton's last scheduled trip to Europe as president, underscored how little time he has to shape foreign policy before he leaves office in eight months.
In his opening remarks at a joint news conference in the formal garden of the palace after the meetings, he struck a retrospective note, saying he wanted to put the talks into "some historical perspective." He listed what he called Europe's achievements in promoting democracy and economic prosperity during the past eight years. "I thank all of those who have supported those developments," Mr. Clinton said.
In emotional words of his own, the effusive Mr. Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, said he wanted to pay tribute to Mr. Clinton's support of the European Union during his administration. He said it was fitting that Mr. Clinton would receive the Charlemagne Prize later this week, an award given to those who promote Europe's goals. Mr. Clinton is "a European," Mr. Prodi said, adding, "You belong to our family, really."
Perhaps it was the blinding sun in Mr. Clinton's eyes that made him blink as Mr. Prodi spoke. In the afternoon, Mr. Clinton played golf for several hours with his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, just outside of Lisbon.
At the news conference, Mr. Clinton spent most of his time fielding questions on subjects other than trade. In his most extensive remarks on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon, he called the decision by Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel "daring." He added, "It changed the landscape." But Mr. Clinton also warned that the withdrawal "imposes a much greater sense of urgency" on all the parties to agree to a blueprint that is supposed to lead to a permanent peace agreement. Israel and the Palestinians are still grappling with unresolved issues like the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements on occupied land, borders and the future of about four million Palestinian refugees.
"There is both greater potential for something happening and also greater tension in the atmosphere," Mr. Clinton said, "which is causing a ripple effect in the relationship between the Israelis and the Palestinians."
Mr. Clinton confirmed that a private meeting he will have with Mr. Barak, originally scheduled for Berlin on Thursday night, had been switched to Lisbon on Thursday morning at the request of Mr. Barak, who, in the face of domestic opposition, decided he needed to be in Israel for a state ceremony marking Jerusalem Unification Day.
Mr. Clinton, who is scheduled to leave for Germany later on Thursday, also spoke by telephone with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. "President Clinton emphasized a commitment to do everything he can to move the process forward," a senior administration official said.
Asked at the news conference about an American plan to develop a limited missile defense, which has been much criticized by America's European partners, Mr. Clinton reiterated his view that the United States faced a new nuclear threat and would be willing to share its technology with other "civilized nations." If the technology for such a system is developed, he said, "it would be unethical" for the United States to hoard it.
Mr. Clinton's proposal to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow for the deployment of a limited missile defense system, as well as Russia's conduct in the war in Chechnya, will be at the top of the agenda when he meets for the first time with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, in Moscow this weekend. Mr. Putin has vociferously opposed amending the treaty, a landmark of cold war arms control.
"We've done a lot of information-sharing already with the Russians," Mr. Clinton said. "We've offered to do more."
The Europeans are not sanguine about a modification of the treaty either. Mr. Guterres, Portugal's prime minister, said today that any move toward a missile-defense system would have to be agreed to "by everybody" and would have to take into account "everyone's preoccupations in this matter."
On Tuesday, President Jacques Chirac of France said he was worried that the missile defense system would spark a new global arms race.
Mr. Clinton played down the prospects for any major breaktrough in Moscow.
"I would be surprised if we bridge all of our differences on Chechnya, and I would be surprised if we resolved all our differences on the question of missile defense, although we might make more headway than most people expect," he said.
As for trade, trade between the United States and the 15-member European Union represents more than 40 percent of the world's share, but the two sides are locked in a protracted and public struggle over a series of conflicts in which neither has shown much willingness to compromise.
The American side objects to European restrictions on the importation of bananas, a ban on American beef produced with growth hormones and the subsidizing by European governments of a new double-deck passenger jet built by the European consortium Airbus Industrie.
More recently, the European Union has objected to a tax break that the United States grants to major corporations that set up operations in offshore tax havens like the Virgin Islands and Barbados. These companies are not required to pay American sales tax and duties -- from 10 to 30 percent -- on their exports. The European Union argues that the tax relief that benefits 6,000 exporters, including corporate giants like Boeing, General Motors and Microsoft, is a form of subsidy that will amount to about $25 billion to United States companies during the next five years.
Because of the European Union's position on bananas and beef, the World Trade Organization has allowed the United States to impose more than $300 million in import penalties against the European Union. The Europeans are infuriated by the American retaliatory import tax on goods such as Roquefort cheese and foie gras.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
This Feels Like '88, Good News (Maybe) for Gore

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
The ghost of the 1988 election is a comforting spirit to many Democrats, who like to remember another sitting vice president, George Bush, who was trailing in the polls in May only to prevail, handily, in November.
In the eyes of these Democrats and some leading scholars, the message of 1988 is clear. Vice presidents seeking election in their own right take time to emerge; not until the convention do they truly take their place in the public's mind as the leader of their party. 
 And when voters finally pay attention to the race, broader issues become most important: How good is the economy, how stable is the world and, essentially, do they want a third term of the party in power?
If the '88 paradigm holds, Vice President Gore is stronger than he looks, and his present difficulties in the polls are much exaggerated -- particularly given the stronger economy of 2000. Citing both the extraordinary economy and President Clinton's approval ratings, Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a research group, said, "It will be a first in modern American history if an incumbent administration is deposed from office under these conditions."
But veterans of the 1988 campaigns of Vice President Bush, the Republican, and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democrat, say there are also important differences between the two elections -- from the background of the challengers to the tenor of the times.
And Mr. Mann and other analysts agree that there is a complicated variable that may be masked by this administration's high approval ratings: How will the long ordeal of scandal and impeachment affect the voters' desire to stay the course?
Bob Teeter, a pollster and top strategist for Vice President Bush's 1988 campaign, argued: "Even in a good economy, Gore is vice president of an administration that people don't like very well. They like its performance and its policies, but they don't like what's been dragged before them."
For all of that, the parallels with 1988 are striking. Then, and now, the incumbent vice president was struggling to emerge from the shadow of a two-term president presiding over a peaceful, prosperous nation. Then, and now, the vice president secured his party's nomination only to lag, persistently, in the polls behind a fresh-faced governor declaring it was time for a change. Then, and now, the vice president's campaign tried methodically to redefine that governor as untested and risky.
The New York Times/CBS News poll ratings for May 1988 and May 2000 are eerily similar for the candidates. Vice President Bush, 12 years ago, was viewed favorably by 33 percent, unfavorably by 35 percent. Vice President Gore, earlier this month, was viewed favorably by 34 percent, unfavorably by 36 percent. Mr. Dukakis was -- at least by this measure -- in better shape than Gov. George W. Bush is today. Thirty-eight percent viewed him favorably, 14 percent unfavorably; earlier this month, 40 percent viewed Governor Bush favorably, 28 percent unfavorably.
But the Dukakis support proved exceedingly soft. In May 1988, in a moment that lives on in campaign folklore, the Bush campaign team took some of the most controversial elements of the Dukakis record in Massachusetts and tested them with a focus group of voters in Paramus, N.J. They emerged with the makings of a devastating attack.
A Gore adviser said of the Bush strategists of 1988: "One of the critical insights they had, when they dissected Dukakis in '88, was that it was no one single issue that proved decisive. When they did those focus groups in Paramus, N.J., it was the accumulation of negatives" that ultimately swayed the voters.
But veterans of that campaign say that Governor Bush will be harder to redefine, by virtue of his family name and history. 'I don't think you can make a Wasp governor from Texas as much of a stranger to the American public as a Greek-American liberal" from Massachusetts, said Jack Corrigan, director of operations for the Dukakis campaign.
Moreover, some campaign veterans say, the younger Bush and his strategists have clearly learned lessons from 1988, and have quickly moved to advance Mr. Bush's biography, themes and policy proposals for the fall campaign; he will not be the tabula rasa Mr. Dukakis was.
Mr. Dukakis "didn't have a clue as to how wedge issues play out in a general election campaign," said Richard Bond, the national political director for the elder Bush's 1988 campaign. As a result, Mr. Bond added, Mr. Dukakis underestimated the power of issues like the Massachusetts prison program that gave furloughs to convicted murderers like Willie Horton, which was used against the Democrats to extraordinary effect. "Who thinks that Gore will ever be able to do that to Bush Jr.?" Mr. Bond asked.
Others see it as less far-fetched. Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said, "When Governor Bush has come under scrutiny in the primary period, he has not stood up very well. And its clear that the Gore campaign will do its best to take a page out of Vice President Bush's treatment of Dukakis."
In fact, the Gore campaign has been using a set of potential wedge issues against Mr. Bush, including his support for laws allowing licensed Texans to carry concealed weapons, even in church.
Another line of attack in 1988 was Vice President Bush's success in presenting himself as the only credible commander in chief -- aided and abetted by Mr. Dukakis's uncomfortable outing in a tank, an image used repeatedly in Republican advertising. But during the cold war, voters were much more sensitive to a candidate's qualifications to be commander in chief, particularly governors with no foreign policy experience. Today, such factors are much further down the voters' agenda, Mr. Teeter said -- and thus less of a hurdle for Governor Bush.
Still, there are deeper similarities to 1988, some analysts say, notably what is sometimes called the shadow theory: How hard a vice president'stransition is from helpmate to leader in his own right.
"Vice Presidents in the modern American political context have either won the election, like George Bush Sr., or they came amazingly close," like Richard M. Nixon in 1960, , said George Sirgiovanni, professor of history at the College of St. Elizabeth in Morristown, N.J.
For a vice president to prevail in November, there is an artful process of baton-passing that needs to occur, strategists say, in which vice presidents both separate from the departing president and benefit from his legacy.
President Ronald Reagan was, in spring 1988, still recovering from the Iran-contra scandal. His approval rating in May was not a match for Mr. Clinton's today, which has remained above 55 percent throughout his second term. But as Mr. Reagan's final year played out, his ratings climbed, as did the general good feelings about the times.
Mr. Bush both benefited from Mr. Reagan's aura and, at the Republican convention, memorably asked and answered the question of who should replace the president, saying, "I am that man."
Mr. Dukakis, who watched his 10-point lead in May 1988 melt away, reflected: "I think it takes a while for a vice president to come into his own. That certainly happened with Bush, and I think it's going to happen with Gore."

A Day After a Record Gain, the Nasdaq Declines 1.7%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
After adding modestly to Tuesday's record percentage gain, Nasdaq stock prices fell in the final hour yesterday to finish with a 1.7 percent loss as investors digested further evidence of a slowing economy and girded themselves for a crucial employment report tomorrow.
The Nasdaq composite index ended 58.57 points lower at 3,400.91. Other major gauges traded in a relatively narrow range and ended nearly unchanged. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average edged down 4.80 points, to 10,522.33, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eased 1.85 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,420.60. 
 "The positive note is that we did not give back a lot" of the post-holiday rally, said Michael Strauss, a managing director of Commonfund, an investment pool for college endowments. On the other hand, he added, the market was pleased with reports of lower home sales and less industrial inflation in the Midwest, "but couldn't do anything with it."
Stock prices mostly moved sideways -- and with little obvious pattern -- except that investors seemed to welcome the opportunity to lighten positions in high-technology concerns, while bidding up shares of household names, like Wal-Mart Stores, which leaped 5, to 58, the biggest positive contributor to the Dow and the S.& P. 500.
"If the economy is going to downshift to a lower gear, you don't want to own a whole load of technology stocks," said Ned Riley Jr., chief strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Mr. Riley examined trading blocks of at least 5,000 shares, and calculated that retail investors accounted for 70 percent of the activity in the top 10 Nasdaq stocks yesterday, even though they held only 57 percent of the shares.
Utilities and brokerage firms were among yesterday's leaders. Timothy M. Stevenson, a senior portfolio manager at the First Capital Group, said the performance of brokerage firms was "a vote of confidence" in the market outlook. Merrill Lynch gained 4 1/4, to 98 7/8, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 4 3/8, to 71 3/8, and Dain Rauscher 2 5/8, to 59 5/8.
Mr. Stevenson was also upbeat about market breadth, with 1,719 issues advancing on the New York Stock Exchange compared with 1,287 that declined. Among the S.& P. 500, however, losers outnumbered winners by 268 to 213, the biggest drags on the index being Cisco Systems, down 2 15/16, to 56 15/16, and Qualcomm, down 10, to 66 3/8. Hewlett-Packard, which skidded 4 3/8, to 120 1/8, was the biggest drag on the Dow.

Treasury Prices Rally
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices rallied yesterday after a series of weaker-than-expected economic reports raised hopes that the Federal Reserve would not have to increase interest rates as aggressively as once feared.
The government's report that sales of new homes fell 5.8 percent in April offered evidence that six Fed interest rate increases since June were starting to crimp the housing market.
The Conference Board reported, meanwhile, that the index of leading indicators slipped 0.1 percent in April, instead of rising 0.1 percent, as forecast.
The market was also pleased by a Chicago Purchasing Managers report that manufacturing growth in the Chicago area slowed in April while the group's "prices paid" index dropped to 64.4, nearly 10 points below its March high.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32, to 103 13/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6 percent from 6.09 percent.
The price of the 10-year note rose 24/32, to 101 22/32. The yield fell to 6.26 percent from 6.37 percent.

The Shots That Changed His Life

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
DANIEL GROSS would not presume to offer advice to the survivors of those shot in the massacre at Wendy's in Flushing last Wednesday night. Grieving, he explains simply, is personal.
But he does have an observation for the families of the seven men and women who were shot, five of them killed. "Something like this colors everything you do the rest of your life," said Mr. Gross. "Whether the families make a decision like I did or try to go back to their old lives, this profoundly changes your life. Not a day or an hour goes by when I don't think back." 
 Back to Feb. 23, 1997, the day when Daniel Gross's younger brother, Matthew, became a victim of the kind of random gun violence that has become achingly familiar in America. In even tones, Mr. Gross tells the story of how he got the news, as if describing a movie he had seen, not a drama he had experienced:
"It was the morning after I had celebrated my 30th birthday with my family. I remember my brother waving goodbye out of the car window. The next day I was watching the Knicks-Lakers game. They broke into the game and said there had been this shooting on the roof of the Empire State Building. I reacted the way all people do, with sorrow and sympathy for the victims.
"I turned to CNN, saw footage of the victims being taken out of the Empire State Building. I turned back to the Knicks game. The Lakers tied it up. I was upset about that. The next second the phone rang. It was my father. He said Matthew had been shot. My life hasn't been the same since. I still don't know who won."
Matthew and his band mate, Chris Burmeister of Denmark, both 27, were among seven people gunned down by a Palestinian man who then killed himself. Matthew, his brain injured, and five other victims lived. Chris died. And Daniel changed.
He avoids streets that have a view of the Empire State Building. He stays off Fifth Avenue. And the former partner at J. Walter Thompson now works full time for Pax, a gun control group he co-founded two years ago. He draws a modest salary now instead of a partner's income, lives in Manhattan with his bride, who works in advertising, and uses his skills to sell gun control instead of Listerine.
"I found I couldn't go back to my everyday life," he said yesterday, in Pax's midtown office. "It really was an opportunity to do something about gun violence using exactly the skills and background I'd gotten in advertising. That's what's missing from the gun violence issue."
Mr. Gross began speaking publicly about gun control -- angrily and emotionally -- when his brother was still hospitalized. A lot can change in three years. Matthew Gross lives with their father in Montclair, N.J., and works part time in retail sales, said his brother, who, to respect Matthew's privacy, declined to go into more detail.
Daniel Gross, who was described in one news account as speaking with "controlled rage" in 1997 about government's failure to control guns, now expresses himself thoughtfully and supports his assertions with statistics. He harbors no bitterness toward his brother's attacker, he says, and opposes the death penalty as "economically discriminatory and inherently racist."
His objective is to reach the majority of Americans who, surveys convince him, support "common sense" gun restrictions like registration and licensing. But the ordinary citizenry is overpowered by the heavily financed and therefore politically influential gun lobby. That imbalance could change, Mr. Gross suggests, if people saw gun violence as something that "goes from being a seemingly random, high-profile tragedy to something that could affect them personally."
HENCE Pax's new campaign -- ASK (for Asking Saves Kids) -- which focuses on guns in the home. Studies show that 40 percent of families with children have guns at home, said Mr. Gross. Later this month, Pax will start an ad campaign urging people to ask if parents of their children's friends keep a gun in the house.
Daniel Gross says he doesn't want what happened to his brother to keep on happening. Finding a way to try to turn tragedy into something positive has been cathartic, he said, and he wishes that for the dear ones of the Wendy's victims, a way to deal with what will never go away.
"Every time one of these tragedies happens it takes you back," he said. "Again, everybody's grief is personal, but I can identify with these families, with how I felt when I got that call. They are now committed to a lifetime of living with this memory. I would be lying if I said it gets much better. Like any pain it lessens over time. But it never completely goes away."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Calls for Better Benefits For Children With Mental Ills

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, Md., May 31

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore called today for legislation that would require health insurance companies to provide children with mental health benefits comparable to coverage for physical ailments.
Appearing alongside his wife, Tipper, before a group of mental health professionals and advocates in suburban Washington, Mr. Gore pledged to make mental health care a priority in his administration. He described his proposal for children as a first step toward eliminating disparities in coverage for adults. 
 "People still have insurance plans that actively discriminate against mental health," Mr. Gore said. "They still don't recognize it as a treatable illness, just like diabetes or high blood pressure or heart disease."
The proposal was part of a package of mental health programs, some of them not new, that the vice president outlined today. Those measures included training teachers and police officers to identify mental illness, expanding community mental health services and creating a $3,000 tax credit for families to pay for long-term care, including in mental institutions.
Achieving parity in insurance benefits for mental and physical illnesses is a leading legislative goal of mental health advocates, who contend inadequate insurance coverage has discouraged many sick people from seeking treatment.
Under a 1996 law, group health plans are forbidden to set annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health care that are lower than the limits for general medical and surgical services. But a Congressional report released two weeks ago found that thousands of companies were violating the law. Some companies have skirted the 1996 law's requirements by replacing dollar limits on mental health care with numerical limits on outpatient visits, treatment sessions or days in the hospital.
Legislation with bipartisan support in Congress would attempt to close such loopholes by prohibiting insurers from setting limits on the number of outpatient visits or days in the hospital for treatment of mental disorders that are more stringent than those for the treatment of physical illnesses.
In an interview today, Mr. Gore suggested that he would support a version of that legislation, but focused only on children. "We want to close any loopholes that allow insurers to shirk their obligations under the law," he said, without offering specifics.
Mr. Gore's Republican presidential opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, signed legislation in Texas in 1997 requiring health insurers to provide coverage for mental disorders comparable to that for physical diseases.
But Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said the Texas governor has not said whether he would support similar federal legislation. Mr. Bartlett added, "Governor Bush understands the importance of mental health parity." Opponents of Mr. Gore's proposal, including many business groups, argue that it would significantly increase the cost of health insurance, potentially causing some employers, particularly small ones, to drop their policies. Mr. Gore estimated that his plan for children would increase premiums by less than 1 percent, but the opponents said the increases could be much greater.
"Every time you increase costs, you cause people to drop coverage, and the end result is more people without insurance," said Frank Coleman, vice president for media relations of the United States Chamber of Commerce. "The question is, do we want Cadillac coverage, or do we want to find ways to insure the 40 million people without coverage, who mostly work for small businesses?"
Mental health advocates heralded Mr. Gore's proposal as a crucial step toward eliminating discrimination against the mentally ill.
"He's put his finger on a major problem," said Laurie Flynn, executive director for the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill, a nonprofit group. "The lack of adequate coverage brings enormous economic hardships to families. They can quickly run through savings, forcing them to re-mortgage houses and dip into college funds."
Mr. Gore refrained from criticizing Mr. Bush, or even mentioning him, at this morning's event. In sharp contrast to his gloomy attacks on Mr. Bush in recent weeks, Mr. Gore was upbeat, describing the times as exciting, optimistic and hopeful for people with mental illnesses.
"I truly believe there has never been a more hopeful time for mental health care in America," he said.
The vice president asked the crowd for its votes, saying that he wanted a "mandate" to make mental health a priority in his administration.
Mr. Gore said the shootings at Columbine High School last year showed that the federal government needed to help schools train teachers to identify mentally ill students and to hire mental health counselors. "As Columbine taught us, we can't wait until tragedy strikes to reach out effectively to troubled young people and give them help and hope," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Best Deal Would Be No Deal

BYLINE: By Thomas Graham; Thomas Graham, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was the chief political analyst at the United States Embassy in Moscow from 1994 to 1997.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Barring a sudden change of heart, President Vladimir Putin of Russia will do the United States a great service when he sits down with President Clinton this weekend and refuses to modify the Antiballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United States to deploy a limited missile defense.
Why does Russian opposition work in America's interest? We are still in the early stages of a serious debate over a national defense against missile attacks and, more broadly, over our nuclear strategy in the new century. Without a consensus on these important points, it is simply wrong to cut a deal with Moscow, either now or in the remaining months of the Clinton presidency. 
 The Clinton administration, of course, does not see it that way. Mr. Clinton does not want to be the first president in decades to fail to sign a significant arms control agreement with the Russians. When the summit meeting was announced several weeks ago, officials hoped to make an arms-control agreement its centerpiece, and saw reasons for optimism.
In April, Mr. Putin pushed the long-delayed ratification of the second strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start II, through the Russian Parliament. The Clinton administration took this as a sign that he was prepared to deal. American officials were also encouraged that Sergei Ivanov, director of Russia's national security council and a close Putin confidant, had not flatly opposed amending the ABM treaty, which bans missile defense systems, during a visit to Washington in February.
Subsequent discussions, however, have shattered the administration's optimism, and it has since tried to lower expectations. Last week, Samuel Berger, the White House national security adviser, stated that he did not expect arms control issues to be resolved this weekend. Rather, he said, the summit would be "a good opportunity for us to explain our view of the problem, and for President Putin to express his view of the problem."
The administration still hopes to cut a deal before Mr. Clinton leaves office, but that remains wishful thinking. The Russians have little incentive to negotiate. The debate in the United States over the reliability of the missile-defense technology and the scope of the system we should build is growing. Our European allies are becoming more concerned, and China is adamantly opposed to missile defense systems. This only encourages Mr. Putin to stand his ground.
The Russians are also concerned that an American missile defense could eventually undermine the effectiveness of their own nuclear arsenal, arguably their last remaining claim to great power status. The problem is not the limited system the Clinton administration wants to deploy against the threat of missile attacks from North Korea.
The Russians know that the White House's proposed system would pose no defense against their arsenal. But over the next decade, as the technology improves, they fear that without the ABM treaty's controls, a more effective system could be built.
Also worrying the Russians are the economic constraints that will force them to reduce their nuclear arsenal, as weapons can no be longer be maintained or replaced, to below 1,500 warheads, regardless of what the United States does. The last thing they can afford is a new high-tech arms race.
To overcome Moscow's resistance, the Clinton administration could be tempted to sweeten the pot further in its last months by promising to reduce the capabilities of a national defense system. That would be the wrong approach at this time.
As Gov. George W. Bush and others have noted, there is a new world out there: the nuclear equation has changed radically. The challenge has expanded beyond maintaining stability between two nuclear-armed superpowers. Arsenals in Russia and the United States may be reduced, but others, notably in China, will increase. Nuclear-weapons and ballistic-missile technology will almost inevitably continue to spread to rogue states.
While it would be folly to lightly discard the strategic arms treaties that have maintained stability for the last 30 years, it would be equal folly not to reassess these treaties in light of the changes over the past decade. In this environment, we do not need a quick decision on whether to deploy a national missile defense system. Instead, we need to forge a domestic consensus about anything we might build, and we must persuade our allies in Europe and East Asia to endorse whatever path we choose.
Yes, we should be talking all along to the Russians to assess their views and reactions. But until we have done our work at home and with our allies, we should be wary of signing any treaty with Moscow.
Logically, only the next administration can conclude this debate. And that is why, if events unfold as expected, Americans should be prepared to thank Vladimir Putin for looking out for their interests by saying no to President Clinton on missile defense.

HEADLINE: The German Complaint

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 31

 BODY:
At his most recent meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, was astonished to be presented with a diagram showing the American view of Europe today.
"It showed circles intersecting with other circles that intersected with still more circles in a rather bamboozling way," said Andreas Michelis, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. "The American question was: where do we turn among all these elements?" 
 The circles in question represented national governments, the European Union, the new office of Europe's "high representative" for foreign and security affairs and other institutions. As President Clinton starts a three-day visit to Berlin on Thursday, they also provide an apt image of the uncertain flux in the American relationship with Germany and its European partners.
That an era has passed is clear. This is the first visit by the President to Berlin since the government moved here from Bonn and so brought down the final curtain on the decades of postwar Allied tutelage of Germany. Less apparent, however, are the focus and equilibrium of a relationship set adrift by the end of the cold war.
At a recent meeting with a handful of correspondents here, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder complained that the United States constantly pressed the "new Germany" to assume responsibilities commensurate with its size, but whenever Germany raised its voice, the old misgivings about German power reared their heads once more.
The chancellor was speaking in the aftermath of the debacle over the choice of a new managing-director for the International Monetary Fund, an appointment pursued and won by Germany with a bludgeoning vigor that shocked officials in Washington. But his point was a broader one about the awkward transition in trans-Atlantic relations.
The Clinton administration, under pressure from Congress, wants Germany to do more -- send thousands of troops to Kosovo, increase its defense spending, stimulate its big economy through deregulation -- just as it wants several other European allies to assume broader responsibilities.
But when Germany and its European partners try to coordinate that defense spending, develop their own military identity within NATO through the formation of a 60,000 strong rapid-reaction corps, and generally sketch a partial emancipation from American strategic dominance, Washington gets uneasy.
"The United States says it wants a clear phone number for a Europe with some real cohesion," said Jurgen Chrobog, the German ambassador to the United States. "But when we try to give it one, we have problems."
A NATO diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the main American concern was that the European Union's push to develop a military capacity within NATO would multiply committees and bureaucracy, increasing confusion but not effectiveness. "And in the end, if the European Union takes on its own collective defense, you would have to ask what NATO is for," he added.
At the root of the American unease lies the fact that, having completed their economic union through the introduction of the shared euro currency, Germany and its European allies have embarked on a determined push for political and military integration.
This European road is fraught and will certainly be long. Britain is by no means the only place where resistance to further integration exists. But Europeans have already done something that now distinguishes the essence of their nationhood from that of the United States: given up a huge slice of sovereignty by surrendering control of the currency to a transnational European institution.
"Any major German interest now requires multilateral action, whether it's the euro, or security concerns over Russia, where we deal through the European Union and NATO," said Karl Kaiser, a political scientist. "But that is not the case in the United States, and this can cause tension."
The most recent instance of such tension has arisen over American plans for a limited missile defense system that Germans see as a doubtful defense against "rogue states" whose real menace is widely questioned.
Mr. Clinton sought to allay these concerns today by saying the technology would be shared with "other civilized nations" -- a reference to allies in Europe.
But however this debate is handled, it has already illustrated divergent views between the United States and a Europe increasingly ready to speak with one voice on a strategic issue.
"You have an overwhelming superpower on the one hand and an emerging Europe learning to articulate its interest on the other," said a close aide to Mr. Schroder. "That is the delicate post-cold-war equation we face."
The shifting nature of that equation is evident in the fact that some people here have taken to saying that a more accurate name for the new "Berlin Republic" would be the "Brussels Republic." Brussels is the headquarters of the European Union.
"We have learned that the more we press our interests multilaterally through Europe, the more we in Germany get for ourselves," said Josef Joffe of the respected weekly Die Zeit. "This will not change."
How far Germany will be able to combine this strategy with its traditional role as chief European bridge to Washington is the long-term question facing a country that still feels deeply beholden to the United States for its post-war recovery.
During his stay, Mr. Clinton will receive the International Charlemagne Prize, presented annually to a person who has worked for European unity. The choice of the President suggests the hope that, despite much evidence to the contrary, America and European nations have an identical interest in the forging of a United States of Europe.

Absence of Shtarkers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel meets President Clinton in Lisbon today, he will report his expectation of a deal with Yasir Arafat that can be signed on the White House lawn in time to affect the U.S. elections. It is a great political gift and a greater security gamble.
Key to the establishment of a Palestinian state in almost the entire West Bank is Barak's startling decision that the Jordan Valley is no longer needed for Israel's defense. 
 Even in Labor's dovish "Allon plan" of generations ago, that buffer behind the West Bank of the Jordan River was considered essential to slow an Arab attack. But Barak, along with another former army chief of staff, just made a military decision that changed today's negotiating equation.
In the new military thinking, it would be unwise to continue to station Israeli forces in the valley between the Kingdom of Jordan and the new state of Palestine. If those two states were in alliance, goes the convenient analysis, Israeli troops would be in a crossfire. If those two states came into conflict, then Israel would be in the middle, unwillingly involved.
Nobody likes to admit this, but Israel's abandonment of the historic valley presages the end of minority Hashemite rule in Jordan. The new king is pleading with Barak to retain at least a sliver of territory along the river to shield his regime from Palestinians bent on avenging their bloody defeat in "Black September" of 1970; they still want a trans-Jordanian "Greater Palestine." "With a common border," says Ariel Sharon, leader of Israel's opposition, "the end of the existence of the Hashemite Kingdom is only a matter of time."
Barak's military reassessment clears the way for the kind of pre-emptive territorial concession Arafat cannot refuse. For years, realistic deal makers have been talking about a final settlement that would give the Palestinians two-thirds of the West Bank, with Israeli settlements not close to Jerusalem or Tel Aviv in security zones. The addition of the Jordan Valley means that some 93 percent would go to the new Palestinian state.
However, casualty-weary Israel's badly organized retreat from its buffer zone in Lebanon, betraying longtime local allies, has whetted Palestinian appetites: if Hezbollah can force the Jews out of "every inch," why can't we?
"I hear that Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem," says the Likud's Sharon, "will get a Zone B status, with municipal administration by the new Palestinian entity. That means the division of Jerusalem." He calls the overlapping jurisdiction and befuzzing of sovereignty -- a sure source of future friction -- "foolish and irresponsible."
Barak and Arafat will call it peace. In his farewell October surprise, with his wife campaigning at his side, Clinton will confidently give America's promise to underwrite the cost.
Barak has also promised Israelis a referendum on both this deal and his giveback of the Golan Heights to Syria. He will argue that such a Lesser Israel is not necessarily weaker; on the contrary, that a time of peace in the region will let Israel strengthen its alliances with the U.S., the Europeans (already offering inducements in the U.N.) and the technology-hungry Chinese.
The political presumption is that if he can set the rules for a referendum to require only a majority of those voting, Barak's sweeping concessions are likely to prevail. Diplomatic cheering, economic incentives and global media enthusiasm provide momentum; the despair of Israel's battle-fatigued and the hopefulness of its forgetful add to the campaign against caution.
Is acceding to a Lesser Israel a dangerous gamble? Yes. Are these leaks about the extent of Israel's concessions intended to shock so they can be reduced? Probably. Should Israel seek evidence of Arab trustworthiness before rolling its security dice? Definitely.
People with views like mine call themselves shtarkers. That's based on the German word for "strong," with a self-mocking Yiddish connotation of "hard-line, insufferably resolute." Israel started out as the land of shtarkers. Maybe that's changed.

HEADLINE: Health Insurance Provides Buffer to Rising Drug Prices for Most Americans

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
More and more in recent years, private insurance has been picking up the cost of prescription medicine. Only about one-quarter of Americans' total drug costs are now paid out of pocket.
That is why there is no general political uproar even though drug prices in the United States have been rising by as much as 15 percent a year, the drug makers are among the most profitable businesses in the world and many new drugs in Canada and Europe cost a small fraction of what they do here. 
 Imagine the political swivet Americans would be in if that were the case with gasoline or some other staple of daily life.
The elderly, however, are up in arms. Those who are completely dependent on Medicare, which does not cover the cost of outpatient prescriptions, bear the brunt of the skyrocketing prices.
But most Americans never face these high drug prices. They pay no more than $5 or $10 for each prescription. The rest is covered by their health insurance.
"When people don't have to pay out of pocket, it lowers the political tension enormously," said Prof. Robert J. Blendon of Harvard, an expert on public opinion and health.
Insurance coverage of prescription medicine is a relatively new phenomenon, a consequence of the shift to health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care.
Today, government figures show, 77 percent of Americans under 65 have health insurance, either public or private, and 99 percent of those with insurance have some drug coverage.
In 1970, only 8 percent of the nation's total drug costs were covered by private insurance. By 1980, the figure had risen to 20 percent, and by 1990 it had reached 34 percent.
In the 1990's the proportion rose steadily, and by last year more than half of all spending on prescription drugs in the country was covered by private insurance. Another 21 percent was paid with public money, mostly for people in the military or those covered by Medicaid or veterans' programs.
Put another way, the average amount of their own money that Americans spend for prescription medicine each year has not even kept pace with inflation in the overall economy over the last 30 years. But the nation's per capita spending on prescription drugs has risen to more than $300 this year from $26 in 1970, government actuaries report.
The Department of Health and Human Services expects the fraction of drug costs paid out of pocket to keep dropping over the next 10 years, even if Medicare still excludes drug coverage.
Medicaid covers the drug bills of poor people. A survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focuses on health care issues, shows that, except for the elderly, the people who are uninsured tend to be low-paid workers, who are not generally influential politically.
Change may be on the horizon. Employers who must pay higher insurance premiums for their workers are shouldering the burden of the rising drug prices. Some companies have begun to reduce prescription drug benefits, requiring workers to make larger copayments or putting some expensive drugs off limits.
If that trend continues and people begin taking a hit in their wallets, the political ramifications can be substantial. But so far, high drug prices are low on the list of Washington priorities.
Both parties in Congress and both parties' presidential candidates say they want to expand Medicare coverage to include prescription medicine. But they disagree so much on the details that action this year is problematic.
Bills have been introduced in Congress to hold down prescription costs. One, for instance, would allow pharmacies to buy American-made drugs abroad and sell them here. But such bills are going nowhere, at least not this year.
There has been some movement in the states. This month, a law was enacted in Maine threatening the pharmaceutical industry with price controls. The law created a commission that would negotiate drug prices for uninsured Maine residents and could impose price limits, starting in 2003. Similar measures are being considered in a few other states. But in most instances, this seems to be a case of politicians seizing an issue and drumming up support rather than responding to demands from their constituents.
An analysis by the Kaiser foundation found that in 1997, the last year for which data is available, private insurance plans required beneficiaries to pay on average a $5.53 copayment for each generic drug prescription and $9.96 for a brand name drug. The average retail price, the analysis showed, was $30.76. For drugs taken on a regular basis, a prescription is normally for a 90-day supply.
Employers are paying the tab. At the Ford Motor Company, for example, Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., the director of health care management, calculated that the company's pharmaceutical bill would increase by nearly 25 percent this year alone, to $470 million from $380 million in 1999. The company, he said, paid nearly as much for drugs as for workers' hospitalization.
Ford employees never feel the pinch. Hourly workers pay $5 for each prescription. Salaried workers pay $12 for brand name drugs and $2 for generic drugs. Retirees get the same benefits.
Dr. Myers said 24 percent of Ford's health care premiums go to drugs. That percentage seems to be typical of large companies. The money is withheld from paychecks, and most workers never think about it.
One of the anomalies created by most people's insulation from rising drug prices was that Americans tended to insist on the newest medicine on the market -- the drugs that cost the most. For example, Dr. Myers said Ford workers often demand that their doctors prescribe Prilosec, a new, heavily advertised ulcer drug that costs $3.80 a day. In many cases, said Dr. Myers, a physician, the workers had nothing but a routine case of heartburn that would respond just as well to older, generic medicine and would cost a few cents a day.
This does not seem to happen so much in other countries. In part, that is because drug advertising aimed at the public is not allowed in Canada and Europe the way it is in the United States. But it also reflects a cultural difference. A study in 1993, before pharmaceutical advertising became prominent on television in this country, found that 66 percent of Americans were interested in the latest medical discoveries, compared with 45 percent of Europeans.
No one disputes that these new drugs cost much more in the United States than they do abroad. A survey last fall by USA Today found that Prilosec, for instance, cost only $1.47 a day in Canada, $1.67 in Britain, $1.29 in Australia and 99 cents in Mexico. The governments in those countries negotiated the lower prices.
The elderly who have no insurance except Medicare and other Americans without insurance pay the prices. But it is not clear that Americans overall pay more for drugs than people in other countries.
The most recent extensive study, by Patricia M. Danzon, a professor of health management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, concluded that Americans might not pay more when factors were counted like the discounts received by American drug companies, the widespread use of generic drugs in this country and the different dosages prescribed in different countries.
Prof. Ernst R. Berndt, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he had been unable to determine whether Americans pay more than people elsewhere. But he noted that in the United States in 1997, 10 percent of all health expenditures went for drugs. The figure was 13.8 percent in Canada, 16.7 percent in Britain and more in some other developed countries.
"Why is it," Professor Berndt asked, "if pharmaceutical prices are highest in the U.S., their cost share is so low?"
The pharmaceutical companies say the higher prices for new drugs in the United States are necessary to pay for research and development. Industry officials often note that other expenses, like college tuition, are also higher in the United States.
This rationale drives some academics and health policy experts up the wall. They argue that the drug companies are making out like bandits. But it does not seem to bother the public much.
William D. McInturff, a pollster who has often done work for Republican politicians and for lobbies affiliated with the pharmaceutical industry, conducted a survey this spring in which he tried to determine the public image of the drug companies.
Only 28 percent of Americans with private health insurance, he found, had an unfavorable view of the industry.
"I don't want to minimize the pressure politicians are feeling from the elderly who have to pay top dollar," Mr. McInturff said. "But other than that vocal group, there's no great public outcry about drug prices."

HEADLINE: PATH IS CLEARED FOR CUTS IN FEES FOR LONG DISTANCE

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
The federal government and many of the nation's leading telephone companies agreed today to a reshuffling of phone rates that would reduce the bills of tens of millions of less-affluent consumers.
The reductions, described by officials of the Federal Communications Commission as the largest rate cut in the history of federal telephone regulation, should lead to less-significant cuts for other consumers and businesses. And the changes could ultimately lead to a flat rate for long-distance service, much like fees paid by mobile phone users. 
 Government officials said they had a commitment from the long-distance companies to pass on to consumers the benefits of $3.2 billion in savings from a reduction in the payments they make to local telephone companies to connect calls to customers, known as access charges.
Officials said the cuts would have the biggest effect on the poor and those who use their phones the least. Rates would be reduced as much as 50 percent -- to $4.68 from $9.39 a month in a typical case -- for Americans who make few or no long-distance calls.
For consumers and businesses that make more long-distance calls, the government predicted reduced costs, though some consumer groups and Wall Street analysts disagreed with the government's estimates, suggesting they were too rosy.
The consumer groups and analysts questioned whether the significant savings recognized by the long-distance companies would ultimately be passed on to consumers. They also said that the government could not force the companies to pass the savings on to the consumers, who would have to rely on the good faith of the long-distance companies.
But officials said that when access charges were last reduced three years ago, the long-distance companies began engaging in a price war that drastically lowered overall phone rates.
The critics and analysts said, however, that long-distance companies had been slow to pass on all of the savings when the access charges were cut and that the benefit to consumers from the price wars was offset by new fees tacked on to their bills.
Critics and officials agreed that today's action would fundamentally reshape the economics of the telephone industry and that it was another big step toward deregulation. It is also part of an evolution toward a price structure in which long-distance rates will ultimately be like wireless and Internet service rates -- either a flat monthly fee or a fee that entitles the customer to a bundle of minutes.
"Today's announcement is a giant step forward in rationalizing pricing," said William E. Kennard, the chairman of the F.C.C. "This is the most dramatic reduction in telephone service prices in the history of this agency."
Mr. Kennard said the price changes would take effect in July. He said the commission's action was an effort to accelerate competition by ending several implicit subsidies.
Today's moves involved an agreement and an order by the F.C.C. They were the products of more than a year of intense negotiations among local and long-distance companies and federal regulators on issues that have divided the local and long-distance providers from the moment they were created with the breakup of AT&T 16 years ago.
Telephone executives from most of the nation's top companies applauded the order.
"When the results of today's action start showing up on customer bills in a month or so, consumers will see that the total cost of local and long-distance telephone service will be down," said Duane Ackerman, the chairman and chief executive of BellSouth.
"At the same time," he said, "those customers who live in rural areas that are expensive to serve and those people who need help paying their phone bills will be ensured affordable service well into the future."
Officials said that the companies had ultimately reached an agreement with one another and regulators because of several important trends, including the blurring of the lines between local and long-distance companies, the competitive threats posed by the emergence of telephone service on the Internet and the heavy pressure put on regulators by a Republican Congress to reduce regulations and let the marketplace play a greater role in setting prices.
As part of the agreement, AT&T said it would eliminate the $3 minimum monthly fee that it charges to millions of customers who make few or no long-distance calls.
Combined with other changes announced today, a typical monthly bill for an AT&T customer who makes no long-distance calls would be cut in half. For a customer who made 10 minutes of long-distance calls, total monthly charges would decrease 27 percent, to $6.87 from $9.39.
The order simplifies telephone bills by folding two separate charges -- one for the cost of telephone lines and the other a special access charge -- into one. It reduces an earlier announced rate increase for the combined items by 66 cents a month.
The centerpiece of the agreement, spelled out in the summary of the order that will soon be issued by the commission, reduces by $3.2 billion the access charges that long-distance companies like AT&T and Sprint pay to local telephone companies like Bell Atlantic to use their lines at the beginning and end of a call. The reduction amounts to a cut of about 25 percent in access fees paid to the local companies.
Commission officials said they could not precisely quantify the reduction for heavy users of long-distance services, and some analysts and consumer groups said they doubted that many of the savings would result in significantly lower bills.
"We hope that the F.C.C. will monitor this process to ensure that the $3.2 billion in long-distance company savings are translated into demonstrable price reductions for consumers," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union.
"Today's decision is a clear benefit for people who make few or no long-distance calls," he said. "But it still leaves consumers paying inflated monthly charges."
Scott C. Cleland, a telecommunications analyst at the Legg Mason Precursor Group, said that experience had shown that the companies had not passed on savings from reductions in access charges.
"The companies have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to not necessarily pass them on," Mr. Cleland said. "To the extent that prices don't fall, these savings increase long-distance profits. The companies may pass them on, but it will be over time."
Industry executives said the decision was part of a trend that will lead to long-distance fees' resembling the fees charged by Internet companies and cell phone providers.
"The pricing structure that these rules permit allows us to move more in the direction that will ultimately lead to Internet pricing or wireless pricing in the long-distance market," said John Nakahata, a former top official at the F.C.C. and spokesman for the coalition of telephone companies that signed the agreement.
As a result of the fee changes, local telephone companies stand to get a short-term shortfall of as much as $500 million over the next year. But industry executives and analysts said that lower prices should increase demand more than enough to offset the shortfall.
"This industry is growing at a rapid rate, and we're all realizing significant cost reductions," said Frank Gumper, vice president for regulatory and long-range planning at Bell Atlantic.
Traders on Wall Street shrugged off the announcement of the rate changes. There was no uniform movement in the stock prices of telephone companies, and changes were modest.
In a partial dissent to today's order, a commissioner accused the F.C.C. staff of making improper side deals with the telephone industry to gain its support for the order.
The commissioner, Harold Furchtgott-Roth, said that in exchange for the industry's support, the staff had agreed to waive certain onerous depreciation rules and rule favorably in a separate access fee proceeding. Both proceedings involve billions of dollars for the companies.
"To be clear, I do not believe that any employee of this agency acted in bad faith" Mr. Furchtgott-Roth wrote. "But I cannot escape the conclusion that the process by which this notice has been promulgated falls short of certain fundamental principles that govern the behavior of administrative agencies."
Both industry lobbyists and staff officials denied that any separate deals had been reached.

HEADLINE: Most Editorials Endorse Florio

 BODY:
Jon Corzine is easily winning the spending race, but former Gov. Jim Florio is emerging as the clear choice of newspaper editorial writers in the race for New Jersey's Democratic nomination for the United States Senate.
The Star-Ledger, New Jersey's largest daily newspaper, endorsed Mr. Florio's candidacy yesterday, calling him a "first-rate congressman and a gutsy governor." 
 The paper said the $2.8 billion tax increase that enraged voters was "probably" necessary at the time, with the state facing a $600 million deficit and the state constitution requiring a balanced budget.
Last month, Mr. Florio received endorsements from The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Chatham Courier, a weekly Morris County paper.
Thus far, his opponent, Jon Corzine, has been endorsed by The Times of Trenton, a Central New Jersey daily. Yesterday, the paper praised Mr. Corzine for business acumen, ability to work constructively with others and courage to campaign as a liberal.
"He sees government the way F.D.R., Truman, J.F.K., L.B.J. and Humphrey saw it: an instrument for addressing what he calls 'the great unfinished business of social and economic justice,' " the editorial said.

HEADLINE: Once and Again a Republican, but Always Libertarian

SERIES: IN THE RUNNING: Last of four profiles of the Republican candidates for the Senate in New Jersey.

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: TOTOWA, N.J., May 31

 BODY:
Murray Sabrin is waving a maroon-bound pocket-size version of the United States Constitution to make a point.
"This is our contract with the people," he said. "This is my agenda, if you will, to restore the principles here, to put a fire wall around the Bill of Rights." 
 Try as he might, Mr. Sabrin still sounds like a Libertarian, even though he is running for the United States Senate as a Republican.
He wants to eliminate the federal income tax, and while other politicians decry urban sprawl, he sees no problem with it. He has had it with demands for political correctness and affirmative action and gun control.
Mr. Sabrin, 53, ran for governor three years ago on the Libertarian Party ticket, raised enough in contributions to qualify for public funds, and picked up more than 100,000 votes, something that no other third-party candidate for statewide office in New Jersey had ever done. He still came in a distant third, but not before worrying Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who won a narrow re-election victory, that he was taking away some of her more conservative constituents.
And now he is back, in a new incarnation as a Republican, but sounding very much like the old Murray Sabrin.
"The theme of this campaign is that we want to end political correctness," he said recently. "The government shouldn't be establishing or mandating preference programs."
Mr. Sabrin, a professor of finance at Ramapo College in Mahwah, may have changed parties, but he is clearly still the odd man out in this race, a crowded one with four candidates vying in Tuesday's primary. The other Republicans are State Senator William Gormley, United States Representative Robert D. Franks and the Essex County executive, James W. Treffinger.
If the outcome is determined in part on ties to party leaders, it is clear that this will be a party to which Mr. Sabrin was not invited.
"I don't consider Murray Sabrin a Republican," said Chuck Haytaian, the chairman of the state Republican Party, practically sputtering.
"I think he's a Libertarian with some very outlandish views. He should not be running in this primary," Mr. Haytaian said.
But party rules say anyone who gathers 1,000 names on a petition can run in a primary, and Mr. Sabrin did just that.
Mr. Sabrin may have won 114,000 votes in the 1997 election for governor, but that was less than 5 percent of the total, said Tom Wilson, Mrs. Whitman's campaign manager then. Mr. Wilson said Mr. Sabrin remained a fringe candidate with no real chance of winning the nomination.
"New Jersey Republicans are, for the most part, open-minded, inclusive, progressive, mainstream, middle-of-the-road, moderate type Republicans," he said. "Will he get some votes? Of course he will. There are people who choose to use their vote to send a message to the establishment or whoever that they don't like the status quo."
So far, Mr. Sabrin has raised $328,000, but that is small compared with what his opponents have raised. One of them, Mr. Gormley, has raised $2.4 million. Mr. Wilson said that was another strong indicator of the limited support for Mr. Sabrin.
"Murray Sabrin is the Lyndon LaRouche of New Jersey," Mr. Wilson said. "He can put his name on the ballot any time he wants, but he's making a joke of the whole electoral process."
Mr. Sabrin says the Republican Party needs the kind of agenda he is offering. "Last time around, the Republican candidate didn't get that marginal voter that's going to elect a Republican in the state, the pro-lifers and the Second Amendment voters," he said. "That's who will vote for me."
His supporters tend to sound a lot like he does.
"He's developed a following of people like me who are just fed up to their ears with what's going on in Washington," said Frank Reick, an inventor and businessman in Washington Township who, along with his wife has donated about $15,000 to Mr. Sabrin's campaigns since 1997. "I'm a firm believer in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and so is Murray."
Mr. Sabrin has been endorsed in this race by New Jersey Right to Life and by the Association of Rifle and Pistol Clubs. He wants to legislatively overturn the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, and is very much against any gun controls. But he is not, he insists, anti-government. If he must be reduced to a label, he said he was for limited government.
"If I were truly anti-government, I would be in the hills somewhere opting out, and I'm not," he said recently, sitting in his campaign office in a shopping mall here, an American flag behind him, and an autographed photograph of Rush Limbaugh in front of him on his desk. "I am the only candidate who has true conservative grass-roots support. "
Mr. Sabrin was born in Germany to parents who were the only ones in their family to survive the Holocaust. He grew up in the Bronx and attended the Bronx High School of Science and Hunter College. His first job was as a teacher in New York City.
He went on to get his Ph.D. in economic geography from Rutgers University, and worked as an analyst and economist. He has taught at Ramapo College since 1985.
Mr. Sabrin bristles at criticism that while he calls for limited government and low taxes and no social safety net, he has benefited from attending a tuition-free college, and he works for a public college.
"To criticize me is extremely mean-spirited," he said. "I went to college before I had read anything about Libertarian ideas. It was an opportunity that was available." The public college he teaches at, Mr. Sabrin adds, raises a significant part of its budget from tuition.
He also said he was not surprised that many of his opponents were criticizing his change of parties after he lost as a Libertarian. He is merely returning to the party he belonged to in his youth, he said.
"I joined the Republican Party in 1969 with the views of freedom and individual liberties and free enterprise and an adequate national defense," he said.
"Those were my core beliefs then, and they haven't wavered one bit. I was a Republican long before I even heard the term Libertarian."
He is stung that he is sometimes the only one of the four candidates not invited to take part in some of the debates or forums that have been held throughout the state. And he knows the Republican Party leaders would rather he not be running under their banner.
"This is part of the process of the people in the Republican establishment wanting to make sure that the Republican Party is not much different than the Democratic Party," he said.

HEADLINE: New York and New Jersey Are Said to Be Nearing an Accord on the Port Authority

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 31

 BODY:
Negotiations to end an impasse between Gov. George Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman that has blocked major new projects by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are nearing a successful conclusion, associates of both officials said today.
Charles Gargano, New York's chief negotiator and the vice chairman of the agency, would not discuss details of the talks, but said, "We are at the point of submitting something to the two governors." 
 Lewis Eisenberg, chairman of the Port Authority board and New Jersey's chief negotiator, would say only that "we are close to a comprehensive agreement." While none of the negotiators for the two states would confirm that a final agreement was set, many who have been close to the efforts to end the 18-month logjam said in private that the final details were being worked out, paving the way for a long-sought meeting between the two governors. That largely symbolic meeting would be followed within days by a board meeting to ratify the accord.
At stake in the long dispute is the fate of a proposed 30-year lease to Maersk-Sealand, a major container cargo company at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal, that New Jersey insists is necessary for the port to remain competitive with other East Coast ports.
New York representatives on the Port Authority board, charging that the deal would amount to a deep subsidy for New Jersey, have refused to approve it, and New Jersey representatives have retaliated by refusing to approve two projects New York covets: privatization of the World Trade Center and the leasing of air rights over Manhattan's Port Authority Bus Terminal.
But all of those projects would get a go-ahead, said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, if the details of the emerging agreement were approved.
Six elements of that evolving agreement would appear to provide something for everyone. In an effort to assuage New York's concerns that New Jersey disproportionately benefits from agency spending, a $250 million pool of money, or "development bank," would be set aside for New York to spend on port- and transportation-related items over the next three years.
New Jersey would also agree to let the Port Authority lease space in, and thus help finance, the transportation and office center proposed for Manhattan's main post office building. In addition, New Jersey would end its opposition to a study of an increase in the $1 PATH fare, which New York has long considered to be unfairly subsidized by the Port Authority. Sources in both states conceded that this was likely to mean a fare increase by year's end.
They said the Port Authority would also invest development funds in South Jamaica, where a new terminal is planned to connect subway and commuter trains to a Kennedy International Airport rail link.
The deal being hammered out would provide New Jersey with the $120 million it had planned to spend to dredge major port channels, and with other concessions in the much-disputed valuation of the Maersk-Sealand lease. And it would require that guidelines be set to distinguish subsidies from investments in the region's transportation and commercial infrastructure -- a clarification that both governors have sought.
Kayla Bergeron, a spokesman for the agency, said it would have no comment on the ongoing talks.
The reports of a possible settlement come just a week after the agency's monthly board meeting, in which commissioners unanimously approved a $3.9 billion budget for this year in what Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Gargano conceded was a sign of progress in the effort to end the impasse.
At the previous month's meeting the board failed to even vote on the budget, a sign that talks were faltering. Then as now, officials had suggested privately that an agreement was imminent.

HEADLINE: Hope and Fear on Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Campaigning on Social Security" (editorial, May 29):
You say the comparison of the projected returns on private Social Security accounts versus the return on money deposited as taxes in the trust fund is "highly misleading" because the "economy is expected to slow over the next several decades." But predicting large swings in the economy is as uncertain as guessing how the Mets will do in 20 years. 
 Second, changing the law to allow the government to invest in the stock market is a horrendous idea. With the amount of money that flows through Social Security, the trustees of such enormous accounts could destroy companies that rely on the capitalization of the stock market. Furthermore, one of the government's main responsibilities is to regulate corporate America to ensure a fair playing field. A stake in the game would erode that ability.

HEADLINE: METRO BRIEFING

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:

NEW YORK
 
MANHATTAN: FILMING MOVED
A commercial scheduled to be filmed yesterday at Rikers Island using nonunion actors was canceled by Bernard Kerik, the head of the Correction Department, after the correction officers union raised concerns about crossing picket lines. The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have been on strike against commercial producers since May 1 over pay issues. A spokesman for Southwestern Bell Communications said its commercial would still be produced, but not at Rikers. Tina Kelley (NYT) 

MANHATTAN: GUN CONTROL BILL
Representative Jerrold L. Nadler said yesterday that he would introduce an amendment to the federal criminal code next week to bar the sale of guns in kit form through magazines and the Internet. Mr. Nadler, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, said his plan would change the definition of firearm in federal statutes to include components of guns like barrels, stocks and actions, thereby barring their sale across state lines. Thomas J. Lueck (NYT)
 
BROOKLYN: PORNOGRAPHY PLEA
A Brooklyn man pleaded guilty yesterday to running a worldwide child pornography club on the Internet in which members traded pornographic images of prepubescent boys and girls. The man, Peter Giordano, 37, admitted in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to having created the online club named '#wOnderland' after "Alice in Wonderland." Prosecutors said Mr. Giordano operated the site from March 1997 to September 1998 and restricted membership to people who had at least 10,000 pornographic images. Alan Feuer (NYT)
 
NEW YORK CITY: MORE JOBS
New York is second only to Atlanta in the number of jobs created in the last year, according to figures on employment in metropolitan areas released yesterday by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employers in New York added 90,500 positions in the year ended April; Atlanta added 103,000 and Los Angeles had an additional 88,200. But unemployment in New York City, at 5.1 percent, is the third highest among big cities, after Miami (5.6 percent) and Los Angeles (5.2 percent). Leslie Eaton (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: EAST SIDE ATTACKS
Two women were attacked within 10 minutes on the Upper East Side, but the police said no evidence thus far linked the attacks to an East Side rapist sought in assaults on at least 16 women. The first attack occurred Tuesday at 11:59 a.m. at East 92nd Street and Lexington Avenue, and the second at 12:08 p.m. at 93rd Street and Fifth Avenue, four blocks away. In both cases, the attackers fled when the women screamed. (AP)
 
MANHATTAN: HOSPITAL REVIEW
Beth Israel Medical Center has begun an outside review prompted by the case of Dr. Allan Zarkin, the obstetrician who carved his initials into a patient's abdomen after delivering her baby. The hospital has hired consultants from the Greeley Company, to recommend improvements in quality control and employee screening, as required under sanctions from the State Department of Health. Beth Israel must make improvements within a month of getting the consultants' reports. Edward Wong (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: INVESTIGATION SOUGHT
Asian-American groups demanded yesterday that the federal government look into possible violations of civil rights laws in an attack on Asian students at the State University of New York in Binghamton on Feb. 27. The assault left a student with a fractured skull. The three suspects are white members of the school's wrestling team. The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund began a letter-writing campaign yesterday to urge the Justice Department to open an investigation. (AP)
 
SARATOGA SPRINGS: PLAN FOR HUDSON
An independent panel of scientists last night endorsed the Environmental Protection Agency's conclusion that industrial chemicals in the upper Hudson River pose a cancer risk to people who regularly eat fish caught north of Poughkeepsie. The decision clears the way for the agency to decide how to clean up the river's last substantial form of pollution by the end of the year. The contamination consists of tons of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, chemicals that were dumped from two General Electric factories 200 miles upriver from Manhattan until 1977.

MONTVALE: PRANK GOES AWRY
Senior Prank Day at Pascack Hills High School started last Thursday with a joke and ended with an ambulance when the principal was hospitalized with chest pains. Just before 10 a.m., a group of seniors, prompted by a secret cue over the school intercom, released hundreds of rubber balls, about 50 crickets and about a dozen mice and rats, students said yesterday. Officials questioned a senior girl about the intercom cue and some students walked out in protest. Two false fire alarms then sounded within an hour, prompting the school's 600 students to evacuate. After the alarms, the principal, Manual Ferreira, was taken to a hospital and underwent angioplasty for a clogged artery. Robert Hanley (NYT)
 
PATERSON: SCHOOLS PLAN
Paterson's public school system on Tuesday unveiled a five-year plan to build 11 schools for $570 million. Several of Paterson's schools are more than 100 years old. (AP)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
GREENWICH: DEMOLITION PLAN
The town has granted a permit to raze a house where a teenager was slain 25 years ago. Michael Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, has been charged in the murder of 15-year-old Martha Moxley, who was beaten to death. The move ends uncertainty over whether lawyers would seek to delay demolition so that eventual jurors might view the crime scene. It was not known why the current owners of the 18-room house want to tear it down. (AP)
 
STORRS: NEW LAW DEAN
Nell Jessup Newton, a leading authority on American Indian law, will become the first woman to be dean of the University of Connecticut School of Law. Ms. Newton, dean of the University of Denver College of Law, will succeed Hugh Macgill, dean for 10 years. Theresa Crapanzano (NYT)

HEADLINE: Schools Chief Hears Parents' Concerns Firsthand

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
In his first major attempt to communicate with parents, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy held a town meeting in Queens last night and fielded questions on standardized testing, sex education, summer school and other topics.
Several hundred parents, grandparents, teachers and others filled the auditorium at Francis Lewis High School in Flushing to hear the new chancellor speak. Mr. Levy, who became the permanent chancellor just two weeks ago, stood in front with a microphone as dozens of people waited in two long lines to ask questions. 
 Mr. Levy did not always give the answers they wanted to hear. When one mother asked if her son's school district could get better after-school programs, Mr. Levy replied that continuing training for teachers was more important. "It's a finite pool of money," he said. "If we had more, we'd do more."
And when another mother, Debra Artis of Flushing, complained about the new requirement that every student pass the State Regents exams to graduate, Mr. Levy vigorously defended the requirement. "If you can't read and you can't do math, there's not going to be a place for you in the new economy," Mr. Levy told her.
Afterward, Ms. Artis said she thought Mr. Levy's comments were insensitive and short-sighted.
"His attitude was like, 'You're stuck with it and you have no option,' " Ms. Artis said. "It's unfair because kids like my daughter are getting frustrated and it's causing them to drop out."
But Ms. Artis and another mother, Maxine Kupersmith of Flushing, praised Mr. Levy for allowing parents to vent their frustrations to him in person.
"It's very nice of him to take the time to do this," said Ms. Kupersmith, who has a son in the ninth grade. "He's not giving definite answers but at least he's listening."
New York City chancellors have long weathered criticism from parents for not involving them enough in policy decisions. Mr. Levy said last night that it would be an enormous challenge, but promised to make it a priority. He plans to hold one town meeting a month, starting in September, and to communicate with parents on talk radio shows.
"What I take away from this," Mr. Levy said after taking questions for two hours, "is a great sense of frustration with the inability to get the message across."

Minimum-Wage Rise Gets Pataki Support

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he supports the idea of increasing the minimum wage, as long as doing so does not negatively affect some economically disadvantaged areas of New York.
"I think it's the right thing to do, but it has to be done in such a way that it doesn't hurt the economic competitiveness of New York State," Governor Pataki said in Albany. 
 The governor said he was not sure whether regions with high unemployment rates, like the Catskills and the Adirondacks, would benefit or be harmed by legislation providing for a minimum wage increase.
Both houses of the State Legislature are considering bills that would increase the minimum wage to $6.75 from $5.15.

HEADLINE: In Bayonne, Blue-Collar Backlash Over Corzine's Spending

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: BAYONNE, N.J., May 30

 BODY:
The crash of bowling pins. Fifty-cent Budweisers. The Jersey Devils on the big television beating the pants off their Stanley Cup rivals.
Life doesn't get much better at the Knights of Columbus lounge, a dark and smoky cocoon where generations of stevedores, crane operators and refinery workers have drunk away their daily aches. 
 During a break in the hockey game, it was time again for the politicians to sell their wares. Like clockwork, the guy with the bold ideas and the bottomless bank account appeared on the bar's half-dozen screens.
Lou Rodrique, 75, drained his glass of beer as Jon S. Corzine, the Wall Street multimillionaire, took over the room. Through the din, an announcer could be heard saying something nasty about former Gov. Jim Florio, Mr. Corzine's opponent in next Tuesday's Democratic primary for the United States Senate. Mr. Rodrique, a World War II Navy veteran who worked at the Exxon refinery until it followed the other oil companies out of town, turned away and nearly spat with disdain.
"I just don't get it," he said. "I don't trust a guy who's spending this kind of money for a job that pays so little. There's gotta be something in it for him."
In a few short weeks, Mr. Corzine's $30 million juggernaut has transformed him from an obscure hopeful into a household name who, recent polls say, is the man to beat. But if the diehard Democrats in this fraying blue-collar town are any indication, Mr. Corzine may be overdoing his lavish spending campaign, one that is quickly making this Senate race the most expensive in American history.
There is little love expressed for elected officials here in Bayonne, and many residents still curse the tax increase championed by Mr. Florio a decade ago when he was governor. But even though Mr. Corzine bills himself as the independent outsider, his relentless advertising blitz and bottomless war chest are spurring a quiet backlash in some quarters.
Despite the support Mr. Corzine has won from Bayonne's Democratic leadership and the state's largest labor unions, many voters here say they will cast their lot with Mr. Florio, a man some now see as an embattled underdog, someone who might understand what it's like to be frustrated by a changing world.
"They're all a bunch of lying crooks," said Mr. Rodrique with the swat of his hand. "But I go for the little guy."
Then there is Joe Paszek, 44, a local postal worker who admits he is not following the race but is sure of one thing: "I'm sick of all those Corzine ads."
Sipping a beer at the Big Apple, a popular sports bar studded with 30 television screens, Mr. Paszek did not have to wait long before his gripe was borne out. "You see, you can't avoid the guy," he said. "Yuck."
In interviews, it was not hard to find those enchanted by Mr. Corzine and his commercials, although many confessed they had little sense of what the former Goldman Sachs executive stood for.
For some, it is enough to cheer on the person who is not Mr. Florio, a man many blame for the $2.8 million tax that was enacted while he was governor. For others, like George Bowe, 66, Mr. Corzine's self-generated wealth is to be admired. "It's not like he robbed a bank," said Mr. Bowe, a truck driver. "Either way, he's coming from nowhere, so he's got to get his name out there."
And then there are those like Tommy Akel, 40, a shaggy-haired longshoreman, who says Mr. Corzine's riches make him a free man. "No one can tell him what to do," said Mr. Akel, who plays the drums in a heavy-metal band called Attacker. "If he wins, they can't hold nothing over his head."
Still, up and down Broadway, the town's ailing commercial strip, most people held little hope that either candidate would have any impact on their two-square-mile peninsula.
Once a working man's paradise, Bayonne has lost nearly all of its big employers in recent years, from Texaco, which left behind 40 acres of tainted land, to the Army, which last year abandoned the Military Ocean Terminal, a huge complex that once employed 2,500 people.
Despite all the changes, Bayonne has weathered its economic traumas relatively well. Taxes are high, but crime is low and the schools are still among the best in Hudson County. The city of 61,000 has always been cushioned from the outside world by the water on three sides.
Unlike most of urban New Jersey, and especially its closest neighbors, Newark, Jersey City and Elizabeth, Bayonne is still dominated by ethnic whites, mostly the children of Polish, Italian and Irish immigrants. It is the kind of town where American flags flutter on every other porch. Democrats here outnumber Republicans 10 to 1, although voters will gladly cross party lines for the right candidate.
Leonard P. Kiczek, a former mayor who produces and is the host of a cable program called "Bayonne Today," predicted that few residents would vote in Tuesday's primary. "Folks here are busy working," he said. "Unless there's a burning issue, they're not going to the polls."
Robert Bailey, an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers University at Camden, said that he, too, sensed widespread apathy among working-class voters. He said he believed that the indifference would only grow as more people learned about Mr. Corzine's $400 million personal fortune and unprecedented spending habits.
"I think it reinforces the perception that the entire political process is a money game, not a political game," he said. "I think this really busts the scale."
Mr. Corzine's strategists might be heartened to meet Mark Minski, a refinery worker and part-time student who was hanging out with some friends in front of Showcase Hairstyling on Broadway. At 25, Mr. Minski hasn't seen too many Senate campaigns, but he knows a thing or two about life in Bayonne. Jobs are scarce, taxes are high and politicians rarely speak the truth, he said. Although he hasn't been following the race, he said he had seen a few of the Corzine commercials on television.
"I saw the one that said Florio's tax hikes hurt the middle class," he said, as his friends nodded in agreement. "Well, we're all middle class. So I guess we're getting hurt. I'll probably support the other guy."
Down the block at Steve's Comet Shoe Repair, the owners, Jean and Steve Attardi, were sitting in the shop's shoeshine chairs, talking politics with an upstairs neighbor, Margie Dorzdowski.
Only one customer had come in all day, but that didn't bother the Attardis, who own the building and get by on Social Security. These days the shop, which they opened 45 years ago, serves largely as a social club for the couple and their friends.
Shouting over one another, their voices growing increasingly agitated, the Attardis bemoaned what they called a new era of big money and empty promises. Mostly, though, they pitied Mr. Florio.
"Corzine has got all the money; it's just not fair," said Mr. Attardi, 85. "It's just not fair."
"The right man never gets elected," said his wife, who is 80. "The poor guy never wins."
Mr. Attardi shook his head and made a sour face. "It never used to be that way," he said. "Why does he have to steal the election?"
And so it went, until Mrs. Dorzdowski, 78, a retired factory worker, broke in. "What are you talking about?" she asked gruffly. "Politicians. Rich or poor, they're all the same. They promise you the moon, and they give you nothing in return."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 3, 2000, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about resentment among blue-collar voters in Bayonne, N.J., against Jon S. Corzine's record spending in the Democratic primary for United States Senate misstated the size of the state tax increase championed in 1990 by his opponent, Jim Florio, who was then governor. It was $2.8 billion, not $2.8 million.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Rambling Amid a Springtime of the Arts in a Garden That Was Bloomsbury

BYLINE: By JOHN RUSSELL 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
"Bloomsbury" is the nickname never sought by those directly concerned -- for a group of friends and sometime lovers who began to see one another in or near Gordon Square in London in 1910. They included Virginia Woolf; her sister, the painter Vanessa Bell; Clive Bell, the critic and author of "Art" (1914); Roger Fry, the originator of two historic post-Impressionist exhibitions in London, in 1910 and 1914; the painter Duncan Grant, the economist J. M. Keynes and the essayist and biographer Lytton Strachey. They stayed together not as a self-promoting "group," but as people who never tired of one another's company.
"The Art of Bloomsbury" is the largest and most complicated loan exhibition ever mounted at the Yale Center for British Art here. What we see is a very large and tightly focused exhibition, but it is much more than that. In an almost subliminal way it gives us the freedom of a certain Britain in the first half of the 20th century. This was a time in which a handful of people provided the model of a civilization in which old ideas were called in question and new ones put quietly forward. 
 At the heart of it were three high Victorian families: the Stracheys, the Stephens and the Frys. Lytton Strachey, with his "Queen Victoria" (1921), pioneered the case for biographies that had something pertinent to say in every line but that did not go on forever. His brother, James, made the first translation into English of the complete works of Freud.
Their sister, Dorothy, married a French painter, Simon Bussy, and was for many years a close friend of Andre Gide. Henri Matisse, a former classmate of Bussy, was their friend and neighbor near Nice. Anyone who thinks that Bloomsbury lacked bite need only look at Bussy's little portrait of Lady Ottoline Morrell in the present show.
Duncan Grant, a pre-eminent figure in the Yale show, was a cousin of the Stracheys and went to school with the poet Rupert Brooke. Men and women alike fell for him on sight until he was well into his 80's.
The second Bloomsbury family were the Stephens. Virginia Woolf, the novelist, and Vanessa Bell, the painter, were the daughters of Sir Leslie Stephen, the first editor of the British Dictionary of National Biography.
Roger Fry's father, Sir Edward Fry, ended his legal career as a Lord Justice of Appeal and his sister Margery was principal of Somerville College, Oxford. He himself had been for a while at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was responsible, among other things, for the purchase of Renoir's "Charpentier Family."
These were high Victorian families, but they were not at all stuffy. "Uncensorious" is the word for Lady Strachey's attitude to the often wayward antics of her children. Nor did her descendants forget her. Some 50 years ago, when I first went to the Stracheys' house in Gordon Square, I found that the name-board in the hall still bore the names of Sir Richard and Lady Strachey. Though long dead, they were simply marked "Out," as if they had just gone round the block.
And now, on the title page of the catalog for "The Art of Bloomsbury," we find Vanessa Bell, painter; Duncan Grant, painter; and Roger Fry, critic, painter, designer and mesmeric lecturer on the history of art.
More than 200 paintings, drawings and sculptures are on view. There are enough autograph letters (none of them perfunctory) to give an interested visitor a long and happy day's reading. (A magnifying glass will help.) There are photographs by the dozen, and not one of them is dull.
Anyone who knew Leonard Woolf as a widower, quietly fading away, will be amazed by the photograph that emphasizes the trenchant virility that he radiated at the time of his marriage to Virginia Woolf in 1911.
There are also headsets on which one can call up recorded memories by veterans of the Bloomsbury scene. There are relevant books and manuscripts by members or near-members of Bloomsbury: Virginia Woolf, above all, but also Leonard Woolf, E. M. Forster and Keynes.
We see the books published by Leonard Woolf under the imprint of the Hogarth Press. Unmistakable Bloomsbury book jackets (mostly designed by Virginia Woolf) also abound. And there are pieces of furniture made at the Omega Workshops, which were directed from 1911 to 1918 by Fry.
Almost everyone in Bloomsbury agreed with the philosopher G. E. Moore that "loving friendship" and esthetic enjoyment were "the supreme goods." From 1910 onward a "loving friendship" is clearly present in many of the portraits on view.
Beginning with Grant's portrait of Keynes (1908), a great many of them are clearly love-tokens. Same-sex love affairs ran throughout the history of Bloomsbury, though significant reversions to heterosexuality could happen at any moment and sometimes led to genealogical havoc.
And the art? To begin with, the dedicated organizer, Richard Shone, gives the lie to the long-running opinion that Fry's paintings are not worth looking at. Fry's paintings of French landscape in 1912-13, and even more his wonderfully lively and truthful portraits of Iris Tree (1915) and Edith Sitwell (1918), have a candor and a directness that still take us by surprise.
Bell and Grant were loving companions for half a century, and she had a daughter by him in 1918. But in their work, their selves remained separate. Grant always had surprises to spring, from the hauntingly beautiful abstract image that he painted in 1915 in memory of Rupert Brooke to the apotheosis of contentment that smiles out at us in his "Vanessa Bell at Charleston" (1917). Bell, by contrast, could always make something memorable out of plain things and plain places, even as early as 1912 with her "Monte Oliveto."
The art of Bloomsbury was a conversational art, in which high drama remained latent. (Grant put more drama into his "Parrot Tulips," from about 1912, than into any of the paintings that relate to his own life.) Nor were these artists competitive, either with one another or in the market. They did their own thing, in their own way, and they knew that it was part of a world of new books, new poems and new points of view in which they would always have a place.
 "The Art of Bloomsbury" is at the Yale Center for British Art, 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203)432-2800, through Sept. 3. In conjunction with the show there will be a two-day symposium (June 16 and 17); performances of "Vita and Virginia," a play about Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West written by Eileen Atkins (5:30 p.m. on June 20 and 21); and a program about the composer Ethel Smyth (5:30 p.m., June 22).

HEADLINE: Data Indicates Further Slowing of Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Two economic reports released yesterday pointed to a further slowdown in the economy, with growth in construction and manufacturing slackening this spring.
While the latest government figures added to evidence that six interest rate increases in less than a year by the Federal Reserve are having an effect, analysts said more rate increases were in store. 
 In one of the first major readings on May, an industry group said yesterday that growth of the manufacturing economy slowed considerably in May. The survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management also reported fewer price increases for raw materials, and an executive of the group said it appeared that such inflationary pressures peaked in March.
But economists say there is still reason to fear a surge in inflation, as oil prices once more are on the rise and as companies are pressed to raise wages to attract workers in an extremely tight labor market.
The monthly report on employment and hourly wages, scheduled for release today by the Labor Department, should provide clues on the labor market, where the unemployment rate last month fell to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent.
The government said yesterday that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose a modest 1,000 last week, to 286,000. Economists view anything below 300,000 as a sign that employers will have trouble filling jobs.
In another government report, spending on construction projects, a sector sensitive to interest rates, fell 0.6 percent in April, the Commerce Department said. It was the biggest setback in almost a year. Analysts had expected no change.
The purchasing agents group reported its overall index of economic activity in the manufacturing economy fell 1.7 points, to 53.2 in May, the lowest reading since February 1999. Any reading above 50 indicates growth. Analysts had expected 55.2.
The index of raw materials prices dropped 10.2 points, to 65.8, indicating that manufacturers were still paying higher prices for supplies.
Taken together, the reports were consistent in pointing to modestly slower growth. But economists said the reports were not likely to change the Fed's stance on interest rates a great deal this summer. Fed policy makers next meet June 27 and 28, followed by an Aug. 22 session.
"You have some tentative evidence of slowdown, but unemployment is so low, and the Fed wants to be very sure they have their slowdown in hand before they back off," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber in New York.

Prudential Ponders Stake in Japanese Insurer

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 1

 BODY:
The Prudential Insurance Company of America, the largest life insurer in the United States, has tentatively agreed to take a stake in the Kyoei Life Insurance Company, one of Japan's many faltering life insurers.
The two companies announced this afternoon that they had signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at giving Prudential roughly a 20 percent stake in Kyoei, while the Japanese insurer will receive a cash infusion of up to 30 billion yen, or about $277 million at current exchange rates. 
 The deal is effectively a rescue package for Kyoei. Its ability to meet obligations and cover losses was rated among the lowest of Japan's life insurers as of November. At that time, there was a 70 billion yen gap between what Kyoei had promised to pay policyholders and returns it received on investments.
"Kyoei started having financial difficulties and came to us to see if we could help them," said Kiyo Sakaguchi, executive vice president of Prudential and head of its Japanese operations.
Japan's life insurance companies are all struggling, burdened by policies sold during the economic boom years that promised a high rate of return. With the economy mired in weakness for much of the last decade and interest rates at record lows, they cannot now make enough on their investments to cover those obligations.
Over the last three years, three Japanese life insurers have failed, and foreign companies have bought four others. On Wednesday, Japan's regulators forced Daihyaku Mutual, Japan's 15th-largest life insurer, to quit the life insurance business.
But while Prudential is acting as a white knight, its stake in Kyoei will not entitle it to a management role. "Our objective is not to take over Kyoei but to help them with financial support and technical support," Mr. Sakaguchi said.
Prudential would become Kyoei's largest shareholder, however, and as such, might even play a role in the nascent movement here to increase the awareness and influence of shareholders in corporate Japan. "I do see that trend developing, but it may take a little while before shareholders here really assert their position," Mr. Sakaguchi said.
The two companies will also form a marketing joint venture to sell a combination of their insurance policies as well as other investment products. Prudential's sales and training model will be used in hopes of making the sales force more professional. Traditionally, selling life insurance has been a part-time job for housewives in Japan.
Prudential will also lend an investment expert to Kyoei to help the Japanese insurer find strategies to improve its return on investments.
The companies said they hoped to cut costs and increase efficiency by eliminating redundant operations.

HEADLINE: Sales at Retail Stores Showed a Rise of 4.3% in May

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Retail sales climbed in May with consumers buying housewares, appliances and summer fashions, many of the nation's merchants reported yesterday, even as higher interest rates and gasoline prices threatened to crimp spending.
Sales in stores open more than a year, a crucial industry measurement, rose 4.3 percent in May, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index. Rising wages and consumer confidence and the lowest jobless rate in 30 years helped fuel spending. 
 Sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's top retailer, rose 7.4 percent, in line with forecasts. Limited Inc. had a better-than-expected 7 percent gain in same-store sales. Sales rose 4.2 percent at Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of Macy's and other chains.
Some retailers -- mostly those specializing in clothing -- reported disappointing results.
Gap Inc. said sales fell an unexpected 2 percent, led by declines at its Banana Republic and Old Navystores. Sales also missed forecasts at Pacific Sunwear of California, Abercrombie & Fitch and Ross Stores Inc.
Same-store sales are a leading measure of a retailer's business because they exclude results from new and closed locations.
Several department store companies met or topped forecasts. Sears, Roebuck & Company said sales rose 3.5 percent. Forecasts ranged from 1 percent to 3 percent. At the J. C. Penney Company, which is trying to emerge from a three-year sales slump, sales rose 1.1 percent at its department stores, beating projections for unchanged sales.
At May Department Stores Inc., sales rose 1.2 percent. Analysts had reduced forecasts from about 4 percent after the company, which owns Lord & Taylor, Hecht's and other chains, posted disappointing results for the final week of May.
Sales at the Neiman Marcus Group, which sells high-priced clothing, rose 6.6 percent.
Talbots Inc., the women's clothing retailer, said sales jumped 29.4 percent, nearly double forecasts. The company kept markdowns to a minimum as customers splurged on merchandise at full price.
The Ann Taylor Stores Corporation posted a 3.1 percent increase. Forecasts ranged from a gain of 1 percent to 3 percent.
Several stores reported slower sales toward the end of the month, said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst at Banc of America Securities.
"Was it a demand issue or a weather issue or a fashion issue?" he said. "It's a little bit of each one."
Abercrombie & Fitch, which sells apparel to teenagers and college-age consumers, reported a 14 percent drop in sales, steeper than forecasts for a decline of 6 percent to 8 percent.
Pacific Sunwear, which also sells clothing to teenagers, said fiscal second-quarter profit might miss forecasts because of slower-than-expected sales. Sales in May rose just 0.5 percent.
The Target Corporation's sales rose 1.5 percent, led by a 2.6 percent gain at its discount chain. That compares with a 6.3 percent increase in May 1999, when sales at Target stores jumped 7.4 percent. The company also owns the Mervyn's, Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field's department stores.

HEADLINE: North Korean in China for 3 Secret Days

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 1

 BODY:
China and North Korea confirmed today that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, was here this week for three days of secret meetings. The trip was the reclusive Mr. Kim's first journey abroad since he succeeded his father as leader in 1994 and his first visit to China since 1983.
Mr. Kim, 58, "the great leader," as he is called at home, took advantage of the trip to visit China's leading computer manufacturer, the Legend Group, as well as the imperial gate at Tiananmen Square, the Chinese reported. 
Occurring two weeks before Mr. Kim's scheduled meeting with President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, the trip appeared to be aimed at shoring up ties with China, the lone important ally of economically stricken North Korea.
China is eager to avoid serious instability in the region or a collapse of the Pyongyang government that might draw South Korean involvement or, perhaps, even American troops, to its border. China has encouraged the North to engage in peace talks and to open its economy to foreign trade and investment.
China fought alongside North Korea against the United States and South Korea in the Korean War and was long an ally in Communism. But relations became strained in 1992, when Beijing extended diplomatic recognition to economically thriving South Korea, and they have only slowly recovered.
On Mr. Kim's visit, from Monday to Wednesday, he was the guest of honor at a banquet given by President Jiang Zemin and met separately with other leaders, including Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, Vice President Hu Jintao and Li Peng, the former Prime Minister who heads the legislature. Mr. Kim was accompanied by top military and political officials.
The two sides reached an "important consensus" on bilateral and regional issues of common concern, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, Zhang Qiyue, said this evening, declining to be specific. "Bilateral relations were raised to a new level."
China also made new promises of food and other aid for North Korea, Ms. Zhang said at a briefing.
A short announcement today from the official North Korean news agency -- as in the case of China's issued only after Mr. Kim had completed his overnight train journey and was safely back home -- described an "unshakable will" to develop friendship with China and said, "Consensus was reached on all matters discussed."
North Korea has tried to break out of its isolation, opening relations with Italy and Australia and holding talks with Japan and the United States.
In footage of their meeting shown on Chinese television tonight, Mr. Kim wore a gray Mao-style jacket, and Mr. Jiang wore a Western-style suit and tie.
Ms. Zhang declined to explain the extreme secrecy surrounding the trip, saying, "We think this is a normal visit."
But other Chinese officials said privately the North Koreans had insisted that the visit be kept secret until Mr. Kim's return to Pyongyang, and they suggested that he was concerned about his security or the possibility of a coup attempt.
In public, the Chinese were all smiles, stressing that the longstanding friendship between the two countries had been strengthened. Mr. Jiang told his guest that China welcomed the talks between North and South Korean leaders scheduled from June 12 to June 14 in Pyongyang, and "hopes the two sides improve their relationship," the New China News Agency reported.
Chinese officials have said in private they find the North Koreans unpredictable and frustrating, as well as too proud to accept openly Chinese coaching on economics or foreign policy. The official accounts today from China seemed intended to help the North Koreans save face, avoiding mention of issues that have strained relations.
Mr. Jiang was quoted as praising North Korea's economic achievements, even though it has suffered a severe decline and food shortages that have sent hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing to China.
China was angered last year when North Korea tested a long-range missile, frightening Japan and spurring stronger efforts by Japan and the United States to develop antimissile defenses, which China strongly opposes.
Ms. Zhang would not say whether the issue had been discussed, but restated China's hope to avoid any arms race in the region or any proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
China has for years encouraged North Korea to begin opening its tightly controlled economy, which collapsed after subsidies from the former Soviet Union ended nearly a decade ago. Officials refused to say whether Mr. Kim had made any commitments on that. But according to official Chinese accounts, Mr. Kim praised the success of China's economic reforms.

HEADLINE: Clinton Finds Germans Critical of U.S. Missile Defense Plan

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 1

 BODY:
President Clinton arrived in Germany for a three-day visit today and faced immediate criticism of his administration's plans to build a limited missile defense system.
In a 90-minute meeting with Mr. Clinton in the official Chancellery, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder added his voice to the chorus of European allies criticizing the administration's plan, telling Mr. Clinton that it could touch off a new arms race. 
 Standing beside Mr. Clinton following their meeting, Mr. Schroder told reporters that the American president presented his views on his administration's position "in a very frank way." Mr. Schroder added, "I then went on and stated my concerns, concerns that we have to be very careful that any project does not re-trigger the process of a renewed arms race."
In an interview that will appear in Friday's Berliner Zeitung, Mr. Schroder was even more forceful, saying, "Neither economically nor politically can we afford a new round of the arms race. No one can dispute the Americans' right to develop what they believe is right for national defense. On the other hand, we are partners in a common alliance."
Other German officials have warned that the missile defense would weaken military ties between the United States and its European allies. And they have accused the United States of overstating the threat.
In his own remarks to reporters, Mr. Clinton did not respond to Mr. Schroder's assertions. But in briefing reporters later, the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, acknowledged the criticism.
"He expressed his concern that we proceed with due consideration for the impact on others, including Europe," Mr. Berger said in summing up Mr. Schroder's remarks.
A number of European leaders are concerned that a missile defense system could upset existing disarmament accords, particularly the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia, which must be amended to allow for the missile defense plan.
Neither Mr. Clinton nor any of his aides have made the point -- at least not publicly -- that the administration's plan is far less ambitious than one proposed by George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, who is ready to abandon the ABM treaty as a relic of the past.
But Mr. Berger stressed that the discord was "not at all sharp," adding, "It was a very intelligent discussion of a very complicated issue."
For his part, Mr. Clinton laid out the American conviction that it must find ways to counter dangerous emerging nuclear threats like North Korea.
"I'm concerned about how we proceed with Europe and their sense of comfort level with this," Mr. Berger paraphrased Mr. Clinton as telling Mr. Schroder. "But ultimately, I've got to make a decision in terms of national security."
Mr. Schroder's criticism slightly tarnished the opening of Mr. Clinton's visit to Berlin, the first by an American president since the city became the capital of a united Germany following the end of the cold war. On Friday Mr. Clinton travels to Aachen, the ancient capital of Charlemagne, to receive the Charlemagne Prize, awarded annually to a person who has worked toward European unity and prosperity.
On another area of contention between the United States and Germany, Mr. Clinton expressed concern over Germany's handling of child custody cases involving American parents.
According to the State Department, Germany favors German parents in custody cases and prevents American parents from gaining access to children living in Germany.
Two prominent cases involve Lady Catherine Meyer, the wife of Sir Christopher Meyer, the British ambassador in Washington, and Joseph Cooke, a New Yorker. Lady Catherine's two sons from a previous marriage were abducted by their German father; she has been allowed to see them for a total of 24 hours in the past six years.
Mr. Cooke has been fighting to regain custody of his two children, who were handed over to foster parents in Germany seven years ago after his wife, a German, fled there with them and declared she was mentally ill.
Mr. Schroder announced today that Germany would set up a working group of experts with the United States to investigate custody disputes involving American parents, but warned he could not interfere directly in the court system.
Mr. Clinton has recently come under pressure from an organized lobby of American parents who complain that Germany has violated conventions guaranteeing the return of kidnapped children.
Last week, the House of Representatives endorsed the effort in a resolution, voting 416 to 0.

HEADLINE: Chase to Lease Office Space In Jersey City

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
In the latest indication that the Jersey City waterfront has become a corporate haven, Chase Manhattan Bank, the second-largest bank in the country, is moving thousands of employees from Lower Manhattan to two new office towers at the Newport complex.
The Giuliani administration tried desperately to keep the bank from leasing space across the Hudson River, but the tax breaks offered by the city could not compete with a better deal in Jersey City. State officials in New Jersey dangled subsidies worth tens of millions of dollars, and Samuel J. LeFrak, the developer, promised to build an office tower within 18 months, according to real estate executives and local officials. 
 Chase's search for office space and bargaining for tax breaks recalls an earlier tug of war across the Hudson River, one that New York won. Twelve years ago, Chase had nearly closed a deal to move 5,000 technical jobs to a proposed 1.5 million-square-foot tower at the Newport project. At the last minute, Edward I. Koch, who was then mayor, got wind of the deal and persuaded Chase to remain in New York with the largest municipal tax break ever granted to a New York company: $235 million. The bank then moved the jobs and its computer operations to the Metrotech Center in Brooklyn.
The bank is joining Goldman, Sachs & Company, which recently announced plans to erect the tallest building in Jersey City, a 45-story, 1.6 million-square-foot tower at the former site of a Colgate toothpaste factory. Merrill Lynch & Company is building its own tower nearby, and Paine Webber, U.S. Trust and Lord, Abbett & Company have all taken large blocks of space in the past year.
Judy Miller, a spokeswoman for Chase, declined to comment, as did the bank's broker, Insignia/ESG, and Lloyd Kaplan, a spokesman for Mr. LeFrak, whose family owns the 600-acre Newport complex. But several executives said the two sides had struck a deal in which the developer would build two office towers totaling 1.1 million square feet for about 4,000 employees. Chase would move its staff from 55 Water Street and still have room to expand in Jersey City. The bank's headquarters would remain at 270 Park Avenue.
"We think Chase is an excellent fit," said Tom Gallagher, chief of staff for Bret Schundler, the Jersey City mayor, "and we welcome them as the latest Fortune 500 company to come to the Jersey City waterfront."
Michael Carey, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, did not return calls requesting comment, nor did a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Word of a pending deal was reported on Tuesday in The New York Post.
Chase's decision to move some jobs to New Jersey could renew criticism that the Giuliani administration has not developed alternative sites for less expensive back office space to house support staff in Brooklyn or Queens during the current real estate boom.
"This should be a signal to policy makers that New York needs an aggressive development policy to meet the growing demand by firms to do business in New York City," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Taub Urban Research Center. "We can't afford to let other firms follow Chase across the river."
Rents for prime office space in Midtown and Lower Manhattan have soared to $50 a square foot and higher since the recession in the early and mid-1990's. And few large blocks of space are available.
Many corporate tenants, in turn, have hunted for cheap space in industrial areas of Manhattan, as well as in Jersey City and Hoboken. Metrotech, the back office complex that Mr. Koch promoted in the early 1980's, is practically full. While most economists said that it makes little difference to the regional economy whether a company is located in Manhattan, Stamford or Parsippany, local politicians have competed to lure companies with billions of dollars in tax breaks.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said he was concerned "that high rents are forcing companies to reconsider their presence in New York. We need to look into how we can create more affordable back office space in Manhattan, or the surrounding boroughs."
Only recently, real estate brokers said, have major corporate tenants been willing to cross the seemingly wide cultural and psychological gulf between Manhattan and Jersey City, which was regarded as a backwater. They were helped along by cheaper rents in Jersey City, enormous tax incentives and a quick ride via a PATH train or ferry. Jersey City is now referred to as the West Bank of Manhattan.
"The waterfront is extremely active right now," said Peter Eppie, executive vice president for SJP Properties, which is building office towers for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in Jersey City and for John Wiley & Sons in Hoboken. "There are an awful lot of major companies looking at space, and the number of available sites is dwindling."
Last year, Chase announced that it was looking for one million square feet of office space in Manhattan and elsewhere. The bank talked to a number of developers about building a headquarters in Midtown and made what has become a corporate tenant's obligatory trip to Jersey City, if only to force New York into offering tax breaks.
But Chase changed its strategy earlier this year and abandoned its quest for a new headquarters as too expensive. Last month, the bank leased 14 floors, or 556,000 square feet, at 1166 Avenue of the Americas, which would allow it to move some employees out of the cramped headquarters building on Park Avenue.
Less than two months ago, Chase began negotiating in earnest with the LeFraks, who were starting construction of an 800,000-square-foot tower at Newport without a tenant. A confident Mr. LeFrak had already built and leased two other buildings last year and had bought the steel to construct a third. But executives who know him said he was wary of dealing with Chase because it had backed out of their deal in 1988. The developer told the bank that he already had a potential tenant, but whoever signed a deal first would get the building.
Chase also talked to officials in New Jersey, where the state offers new companies a rebate of up to 80 percent of the state income taxes the new jobs generate for 10 years. One person said the incentive package offered to Chase is worth about $100 million.
Meanwhile, the Giuliani administration offered Chase increasingly larger tax breaks if the bank would stay put. But, one real estate executive said, city officials were also slow to respond, in part because Mayor Giuliani was then engaged in the race for the Senate. The tempo picked up after the mayor dropped out of the race, but it was a lost cause by then. Chase had already decided to cross the Hudson, to where rents and other costs were 30 percent lower, and sign a deal for two buildings.
"Once they hurdle the river, you can't touch the economic benefits of Jersey," said one real estate executive involved in the talks. "No incentive package from New York could've mitigated the difference."
Mr. Koch said yesterday that he was saddened by the bank's decision. "I wish them well," he said, "but I can no longer refer to them as Chase Manhattan."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Jumps 5.34%, Its 7th-Best Percentage Gain Ever

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Technology stocks roared ahead yesterday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its seventh-best gain in percentage terms, up 5.34 percent. That performance followed Tuesday's record 7.9 percent rise.
The index surged 181.59 points, to 3,582.50, and cut the Nasdaq's losses on the year to nearly 12 percent. 
 After Wednesday's downturn, investors became re-enthused yesterday as the economic news of the day suggested that the economy was slowing markedly from the breakneck pace that had led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates six times since last June.
"We're beginning to see the impact" of Alan Greenspan's slow-acting but powerful anti-inflation medicine, said Frank Cappiello of McCullough, Andrews & Cappiello in Baltimore. "We sense that he's gotten near the end of raising rates. And if that's the case, then these tech stocks are woefully underpriced."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also posted a gain, up 28.21 points, or 1.99 percent, to 1,448.81, while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 129.87 points, or 1.23 percent, to 10,652.20.
News of slackened industrial costs and construction spending left many analysts unpersuaded that rate increases were near an end and that this spring's stock slide was over.
"I'm skeptical," said Byron R. Wien, chief United States strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He said the economic slowing was from a "very feverish" pace, suggesting that more Fed tightening might be needed, and that in any event corporate earnings growth was probably on the wane. "I would certainly have a defensive position" toward stocks, Mr. Wien advised.
In Atlanta, Robert M. Balentine, chief executive of the investment counselors Balentine & Company, took a similar view. "We're simply seeing some bounce off the lows," he said. "We would use the rally to raise cash for better buying opportunities ahead rather than think the worst is behind us."
And while the skeptics cited continued subdued trading volume as evidence that the rally lacked enthusiasm, there has been a clear improvement lately in the proportion of stocks moving higher. Yesterday, 2,061 New York Stock Exchange issues advanced while 927 declined, and new 52-week highs nearly doubled new lows, 68 to 35.
The ratio was even better for the S.& P. 500, where 353 stocks rose while 131 declined and 16 were unchanged.
Several Nasdaq issues posted double-digit gains, with the heavily weighted Cisco Systems up 4, to 60 15/16, having the biggest impact.
Hewlett-Packard, up 14 3/8, to 134 1/2, after a meeting that impressed security analysts, accounted for nearly two-thirds of the Dow's rise. Intel climbed 5, to 129 11/16.
Although the market for initial public offerings has been severely chilled of late, ONI Systems, a fiber optics company, attracted huge demand for 8 million shares it offered late Tuesday at 25. The stock started trading yesterday at 75, climbed as high as 86 and finished at 82 9/16.

Treasury Prices Climb
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices rose strongly yesterday after another economic report suggested that the nation's economy was slowing and interest rates might be near their peaks.
The report that manufacturing activity grew in May, but at its slowest pace in more than a year, followed similarly soft data on retail sales and orders for big-ticket items.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 30/32, to 104 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.94 percent from 6 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 10-year bond rose 21/32, to 102 11/32, while its yield declined to 6.17 percent from 6.26 percent.

HEADLINE: Mayor and Council Near Agreement on Budget

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration and City Council leaders are close to reaching an accord on a $37 billion budget for the 2001 fiscal year, although the proposed settlement could still be disrupted by state legislators in Albany, who might add as much as $1 billion in extra expenses, city officials said.
Representatives for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council want to try to resolve remaining differences on the budget package by today, city officials said, with a vote by the Council to adopt the spending plan perhaps as soon as Tuesday. The new fiscal year starts July 1. 
 The talks between the administration and the Council have focused on differences in the tax-cut plans, as well as some relatively small differences in spending plans for certain city agencies. As of late yesterday, the two parties were considering adding $150 million to $200 million in spending to the budget over the mayor's April proposal to supplement programs like recycling and day care.
As of yesterday evening, the negotiators had agreed to include a reduction in the commercial rent tax in the budget package, which, according to the mayor's April budget plan, would save businesses $16 million in the next fiscal year. And both sides are supporting cutting a surcharge on the personal income tax to 7 percent from 14 percent. For a taxpayer who earns $60,000 to $99,999 a year, that cut would save an average of $123, assuming the tax rate structure is not changed.
The budget negotiations this year have been relatively stress-free, because the city economy is booming, meaning there is a surplus in the current fiscal year of as much as $3.1 billion, which can used to help balance the 2001 fiscal year budget.
But the talks have been complicated because of legislation under consideration in Albany that could require changes in pension benefits for retired city workers that would cost as much as $1 billion in the coming fiscal year. City officials have asked the state to pick up all or part of the cost of this program, which would give retirees automatic cost-of-living increases in their pensions.
The city is also asking the state for the authority to borrow an additional $4 billion over the next four years, although so far it looks as though the Legislature is moving toward approving only $2.5 billion for the next two years.
Depending on what actions are taken by the State Legislature and governor, the city may not be able to afford the tax cuts that the mayor and City Council are advocating, officials said.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Declined 2% Last Month

BYLINE: ByKEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 1

 BODY:
Auto sales dropped 2 percent last month from May of last year, the first year-to-year drop since the summer of 1998. Dismal results at DaimlerChrysler and General Motors entirely accounted for the decline as other manufacturers posted record sales, leaving it unclear whether a long-expected decline in sales had begun.
Only one in five buyers of new family vehicles pays cash; the rest rely on loans or leases, for which the monthly payments vary with interest rates. As a result, the auto industry is usually one of the first to feel the effects when the Federal Reserve starts pushing up interest rates, as it has done in recent months. Many economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, have long watched for weak auto sales as an early indicator that the American economy might be slowing. 
 But if auto sales fell because of a slowing economy, many automakers would be expected to post lower sales figures. Instead, Ford Motor, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced increases in sales, with Toyota and Mitsubishi reporting their best months ever. Industry experts suggested this meant that the overall decline in sales in May was linked at least as much to specific problems at DaimlerChrysler and G.M. as to the pace of economic growth in the United States.
While the 2 percent decline in sales last month was the first since August 1998, when a strike crippled G.M., sales were still very strong last month by historical standards. Ward's Auto Infobank, a market data service in Southfield, Mich., calculated that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales last month was 17.1 million vehicles. That put last month's sales above the average pace for last year, the industry's best ever, with 17 million vehicles sold.
DaimlerChrysler's sales plunged 16.8 percent last month after the company tried to reduce its rebates and other discounts in May. The company announced on Wednesday that it was increasing its rebates and eliminating most low-rate auto loans as part of a new sales-incentive campaign intended to match the more generous discounts offered by its main rivals, G.M. and Ford.
May of 1999 was also the best month ever for DaimlerChrysler. "That is a tough benchmark," James P. Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, said in a statement.
G.M.'s sales fell 5.8 percent, as the company, the world's largest automaker, struggled to stay ahead of Ford in total sales. Paul Ballew, G.M.'s executive director of market analysis, attributed the G.M. drop to shortfalls in three specific segments of the auto market, rather than an overall weakening of the market in response to the Federal Reserve's six increases in short-term interest rates or rising gas prices.
G.M.'s sales of luxury cars suffered as Cadillac ran short of the new DeVille sedan, for which G.M. is still ramping up production after redesigning the vehicle, Mr. Ballew said. The overall pickup truck market weakened in May, while Korean automakers continued to expand their share of the small-car market, which G.M. once dominated.
"I don't think you can declare May some watershed of industry moderation" in the pace of sales, Mr. Ballew said in a telephone conference call with reporters this afternoon, adding that G.M. still expected sales to slow somewhat later this year.
But Haig Stoddard, the manager of industry analysis at Ward's, was more concerned about the industry's short-term health. "We're definitely heading at least into a stop in the growth we've had," he said. "But June should be a good month because now we've got all this excess inventory they've got to get rid of."
G. Richard Wagoner Jr., G.M.'s president, added the title of chief executive today, replacing John F. Smith Jr., who remains chairman.
Ford's sales crept up 1.4 percent, which still allowed the company to say that it had just enjoyed its best May ever. Toyota's sales inched up 2.7 percent to break a record set last year. Honda's sales rose 3.6 percent, Nissan's increased 11.5 percent and Mitsubishi's were up 31.3 percent.
The most recently introduced models sold best, the latest sign that American shoppers are becoming more conscious of the latest styles when it comes to cars. William J. Kirrane, Nissan's vice president and general manager of Nissan brand cars, said that his company's Sentra small car and Xterra sport utility vehicle were the most recently introduced models and had sold especially briskly even without incentives.
"The new products have really done well for us," Mr. Kirrane said.

HEADLINE: With Loophole, Carmakers Post Mileage Gain

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 1

 BODY:
A soon-to-be- released government report shows a slight increase in the fuel economy of family vehicles in the 2000 model year. But the rise is mostly thanks to a loophole that gives carmakers extra mileage credit for vehicles that can run on ethanol, even though virtually no one uses that fuel.
Ethanol is sold by only 108 of the nation's 178,000 service stations. Nonetheless, General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler are producing roughly 750,000 dual-fuel minivans, small pickup trucks and cars this year at an extra cost of up to $300 each. These vehicles are counted by the government as getting roughly triple the gas mileage that they actually achieve, allowing manufacturers to sell more full-sized sport utilities and pickups while still meeting federal standards for average fuel economy. 
 The government report, produced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, calculated that the average fuel economy for all new family vehicles sold in the 2000 model year would be 24.7 miles per gallon, after including the special treatment of dual-fuel vehicles. That is up slightly from 24.5 in the 1999 model year and the same as in the 1998 model year, but still well below a peak of 26.2 miles per gallon in the 1987 model year.
Without the benefit from the special treatment of ethanol, the overall number would be up very slightly from 1999, when many dual-fuel vehicles were also sold, and down from 1998, when automakers were just starting to build the dual-fuel vehicles.
The growing popularity of large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far less fuel efficient than cars has lowered the average fuel economy of the nation's vehicles in recent years. Automakers have made the big vehicles a bit more fuel efficient for this model year. But there are so many of them being sold that they have dragged down the average.
Fuel economy has become a political issue again this year because of rising gasoline prices, the possibility of shortages of certain types of gasoline in the Midwest this summer and growing criticisms of large family vehicles by environmentalists and safety advocates.
Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential nomination earlier this year, has used his position as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to order Congress's General Accounting Office to perform a broad review of American fuel-economy policies.
At Senator McCain's request, the review is focused on the safety, environmental and energy conservation issues raised by the fuel-economy standards for sport utilities and other so-called light trucks -- standards that are more lenient than those applied to cars. Pia Pialorsi, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Committee, said today that the report should be finished by August.
The 12-year-old law that gives special treatment to automobiles that can burn ethanol or gasoline also requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to prepare an extensive report of the legislation's effectiveness by the end of the government's current fiscal year, on Sept. 30. The law will make the fuel-economy calculations for dual-fuel vehicles less favorable for automakers in 2004, and manufacturers have already begun lobbying for an extension of that deadline. An auto executive who insisted on anonymity said that the industry was counting on support for an extension of the law from the farm lobby and from politicians who might want to impress voters in Iowa, which holds the first presidential caucuses.
Samuel Leonard, General Motors' policy director for fuel economy and air pollution, said the fuel-economy credits for dual-fuel vehicles were needed as an incentive for automakers to build vehicles that could burn ethanol, a type of alcohol made from corn, sugar cane or even waste paper. For many years, automakers refused to build vehicles for which alternative fuels were not available while the oil industry refused to distribute fuels that few vehicles could burn. The fuel-economy credits could break the standoff, Mr. Leonard said.
Environmentalists have long been skeptical of ethanol, mainly because there have been conflicting studies on whether it takes more fossil fuels to grow corn and turn it into ethanol than would be burned by gasoline-powered vehicles. Oil companies do not like to sell ethanol because it is so corrosive that it cannot be shipped in steel pipelines, requiring costly trucks, barges, and rail cars instead, said John Felmy, the director of policy and statistics at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington.
There have also been predictions of a coming ethanol shortage. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed the elimination of a popular gasoline additive, MTBE, which accounts for almost 3 percent of the volume of gasoline, and the use of ethanol instead. The ethanol industry says it can increase production.
The average fuel economy of new cars has inched up to 28.4 miles per gallon from 28.3 in the 1999 model year, the report said. But the average for light trucks -- sport utilities, pickup trucks and vans -- jumped to 21.2 miles per gallon from 20.7 a year earlier. Almost all of the automobiles being produced with the capacity to burn ethanol are minivans and small pickup trucks, like Ford Rangers with 3-liter engines and Dodge and Chrysler minivans with 3.3-liter engines, as automakers have struggled to comply with federal standards.
Safety agency officials estimated that labeling vehicles as capable of burning ethanol or gasoline had allowed Ford and DaimlerChrysler to increase the calculated average fuel economy of their sport utility vehicles and other so-called light trucks by about 0.8 mile per gallon in the 2000 model year. The benefit for G.M. is 0.4 mile per gallon in the current model year. G.M. has indicated that it plans to step up production.
The government's rules require each automaker to produce cars with a so-called corporate average fuel economy of at least 27.5 miles per gallon and light trucks with an average fuel economy of at least 20.7 miles per gallon. Gasoline prices have recently increased but over the last decade, adjusted for inflation, they have been among the lowest ever, and this has helped create demand for light trucks with poor gas mileage.
Auto executives have called repeatedly for Congress to repeal the corporate average fuel economy rules (known as CAFE) and replace them with higher gasoline taxes, but there has been no enthusiasm in Washington for such a move. "A philosophy of CAFE that doesn't have a corollary of fuel policy doesn't work," said James Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, in an interview earlier this year.
The giant Ford Excursion sport utility vehicle and a growing number of full-size pickup trucks are not included in the fuel-economy averages at all, because they exceed the maximum weight that regulators set in the 1970's for consideration as a family vehicle. G.M. and Ford told regulators at the time that they could not envision selling family vehicles weighing as much as their current models do.
Senator McCain's review and the safety agency's report on dual-fuel vehicles in September are unlikely to result in legislative action this year. The Republican majority in the House approved a transportation budget two weeks ago that for the sixth year in a row, bans the spending of federal money to revise federal fuel-economy rules. House Democrats organized an effort to remove the ban but then backed away from introducing the necessary amendment, fearing an election-year split between environmentalists, who favor stricter standards, and labor unions, which worry that American automakers depend on big gas guzzlers for their profits.
The Senate is tentatively scheduled to vote in two weeks on a nonbinding resolution calling for an end to the ban. Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, a state with no auto assembly plants and high gasoline prices, said that he hoped to do better than last year, when the Senate defeated a similar resolution, 55 to 40.
"I'm convinced we'll get more votes than last year, and we've got a 50-50 chance of winning it," Senator Gorton said.

HEADLINE: Lazio Tending to Stray From Strategists' Script

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: MAMARONECK, N.Y., June 1

 BODY:
As Representative Rick A. Lazio set out from the Republican convention in Buffalo, the immediate concern of his Senate campaign was not what he said, but how he was photographed. Everywhere Mr. Lazio went -- a vineyard in the Finger Lakes yesterday, a suburban schoolyard here today -- his staff members vigorously stage-directed the candidate and the news media, seeking the best photographs of Mr. Lazio's inaugural bus tour.
Most important, Mr. Lazio was advised to refrain from attacks on Hillary Rodham Clinton, because they might distract from these carefully arranged images. 
 That restraint lasted for all of five hours. Just past noon on Mr. Lazio's very first day out, at a small sidewalk rally in Watkins Glen, the candidate's high-minded and deliberately low-octane discussion of education and the economy gave way to a mocking jab at Mrs. Clinton's book "It Takes a Village."
By dusk, he was heartily attacking the first lady as a cloistered carpetbagger, suggesting that she was using the Secret Service to shield her from the press and the public. "We're not going to have a bunch of bodyguards to hide behind," he pledged.
The new Republican candidate for United States Senate has presented a conflicted message during these opening days of his campaign. At one moment, he has condemned negative campaigning and promised New Yorkers a candidacy grounded in his values and "mainstream ideas," a campaign drawn in a series of settings chosen to encourage picturesque, and not particularly weighty, coverage of his first official swing as a candidate for Senate.
But at the next, Mr. Lazio has gone after Mrs. Clinton with as much spirit as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ever did, before he quit the race for health reasons. "Being a New Yorker is more than moving into a multimillion-dollar house and putting on a Yankee cap," Mr. Lazio said at a rally by a golf course in Binghamton. Some of these discordant moments have even come within the space of a few lines in a speech.
Ideally, according to aides, it is the first Mr. Lazio that voters should be seeing for now. The strategy, one Republican said, is for Mr. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, to keep his guns holstered for the time being, allowing New Yorkers to get to know him for what he is and what he stands for, rather than as a harsh carrier of attacks on Mrs. Clinton.
To that end, he is intending to be somewhat vague and studiously noncontroversial, relying on carefully arranged pictures -- like eating a sandwich today at Katz's Deli on the Lower East Side -- rather than words to get himself known.
That this task has turned out to be more than a little difficult is, in part, a reflection of the aggressive nature and relative inexperience of the 42-year-old candidate the Republicans have chosen to send up against Mrs. Clinton.
Mr. Lazio, as Mr. Giuliani discovered when Mr. Lazio threatened to run a primary race against him, has a taste for political combat. But this is only his first race for statewide office, and a key skill for any successful politician is knowing when not to say something, a lesson that often comes only with time.
Beyond that, the conflicting signals out of the Lazio camp suggest the difficult terrain that the candidate confronts as he enters this complicated race. If this contest is going to be about Mrs. Clinton's shortcomings -- and that is, to a large extent, what his aides want it to be about -- he needs to make Mrs. Clinton the issue, and one way is by raising questions about her credentials, philosophy and character.
The problem is time. In a more traditional campaign, Mr. Lazio would have had months to quietly establish his credentials, biography and record in the minds of voters, giving him the foundation from which to attack his opponent come the fall. But Mr. Lazio is getting a relatively late start, because of Mr. Giuliani's delayed departure from the race. Mrs. Clinton has been campaigning for a nearly a year.
And the candidate is facing conflicting pressures from inside and outside his campaign on how quickly to proceed, which no doubt accounts for the different faces he has shown in the early days of the campaign.
Mr. Lazio has surely noticed that the applause lines that he uses in more high-minded campaign moments -- "We don't want to export any more of our children out of state, do we?" for example -- do not get quite the response from his audience (or the reporters covering him) as when he lashes out at the first lady as an opportunist.
And senior Republicans are expressing impatience with Mr. Lazio's emphasis on image over political substance, and are urging him to dispense with his slow wind-up.
"This is about connecting with the voters and identifying the candidate with the voters, as opposed to showing up in a nice picture on a daily basis for 30-seconds on the national news," a senior New York Republican said today as part of a generally unhappy assessment of Mr. Lazio's first run out. "There's a legitimate need to talk about Hillary's record and her stand on the issues."
Mr. Lazio and his advisers, in particular his chief strategist, Mike Murphy, are not known for being shy about going on the attack. But they are constrained by the history of candidates who have squandered their credibility by starting off on the attack, and this concern has been evident in the Lazio camp in the last few days. Mr. Lazio has chastised reporters who have suggested in their questioning that he is attacking Mrs. Clinton. And Mr. Lazio's aides were upset with newspaper headlines that portrayed Mr. Lazio as going on the attack.
Mrs. Clinton's advisers are not strangers to tough campaign tactics and, sensing the Republican candidate's discomfort, have thrown marbles in his path.
"It sounds like Congressman Lazio's bus took a wrong turn off the high road today, offering New Yorkers more insults instead of ideas," Howard Wolfson, the campaign spokesman, said moments after Mr. Lazio made some critical remarks about the first lady.
For now, Mr. Lazio's aides said that he would continue to steer away from engaging Mrs. Clinton as much as possible, hoping that with experience comes restraint. And they are not even trying to conceal their intentions.
When Mr. Lazio was posing with workers at a milk processing factory in Syracuse early this week, one of his aides noticed that reporters were spilling into the picture and shooed them to the back of the room.
"We're doing this for the cameras," he declared."

HEADLINE: Governors End Port Authority Rift That Blocked Billions in Projects

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman settled an 18-month standoff at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey yesterday, clearing the way for long-blocked projects worth billions to both states.
In a flurry of late-afternoon telephone calls, the two governors -- who had refused appeals from their political colleagues to speak to each other about the impasse -- put the finishing touches on a deal their negotiators have hammered out over the last several months. 
 The agency's 12-member board is expected to ratify the agreement at a meeting today, where, one member said, "the floodgates will open" when members vote on previously stalled projects and other deals reached in the negotiations.
In the governors' talks yesterday, Mr. Pataki agreed to end New York's opposition to a 30-year lease for the Maersk-Sealand shipping line to expand its operations at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal. The proposed lease had been the major cause of the disagreement, which has all but stymied an agency created 79 years ago to end bickering between the two states over transportation and port commerce.
Mrs. Whitman, in turn, ended New Jersey's refusal to approve two projects dear to New York: selling or leasing the World Trade Center to private interests and leasing air rights over the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
As part of the deal, Mrs. Whitman also agreed to a study that is likely to lead to an increase by the end of the year in the $1 fare on the PATH rapid transit line -- a step New York had long sought. The governors, who each control half of the votes on the Port Authority board, had been locked in a dispute over which state received more financial benefits from the agency, which built and operates all of the bridge and tunnel crossings between New Jersey and New York City, manages airports and seaports in both states, operates the PATH system and owns the World Trade Center.
In a joint news release, Mr. Pataki and Mrs. Whitman presented dueling encomiums to the agreement, which they said would serve commuters, shippers, travelers, the global marketplace and the long-term stability of the region. Their statement gave details on 18 specific actions that they had agreed upon.
"This agreement will ensure the Port Authority moves forward with important projects that will help spur economic growth for the entire region, creating more jobs and opportunities for hard-working New Yorkers," Mr. Pataki said in the statement.
For her part, Governor Whitman added, "It will guarantee the lasting prominence of our shared port in the global marketplace and will provide a foundation for the long-term stability of the port region."
New York officials have long contended that New Jersey, which is smaller and contributes less to the region's economy, has benefited disproportionately from agency spending.
Some items in the agreement that seemed aimed at addressing New York's concerns included the creation of a $250 million "development bank" for New York transportation projects over the next three years and the allocation of agency money for economic development efforts in South Jamaica, Queens, where a new terminal is planned to connect subway and commuter trains to a Kennedy Airport rail link.
New York would also benefit from the agreement's call for approval of measures to improve Howland Hook and Red Hook port and barge operations and its promise that the Port Authority will lease space in the proposed main post office and Pennsylvania Station renovation in Midtown Manhattan.
The agreement also calls for agency approval of the northbound connection of the Staten Island Railroad to CSX Transportation's Chemical Coast Line.
Among the gains for New Jersey in the agreement are the allocation of $120 million in agency funds for dredging operations that New Jersey had previously planned to finance on its own, and the sale of cranes to help modernize several cargo terminals.
The agreement also gives the go-ahead to the purchase and development by the port agency of a Jersey City site for port use, the privatization of the Newark Legal Center and a study of the feasibility of extending the PATH line to Newark Airport monorail connections.
While the impasse had not completely hobbled the agency, it had blocked the authority's major initiatives and spawned furious philosophical debates between the two states' representatives over whether Port Authority investments benefited the region, or just one state.
Differences over these issues had thrown the agency into tumult, threatening the agency's reputation as a can-do and efficient builder.
As part of the agreement, the governors have directed the agency board to begin two studies to try to bridge those philosophical differences and set clear criteria for projects. One study would modify how the Port Authority evaluates a project's cost, return on investment and regional benefit. The other would study the financial and operating structure of the agency and more throughly examine the allocation of resources between the two states.

HEADLINE: Plan for New Intelligence Post Is Shelved

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
An ambitious plan to create a post to oversee the government's spy-catching efforts has been shelved by the Clinton administration, largely because of strong opposition from Attorney General Janet Reno, federal officials said today.
The job of a national counterintelligence executive was proposed to answer widespread criticism of the government's efforts to combat espionage. 
 The official would have been asked to develop and oversee a strategy to protect the nation's secrets, trying to stay a step ahead of foreign spies by identifying what information -- in government and in industry -- would be the most enticing to other governments.
The proposal, the product of a yearlong interagency review, gained support from Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, and John J. Hamre, who until recently was deputy secretary of defense, officials said.
But Ms. Reno blocked the proposal, and some officials said they believed that her opposition was the product of her feud with Mr. Freeh, whose agency is charged with overseeing domestic counterintelligence.
In letters and conversations with other officials, Ms. Reno indicated that she believed the agency needed to solve its own internal problems with counterintelligence instead of adding a new layer of bureaucracy.
Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh have been at odds over a wide variety of issues over the past few years, most notably Mr. Freeh's recommendation, which she rejected, that she appoint an independent counsel to investigate campaign fund-raising abuses by Democrats in the 1996 presidential election.
Opposition to the counterintelligence plan, called CI-21, also surfaced within the F.B.I., where some senior officials were said to fear that it would erode the bureau's authority over spy-hunting operations.
And some Clinton administration officials said they believed that the interagency panel, formed last summer, had gone too far by calling for major changes in the counterintelligence structure without adequately consulting with other officials throughout the government.
"The idea of a new counterintelligence executive is probably not going to work the way it was proposed," a senior administration official acknowledged.
Still, officials said, many of the panel's ideas for changing the direction of counterintelligence may be incorporated in more a modest reorganization plan in the future.
A high-level review of counterintelligence is still under way within the administration, they said.
"It's clear that the CI-21 initiative has succeeded in focusing attention, and what will emerge from that is still evolving," said the Defense Department spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon.
Despite the debate over the proposed reorganization, there is widespread agreement among senior officials that the government has failed to keep pace with the rapidly changing espionage threats faced by the United States in a post-cold-war, information-age era.
Critics agree that the F.B.I., the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon have found it difficult to shift gears after decades spent keeping tabs on traditional adversaries, like K.G.B. agents working out of the Soviet embassy in Washington.
Today, as the sole remaining economic and military superpower, the United States faces a wider range of espionage threats than ever before, from both allied and unfriendly nations eager to steal information not just from the C.I.A. or the Pentagon but from corporations and research institutes.
France, Israel, China, India, Russia and other countries are believed to have turned their focus on the United States to obtain sensitive and economically significant scientific and technological information, as well as traditional military and national security secrets.
Intelligence officials made some changes after the 1994 arrest of Aldrich H. Ames, the C.I.A. officer who spied for the Soviet Union. But several officials said they believed that the National Counterintelligence Center, established at the agency after the Ames case, had largely failed to provide coordination for counterintelligence. The center would have been abolished under the proposed restructuring.
Flaws in the government's handling of some high-profile espionage cases, including the investigation of Wen Ho Lee, the former government scientist accused of mishandling government secrets, have underscored the need for counterintelligence reform, officials say.
In the Lee case, an 800-page classified report by the Justice Department has just been completed detailing the mistakes made both at the F.B.I. and at the Justice Department in the way they handled investigation.
The report is said to offer an even-handed critique of the government's failures in the Lee case.
The report criticizes the F.B.I. for its failure to aggressively investigate evidence that China may have stolen American nuclear weapons data, as well as its decision to focus on Dr. Lee early in that investigation. But it also is critical of the Justice Department for its failure to approve F.B.I. requests to wiretap Dr. Lee.
While he was never charged with espionage, Dr. Lee was accused of mishandling classified material after investigators found that he had downloaded large amounts of sensitive nuclear weapons design information and then copied it onto portable computer tapes. Some of those tapes are now missing. Dr. Lee has said he is innocent of the charges.
The reorganization proposed in the new initiative would not have altered the F.B.I.'s authority to handle criminal investigations into spy cases.
But it would have created a board made up of senior officials from the C.I.A., F.B.I. and Pentagon and advised by other agencies like State and Treasury. Its executive would have set the broad direction of counterintelligence strategy, and would had access to information about ongoing espionage cases.
"It's terribly unfortunate that the attorney general has seen fit to torpedo this, because the concept is very good and absolutely necessary as we face counterintelligence threats that are as great as ever," said Paul Redmond, a former chief of counterintelligence at the C.I.A.

HEADLINE: Factory Turnaround Reflects Economic Glimmer in Russia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: VOLOGDA, Russia

 BODY:
Don't look now, says Viktor Petukhov, but that Russian economy the world wrote off as a basket case two years ago is roaring back to life.
He is certainly right about the roaring part. 
 Inside a peeling salmon-colored stucco building near the center of this otherwise quiet town, Mr. Petukhov, the director of the Vologda Textile Enterprise, stood one recent day and surveyed the ear-splitting success he has wrought. Around him, a hundred mechanical looms clack-clacked in deafening unison, spitting miles of linen onto spools as big as car axles.
He said linen sales leapt by 50 percent last year and would grow by a third or so more this year. This from a company that was bankrupt and rudderless just four years ago.
"There's growth everywhere," he said. "All we need now is stability and some government understanding of the problems."
This is Russia's not-quite-open secret: the crash of 1998, the meltdown that wiped out Russia's middle class and turned the Kremlin into a global deadbeat, is over.
Its devastating aftereffects -- a sharply devalued ruble, the disappearance of imports, a government cut off from addictive foreign loans -- turned out to be fuel for an economy that had simply run out of gas. A landscape littered with bankruptcies two years ago now sprouts hundreds of Vologda Textiles.
The question is whether that comeback is real and gaining strength, or will run out of steam.
The Kremlin casts it as real, if shaky, and the numbers look promising. Industrial production through April was 10.3 percent greater than the same period in 1999. Russian exports jumped 50 percent. The average worker's salary, a meager $73 a month, nevertheless was up 7 percent in March over a year ago.
Companies and the government have begun to pay workers months and even years of back wages. Inflation this year is expected to run about 13 percent, far below the 1999 rate. Investment in new equipment and buildings is rising for the first time in a decade.
Most promising, Russia's budget now runs a primary surplus -- that is, it has money left after domestic spending to pay some of its foreign debt. In Washington in May, President Vladimir V. Putin's chief economic adviser told President Clinton that the Kremlin no longer needed to secure new foreign loans just to pay its old ones.
Mr. Putin now announces the good news personally, as in April when he disclosed a higher-than-expected increase in economic growth in the first quarter. By recent Russian standards, he boasted, "this is enormous growth."
He cautions, and experts agree, that it cannot last absent basic economic reforms. He already has proposed wholesale changes in taxes, including a flat income tax and corporate tax cuts, and despite concerns that the wealthy would benefit most, the changes appear to have strong support. Mr. Putin promises to announce equally sweeping changes in June. If they become law, his advisers say, Russia's economy should grow by roughly 5 percent a year, and inflation should fall steadily.
Other top government forecasters are less cocksure. They agree that the economy is reaping the economic windfall of the 1998 crisis. The problem, they say, is that the windfall has now been more or less exploited, and there is little to take its place.
"In the second part of this year, the positive influences will mostly be over," said Aleksandr Frenkel, the chief macroeconomics forecaster at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Economics Institute. "And the influence of negative factors -- low investment, a foreign payments crisis, a low standard of living -- may significantly influence economic growth."
Eduard F. Baranov, the first deputy chief of the government's Economic Research Center, says Russia's boomlet has been confined mostly to raw-materials exports and light industries like food processing and textiles. Major industries have mostly been left behind.
Companies like Vologda Textiles "are like little plants that give us hope," he said. But they are not the architects of basic reform that the economy needs.
"We still have the mentality of the old Soviet plan, when we didn't have to think about sales or quality or lowering expenses," he said. "We have to rebuild our organization at the molecular level. And it's going to take a long time."
The bears say the glowing statistics look a lot different when Russia's performance is compared with the months before the August 1998 crash instead of the depressed months after it. Investment so far this year is surely greater than last, they allow, but it still is only 92 percent of that during early 1998. Workers' real income is substantially higher than a year ago. But it remains barely 77 percent of what is was in 1998, and that translates into a lower standard of living.
"Wages haven't returned yet to their pre-crisis level," Mr. Baranov said. "And while salaries have increased, they have risen at a lower rate than prices."
A Russia that poor is hard put to generate enough domestic demand to make the economy grow. The statistics bear that out, Mr. Frenkel says: exports are driving the recovery, accounting for more than $8 of every $10 of growth in the gross domestic product.
Russian exports have boomed because the fallen ruble has made them exceptionally cheap while economic growth elsewhere has driven up demand. But most are raw materials -- timber, chemicals and especially high-priced oil. Exporting consumer goods is unrealistic; most remain too shoddy or poorly marketed. Some of those same goods have prospered at home because of another crisis-borne opportunity: the chance to fill the gaps on store shelves after the ruble's crash made foreign products too expensive.
But those gaps have been largely closed. To keep growing, companies now must attract new buyers -- no easy task in a nation whose products are not ready for export, and whose citizens are too poor to buy anyway. In fact, exports have slowed this year, and industrial output fell in April. So did the measure of business managers' confidence in the future.
All that seems at odds with the brimming orders at Vologda Textile and its kin. But in more than a few ways, Vologda Textile epitomizes the economy's two-steps-forward, one-step-back quality. Like the rest of Russia, this place has come a long way in the last few years, yet still has miles to go.
For 38 years after its founding in 1953, Vologda Textile was a worry-free place. Its 5,000 workers had state-guaranteed jobs. The bottom line was no concern: the state bought the output, too. In its heyday, the factory churned out 22 million square meters of linen a year.
But when Communism fell in 1991, Vologda Textile followed the rest of Russian industry into a black hole. The government hastily privatized it. Harebrained schemes that followed included a switch from making textiles to making jeeps. By the mid-90's, the company was bankrupt.
Vologda's regional government finally intervened, and in 1998 it dispatched Mr. Petukhov, a dour furniture-factory manager to clean up the mess. A mess it was, too. Workers had gone unpaid for three years. With a crippled factory for their product, farmers had stopped growing flax, and cultivation had plummeted to a paltry 6,000 acres in 1998 from 200,000 in the early 90's. Exports were a fantasy: the ancient looms produced only 100-centimeter linen in a world market that bought only cloth 150 centimeters wide.
That said, Vologda Textile had some advantages. For one, Russia was posed to prosper in the world textile business, if only it could control costs.
"In Europe, the textile industry is shutting down," Mr. Petukhov said. "Labor costs are very expensive in Europe, and fabrics produced in Europe are very expensive." The centers of textile production, he said, have been moving east to Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere.
Also, the region's government was already pushing the sorts of economic reforms that Mr. Putin is pressing on Parliament. The region's new governor, Vyacheslav Y. Pozgalev, exempted businesses from all taxes, provided they poured the savings into their companies. He lent flax farmers money and equipment. And he gave Vologda Textile a break on electricity prices, and a hefty order of linen to get it back on its feet.
It also helped that clothing is one of life's essentials. "When people's income fell after the crash, lots of them became poor," Mr. Frenkel said. "And when you're poor, all you can afford is food and clothes."
The crash of '98 solved Vologda Textile's competitiveness woes: almost overnight, the ruble's plunge made its linen four times cheaper to foreign buyers. Nationally, textile production shot up 20 percent in 1999, even as other industries struggled.
But none of that might have helped had the factory not bootstrapped itself into profitability. The work force was slashed to 1,300, ending the featherbedding that was a staple of Soviet factory life. The government shut the monolithic trade agency that marketed textiles abroad, so Mr. Petukhov began hawking his wares at trade shows in Milan, Paris and New York.
As in most Russian industry, new equipment was too expensive. So over a year, workers rebuilt 400 looms to produce 150-centimeter fabric and fired up a foundry to make hard-to-get spare parts.
The result of all the changes: Vologda Textile will sell six million meters of linen this year -- well below its totals of old, but enough to make a profit. Next year, the goal is eight million meters.
Exports have rocketed to 80 percent of sales, with Italy and the United States the primary customers. Mr. Petukhov also has paid off back wages. That helped workers, who make 31 to 46 cents an hour -- $50 to $70 a month -- for mind-numbing and unhealthy work. "American workers would never work for such wages," Mr. Petukhov grumbled.
On the assembly line, 37-year-old Tatyana Naidyonova, an apron covering her Harley-Davidson T-shirt, paused from cleaning a machine with kerosene and agreed. "It's not much money," she said. "But where else can you get any more?" Raises will have to wait until the plant can sell more and better linen.
Governor Pozgalev says private investors -- this time with experience -- could buy the factory by year's end. His eventual goal, and Mr. Petukhov's, is to move from a supplier of basic cloth to a producer of more profitable dyed and refined fabrics, and eventually to make and export clothes.
"We have only to solve the problem of the quality of our material and little by little increase the volume," Mr. Petukhov said. "What's needed is that in Russia we produce as much as possible, and buy as little as possible abroad."
That is a long way away. The factory still faces basic problems and Soviet mind-sets at every turn. One example: linen production is severely crimped by the supply of local flax, which is in turn limited by the state's utter failure to replace Soviet-style collective farming and sound management. So Vologda Textile has been forced to buy higher-priced flax from Belgium, France and the Netherlands -- which, in turn, is slapped with a 15 percent customs duty. That raises Vologda Textile's costs, and lowers sales.
The factory also has to navigate the Gordian customs office, which inexplicably follows the factory's processing of imported flax into cloth even after the duty is paid and the reedy plant is made into thread.
The factory is peppered with tags on various machines reserving them exclusively for imported flax under customs supervision. Asked why, Mr. Petukhov said drily: "We have a bureaucracy in this country. You probably have one in America, too." That may be solved soon; local flax production should jump by two-thirds, to 25,000 acres, next year.
For now, though, Vologda Textile must import some 40 percent of its raw material from Europe. That lifts costs. But it is a change that Mr. Petukhov savors.
"For once," he said, "we're importing our raw materials from the West, instead of the other way around."

HEADLINE: The Patterns Hidden In Market Swings

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
In recent years, the craggy peaks and sharp precipices of the common stock chart have redefined the American landscape. Charts flash on television screens and computer monitors, inspire animated debate and wild expectations, and become minor obsessions. Anyone who follows charts cannot follow them casually; too much is at stake. But anyone who follows them closely can be baffled by their vast swings, unexplained moves and dizzying plunges.
Of course, professional commentators would argue, these movements are hardly arbitrary. Among the reasons they offer for the ups and downs: changes in interest rates, shifts in foreign policy, technological innovations. And theories abound for how to predict the fate of a company's stock chart. 
 Some investors have championed "value" investing, in which a company's cash flow, future earnings and assets are rigorously analyzed; stock prices are expected to reflect a rational analysis of value.
One interpretation of stock market behavior, known as the random walk theory, has less faith in reason: prices randomly stumble around a perceived value like a drunk looking for a lost coin; no past price can tell us anything about the future.
Other theories argue that the future can indeed be anticipated by examining past activity through computer analyses of the rate of stock sales, or calculations of the averages of stock prices over the last 200 days, or examinations of seasonal price patterns.
Meanwhile, though, another set of techniques appeals to the hope that a deeper order can be revealed in the bewildering movements of the market. It is known as "technical analysis." As the Internet has turned the market into a mass market, this discipline, once the domain of professional traders, has entered the mainstream.
Software programs like Omnitrader and Internet sites like www.barchart.com bring the approach home. Television discussions of "support levels," and "consolidation," "breakouts" and "corrections," have made the vocabulary as familiar as a weatherman's references to low-pressure systems, pollen count and wind-chill factors.
According to the theory of technical analysis, nothing needs to be considered aside from a chart showing price movements and volumes of trades. Forget profit statements, business plans and inflation figures; ignore whether the company makes widgets or lays fiber optic cable. Investors, the theory believes, have already come in contact with all these bits of knowledge, reacted to them, judged their impact on other investors, and acted upon them. The result is a stock's price; commitment to that price is measured in the volume of trades.
Technical analysts examine charts, draw geometric shapes, connect points and mark off familiar patterns. Each pattern has a meaning in the analyst's lexicon, providing a glimpse of what might happen next. Some technical analysts, having seen a promise of pictorial order, go further, arguing that there are even more basic rules governing these shapes, rules that grow out of what they consider basic laws of nature and geometry; some get even more fantastical, invoking the principles of astrology. These latter hypotheses do not seem to have a major following, but few traders work without using some of the techniques of technical analysis.
In one classic text, "Technical Analysis of Stock Trends," (seventh edition, 1997, St. Lucie Press), Robert D. Edwards and John Magee trace technical analysis to ideas first advanced a hundred years ago by Charles H. Dow, a founder of Dow Jones & Company. The market, they explain, moves in long-term trends in which stocks rise or fall; those trends are subdivided into secondary or tertiary trends in which retreats and advances also take place.
The entire effect, they suggest, is like the ebb and flow of the tides, punctuated by individual waves washing against the shore, whose own surfaces are, in turn, shaped by more chaotic ripples. The goal of analysis is to identify places where the tide will change.
Charts can help, analysts argue, if their pictorial language is properly understood. These patterns tend to have geometric names like a "right-angle broadening formation" or pictorial names like "falling wedge." A chart might, for example, create a "head and shoulders formation," which is composed of three jagged hills, the central one (the head) reaching the highest point. These patterns and scores of others can best be understood as maps of human behavior, revealing ways in which investors act and react.
Consider one example: the "head and shoulders" pattern. When a stock's price is rising, analysts argue, the pattern is almost always followed by a reversal. Why? Imagine a stock moving from $10 to $12 and back, forming a "shoulder." It then rises again to $15 before falling again to $10, forming a "head." Finally another shoulder forms, resembling the first. Why should this mean the stock will fall from $10?
Well, think of the behavior this pattern portrays. The first rise is energetic, with heavy volume, but the fall back from $12 reveals some doubts. Some owners cautiously sell off a bit, but others may hold on as the first shoulder is formed. The head represents yet another burst of support. But though the stock reaches higher, the trading has less volume. Conviction is limited and the stock drops again.
Two such rises and falls might be thought inconsequential, but by the time the stock rises yet again, worry becomes palpable. The faith in the stock cannot be supported. Finally, the stock begins its extended fall, plunging below $10, which is picturesquely called the "neckline."
The uncertainty shown in this pattern might be affected by a company's fortunes, or the state of the economy, but according to the theory, interpreting the pattern requires no knowledge of any of this. "Head and shoulders" is a pattern caused by conflict; it reveals a gradual defeat of bullish optimism. And the pattern has the same meanings for any stock.
The theory of analysis then goes even further: rules not only predict broad patterns, they also provide guidance about the extent of a rise or fall. For analysts, charts almost seem to follow aesthetic principles. For example, analysts suggest that in the "head and shoulders" pattern, the second shoulder will tend to mirror the first, and the rise of the "head" will tend to be matched by the extent of the fall after the stock drops below the "neckline." There is something uncanny about such assertions; they are much more difficult to justify. But they reveal a determination to find order in the midst of seeming chaos.
Critics argue that these sorts of rules have so many exceptions they can hardly be relied upon; that patterns are best seen in retrospect, when they are no longer helpful; that analysts' ideas can becomeself-fulfilling prophecies. And indeed, while investment banks have technical analysts on staff, strict analysis is generally tempered by considerations of other factors.
But the effort to find pictorial order seems almost universal. The Japanese, for example, have used a 300-year-old method of charting known as "candlesticks," made familiar in the West after the analyst Steve Nison examined them in books like "Beyond Candlesticks: New Japanese Charting Techniques Revealed" (1994, Wiley). Instead of just marking the range of a day's trading with a single vertical line, as on Western charts, the Japanese create candlesticks: small rectangles whose ends represent the stock's opening and closing prices. If the price fell during the day, the candlestick is darkened (and is called a "long black body"); if the price rose, it is left unshaded (and is called a "long white body"). In candlestick charts, technical analysis becomes almost poetic, with patterns named "morning star," "hanging man" and "falling window."
But if charts reveal hidden patterns, some believe there are even deeper esoteric patterns guiding them. In "The Psychology of Technical Analysis" (1993, Irwin), which The Financial Times of London said would "entertain and intrigue keen investors," Tony Plummer, a British trader, argues that the ebb and flow of human activity actually follow a pattern that resembles the curve of the Nautilus shell. That curve, which expands outward without changing its shape, recurs throughout the natural world in various organic forms (pine cones, sunflowers, tree leaves). It is an image of a certain form of growth that, Mr. Plummer suggests, also applies to the large-scale actions of the marketplace. He argues that a properly drawn Nautilus curve -- and it is by no means easy to find the proper curve -- will intersect with the stock's highs and lows.
Major turning points in stock charts, other theorists have also argued, occur at intervals determined by the Golden Mean -- a ratio approximately equal to 1.618 that also determines the shape of the Nautilus curve. Similar arguments are made in "Fibonacci Applications and Strategies for Traders" by Robert Fischer (1993, Wiley) and are regularly described in survey texts like "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets" by John J. Murphy (1999, New York Institute of Finance). The quest for order would now seem complete: charts not only are rife with symmetries and patterns, but they also reflect a ratio that is considered one of the most beautiful in the natural world.
It is perhaps too much to believe, that the cumulative effect of individual decisions to buy and sell would create such hidden patterns. In fact, push the notion of hidden pattern a bit further and chart reading can even turn religious: the analyst Perry J. Kaufman devotes 10 pages to financial astrology in a scrupulous theoretical text, "Trading Systems and Methods" (1998, Wiley), a method few analysts would probably confess to using.
Of course, these assertions are not widely accepted; they are extensions of the theory, not exceptions to it. Technical analysis has its believers and detractors, but it is an unusual attempt to make sense of an exceedingly mysterious phenomenon.
After all, the market may be created by its participants but it is also independent of them; it reflects their will but also affects their will; its participants believe they are free, but their actions fall into familiar patterns. The chart is not just the record of a company's share price; it is the record of attempts to guess the future. It is a trace of human behavior. So what are we seeing when we examine these charts? Images of ourselves.

Unemployment Rate Rose To 4.1 Percent Last Month
In the strongest signal yet that the booming economy is finally slowing, the Labor Department reported that the nation's private sector employers shed 116,000 jobs in May. It was the largest drop in more than eight years and the first decline since the economy began to soar in the mid-1990's. 
 The unemployment rate edged up to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent, with blacks and Hispanics absorbing most of the loss. Wage increases, which had accelerated in the early spring, eased in May, reducing concerns about inflation. Jobs disappeared in almost every sector of the economy, except government, where the hiring of 357,000 census takers for the once-a-decade population count offset the decline in business jobs. Page A1.
 
More H.M.O.'s Are Exiting Medicare
More health maintenance organizations, including Cigna and Aetna, will soon pull out of Medicare or curtail their participation, disrupting insurance coverage for thousands of elderly people, according to federal officials, independent experts and managed care executives. Despite pledges by the Clinton administration to slow the withdrawal, the exodus may actually accelerate this year, a White House official and several experts said. A1.
 
F.A.A. May Ground Alaska Airlines
The Federal Aviation Administration threatened to shut down major maintenance operations at Alaska Airlines, which would ground the airline within months. The agency, its attention drawn to the airline by a fatal crash last January and a federal grand jury investigation, said that the carrier had a persistent problem in keeping track of whether required maintenance had been done, and that managers had not noticed the problem. A7.
 
Oprah Magazine Editor to Resign
The editor of O: The Oprah Magazine is resigning for personal reasons, forcing the owners of the top-selling women's glossy to find a new leader after just one issue went on sale. Ellen Kunes, a longtime editor of women's magazines, said her decision was prompted by "work-family issues" and had nothing to do with the way the magazine was run. C15.
 
Brazilian Pension Fund Controversy
In a political race that was major news in Brazil but little noticed abroad, a radical-left coalition now controls all three elected seats on the six-member board of the nation's largest and most influential pension fund. Two radical leftist candidates who won seats in an election last month began their terms Thursday, joining an incumbent colleague on the board of the fund, known as Previ. That gives them unprecedented power to block decisions that require a majority vote. C2.
 
Another Loss for Soros Hedge Fund
The hedge fund empire of George Soros continued to shrink as Duncan Hennes, left, who was hired last summer to be chief executive of Soros Fund Management, announced his resignation. "I was brought in to do one thing, and George doesn't want to do that anymore," Mr. Hennes, 43, said. That thing, he said, was to build a larger hedge fund business. Mr. Soros announced in April that his two top fund managers, Stanley Druckenmiller and Nicholas Roditi, were leaving and that the fund that made Mr. Soros famous, the Quantum Fund, would be renamed the Quantum Endowment Fund and changed in emphasis to reduce its risk. C15.
 
F.T.C. to Sue to Halt Kroger Deal
The Federal Trade Commission announced that it would sue to halt Kroger's proposed purchase of 74 Winn-Dixie Stores supermarkets in Oklahoma and Texas. The F.T.C. voted 5 to 0 to seek a preliminary injunction in a Federal District Court in Dallas. A Kroger spokesman said the company would explore its legal alternatives. Kroger has more than 2,300 stores in 31 states. C4.

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
At long last: Schadenfreude dot-com.
This has been a great spring not only for those rooting for the comeuppance of Bill Gates, but for anyone who has had quite enough of New Economy New Millionaires and their irritatingly unostentatious brand of ostentation. Just a short list of recent flameouts includes boo.com (a fashion site that burned through $135 million in months), den.net (a "digital entertainment network" panting haplessly after the demographic Holy Grail of Generation Y), and RedRocket.com (toys from Nickelodeon). Among the countless former high-fliers in a Wall Street tailspin are Drkoop.com and Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, whose shares have dropped from $333 in March to around $23 today, amid investigations for alleged accounting irregularities. 
 Most of these sites rode in on a wave of hype as excessive as those that herald Hollywood's bigger bombs. (On the Web, as in show business, the big hits are often sleepers.) Mr. Saylor was being canonized in the press as a Medici -- for underwriting a dubious, if free, online university -- just as his stockholders fell on his sword. Now that these start-ups are in peril or ruin, their press is almost as apocalyptic as the initial buzz was celebratory. When Disney bought a 60 percent interest in Toysmart.com back in August, an expert at Forrester Research gushed to The Associated Press, "There's nothing bad in it for Disney." When Toysmart went belly-up last week, another Forrester analyst authoritatively told The A.P. it was "the wrong company selling the wrong product at the wrong time." Now you tell us!
You have to wonder if these pundits visit the sites they initially tout. I found from personal experience five months ago that den.net was nearly impenetrable even on a fast connection and that no one in its office would come to the phone to explain why. If anyone wonders whether Barnes & Noble has mastered online bookselling, just try, as I did this week, to order from its not-ready-for-e-time "same-day delivery" service. With competitors like this, no one at Amazon need go sleepless in Seattle.
Emotionally satisfying as these rags-to-riches-to-rags dot-com sagas may be, however, they are often irrelevant to the long and looming future of the Internet. Like some other favorite story lines of the past few years -- the kiddie-porn scare, the "Blair Witch" craze, the day-trader menace -- tales of the Nasdaq bubble are transient sideshows in the Web's early gold-rush phase that may look like quaint olden-days phenomena once the Internet is seamlessly integrated into our lives. As with the original California gold rush's prospectors, it's inevitable that more dot-com prospectuses are going to pan fool's gold than pay dirt. The disasters won't slow the progress of this new technology any more than earlier economic setbacks did the spread of the railroad and electricity.
The truly illuminating Internet stories are sometimes less visible than the morality plays of hubristic e-celebrities and evanescent I.P.O.'s. That may be because they are buried in the very architecture of a technology few of us laymen understand -- or because they involve the media's own selfish interests. Or both.
Into this category fall the newest corporate marriages in the increasingly intertwined Internet-cable-entertainment-telecommunications industry: AT&T-MediaOne and AOL-Time Warner. These mammoth couplings have been dissected as stock-price stories and captains-of-industry personality profiles, to be sure. But if it hadn't been for the divine intervention of another corporate giant last month -- Disney -- even a hint of the worst-case scenarios possible in this new media landscape would have been invisible to most Americans. Few still understand how these new powerhouses could make our current cable and phone companies look like kindly mom-and-pop operations by comparison.
What Time Warner did to Disney, throwing ABC off its cable in 11 cities until a public outcry forced a retreat, is just a tiny window into how these corporations can behave in their even more powerful future, when cable TV service will be inseparable from Internet service. There is nothing to stop one of these new megaliths from exerting a larger and more surreptitious chokehold on all the electronic services that their cable wires will speed by the bundle into our homes tomorrow, from chat rooms to e-shopping to movies. Even in the few weeks since the Disney fiasco, when you might think Time Warner would be too chastened to risk more censure, it has been caught misbehaving in Texas, where its cable company offered its employees bounties to place bogus orders for a rival Internet service offered by Southwestern Bell.
Time Warner has since apologized for its recent transgressions, but if it can try to squelch Disney (itself described by The Wall Street Journal as "one of America's most aggressive corporate bullies"), imagine what it can do to smaller companies and consumers once Disney and the other giants inevitably make deals to secure their pieces of the pie.
Not unlike Windows, which blackballed Web software not made by Microsoft, or the most recent edition of AOL, which snaked into its users' computer settings to override competing programs, the future AOL-TW threshold into the Internet/TV can be engineered for nefarious purposes. It could make its own products, like Time and CNN, come on screen easily and fast while slowing down (or blocking) the alternatives, whether Newsweek or Drudgewannabe.com. It could do the same with merchants, TV channels or non-AOL Internet service providers.
In other words, it could control the entertainment and even the news grid on your computer/TV screen much as the movie studios (including Time Warner's ancestor, Warner Brothers) limited Americans' entertainment choices in cities until antitrust action ended such restrictive practices in 1948. The result wouldn't be the democratic, go-anywhere-you-want Internet of yore but a more elaborate version of cable TV, in which your cable company adjudicates both your programming choices and cyber-activities (and could monitor all of them).
It would be like "someone constantly dealing the deck and knowing every card and shuffling at will, but never letting you know if you're being dealt every card or not," says Jeffrey Chester of the Center for Media Education. Gerald Levin, of Time Warner, and Steve Case, of AOL, have pledged not to be naughty, but even if we take them at their word, they'll not be running their company forever. What's more, what they say already fails to square with what they do. This week USA Today persuasively charged AOL with foot-dragging on last summer's promise to open up its instant-messenger system to all non-AOL Internet users.
The antidote to any possible future misbehavior is not necessarily to stop the merger -- a non-starter anyway -- but for regulators to set simple rules of the information highway (and build them into its construction) so that all comers have equal access to its various lanes. Yet most of the political pressure on Washington comes from the media giants, not the spottily informed public. TV news, the main news source for most Americans, is mum about this part of the merger story, in which so much is at stake for its corporate parents; it's easier to talk about Mr. Levin going tieless.
Nor do politicians want to take on media corporations whose news divisions cover them and whose donations increasingly support them. At my request, the Center for Responsive Politics broke down total campaign contributions by industry over the past decade, and the result shows a rapid increase of total donations by media, communications and electronics companies since the explosion of the Internet -- a stiffer increase than even those made by the health care industry. The parties more or less split the loot.
The Clinton administration has taken a "do-nothing attitude" about ensuring fairness for the millions who will connect by cable into the Internet, according to Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard law professor who has more than anyone framed this issue. Nor is there any Teddy Roosevelt Republican in sight to ride to the rescue. Still, some public-interest advocates are hopeful that voters will be provoked into anger over time, if only because media companies arrogant enough to pull the plug on Regis Philbin may, like Microsoft before them, eventually overplay their hand. But it may take something as startling as a totalitarian new voice saying "You've got mail" -- Charlton Heston's, perhaps -- to wake the country up.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Weekend in Moscow

 BODY:
Meetings between American presidents and their Russian counterparts pack less drama than they used to. But they still matter. Bill Clinton's meetings with Vladimir Putin, the first since Mr. Putin became Russia's president, provide a timely opportunity to discuss issues ranging from nuclear arms control to market reforms and human rights. Mr. Clinton should use his public appearances, including a radio call-in show and an address to Parliament, to hail Mr. Putin's steps toward reform and criticize troubling signs of authoritarianism.
Mr. Putin's leadership personality is still unfolding. The theme of his presidency so far has been the reorganization of the central government. That is a reasonable response to the catastrophic breakdown of services over the past decade. But there are concerns that Mr. Putin, who was a K.G.B. officer in the Soviet era, means to reassert Kremlin powers at the expense of Russia's nascent civil liberties. Last month's raid on Media-MOST, a leading private media company, was troubling in this regard. So is Moscow's continuing military brutality in Chechnya and Mr. Putin's legislative drive to override the power of elected regional governors. 
 More encouraging are the economic goals reflected in his cabinet appointments and proposals to reform the income tax code. Higher oil prices and the consequences of earlier ruble devaluations have spurred a modest economic revival in Russia. But this windfall must now be sustained by a coherent set of government policies including further simplifications of the tax code and improvements in property and bankruptcy laws.
No breakthroughs on nuclear arms cuts or missile defense are expected this weekend. But in an interview with NBC News Mr. Putin acknowledged that he, too, recognized a potential threat from small, unpredictable nuclear powers. He said he intended to propose a joint defensive system to counter it. The details of Mr. Putin's ideas have yet to be filled in, but they are likely to be quite different from the national missile defense system currently being tested by the Pentagon. Mr. Clinton should listen carefully to any new Russian proposal. It could ease the path to an eventual agreement. As for offensive warheads, both sides have strong reason to move ahead with deep new cuts.
Mr. Putin's presidency is just beginning, while Mr. Clinton's is drawing to a close. But the remaining seven and a half months during which their terms overlap should not be wasted. Mr. Clinton has full authority to negotiate on nuclear issues through next January. As leader of the world's foremost democracy he also has the moral authority, and obligation, to speak out in defense of human rights and Russia's newly won freedoms.

HEADLINE: Measuring the Progress of Women

 BODY:
Next week at the United Nations, representatives of nearly every country and thousands of non-governmental groups are meeting to talk about what the world has done to improve the lives of women. The delegates will evaluate what has happened since the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, when 187 nations endorsed a wide range of goals and promised specific actions.
The subject of women's needs is, of course, a broad one, encompassing poverty -- 70 percent of the poor are female -- health, domestic violence, armed conflict, political representation and other issues. One achievement of the Beijing conference was its acknowledgment that women need to be heard in debates on just about every kind of policy. 
 The Beijing conference was the fourth U.N. conference on women, but more than the others it established concrete targets -- such as abolishing laws that discriminate against women economically or increasing the number of women in public administration -- and set timetables for measuring progress. Activists have found these benchmarks crucial to holding governments accountable.
In 1998 the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a New York-based network of groups, did a survey of progress. It found that most of the governments represented at Beijing had drawn up plans to keep their promises, and 64 countries had changed laws. The growth of local women's groups has been the most important reason for these advances. Some 30,000 activists attended the Beijing conference, and they have used its platform to organize women and to press governments to keep their commitments.
But most of what governments call action is still just lofty talk, and is not yet affecting women. The inaction stems partly from cultural resistance and partly from lack of money to finance new programs. Governments argue, persuasively, that they are overwhelmed by AIDS, debt payments and budget cuts demanded by the International Monetary Fund. But women's issues have never been a priority, even when progress, as with educating girls, would benefit the nation as a whole.
In addition, many governments are not even changing egregious laws, which costs nothing. In several countries women may not inherit property. In much of Latin America, a rapist goes free if he marries the victim. In several Islamic countries, a man may kill a female relative who has disgraced the family. In Pakistan, women's testimony has no value in rape cases. In Kuwait, women still may not vote. "We have prepared people to ask their government: 'Did you do what you said you would do?' " says Litha Musyimi-Ogana, a Kenyan activist, who could be speaking for women's groups everywhere. This is a big achievement, but the answer in too many places is "no."

HEADLINE: Indonesia's Uphill War on Rule From the Top

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, May 30

 BODY:
Everything has changed in Indonesia since its strongman, Suharto, was pushed from office just two years ago. The clamor of democracy is everywhere, along with the violence and instability that accompany a time of unfettered transformation.
And nothing has changed. For all the talk about democratic principles and local empowerment, Indonesia is still focused on the ideas, the directives -- even the whims -- of one man, its new president, Abdurrahman Wahid. 
 Will the country's separatist movements be crushed by force or courted with blandishments? Will its military leaders be the hard men fostered by Mr. Suharto or a new generation of liberal thinkers? Will its press remain open and free? Will Indonesia begin toying again with the idea of strict currency controls?
These are all fundamental questions whose final answer lies with one man, the president.
And yet, in sharp contrast to Mr. Suharto, who was forced to step down in May 1998 after 32 years in power, Mr. Wahid's ability to enact his policies is dangerously limited.
As he built his top-down structure of personal control, Mr. Suharto so eviscerated the nation's institutions that his successors have inherited a hollow and nearly useless bureaucracy.
"The government here is almost hydroponic," said a Western diplomat -- a floating structure with dangling, ineffectual roots.
Mr. Wahid was a compromise president, the product of back-room deals seven months ago to replace Mr. Suharto's immediate successor, B. J. Habibie. Though Mr. Wahid is personally popular, he lacks a broad political base. Even his cabinet, the product of his deal-making, does not fully support him.
So he rules through the force of his personality, through his moral authority, through the weakness of his rivals and through a sort of light-hearted bullying in which he pummels potential challengers with jokes, insults and impulsive personnel changes.
But when he issues direct orders, one of his cabinet ministers said, he can never be sure what the result will be. His subordinates may be recalcitrant or incompetent or simply lack the bureaucratic machinery to act effectively.
"This is a president from whom everyone expects too much," said Daniel S. Lev, an expert on Indonesia at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was visiting Jakarta.
"He is a president without the institution of the presidency," Mr. Lev said. "Every major administrative institution and political institution has essentially been destroyed, crushed. There is really nothing left to work with. It doesn't matter, in a sense, how good the people are that you appoint because the institutions are devastated. There's corruption everywhere."
And so, seven months into his presidency, Mr. Wahid finds his country in a slough of discontent, its reforms slowing, its leaders consumed by personal rivalries, shaken by outbreaks of religious violence and increasingly annoyed by the mannerisms of its quirky president.
Several recent missteps have particularly shaken public confidence. They include the still-unexplained firing of a highly respected economic minister, Laksamana Sukardi, and his replacement by a political ally of the president. And they include scandals involving the president's youngest brother and his personal masseuse that have evoked fears of a return of the corruption and nepotism of the Suharto years.
Most dangerously, the public restiveness grows out of a sharp economic downturn that has seen the currency, the rupiah, lose up to 18 percent of its value this year and the stock market plunge by 27 percent. Although the overall economy is growing and could exceed last year's increase by as much as 3 percent, the slump has caused a panic in this still-traumatized nation, where it was an economic crash that led to the forced resignation of Mr. Suharto.
And so the Western diplomat offered a succinct analysis of the current challenges facing Indonesia: "It's the economy, stupid."
Mr. Wahid is not a president who takes a great interest in the economy, and the economic team he has assembled -- skewed by his political deal-making -- is widely viewed as weak.
The situation has not been helped by a series of ill-considered statements by government officials, most strikingly by Kwik Kian Gee, the president's chief economic minister.
"If I were a foreign investor, I wouldn't come to Indonesia," Mr. Kwik said in a recent, and much quoted, interview with Dow Jones Newswires. "The law enforcement is not there, but not only that, the whole thing is so confusing. How can you come here?"
Like Mr. Wahid, Mr. Kwik spent much of his career in opposition to the Suharto government. Both men, like some other leaders, still speak and act as if they were in opposition rather than in charge.
So Mr. Kwik -- the government's chief economic manager -- blamed "the way the government is managed" for the weak economy. He criticized his boss for appointing a welter of economic councils and advisory groups, leading to inconsistent policies.
In response, Mr. Wahid told reporters he might just take over economic management himself, despite his lack of background. He then said he might take action to control currency fluctuations -- a seeming reference to the creation of a currency board, an eccentric idea of Mr. Suharto's that aroused shudders among investors.
But while the surface of public life here drifts and sloshes in what sometimes seems a sea of incompetence, fundamental changes are being prepared in the structure of the nation and its governance.
Donald K. Emmerson, a professor of political science at Stanford University, calls it "the rebirth of the Indonesian political system."
Commissions are preparing constitutional amendments for a congress scheduled in August that would put in place a democratic system with striking similarities to that of the United States.
With the support of Mr. Wahid, these changes are likely to include direct election of the president, a bicameral legislature, a system of judicial review, decentralization of some power to the provinces and even perhaps an American-style bill of rights.
Mr. Emmerson suggested that there may be mirror images here.
Mr. Suharto placed his emphasis -- and staked his legitimacy -- on economic development, while corrupting and bankrupting the political system. It appears that the new government of Mr. Wahid, while drifting economically, has embarked on an ambitious program of political development.
Mr. Suharto took the easy way; he crushed dissent by force. Mr. Wahid has more faith in the ability of his countrymen to live together in peace; this is a time when that faith is being tested.
It is rainy season in Jakarta, and the gray skies and occasional cracks of thunder speak to the national mood.
All debates and rivalries and even outbreaks of violence are focused now on August, when the national assembly will meet to debate, to pass laws and to hear a state-of-the-nation report from the president. No one is sure if a storm is coming.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ELECTORATE;
Population Shifts in the Southeast Realign Politics in the Suburbs

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: SMYRNA, Ga., June 1

 BODY:
When he was swept into the Georgia House of Representatives in 1994 at the crest of the Republican revolution, Randy J. Sauder seemed to personify Cobb County's reputation as one of the most conservative suburbs in the country.
Mr. Sauder was in favor of mandatory execution for twice-convicted murderers, abolishing the state parole board and barring Atlanta's public transportation system from the county. He became an ally of fellow Cobb County resident Newt Gingrich, and a national Republican organization voted him the top freshman state legislator in the country. 
 But last month, Mr. Sauder infuriated the Republican Party in Georgia with an audacious heresy. As he saw the future of his district, he became a Democrat.
Mr. Sauder's conversion says much about the population changes that are transforming the suburbs of Atlanta and other cities in the Southeast, rearranging the political order along with the priorities of state leaders. Nearly 2.5 million Americans moved to the Southern states along the Atlantic Coast during the 1990's, by far the largest growth of any region in the country, and they have proven to be far less conservative than longtime residents.
Suburbs once dominated by religious conservatives are increasingly home to moderate Republicans, and moderate Republican districts are teetering on the edge of Democratic reascendancy. As officials of both parties have begun to move away from divisive racial and social issues and toward the center, the effect on public policy has been dramatic.
In state after state, conservative social issues that once monopolized the conversation of Southern suburbs -- lower taxes, welfare reform, crackdowns on crime -- have been supplanted by a new agenda: managing growth and transportation, bringing in technology jobs and above all, improving education. In a swath of states from the Carolinas to Mississippi, Democratic governors have made these issues their own, and Republicans are struggling to keep up.
"My district has changed so dramatically since I was first elected," Mr. Sauder said recently, over biscuits at a Shoney's restaurant near his house. "The people moving in want to see action on issues like education and sprawl, and it's the Democrats that have grabbed those themes and delivered. The Republicans around here are seen as bickering and obstructionist."
Even a matter as racially charged as the Confederate battle flag on the South Carolina Capitol, which comes down on July 1, has largely been resolved, mostly at the request of suburban voters who made it clear they had other priorities.
At the same time as centrist Northerners, mostly white, moved South, an inner ring of Southern suburbs that were once nearly all white have become more diverse, attracting large and stable populations of black, Hispanic and Asian residents who do not as a rule support a conservative political agenda.
In Cobb County, where blacks once had to sue to rent apartments, the number of black residents has grown fivefold since 1980, rising to 12 percent of the county's population from 4 percent 20 years ago, according to the Census Bureau and the county. There has been a similar shift in other Atlanta suburbs, like Clayton and Gwinnett Counties, along with suburbs of Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham in North Carolina and Columbia in South Carolina.
The population shifts, driven by the South's quickening economy and the prosperity of a mobile middle class, do not necessarily presage a partisan realignment like the mass movement of white Southern Democrats to the Republican Party in the 1980's and 1990's. Nor are they necessarily good news for Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
Although two state legislators have switched to the Democratic Party in South Carolina, and more could do so in Georgia, the pendulum swing is more ideological than political. Its most lasting effect may be a race by officials of both parties to the center, mostly at the state level.
In North Carolina, the explosion of new residents in the 1990's has actually produced a new breed of Republican in a state dominated for decades by Democrats and religious conservatives. They seem to be precisely the kind of voters singled out by the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
"As North Carolina has filled up with cul-de-sacs, we have become simultaneously more Republican and far less conservative," said John N. Davis, executive director of the North Carolina Forum for Research and Economic Education, a nonprofit, research group supported by business that surveys newcomers.
"These are pro-government Republicans, who want the best soccer fields, schools and police departments that government money can buy," Mr. Davis said. "And suddenly you see formerly conservative candidates for office pushing education and environment programs that they would have tried to cut 10 years ago."
He said that many of the newcomers come from the Northeast where it is common to be Republican and moderate or Republican and left-of-center, a combination rare in the South.
Native Southerners, whether Democratic or Republican, identify themselves as conservative far more often than newcomers in his organization's polls, he said. A similar survey by the University of North Carolina last year showed that 34 percent of non-native Southerners considered themselves conservative, compared with 42 percent of native Southerners.
Newcomers are prodding elected officials to be more aggressive about spending tax money on their priorities. In the last three years, residents in 19 out of 20 counties in the Atlanta area have voted to raise their sales taxes to pay for schools and other projects, often by overwhelming margins.
In Cobb County, where voters raised the sales tax in 1998 for new schools, the county commission has proposed a tax increase to buy parkland, and commissioners say they believe that residents will support the measure.
Gwinnett County, a northeast Atlanta suburb that has been a developer's paradise, recently imposed a seven-month moratorium on rezonings. (The move is mostly symbolic, but coincides neatly with the re-election campaigns of most of the county commissioners.) Suburban politicians make it clear that in both substance and style, they are following a mellower electorate.
"My district is still a conservative place, but the social issues of the 90's are not the fundamental foundation of people's politics anymore," said Representative Johnny Isakson, a Republican who replaced Mr. Gingrich in Georgia's Sixth Congressional District and whose easygoing moderation bears no resemblance to his predecessor's partisan fire.
"We've taken care of matters like a balanced budget and welfare reform," Mr. Isakson said, "and now people are more concerned about quality-of-life issues, education and transportation."
But just as Bill Clinton made an art out of appropriating Republican themes, Democratic governors in the Southeast have edged aside Republicans in seizing the issues at the top of suburban agendas.
Republicans who have opposed Democratic initiatives to raise teacher salaries and hold schools accountable with testing regimens are gleefully painted as obstructionist, and the effects are visible. Both legislators in South Carolina who switched to the Democratic Party complained that Republican leaders tried to force them to vote against education programs that their constituents supported.
Many Republicans insisted that the party switching did not represent a trend, and that deeply conservative values still prevailed in the South. Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster in Atlanta, said the increased emphasis on quality-of-life issues was the result of an improved economy, not a political shift. But other Republicans said their party had fallen behind in the race to capture newcomers with unpledged loyalties.
"This transformation is going on around the South, and the Republican leadership just does not get it," said Matt Towery, a Republican and former state representative from Cobb County who was Mr. Gingrich's campaign chairman for many years. "They're still talking about tax cuts, but the Democrats now have the issues that appeal to presidential-year voters, the environment, gun safety. You can't win these counties as a gun-toting, anti-abortion Republican anymore."
But partisanship still prevails. All but 1 of the 16 Republican state legislators from Gwinnett County voted against the overhaul of Georgia's education system by Gov. Roy E. Barnes, a Democrat, which passed nonetheless. The law mandates many of the ideas that Republicans have championed: smaller class sizes, an end to teacher tenure and strict accountability of each school, as measured by comprehensive tests.
When he signed the bill, Mr. Barnes deliberately chose a school in the district of the one Gwinnett Republican who had supported him.
Mr. Barnes, in fact, has been one of the South's shrewdest observers of these demographic trends, assembling an agenda with pitch-perfect resonance for suburban voters -- the education bill, a powerful new transportation and planning authority, a managed-care bill of rights -- while also retaining his popularity among urban and rural residents.
He has worked to strengthen the Democratic majority in the Georgia Legislature in anticipation of the redistricting that will follow this year's census, singling out districts like Mr. Sauder's in Smyrna. (If he had not switched parties, Mr. Sauder acknowledges, he would eventually have faced a Democratic opponent with the governor's strong backing.)
Bobby Kahn, the governor's chief of staff and principal political strategist, said the population shifts in Georgia had been of significant benefit to the Democrats, and could make a difference in Mr. Gore's favor this November, although the state is considered a tossup.
"The outer ring of suburbs are still very Republican," Mr. Kahn said, "but some of the counties on the inner ring that had gone Republican are clearly trending back to the Democrats. I think Gore could do better in the suburbs than people expect, particularly with women. In a close state, you make an impact at the margin, and the suburbs are the margin now."
One of those swing districts is likely to be in Smyrna and south Cobb County, home to both Mr. Sauder and, before he moved to the governor's mansion, to Mr. Barnes. The district has become one of the fastest-growing integrated regions in Georgia, a leading destination for middle- and upper-middle-class white and black families buying homes in the $200,000 range and above. Mr. Kahn said the governor's hometown, Mableton, just southwest of Smyrna, is now about equally black and white.
The welcome mat for black home buyers represents quite a turnaround for Smyrna. As recently as 1988, a restaurant with a slavery theme, Aunt Fanny's Cabin, could be found in Smyrna. But the restaurant closed in 1994, the city replaced its decaying downtown with a landscaped civic center and professionals caught in rush hour began to appreciate Smyrna's easy access to downtown Atlanta.
Keith De Cay, one of many black homeowners who recently bought a house in the affluent Austin Lake section of Smyrna, said he was impressed by the city's friendliness, selecting it after a transfer from New Orleans based on the number of residents who offered to give him directions when he pretended to be lost.
"I'm a lifelong Democrat, and I had heard this was a very Republican area, so I didn't know what to expect," said Mr. De Cay, an executive with the Dataradio Corporation, which makes wireless modems. "But I just haven't found that old-guard kind of politics here. They're building schools and community centers and parks, and that's what I want to see my elected officials do."

A Lamentation by Philip Roth In a Black Woman's Voice

 BODY:
Nathan Zuckerman, Philip Roth's longtime alter ego, plays a leading role in Roth's new novel, "The Human Stain," but the character who seems most clearly to be the voice of the author is a retired schoolteacher, Ernestine, the sister of the novel's black protagonist, Coleman Silk. Toward the end of the book Ernestine describes the circumstances of Coleman's early years to Nathan, and the two discuss how Coleman, who is passing himself off as white, was hounded from his teaching position at Athena College for remarks mistakenly taken to be racist. Both the portrayals of the black characters and the views Roth puts into their mouths have generated some uneasiness among a number of reviewers and critics. Here is the "good and virtuous" Ernestine lamenting the atmosphere of intimidation on college campuses today, the role of Black History Month, and the general decline of academic standards.
I don't believe I've ever heard of anything more foolish being perpetrated by an institution of higher learning. It sounds to me more like a hotbed of ignorance. To persecute a college professor, whoever he is, whatever color he might be, to insult him, to dishonor him, to rob him of his authority and his dignity and his prestige for something as stupid and trivial as that. I am my father's daughter, Mr. Zuckerman, the daughter of a father who was a stickler for words, and with every passing day, the words that I hear spoken strike me as less and less of a description of what things really are. Sounds from what you've told me that anything is possible in a college today. Sounds like the people there forgot what it is to teach. Sounds like what they do is something closer to buffoonery. Every time has its reactionary authorities, and here at Athena they are apparently riding high. One has to be so terribly frightened of every word one uses? What ever happened to the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America? In my childhood, as in yours, it was recommended that each student who graduated from high school in New Jersey get at graduation two things: a diploma and a copy of the Constitution. Do you recall that? You had to take a year of American history and a semester of economics -- as, of course, you have to no longer: 'have to' is just gone out of the curriculum. At graduation it was traditional in many of our schools in those days for the principal to hand you your diploma and somebody else to give you a copy of the Constitution of the United States. So few people today have a reasonably clear understanding of the Constitution of the United States. But here in America, as far as I can see, it's just getting more foolish by the hour. All these colleges starting these remedial programs to teach kids what they should have learned in the ninth grade. In East Orange High they stopped long ago reading the old classics. They haven't even heard of Moby-Dick, much less read it. Youngsters were coming to me the year I retired, telling me that for Black History Month they would only read a biography of a black by a black. What difference, I would ask them, if it's a black author or it's a white author? I'm impatient with Black History Month altogether. I liken having a Black History Month in February and concentrating study on that to milk that's just about to go sour. You can still drink it, but it just doesn't taste right. . . . 
 In my parents' day and well into yours and mine, it used to be the person who fell short. Now it's the discipline. Reading the classics is too difficult, therefore it's the classics that are to blame. Today the student asserts his incapacity as a privilege. I can't learn it, so there is something wrong with it. And there is something especially wrong with the bad teacher who wants to teach it. There are no more criteria, Mr. Zuckerman, only opinions. I often wrestle with this question of what everything used to be. What education used to be.

EUROPE
 
GREECE: TURKS STORM BEACH -- In a dramatic display of the improved state of Greek-Turkish relations, about 160 Turkish troops, one of whom is at left, stormed a beach at Kyparissia, in the western Peloponnesus, as part of a NATO exercise in recapturing lost territory. Some 2,000 Greek, American and Spanish marines were also involved. Greece and Turkey came close to war in 1996 when Turks seized a disputed rocky islet about 310 miles west of Kyparissia.

NORTHERN IRELAND: HITCH OVER FLAG -- Ministers in the new government from Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, refused to permit the flying of the Union Jack from their office buildings, the official practice on June 2, the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. The pro-British Ulster Unionist Party accused Sinn Fein of violating the terms of the peace pact that created the new home rule government. First Minister David Trimble said the dispute would be debated when the Northern Ireland Assembly reconvenes Monday. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
CZECH REPUBLIC: 'MEIN KAMPF' SUIT -- The Czech publisher of Hitler's "Mein Kampf" has been charged with promotion of Nazism, the police said. Michal Zitko published the unabridged Czech translation in March, saying he wanted Czechs to be exposed to an important historical document. A first edition of 10,000 copies sold out. He faces up to eight years in prison if convicted.

SLOVAKIA: TOP U.N. JOB DENIED -- Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda and Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan conspired to keep a choice United Nations job offer from Finance Minister Brigita Schmognerova. Secretary General Kofi Annan suggested to Mr. Kukan that she become director of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, but Mr. Dzurinda decided he needed Ms. Schmognerova in his government and never told her about the offer. "It would have been one of the greatest positions a Slovak official could hold," she told Radio Twist in Bratislava. Steven Erlanger (NYT)
 
GERMANY: WOMEN'S ARMY ROLE -- Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping announced that women would have unrestricted access to all jobs in the armed forces starting in January. Until now, women in the German Army have been permitted to serve only as nurses and musicians. Mr. Scharping's decision follows a court ruling that said women could not be excluded from performing most military tasks. Alan Maimon (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: POPE NOT WELCOME -- The Russian Orthodox Church, responding to reports that President Vladimir V. Putin plans to invite Pope John Paul II to visit Russia when they meet at the Vatican on Tuesday, said it is not ready to receive him until differences between the two churches are resolved. The Orthodox Church objects to missionary work by Catholics in Russia. (NYT)

PERU: FINAL VOTE TALLY -- Election authorities released final results of last Sunday's presidential runoff showing President Alberto K. Fujimori winning 51.20 percent of the vote. Alejandro Toledo, the business professor who dropped out of the race charging fraud, won 17.68 percent. The remaining voters, 31.12 percent, canceled or left their ballots blank. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
CANADA: VIETNAM TO FREE WOMAN -- Vietnam has told Canada it will release from a Hanoi jail a 74-year-old Canadian-Vietnamese woman convicted of heroin trafficking. Tran Thi Cam was convicted with her daughter, Nguyen Thi Hiep, in a case in which the Canadian police suspected they were tricked into trying to embark from Hanoi with art panels laden with heroin. The daughter was executed in Hanoi. James Brooke (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
JAPAN: PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED -- In the face of some of the worst-ever polling data, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori dissolved the lower house of Parliament and announced national elections for June 25. The elections have been sparked by a series of controversies surrounding Mr. Mori, from the circumstances surrounding his arrival in power, to a remark calling Japan a divine country. Mr. Mori became prime minister on April 3 his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, suffered a stroke. Mr. Obuchi died last month. Howard W. French (NYT)

ISRAEL: REJECTING RED CROSS -- Israel said it was rejecting a proposal by the International Committee of the Red Cross to allow it membership if it agreed to replace its red Star of David with a neutral symbol, like a diamond, in certain zones. The director of the Magen David Adom, or Red Star of David organization, said that since the symbol would be for Israel only, it would be "like a yellow star," the Nazi insignia for the Jews.

HEADLINE: Horace Busby, 76, Ex-White House Aide and Johnson Adviser

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Horace Busby Jr., a former White House aide and longtime associate of former President Lyndon B. Johnson, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 76 and lived in Santa Monica.
The cause was respiratory failure, said his son, Scott. 
 Mr. Busby, a fellow Texan known as Buzz, served President Johnson as, among other things, a speechwriter and an idea man. He was an important aide to Johnson in various phases of his political career.
After Johnson became president when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in 1963, Mr. Busby was named a special assistant to Johnson. Mr. Busby had been running a management consulting firm in Austin, Tex., and Washington that specialized in economic research.
Mr. Busby served as the liaison between the executive departments and the White House. He also was a deputy to McGeorge Bundy, then special presidential assistant for national security affairs.
At first, Mr. Busby agreed to remain on the president's staff only through the election of November 1964, when Johnson defeated his Republican opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, in a landslide.
Johnson persuaded Mr. Busby to stay a few months longer, but he resigned in September 1965, and returned to private life.
As Mr. Busby left public service, he received a letter from Johnson that said: "As a counselor, you have been wise. As an administrator, you have been unsparing toward yourself. As a friend, you have been, and you are, a never-failing source of strength to me."
But that was not the end of Mr. Busby's work for Johnson. In 1988, James R. Jones, who was the president's chief of staff in 1968, recalled that early in that year Johnson told him to put Mr. Busby back to work on an "I will not run" peroration in which the president, whose escalation of the Vietnam War led to student unrest and a bitterly divided nation, would disclose that he would not seek re-election.
Earlier, Mr. Busby had been assigned to write such a passage for another Johnson speech, but the president changed his mind.
On March 31, 1968, however, at the end of a nationally televised speech in which he announced the cessation of bombing north of the 21st parallel in Vietnam, the president made his surprise statement that he would not run again.
Johnson died in San Antonio on Jan. 22, 1973, at the age of 64.
In 1990, when a book about the former president, "Means of Ascent" by Robert A. Caro, provided new evidence that Johnson had stolen his election to the United States Senate in 1948, Mr. Busby, who had been an aide in Johnson's senatorial campaign, said: "I don't disagree with the accuracy of anything Bob has in there," but added, "There was a lot of stealing in that election."
"The irregularity in the voting was caused in most instances by the local races," Mr. Busby, who was a political analyst in 1990, added. "It was just incidental that there were also votes stolen for Johnson" and for the losing candidate, Coke Stevenson.
Horace Wooten Busby Jr. was born in Fort Worth, attended the University of Texas at Austin and was a liberal editor of the student newspaper. He was employed for a while as a wire-service journalist before beginning his first stint as a Johnson aide in 1946.
His marriage to the former Mary Alves ended in divorce. Besides his son, Scott, of Los Angeles, Mr. Busby is survived by two daughters, Leslie Busby, who lives in Italy, and Betsy Busby of Encinitas, Calif. He is also survived by a grandchild and a sister.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Vows to Overhaul Child Support System

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
Describing absent fathers as "the No. 1 cause of child poverty in America," Vice President Al Gore called today for measures to encourage them to pay child support.
"As president, I will launch a second generation of welfare reform to require all fathers who owe child support to pay up or be required to go to work to support their children," Mr. Gore said at a conference on fatherhood. "We've been requiring that of the mothers; let's require it of the fathers." 
 Citing statistics showing that children in single-parent families are more likely to be poor, to drop out of school, to go to jail or to commit suicide, Mr. Gore also called for government policies that would "lift up the institution of marriage."
"Governments don't raise children, and national policies can never take a child to a baseball game," the vice president said. "But I believe we have a national obligation to insist upon responsible fatherhood."
As part of his plan, Mr. Gore proposed "parental responsibility accounts" for families on welfare. Most child support intended for families on welfare goes instead to state governments, which use the money to defer the cost of benefits.
Under Mr. Gore's proposal, some of those payments would go into accounts that would become available to families when they went off welfare. Mr. Gore said that more parents would pay child support if they knew it would go to their families instead of the government. He said it would cost the federal government $2.3 billion over 10 years.
The vice president also proposed federal grants for states that created successful programs for finding work for unemployed parents who owed child support. And he called for policies that would make it easier for credit card companies to deny new credit cards to parents who were delinquent in child support payments.
To help two-parent families stay together, Mr. Gore called for changing the tax code so that working couples would not pay higher taxes than if they filed as individuals. Under his plan, he would eliminate that so-called marriage penalty only for families that used the standard deduction.
Republicans criticized Mr. Gore's tax plan, saying it would reduce taxes for 9 million of the 28 million couples who filed tax returns. A Republican plan supported by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican presidential nominee, would eliminate the penalty for all the couples.
"Put George Bush in the White House and the marriage penalty will be gone," said Chris Paulitz, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. "Al Gore will not fight for this. He will give Americans lip service, but not fight."
Mr. Gore ran into some trouble with his audience. When the vice president said that only one in four parents who owe child support actually pay it, a man in the audience shouted, "That's a lie."
"Is he on the speaking program today?" Mr. Gore shot back with a sly smile to the rest of the mostly friendly crowd.
In keeping with the upbeat tone of all his events this week, Mr. Gore added confessional touches to his remarks today, part of his effort to underscore his biography and soften his image. Mostly, those touches were about his late father, Albert, a Democratic senator from Tennessee.
"I remember watching my father bait a hook on the banks of the Caney Fork River and sit quietly for an hour," Mr. Gore said. "From such moments sons learn more from their dads about patience, joy, duty and love than they do from all of the lectures and sermons that you can add up."

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges United Europe to Include Russia

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: AACHEN, Germany, June 2

 BODY:
Honored in this ancient European center for his service to European unity, President Clinton today urged America's European allies to invite Russia into their military and political unions.
Standing under an unforgiving sun in the courtyard of the ninth-century cathedral where Charlemagne is buried and where many Holy Roman emperors and German kings were crowned, Mr. Clinton told an audience of several hundred people that to do otherwise would destroy the vision of an undivided Continent. 
 Mr. Clinton delivered his speech after he was given the Charlemagne Award, which is given to a world leader who furthers the cause of European unity.
And in the spirit of unity on the eve of a two-day summit meeting in Moscow with President Vladimir V. Putin, he made clear that Russia deserved Europe's warm embrace.
"We don't yet know if Russia's hard-won democratic freedoms will endure," Mr. Clinton said, citing the country's economic crisis and the war in Chechnya.
But he envisioned a time when a prosperous, democratic Russia would be offered membership in NATO, the military alliance created a half-century ago to contain the Soviet threat, and in the 15-member European Union.
"Because the stakes are so high, we must do everything we can to encourage a Russia that is fully democratic and united in its diversity; a Russia that defines its greatness not by dominance of its neighbors, but by the dominant achievements of its people and its partnership; a Russia that should be, indeed, must be, fully part of Europe," Mr. Clinton said.
"That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia -- not NATO's, not the E.U.'s," he said. "The alternative would be a future of harmful competition."
He added that if Russia decided it did not want to join NATO and the European Union, then they must make sure that their eastward expansion does not create "barriers to trade, travel and security cooperation" with Russia.
The Clinton administration has long said Russia could eventually become a member of NATO if it met the military alliance's stringent requirements. Up to now, Russia has shown no interest in joining.
Since 1994, it has been a member of the interim Partnership for Peace, a sort of junior partnership in NATO that includes no military umbrella. In 1997, NATO and Russia signed an agreement that allows for additional consultations and cooperation.
But neither Mr. Clinton nor the Europeans have ever suggested that Russia should join the European Union.
Mr. Clinton characterized his views as part of larger strategy for the transformation of Russia from a hostile dictatorship to a friendly democracy that belongs to the West.
"We must do everything we can to encourage a Russia that is fully democratic," he said. "Though Russia's transformation is incomplete, there clearly is reason for hope in Russia's remarkable journey over these last few years -- from dictatorship to democracy."
He offered no blueprint on how to reach such ambitious goals. But this is the last scheduled trip to Europe in the his presidency, and Mr. Clinton was in a mood to be magnanimous.
The gesture could also be seen as a symbolic peace offering to Moscow, defining Russia as a great power and potential partner as Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin prepare for talks on such contentious issues as Washington's proposal to develop a limited missile defense system and Russia's prosecution of the war in Chechnya.
Mr. Clinton said the other essential task for the Europeans was to bring the Balkan region into the global mainstream. "That is the only way to make peace last in that bitterly divided region," he said. "Our goal must be to de-Balkanize the Balkans."
The president also challenged the image of the United States as a superpower bully with more power, money, military might and political will than Europe, and portrayed it instead as a close friend who wanted to pay his respects and clear up what he called "potentially harmful misperceptions."
"There is a perception right now in America that Europe doesn't always carry its fair share of our mutual responsibilities," he said. As proof that the statement was untrue, he pointed out that Europeans were providing more than 80 percent of peacekeeping troops in Kosovo and of the money for economic reconstruction there. He also said Europeans paid for more than 60 percent of all aid to Central America after it was ravaged by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
"At the same time, there is a perception in Europe that America's power -- military, economic, cultural -- is at times too overbearing," Mr. Clinton added. He acknowledged that America's dominant military role in NATO's air campaign in Kosovo accentuated such fears.
Mr. Clinton was welcomed to Aachen by Mayor Jurgen Linden and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder.
Mr. Linden put a yellow-ribboned medallion over Mr. Clinton's head, as 10 other medallion-wearing recipients of the award, including President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic and King Juan Carlos of Spain, looked on from the makeshift stage.
The setting was fitting for what may be Mr. Clinton's most comprehensive reflections on Europe in the final months of his presidency.
Although Aachen, a western city a few miles from the Belgian and Dutch borders, was severely damaged during World War II, in 1944 it became the first German city to be occupied by the United States. Today, it is a on the cutting edge of Europe's information economy.
In honoring Mr. Clinton for his contributions to Europe, Mr. Schroder praised him for "preserving, strengthening and further developing" America's partnership in Europe.
Mr. Clinton becomes the third American, following former Secretaries of State George C. Marshall, the architect of the plan to rebuild Europe after World War II, and Henry A. Kissinger, to receive the award.
The president said he would donate the $2,500 that comes with the award to a student exchange program between the sister cities of Aachen and Arlington, Va.

HOW RACE IS LIVED IN AMERICA

 BODY:
Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race still ignites political debates -- over Civil War flags, for example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of race relations seems muted by a full-employment economy and by a sense, particularly among many whites, that the time of large social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports arenas, in pop culture and at worship, and especially in the workplace.
These encounters -- race relations in the most literal, everyday sense -- will be the subject of a series of reports, the outcome of a yearlong examination by a team of reporters. Tomorrow, in Part 1: A look at the inner and outer lives of a multiracial congregation.

HEADLINE: Talks With Germany on Fund for Victims of Nazi Slave Labor Are Snagged by a Legal Issue

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 2

 BODY:
Five months after German industry and the government agreed to pay Holocaust survivors nearly $5 billion, the deal became ensnarled today in disagreements with the United States over protecting the companies from future lawsuits.
As a result, German and American officials warned that the aging population of Nazi-era slave laborers and forced laborers might have to wait until next year before receiving any payments. 
 After almost 14 hours of talks on Thursday night and this morning, American and German negotiators failed to reach agreement and gave up their hope that President Clinton would be able to sign the final pact this weekend during his visit with European leaders in Berlin.
American and German negotiators said they were still confident of reaching a final deal, and they scheduled another round of talks in Washington on June 12.
"We must agree on final arrangements by then," said Otto Lambsdorff, a former German economics minister who is his country's lead negotiator on the matter. "If we don't get the whole thing going, then the million or so survivors will have to wait even longer for the payments."
What has surprised many observers, including groups representing Holocaust survivors, is that the dispute has erupted now over an issue that appeared to have been settled last December.
The main dispute is over German demands for "legal closure," a guarantee from the United States government that German companies will be shielded from any future American lawsuits stemming from their activities during Hitler's Third Reich.
Under the basic plan, German industry and the German government would each contribute 5 billion marks ($2.4 billion at the current exchange rate) to the new fund, which would then make payments to Holocaust-era victims including slaves, who were kept in concentration camps, and forced laborers, who worked against their will but received better treatment and some pay.
But German corporations have insisted on receiving immunity from future lawsuits over claims for compensation -- a guarantee that the fund will resolve all such claims once and for all.
The issue is crucial because a primary motive of the corporations in agreeing to create the fund was that they faced an explosion of class-action lawsuits filed in American courts on behalf of millions of people around the world.
American officials, led by Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat, agree in principle but say the American government does not have the power to simply bar future lawsuits.
Last December the two sides appeared to have agreed on a workable compromise: the American government would file a strongly worded legal brief that would be used to urge judges to reject any future Holocaust claims on the ground that they had been addressed by the new fund.
But German officials said today that the proposed American brief was not strong enough, because it rested largely on American "foreign policy interests" in rejecting future lawsuits.
"If it is only a political statement, then there is a risk that a judge five years from now will have lost the context of what happened here," said Wolfgang Gibowski, a spokesman for German industry. "We need legal wording, to explain that there are not only political reasons but legal reasons to dismiss the case."
Making matters more difficult, Mr. Lambsdorff has raised only 2.4 billion of the 5 billion marks that has been pledged from German corporations. Hundreds of smaller companies that did business during the Nazi period are resisting calls to join the fund, and some companies are now threatening to withdraw their pledges if they are not guaranteed legal immunity.
Mr. Lambsdorff has harshly criticized the German corporate holdouts and recently accused them of using the issue of legal immunity as a "lazy pretext" for not contributing.
Mr. Lambsdorff and Mr. Eizenstat hoped to work out a final agreement in time for President Clinton and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder to sign here this weekend.
Gideon Taylor, head of the Jewish Claims Conference in New York, said today that he remained optimistic.
"I would hope that both sides remember what is at stake here, and I think they will," Mr. Taylor said in a telephone interview.

HEADLINE: Donald F. Ephlin, 74; Helped U.A.W. Fashion Saturn Agreement

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
Donald F. Ephlin, the senior official of the United Automobile Workers union who negotiated the pioneering labor agreement that created the Saturn division of General Motors, died yesterday at his home in Dearborn Heights, Mich., a Detroit suburb. He was 74.
One of Mr. Ephlin's sons, Dennis, said that his father appeared to have suffered a heart attack in his sleep early yesterday morning, but said that the medical examiner had not yet completed his report. 
Flags flew at half-staff yesterday at Saturn's assembly plants in Spring Hill, Tenn., and Wilmington, Del., in recognition of Mr. Ephlin's central role in the establishment of Saturn's unusual approach to labor relations. As the U.A.W.'s vice president for General Motors negotiations from 1983 to 1989, Mr. Ephlin negotiated a comprehensive new labor agreement with G.M. that allowed for an innovative approach to labor-management relations in Spring Hill.
Traditional labor agreements between the U.A.W. and the automakers specified numerous job classifications and did not link workers' pay to the marketplace success or failure of the cars they built. The Saturn agreement in Spring Hill linked workers' paychecks partly to how many Saturn cars were sold each year and eliminated most job classifications, allowing managers, together with the local union, to assign workers to whatever tasks most needed doing.
The workers and their union also gained unparalleled veto power over many management decisions, and even participated in the selection of dealers and auto parts suppliers. G.M. promised that Saturn would not lay off workers during slow periods, training them instead so that they could perform a wider range of jobs with greater skill.
The agreement was long regarded with skepticism by G.M. executives and traditional U.A.W. leaders alike. The elimination of complex job classifications irked union officials and members accustomed to a system in which workers with considerable seniority could be assigned less rigorous tasks, like janitorial work, and not be asked to perform other tasks. G.M. management was wary of placing limits on its ability to lay off workers, the automaker's traditional response to recessions.
When Saturn chose a G.M. factory in Wilmington, Del., to build the Saturn midsize sedans that went on sale last year, G.M. and U.A.W. leaders decided that the factory would keep a traditional labor agreement rather than switch to the Spring Hill system. G.M. has also forced Saturn over the last several years to share more auto parts and designs with other G.M. models, limiting the division's independence.
The workers in Spring Hill have also become dissatisfied with lower paychecks as Saturn sales have weakened with the small-car market, and recently the workers elected new local union leaders who have promised a slightly less unconventional approach to labor-management relations.
Dennis Ephlin said that his father had long regarded the establishment of Saturn as his greatest achievement, but had been deeply upset in his final years. "He was very frustrated with what's going on, the moving of Saturn back into the mainstream," he said.
Susan Mallino, a Saturn spokeswoman, said that the division retained an independent dealer organization and a unique labor agreement in Spring Hill. "We're aligning with G.M. where it makes sense to expand our product portfolio," she said.
Mr. Ephlin was the U.A.W. vice president for Ford Motor negotiations from 1980 to 1983, and negotiated a series of agreements then that have created very close cooperation to this day between Ford and the U.A.W.
Mr. Ephlin is survived by his wife of 50 years, Theresa; three children: Dennis, of Troy, Mich.; Donald Ephlin Jr., of Whittaker, Mich.; and Deborah Chappo, of Novi, Mich.; and 10 grandchildren.

Stocks Post Big Gain on Report That Shows Slowing Economy

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index soared 6.44 percent yesterday, ending its best week ever, as investors cheered data suggesting that the nation's economy is slowing and the Federal Reserve may be almost done raising interest rates.
The gains in many technology stocks echoed the wild trading seen in January and February, with many big technology companies rising 10 percent or more on heavy volume. Over all, the Nasdaq rose 230.88 points, to 3,813.38, continuing its extraordinary volatility. For the week, it was up 19 percent. Other indexes also gained. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 142.56 points, or 1.34 percent, to 10,794.76, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 28.45 points, or 1.96 percent, to 1,477.26. 
 With unemployment in May rising unexpectedly and wages nearly flat, Wall Street strategists believe that the Federal Reserve is no longer likely to raise short-term interest rates later this month and may not have to push rates much higher this year. To slow the economy and keep inflation down, the Fed has already raised short-term rates six times since June 1999, and until this week many economists thought at least two more increases were likely.
Higher interest rates are usually considered bad for stocks, because a slower economy hurts corporate profits. Now, whether right or wrong, investors, who are convinced that rates will remain relatively stable, are eagerly seeking out shares in many of the companies they fled earlier this spring.
The buying spree, which began in earnest Wednesday, accelerated yesterday as many stocks jumped at the opening bell and stayed strong through the close of trading.
"The message is fairly clear that investors, after believing that there would be at least one more Fed tightening, have concluded that would not be the case," said Ed Yardeni, chief economist and global investment strategist with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Mr. Yardeni said he believed the Fed, whose primary mandate is to keep the United States economy growing steadily with low inflation, ran the risk of embarrassing itself if it continued to raise rates this summer.
Despite a spike in energy prices and scattered indications that wage inflation is rising, "the latest inflation indicators suggest that inflation isn't even close to being a problem," Mr. Yardeni said.
"The Fed is just going to have to chill out and enjoy prosperity," he added.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief investment strategist for Goldman, Sachs, said the breadth of this week's rally impressed her. While the Nasdaq's frantic gains in January and February came largely at the expense of old-economy stocks in the S.& P. 500, the gains this week included both the Nasdaq and the S.& P., Ms. Cohen said.
"This is a situation where investors are taking a look at the economic data and deciding the situation was not quite as ugly as they had assumed," she said. "The economy is still growing, but more slowly."
Still, yesterday's action had more than a touch of last winter's speculative fever to it. Many big Nasdaq stocks rose 10 percent or more, with JDS Uniphase up 12 1/8, to 110 3/8, and Broadvision gaining 10 1/8, to 53 5/8. The bellwether Cisco Systems, the second-largest stock on the Nasdaq, continued to rally, gaining 3 7/16, to 64 3/8. Cisco has now gained almost 30 percent in just over a week, adding $100 billion to its market valuation.
Other big winners included financial stocks, which often gain when interest rates are falling. Merrill Lynch rose 4, to 108, while Citigroup jumped 2 15/16, to 66 1/4.
Mickey Levy, the chief economist at Banc of America Securities, said he expected financial stocks to continue to gain. "Financial stocks always outperform prior to an inflection point," when the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, Mr. Levy said. "They've been rallying in the last few weeks. They've outperformed. As analysts soften their expectations for the Fed to tighten even more, the rotation into financials will continue."
But not everyone believes the Fed is done raising rates. Stephen Slifer, the chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers, said he still expected the bank to increase short-term rates by one-quarter of a percentage point at the end of June and another quarter-point in August. In the wake of yesterday's unemployment report, which showed joblessness rose from 3.9 percent in April to 4.1 percent in May, Lehman lowered its estimates for United States economic growth for the second quarter from 6.3 percent to 4.7 percent.
Still, Mr. Slifer expects the economy to expand at 5.2 percent for all of this year and another 3.7 percent next year, levels that are high by the standards of the last two decades. With the economy growing so fast, the Fed must remain wary of inflation, Mr. Slifer said.
"By any sort of recent historical standards, growth is just off the charts," he said.
In addition, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has publicly worried about the potential inflationary effect of a rising stock market. As the market rises, investors who feel flush may increase their spending, overheating the economy and causing inflation.
Coming along with the broader economic slowdown, the nearly 40 percent drop in the Nasdaq between March 10 and Tuesday, which erased more than $2 trillion in investor wealth, may have alleviated some of the Fed's concerns, Mr. Slifer said. But if the Nasdaq regains its losses too quickly, it could once again overheat the economy, he said.
"A couple of months from now, if the Fed doesn't do anything, they could be right back worrying about the economy overheating again," he said.
Bond prices were mixed yesterday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2/32, to 104 9/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.94 percent. The price of the 10-year note rose 4/32, to 104 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.16 percent from 6.17 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: MAY'S LABOR DATA INDICATE ECONOMY COULD BE SLOWING

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
In the strongest signal yet that the booming American economy is slowing, the Labor Department reported yesterday that the nation's private-sector employers, instead of hiring, shed 116,000 jobs in May. It was the largest drop in more than eight years and the first since the economy began to soar in the mid-1990's.
The unemployment rate edged up to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent, with blacks and Hispanics absorbing most of the loss. Wage increases, which had accelerated in the early spring, eased in May, reducing concerns about inflation. Jobs disappeared in almost every sector of the economy, except government, where the hiring of 357,000 census takers for the once-a-decade population count offset the decline in business jobs. 
 The jobs report came on the heels of a half-dozen other indications this week that a still very strong economy is beginning to cool off, responding to the Federal Reserve's six interest rate increases over the last year. Car sales and home sales have dipped recently, partly because of higher car loan and mortgage rates. Construction spending is off, and manufacturing production appears to have weakened in May.
"We clearly have evidence now that the economy is slowing," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "The question is how much."
On Wall Street, investors pushed up stocks across the board yesterday -- as they have for much of the week -- in the belief that the accumulating evidence of a slowing economy would encourage the Federal Reserve to limit future rate increases aimed at keeping the inflation rate from rising.
The Nasdaq index registered its largest weekly percentage gain in history and the Dow Jones industrial average had one of its best weekly performances this year. The Dow closed above 10,794 yesterday, up more than 142 points. The Nasdaq closed at 3,813, up more than 230 points.
But the May employment report may overstate labor force weakness, some economists said, and may be encouraging too much euphoria.
Until this week, Wall Street forecasters had expected another rate increase at the Fed's meeting in late June. That expectation had helped to damp stock prices, and had led many economists to predict that the robust consumer spending fostered by the so-called "wealth effect" of a rising stock market would begin to moderate, weakening the economy.
But Wall Street's exuberance now creates a quandary for the Fed. "The economy is probably slowing, but the markets are so excited about it that higher stock prices are already increasing the odds of a speed-up in the economy this summer," said John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. A revived wealth effect, he and other economists argued, could swamp the Fed's efforts to slow the economy, or convince the policy makers to keep raising rates.
"The irony is that when people believe the economy is slowing, the markets behave in a way that encourages people to spend more," Mr. Makin said.
Not surprisingly, the Fed's policy makers, starting with Alan Greenspan, the chairman, have made no reference in recent speeches to the state of the economy -- one concern being that if they were to observe that the economy might be slowing, stock prices could really take off.
The Clinton administration argued that the latest figures were nothing to worry about. "The economy took a breather in May," said Alexis Herman, the labor secretary, "but it remains robust."
Some economists lowered their forecasts yesterday for economic growth in the second quarter, which ends on June 30. For example, Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis, predicted that growth would be closer to 3 percent than the 4.5 percent originally forecast.
But the May report may have overstated the job losses. Just as the March and April reports seemed to exaggerate job growth, they said, the May numbers seemed unrealistically low. Indeed, job growth in the private sector averaged 182,000 a month from January through May, almost in line with last year's average of 202,000 jobs a month.
Count all the census takers hired in May and jobs actually rose by 231,000, the Labor Department reported. But without them, the drop of 116,000 jobs in the private sector was the first loss since January 1996, when 61,000 jobs disappeared, and the largest since November 1991, when the work force shrank by 129,000 jobs as the nation emerged from its last recession.
May was the last month in which census takers were hired in huge numbers; the estimate for June is only 11,000. Still, some economists argued that if the census takers had not gone to work for the government, at $8 to $18 an hour, many would have found employment in the private sector, swelling the rolls.
"The private-sector employment numbers are definitely" an anomaly, said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers.
Still, the cutbacks were widespread. Reversing course, 29,000 jobs disappeared in construction, 71,000 in wholesale and retail trade, 17,000 in manufacturing, and 11,000 in transportation, mostly trucking.
"Jobs even fell for college graduates," said Lawrence Mishel, research director at the Economic Policy Institute.
Labor Department statisticians offered various reasons for much of the drop, particularly for construction and retailing. Warm winter weather, for example, swelled construction rolls in April, so employers did not need to hire in May. Retailing exhibited a similar pattern.
The wage and hours numbers were less equivocal. Average hourly earnings, covering 80 million production employees in a work force of 131.7 million in May, rose only a cent, to $13.65, the smallest increase in months. This number is the first on wage trends each month, and with the slight May increase, wage growth over the previous 12 months fell to 3.5 percent from 3.8 percent in April.
The slight rise in joblessness hit hardest at blacks, whose unemployment rate rose to 8 percent from 7.2 percent. That was still well below the peak for the 1990's of 14.2 percent in June 1992. Hispanics, whose rate edged up to 5.8 percent from 5.4 percent, remained far from their peak of 12.1 percent, also in June 1992. By comparison, the unemployment rate for white adults remained at 3.5 percent.
The pool of people available to take jobs -- those either actively seeking jobs or willing to work if a job came their way -- rose to 10.2 million from 9.9 million in April.
The Labor Department's job numbers come from a monthly survey of 400,000 businesses. An annual revision, announced yesterday, resulted in small changes in earlier months, most of them upward.
The unemployment rate, on the other hand, comes from a separate survey of 50,000 households. It also produces an estimate of the total work force, one considered less accurate. In May, according to the household survey, 991,000 jobs disappeared, the largest one-month drop since the survey began in 1948. To the Labor Department, that outsized decline reflected problems in the way the results are adjusted to account for seasonal variations.
Whatever the statistical quirks, the new signals of a slowing economy suggested to William Dudley, director of domestic research at Goldman, Sachs, that "it is going to be hard for the Fed to justify raising rates at the June meeting."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 6, 2000, Tuesday
PUB-DATE: June 10, 2000

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about the Labor Department's employment report for May misstated the period for a forecast of economic growth made by Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis. In predicting growth closer to 3 percent than to the 4.5 percent originally forecast, it referred to the second half of the year, not the second quarter.

A front-page article last Saturday about the Labor Department's employment report for May misstated the period for a forecast of economic growth made by Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis, and misstated the recency of the forecast. And a correction in this space on Tuesday omitted a clarification of the recency. The firm predicted a decline in growth from 4.5 percent in the second quarter to around 3 percent in the second half of the year, not the second quarter. The forecast was the firm's existing one -- not revised as a result of May's employment data.

 A PLAGUE
 OF FROGS
 The Horrifying True Story.
 By William Souder.
 Illustrated. 299 pp. New York:
 Hyperion. $23.95. 
 We live in an age in which belief in the virtues of technology is ascendant, everyone and his dog wants to be a dot-com and greed is entertainment. Most of my college writing students have unalloyed faith in progress (although some of them don't know what "unalloyed" means). The roar of the S.U.V.'s can drown out challenges to the costs of technological advance.
William Souder's immediate subject is deformed frogs, and if frogs had searched far and wide for a spokesman, they could have found no better. Souder, a Minnesota-based freelance journalist with a masterly understanding of science, manages to make frogs as interesting to the reader as they are to the scientists who study them, their mating habits, embryonic development, growth and yearly migrations. And there is a fascinating cast of these same researchers in "A Plague of Frogs," the story of the ecological detective hunt that followed the discovery, by Cindy Reinitz, a schoolteacher, and a vanload of sixth, seventh and eighth graders, of severely distorted frogs in an innocuous pond on a farm in Minnesota in 1995.
Some frogs, Souder recounts, had "extra legs, singly and in pairs. Some of the additional legs were fairly normal-appearing duplicates growing alongside the primary limbs, others were translucent pink and undersized, sprouting at odd angles from the animals' hindquarters. There were fleshy masses and tapering, undifferentiated protrusions. . . . Some frogs had legs that appeared shrunken and desiccated and stiffened -- like jerky, as if they had been cooked to the bone. Others had legs that seemed to split in two . . . or legs that were weirdly bent and inflexible, with feet pointing every way but the right way."
The litany of limb disorders would become distressingly familiar in the next several years to the biologists Judy Helgen, of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and Robert McKinnell and David Hoppe, of the University of Minnesota, as deformed frogs turned up in virtually every county of the largely rural state. Meanwhile, similarly afflicted amphibians were discovered in wetlands all along the Canadian border. Historically, there is evidence that amphibians are prone to such episodes. But the sheer numbers and percentages recorded in 1995 and after pointed to some human factor superimposing itself upon the natural pattern -- a signal, as Souder puts it, of something "gone terribly wrong." Eventually, the Environmental Protection Agency got involved, as did the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Wildlife Health Center. Soon, academic experts on limb development, toxicology and other specialities joined the hunt.
Ultimately, the investigators were embroiled in intense disagreement. Souder shows us the messy deliberations, rivalries and politics of real science getting done. Were parasites the culprit? Or were hormone-mimicking breakdown products of pesticides interfering with normal development? Or maybe there was some pernicious interplay between the two? Souder, pursuing the story, sometimes -- justifiably -- found himself confused: "The findings seemed to add up one minute and go to mush the next." Today, there is still no consensus.
Souder could have told the story with more economy, but this is a quibble with what is otherwise a superb account of a disturbing environmental happening, which finally leaves us wondering, as scientists do, over its larger implications. Indeed, the frogs may be reacting to global warming and the increase in ultraviolet rays by becoming more susceptible to pathogens, to man-made poisons, to genetic miscues. Amphibian populations appear to be on the decline worldwide for some of these same reasons. "The frogs are telling us a lot -- so much, perhaps, that we cannot yet fully understand the message," Souder writes. "The earth is changing and the frogs are responding."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Who Turned On The Noise?

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
CURT PEOPLES of Toronto went to Myrtle Beach, S.C., with a friend for a weekend of golf last month. He was taken aback to discover they had arrived in the midst of a huge convergence called Harley-Davidson Week. Mr. Peoples said that from his hotel, the Caribbean Resort on Ocean Boulevard, he could hear the parade of bikes making its way around the Route 17 loop until 1 a.m. nightly. Sleep was elusive, Mr. Peoples said, and the drive back to the Charlotte, N.C., airport, a trip that normally takes three hours, took four and a half because of the traffic.
The local Harley-Davidson shop estimates that 250,000 machines were in town for the week. The Myrtle Beach Grand Strand area has 60,000 rooms for rent, including condominiums for six or eight people, according to Jennifer Coons at the Chamber of Commerce, and she considers the figure of a quarter of a million motorcycles quite plausible. Last year, it was 100,000. 
 Mr. Peoples said he does not consider himself anti-biker, but he and his golfing friend would plan their trip differently next year.
The experience brings up the question: What steps can the leisure traveler seeking a quiet getaway take to avoid sleepless nights and choked highways that may develop around unanticipated conventions?
 
Motorcycle Rallies
First, avoid large numbers of internal combustion engines. The bikers' week that Mr. Peoples encountered is actually considered a tranquil respite in the biking community. "They mostly come to ride around and admire each other's bikes," said Dale Coyner of Communicast, a producer of live Web events in Herndon, Va., and author of "Motorcycle Journeys Through the Appalachians" (Whitehorse Press).
Mr. Coyner said that the Myrtle Beach week had a family quality because it has been fostered by the Blue Knights, an organization of bikers who are current or retired law officers. He said this was unlike a week in Sturgis, S.D., which he said was "notorious" (this year's rally is scheduled for Aug. 7 to 13). For Myrtle Beach, he said, the carefully maintained bikes are brought in on trailers lest they get scratched or dirty on the highway. This was part of the congestion on the route to Charlotte. Moreover, the Myrtle Beach week, he said, is a tiny shadow of the Daytona Beach week, which in March was reported to have attracted 600,000 motorcycles. The Daytona 200 race is run then.
Mr. Coyner said that motorcycles from the factory were quieter than they became after the owners modified them with straight exhausts. The Motorcycle Industry Council in Irvine, Calif., says that the maximum level allowable is 80 decibels, and that it is illegal to sell components that cause a motorcycle to exceed the limit. "It's illegal but not enforced," Mr. Coyner said.
Mark Reber, an acoustical consultant at Shen, Milsom & Wilke in New York, said a modified motorcycle could be measured at 95 decibels or above if one stood nearby. For contrast, the ambient noise in a New York street is about 50 to 60 decibels, Mr. Reber said, while the sound in a subway tunnel with two trains passing would be around 95. He said that for every rise of 10 decibels, the sound would be perceived as doubling in loudness.
One Web site maintained by a moviemaker and biker, Ronnie Kramer, includes an alphabetical listing of biker events of all sorts: www .sepnet.com/cycle/events.htm. A Harley-Davidson events list is found at www.harley-davidson.com.
Asking a hotel or convention and visitors bureau what events are scheduled in the area you plan a visit is one step travelers can take. Really big events, like Daytona, soak up the available rooms a year in advance and drive up prices.
My journalism class plans a meeting in Gainesville, Fla., next spring. But until the major automobile drag-racing group, the National Hot Rod Association, picks its 2001 date for its Gator Nationals there, we are holding alternate dates open. Avoiding the event seems like a wise decision. A colleague who covers auto races said that the sound of a drag race can be heard five miles off. Mr. Reber said this was perfectly likely.
Again, to participants, the racket is part of the attraction. The National Hot Rod Association recently reiterated that an upper limit of 95 decibels, as measured 50 feet from the engine, was set on Jan. 1 for all stock and superstock vehicles competing in organization events, but, the Web site announcement said, the "vast majority" had chosen to ignore the rule. Moreover, these vehicles are quieter than the 5,000-horsepower top fuel dragsters that are part of the mythology. The hot rod association and related groups have about 50 events scheduled between now and November. In the cold weather, these are in the South, but by August they are in places like Norwalk, Ohio, and Indianapolis. The schedule is maintained at www.bmracing.com.
 
Fiestas and Discos
There are other noises that can wreck a vacation. Unless you face on a courtyard, a room in the French Quarter of New Orleans is not likely to be restful any night of the year, particularly holidays. But most people who want quiet in Louisiana do not pick the French Quarter.
Events designed to bring in tourists to celebrate in the streets -- Fiesta in San Antonio, for example -- also have their own distant early warnings in high hotel prices and limited availability. In addition, there are holidays unique to some states, traffic-halting marathon races and nationality parades across the country. Local hotel clerks and tourist bureaus know about these, and they should be asked for a schedule. Holidays overseas may bring noise in the street, or the opposite: shuttered banks, museums, stores and information bureaus. It is worthwhile to check guidebooks for these lists, especially if they are religious holidays that may shift with a lunar calendar. Canada's National Day, July 1, can come as a surprise on a trip across the border; likewise Dec. 26 and the Monday after Easter, which are bank holidays in England.
Hotel rooms just above the disco are an awful problem, and if the room is rented early in the day, the situation may not be apparent. When making reservations, ask about the location of any late-night clubs. Other hazards are the swimming pool, the parking lot and the place where trash is picked up early in the morning. Lately the Travel section has received a rash of letters complaining of hotel construction, a byproduct of a booming economy, or reconstruction in the Caribbean after hurricane damage. This is less an evening problem than one for early in the morning. If there are dropcloths and trash bins on your floor, ask for another. When renting a vacation house, ask the agent if the view from the porch is likely to include a construction crew during your stay.
At this time of year, it is nearly impossible to avoid graduation parties and wedding receptions. Samuel F. Pryor III, a partner at Davis, Polk & Wardwell in New York, said he arrived in Durango, Colo., at the time of a major bikers' gathering last year. "They were parked head-in as far as you could see," he said. But the noise was not such a problem. "We were attending a wedding," he said, "making some of our own."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
At More Parks, Smog Is Obscuring the Views

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS another smog season begins, it's likely that some of the country's most popular national parks, especially in the east, will once again be troubled by haze and smog rivaling the levels in crowded metropolitan areas.
A booming economy has been increasing production from factories and power plants, whose pollution blows on the wind to distant peaks in national parks like Acadia in Maine, Shenandoah in Virginia and Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee. A hiker following the length of the Appalachian Trail this summer, therefore, is likely to encounter some pretty smoggy days. 
 On March 8, monitors in Great Smoky Mountains Park, near the southern end of the Appalachian Trail, recorded what the park's air quality officials called extraordinarily early violations of federal smog standards. Last autumn, the monitors documented heavy smog unusually late in the year. Usually, the smog season is concentrated in summer.
Last summer, Great Smoky recorded 52 days of smog exceeding federal health standards. Acadia recorded worse smog than Boston and Philadelphia. And visibility from Shenandoah's heights has been reduced by a quarter in the last 50 years.
In a satirical essay in the April issue of Backpacker magazine, Thom Hogan, the editor, writes of traveling the length of the Appalachian Trail 50 years in the future -- starting in January in Georgia to beat the heat and smog on a trip that nowadays typically begins in March. "Fortunately," he fantasizes, "I'm carrying my battery-powered rebreather, a technology derived from scuba equipment and paid for and refined by the final tobacco-industry settlements with the federal government in 2003."
Park advocates say today's reality is grim enough. "It's a tragedy when the air is dirtier in the places we escape the pollution of the city," said Jonathan Birdsong, southeastern regional representative for the Izaac Walton League, a conservation group of hunters and other outdoors enthusiasts, which recently issued a study of the trends.
The Environmental Protection Agency reported last month that in recent years, the smog trend in some national parks has been running counter to the overall national picture, which has steadily improved. Smog concentrations increased at 17 of 24 National Park Service monitoring sites from 1992 to 1998, the most recent comprehensive data that is available, the agency said.
The data measures ground-level concentrations of ozone, a chemical that forms smog. Ozone damages living cells, and therefore can harm not only growing plants but also people's lungs.
"The 1998 levels were particularly high at two parks in the eastern United States, Shenandoah and the Great Smoky Mountains," the report said. "Ozone levels at these sites were the highest in a decade and 30 to 40 percent higher than the national ozone standard."
Haze -- not the natural bluish vapors that gave the mountains their name, but the suspended smoky particles that are chemically different from smog -- is also worsening, the report said. "Eastern visibility impairment on the haziest days has worsened from 1997 to 1998, and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park experienced its worst visibility in more than a decade."
More than the view is affected, park advocates say. In a study several years ago by the Appalachian Mountain Club, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the Harvard School of Public Health, hikers climbing to the summit of Mount Washington in New Hampshire suffered from less efficient breathing as ozone levels rose. The people who had the worst problems were those with a history of asthma or other lung problems, but even healthy climbers could be affected, the study found.
And researchers in the Great Smoky Mountains park have documented damage to 30 plant species, including tall milkweed, black cherry and sassafras.
There are many sources of air pollution in parks. Some are affected even in wintertime by heavy snowmobile use; Yellowstone National Park is phasing out snowmobiles, and other parks are expected to crack down on their use. Cars, of course, crowd many parks in summer.
But the most persistent problems are caused by industrial pollution from relatively distant sources, especially coal-fired power plants, according to pollution experts.
In Great Smoky, for example, air quality scientists have found strong correlations between emissions from the Tennessee Valley Authority's power plants and pollution in the park. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency, which has been flying research planes in the area, said pollution patterns are complex, and it implicated Ohio Valley plants as well.
The E.P.A. has adopted policies that should result in significant reductions in smog in eastern states, including emissions from the T.V.A., in the next several years. The power authority already has taken steps to reduce the generation of smog-creating chemicals, especially in the summer. But at the same time, the authority, which is the largest federal utility in the nation, has been challenging some of the environmental agency's rules in court.

BYLINE: By Stephen S. Hall; Stephen S. Hall is a contributing writer for the magazine. His most recent article was about embryo research.

 BODY:
On a wet, blustery April morning, mist blowing sideways across the docks marking the lower end of Union Street on the Brooklyn waterfront, 17-year-old Alice Warren-Gregory races down the steps from her family's third-floor apartment a little after 5:30 a.m. Clutching a calculator and a copy of "The Great Gatsby," she hurries up the block in the predawn darkness to catch a waiting B71 bus. As we step on board, the driver says, "Good morning, Alice," and closes the door.
"I got four hours of sleep the night before, and I went to bed at 1 a.m. last night," Alice says grumpily, settling into a seat and opening her book. We have barely gone a block, and she is already fretting about how far behind she is. "I was supposed to write my essay on 'Song of Solomon' for English, but I didn't get to it," she says. "I had to do my laundry." The topics of this early-morning conversation -- laundry, homework, her guitar lessons, the boring party in Manhattan over the weekend -- form little tiles in the typical mosaic of teenage ennui. 
 But as the empty bus lumbers down into the Gowanus flats and up toward Prospect Park, strange words and phrases begin tumbling from Alice's lips. "Synaptic plasticity." "Hippocampus." "Long-term potentiation." She isn't talking about things she has learned from a textbook; she is talking about the stuff and ideas of contemporary brain research, things she'll be working with later that same day. Indeed, she is talking about a science project she is pursuing after school under the guidance of Constantine Pavlides, who happens to be a world-class neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York and a leading researcher on the role of stress in the neurophysiology of memory and learning.
The Pavlides lab, she says, has been pursuing a theory suggesting that animals -- presumably including humans -- convert the things they learn during their waking hours into long-term memory during the period of sleep characterized by rapid eye movement, or REM sleep, which also happens to be the peak period for dreaming. It is on the leading edge of modern scientific research, and Alice, who just took her College Boards and still doesn't know where she wants to go to college, spends part of every school day living on that edge. "If you deprive animals of REM sleep, they have lots of trouble, like with spatial relationships," Alice explains. "Kind of like me," she adds with a laugh. "Dr. Pavlides was explaining this to me, and I'm, like, yeah, two things I know a lot about -- stress and lack of sleep."
Alice's typical 18-hour school day begins before 6 a.m. As a junior at Midwood High School in Brooklyn, she attends one of the most overcrowded, antiquated, ethnically diverse and, in terms of science education, unusually successful schools in New York City's public school system. She is one of approximately 60 students in the class of 2001 known informally as "Intel kids" -- gifted students who literally sign a contract promising to devote several precious years of their teenage lives, weekends and summers usually included, to conducting original independent research and competing in a series of local and national science competitions, culminating in the prestigious Science Talent Search sponsored each year by the Intel Corporation (formerly by Westinghouse). Since 1990, Midwood High School has produced 112 semifinalists, one of the best records in the nation.
A generation ago the kind of students who entered science fairs were considered nerds -- preternaturally bright kids whose ardent intellects, moire-patterned wardrobes and clueless social instincts put them outside the adolescent mainstream. Geeks still roam the halls of American high schools -- and of Midwood, for that matter -- but many of Midwood's Intel kids move comfortably in the newly respectable mainstream, where being scientifically astute has a certain cachet. They inhabit an area of cultural endeavor that -- coming a quarter-century after the birth of biotechnology and personal computers and, yes, the rise of Nasdaq -- is now seen not only as intellectually precocious but also, suddenly, improbably, as positioned in a fast lane pointed toward wealth, creature comforts and the freedom to choose what to make of one's life.
At a place like Midwood, which draws on a less elite population than city schools with admission exams, like the traditional powerhouses Stuyvesant and the Bronx High School of Science, the Intel contest provides the flame that heats a new, high-tech version of the melting pot myth. Many of the students competing for next year's prizes lived just a few years ago in places like Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Vietnam and Bangladesh, and English is often a second language. Many come from households with difficult financial or familial circumstances. Like a test-tube version of the teenage strivers immortalized in the movie "Fame," they see the science-fair competitions as a path to attention and acclaim, to scholarship money and a better college education and, ultimately, to a better life. For many students, merely doing the research and producing a paper is a transforming experience.
But it comes at tremendous sacrifice. "Everyone who has worked in my lab has gone to Harvard, Yale, Brown, all Ivy League schools," Alice says. "I really feel a pressure to perform." That pressure often chases an otherwise lovely smile from Alice's face; in more relaxed moments she can be sassy, irreverent, insightful and unusually self-aware, but like many Intel kids, she has her eyes firmly latched on the prize. "I think it's really good to have something like Intel, because it gives you focus," she says. "I think some people in high school lose sight, and then they get to their senior year and find that they've gotten caught up in trivial things. Right now is a really good time to work hard at something."
In these days of standards-based education, the Intel competition functions as a kind of ex officio nationwide Regents test for the best and the brightest. It is often referred to -- in Intel news releases, certainly -- as "the Nobel Prize of high school students," and kids who reach the finals and semifinals get lots of attention. What rarely gets described is the gestalt of life as a burgeoning adolescent intellect -- the incredibly long days, the hard and heady work, the inevitable shedding of many quotidian pleasures of teenage life (dating, participating in sports, listening to or making music) in order to conduct advanced lab research. As Alice puts it: "There are people in the Intel program at school who have social lives. I just don't happen to be one of them."
After leaving the subway and stopping for a bagel with cream cheese ("This is probably the last thing I'll have to eat until 7 o'clock tonight"), Alice walks briskly to Brooklyn College, where Midwood students attend some of their college-level advanced-placement classes. The first to arrive, she sits on the floor of a long, empty corridor interrupted only by a succession of cranberry-colored steel doors, all locked. "My mom is really concerned about my health," Alice says at one point. "She thinks I have an eating disorder. But I just don't have time to eat, that's the problem."
Unexpectedly, a little fear creeps into her voice. Her mother, she continues, recently announced her desire to leave New York -- the sooner she could move, the better. Alice interprets this development as a potentially devastating disruption of all her dreams -- of staying at Midwood, of completing her Intel project, of getting into a top-drawer East Coast college. "I just want to finish up at Midwood," she says, swallowing hard, staring straight ahead. "But as it stands now, I really have no place to go." Shortly after sunrise, she is deep into the day's first crisis.
At 7 a.m., the chemistry teacher, Alan Finkelstein, arrives and unlocks the classroom door, and Alice, along with 30 or so other sleepy-eyed students, files into the room. Finkelstein wordlessly begins to write a problem on the board. "The electrolysis of an aqueous solution of potassium iodide results in the formation of hydrogen gas at the cathode and. . . . " Like everyone else, Alice gets out her calculator and begins solving what, for her, is a far more tractable kind of problem.
 
'The Scientific 'Hood'
It has always been hard to be a high school intellectual. my 1967 high school yearbook contains a photograph of the Science Seminar club. Eight students, all boys. No one is smiling. It would be easy to make fun of the horn-rimmed glasses and bold plaid shirts, but what is most striking to me is the body language: the tense, tight-lipped posture of defensiveness, as if being smart, clever and intellectually adventurous singled you out for ridicule. The damning adjective for any teenager from that era was "mature." That was code for smart, responsible and virtually incapable of the puerile, thrill-seeking, predatory, reckless and authority-defying behavior so essential to adolescent self-esteem.
I wasn't in that picture, but only because the brainiacs at my suburban Chicago high school left me in the dust. I don't believe the word "geek" had entered the lexicon then, but the sense of the word surely had: kids gifted in science and math inhabited a rarefied universe, where everything intellectual was easy and everything social was hard. Or so it seemed. In reality, I have come around to the view that science institutionalizes the need to challenge your strongest convictions with rigorous thought, which is one reason it constantly chases the New and is now, arguably, a much more interesting avant-garde than, say, art. And there comes a moment, sooner or later, when we all admire its creativity and yearn for its interventions. One of the "kids" in that photograph, Douglas Brash, is now a professor at Yale who has played a leading role in explaining why we risk developing cancer when we sunbathe -- molecular explanations that may lead to molecular interventions and treatments for the growing epidemic of skin cancer.
While geekdom has not totally been erased from the culture of high school science, the difference at Midwood is immediately apparent. In Alice's junior research class, taught by Stanley Shapiro, an enthusiastic, joke-spewing instructor who has a Ph.D. in chemistry and coordinates the science research program at Midwood, girls outnumber boys by almost 2 to 1, as they do in the entire program. And plastic shirt-pocket pen protectors don't live here anymore. Maria Bouzas, a junior, stands in front of the class describing her research project; she is wearing baggy blue pants, a loose gray sweatshirt and a light green kerchief around her streaked hair and sports a stainless-steel diamond-shaped stud through her lower lip. After describing the molecular biology of diabetes, and some particularly grisly techniques she has learned in a laboratory at Brooklyn College, someone in the class asked, "You did that?"
Maria suddenly brightened. "Yeah, man," she gushed. "I broke my way into the scientific 'hood!" (I later learned that she also rides dirt bikes on the weekend and subscribes to a motocross magazine.)
Everyone at Midwood seems to have a story. Alice, for example, lives in an apartment in Carroll Gardens with her mother and younger sister. Her mother works as a massage therapist at a Y.M.C.A. in Manhattan; she has hired a baby sitter so that Alice can do her after-school research at Rockefeller until 7 p.m. and not have to pick up her 7-year-old sister, Karyn, after school. To pay for the sitter, she has to work longer hours, which means she rarely sees Alice during the school week. "I'm usually in bed before she gets home," Alice said. Alice often leaves for school before her mother wakes up.
I noticed that Alice mentioned her mother a lot, but her father not at all. "He's not a factor," she said in a strenuously neutral voice. She had written a poem about him, she told me, that appeared in Patterns, Midwood's literary magazine; it describes a daughter going to visit her father after he has undergone drug rehabilitation. "Three weeks was long enough," it reads, "For him to see/how slowly he was killing me/How waiting to find your father strung out/over cold, white, bathroom tile/was enough to rip your soul to shreds." Alice has a grade-point average of 97.1 and recently totalled 1490 on her College Boards.
As Jay Touger, one of three research advisers at the school, put it, "You never know, looking at these kids, what life has done for them, or to them." Ananya Das's family, which belonged to the Hindu minority living in Moslem-dominated Bangladesh, fled the country in 1994 after increasing incidents of religious violence, including the kidnapping and rape of young Hindu girls; she is studying perception and the visual system at a lab at Brooklyn College. Mong Thi Le, who goes by the name Meagan, is a quietly brilliant 17-year-old who emigrated with her family from Saigon in 1996 and now has a grade-point average of 96.23. Anti-Semitism forced the family of Marianna Shnayderman, one of a large contingent of Russian emigres at the school, to leave Kiev in 1991; in addition to having been an Intel semifinalist, she will be Midwood's valedictorian at graduation ceremonies this month. Eugene Simuni, another Russian, came to the United States less than three years ago, yet finished higher than any other New York City student in this year's Intel contest. His classmate Emmanuelle St. Jean, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, was the only African-American among the Top 40 Intel finalists. Shapiro likes to tell the story about the time one former student needed to supply a Social Security number to fill out a science-fair application, which is how it was discovered that she was, technically, an illegal alien.
 
'A Lot of People, Like, Don't Even Know That I'm Smart'
Midwood may be an especially comfortable place to be smart. It's competitive -- everyone seems to know everyone else's grade-point average, down to the hundredth place, and students can have a 90 average and still rank 200th in their class. But many of the Intel students glide in and out of their elite subculture without passports or apologies.
"I don't think of myself as being smart -- I think of myself as being normal," says Emmanuelle, who chose Barnard over Harvard for college. Diana Murakhovskaya, a senior who is also editor of the school's science magazine, Prism, says: "I don't see myself as a geek. I have my smart friends. I have my museum friends. I have friends I go to clubs with on the weekend. A lot of people, like, don't even know that I'm smart."
With its six Ionic columns and its Georgian cupola, the architecture of Midwood High School makes an outdated argument for a traditional, even classical, education in a neighborhood, and world, that has changed around it. The school was built to accommodate 2,800 students, mostly from the Irish, Italian and Jewish families that used to live nearby, but now nearly 4,000 crowd its hallways. In addition to its two gifted programs, for medical science and for the humanities, it is also the zoned high school for Midwood and surrounding neighborhoods, with their predominantly minority populations; the school is just over 40 percent African-American, 31 percent white, 19 percent Asian and 9 percent Hispanic, although the research program is much less heterogenous.
In many respects, Midwood is as up to date as any high school in the nation. Students affect a hip urban nomad look, lugging enormous backpacks, athletic bags, coats and lacrosse sticks from room to room. (No one is allowed to use the lockers anymore because thefts became so rampant.) The Intel students typically avoid the crowded cafeteria and eat lunch in class (everything from takeout barbecue to mocha Frappuccinos). They can get credit for phys ed by taking the "cheese bus" (the classic yellow schoolbus) to a bowling alley or billiards parlor. And the school newspaper recently ran an article entitled "Should Cross-Dressing Be Allowed at the Prom?"
But time has stood still at Midwood in the worst possible way: its physical plant is a running joke among students and teachers. When I marveled at the beautiful 1940's-era glass-paneled cabinetry in some of the science labs, the principal, Lewis Frohlich, barked: "I don't need museum pieces. I need modern equipment and facilities." (He is about to get his wish: after nearly six years of bureaucratic and community delays, Midwood hopes to begin construction on a $22 million state-of-the-art science annex across Bedford Avenue from the school in the fall of 2001.)
And yet Midwood's shabby facilities also prove the point that dedicated teachers mean more than modern equipment. Midwood's two Intel finalists this year worked under Touger's tutelage. Ann Nicastri, who was a Westinghouse semifinalist in the 1950's, guides research students in biology. When you ask students why Midwood has been so successful in recent Intel competitions, they invariably mention the close and informal rapport with their teachers, and after watching their interaction over several months, I realized that in order to push students to their limits, and perhaps a little beyond, you need to know them very well. Recently, for example, when Alice began to feel a little overwhelmed, she went in to see Shapiro and "yenta," as he put it, about all the stress she felt in her life -- how she was burning the candle at both ends, working too hard, tired all the time. "My reaction was, 'Good,"' Shapiro told me later. "That's what I like to see in my students."
"We ask the kids to do the impossible," Touger said. "We ask them to do the equivalent of a master's thesis or a graduate thesis on a topic they know nothing about at first, and to do it in one year. And they do it. Year after year, they do it."
 
Room 256
The first time I encountered Alice, she had come into room 256 -- technically a prep room for the physical science teachers, but in practice a kind of clubroom for Midwood's teenage intelligentsia -- with an excuse. Her English teacher had lost the only (handwritten) copy of the essay she had done on "Scientific Attitude," one of five essays that form part of the Intel contest application. Shapiro looked at her skeptically -- as much, it seemed, because she preferred writing in longhand to using a computer. They bantered back and forth, and somehow the discussion turned to the way that kids, even in rural areas, can become interested in science. Shapiro mentioned the movie "October Sky," about young rocket enthusiasts growing up in West Virginia. Alice, whose attitude can fairly be said to lean toward the humorously unsentimental, made a ribald remark about the recreational practices of teenage boys in rural America. In my day the comment might have earned a suspension, or at least a lecture. Here, everyone laughed.
Room 256, in other words, is the place where the traditional boundaries of authority and deference between students and teachers break down. The atmosphere of adult collegiality in turn creates an environment of adult expectation. Room 256 has high ceilings, high windows and an unbelievable amount of clutter, including half a dozen models of the solar system, quaintly obsolete electrical devices, the odd box of rocks, bottles of chemicals with yellowing labels, one computer for a dozen teachers and a ceiling fan that, upon closer inspection, is a floor fan lashed to the ceiling.
On any given morning around 8:30, several seniors invariably gather in the room around a 12-foot worktable. The conversation veers into molecular biology or computer models of traffic flow, then just as quickly back to plans for the prom. Diana, who is a dark-haired 18-year-old born in Odessa and an Intel semifinalist this year, goes clubbing on the weekend with Marianna, the class valedictorian, and other girls from Midwood. But she can tell you more than you could possibly want to know about the reactivity of ATP synthase molecules on the surface of cancer cells. She plans to get an engineering degree from Cooper Union. "I probably want to start my own business," she said. "Or belong to a corporation -- like, be the boss of it."
Ross Krupnik, 17, a genial and thoughtful student who lives in Sheepshead Bay, also did some original research on ATP synthase. "We have, like, clashing results," he admitted, nodding toward Diana.
"Yeah," she replied, "but mine are being published."
Steven Beigelmacher, 18, spent one morning lecturing the others on his empirically derived technique for pouring hot coffee into a thin plastic cup without its melting; a computer jock, he will spend the summer calculating pensions for retired city firemen before attending Carnegie-Mellon University in the fall.
They don't, however, spend all their time reciting equations. One day, Diana announced that having finally turned 18, she had made a long-anticipated appointment to go sky diving this month. Someone asked if she liked para-sailing; she shook her head and said it was too boring. Instead of going to the prom, she and some friends have rented a limo and plan to go to dinner and clubbing before catching a bus to Ocean City, N.J., for a day of jet skiing at the beach.
"If there was a television show, Room 256 would be the place," said Martin Langan, the assistant principal for the school's science department. "This is like the teacher's version of M*A*S*H." The scene even came with goofy public-address announcements. "Today's meeting of the Islamic Society has been canceled," went a voice over the loudspeaker. "Thank you. Have a good day today, and a better day tomorrow."
 
The (Rube) Goldberg Variations
Alice, who was born in California and moved to Brooklyn when she was in the fifth grade, entered the research program as a sophomore because of her exceptional performance in science classes. "I didn't ask to be an Intel student," she explained one day as we walked to her lab at Rockefeller. "They just sort of put me into it without asking. My mom's reaction was, 'This is what we wanted!' and I said, 'We'?"
"There was a little hesitation," confirmed her mother, Patricia Gregory. "She can be very, very hard on herself, and has to be perfect. She wasn't sure she could handle it as well as her schoolwork. But I felt she was too young not to take risks." By May of last year, she placed first in Midwood's annual sophomore science fair and was on her Intel way.
The most promising science students at Midwood, approximately 105 freshmen, are steered into the research program. During their first two years, the students take classes in research methods, develop critical thinking and are encouraged to submit entries as sophomores in various science fairs. "If you can't get 95's easily, then you better drop out, because you won't be able to keep up with your schoolwork," Shapiro said. "And it's usually self-selection out." By sophomore year, the total in the program is down to 95, and by junior year the number is about 60.
The advanced level of the research adds a layer of incomprehensibility to the already fitful conversation between parents and teenagers. "My dad, like, didn't even know I was in Intel until he saw my picture in The Daily News," Diana told me. Lauren Mikulski, a senior, said describing her research project to her family was difficult because "we had a vocabulary in the lab that isn't even in the dictionary, it's so new." When she showed her father a draft of her research paper, he said it was good. "But did you understand it?" she continued. "No," he confessed. Not an unusual reaction, except that Lauren's father teaches organic chemistry at Brooklyn Technical High School.
The sheer workload and commuting time -- getting to school by 7 a.m., taking the subway to labs -- makes the day especially long. During the summer following her sophomore year, Alice stayed with family friends who lived closer to Midwood while taking a course in molecular biology. She began to hang out with two other Intel students who lived nearby, Daniel Shaw and Etan Marciano. "Those guys are so funny," she said at one point. Indeed, as sophomores the two boys parlayed their humor into the winning entry in the Rube Goldberg contest held last year at the New York City Science Fair. Their device was a monument to high-precision superfluous engineering, designed to deposit cereal and milk in a bowl mechanically, and to do so in exactly 60 seconds. "Breakfast for One," they called it.
When I went to visit him one Saturday afternoon, Daniel was playing Chopin's Waltz in C Sharp Minor on the piano in the living room of his family's home in Ditmas Park. A junior at Midwood, Daniel, 16, had just come home from playing tennis and later that night would be hanging out with his girlfriend. I had first met Daniel on a Tuesday afternoon at Midwood when he came into Room 256 to meet with Shapiro and discuss the first draft of one of his Intel essays. He had jet black hair, slicked back, and wore baggy pants and tennis shoes, which in one sweeping motion he planted firmly on Shapiro's desk. Juniors like Daniel and Alice are encouraged to engage in a version of what Jay Touger calls "six degrees of separation," in which the brother of the father of a friend of a friend might know someone who runs a laboratory in Brooklyn or Manhattan and might be approached to work as a mentor. A student was once placed at N.Y.U. Medical Center through someone who knew a custodian there.
While Midwood might be accused of tailoring its program too specifically to successful Intel applications, there was nothing narrow about the discussion between Shapiro and Daniel. It was a stream-of-consciousness conversation that had almost nothing to do with science but everything to do with two associative, nimble intellects jumping from one topic of interest to another, highbrow erudition tussling with lowbrow humor the entire way.
While eating his lunch, Shapiro perused the first few paragraphs of Daniel's essay on "Scientific Attitude." "Yeah, clever stuff," he grunted approvingly. "I didn't know you played the piano."
"I play three instruments," Daniel replied. "The piano, the cello and the bass guitar."
"Too bad you didn't go to the High School for the Performing Arts."
"Yeah," Daniel laughed, "I could be a starving artist instead of a starving scientist."
"What kind of pieces?" Shapiro asked, referring to the music. "Are you talking about 'Mary Had a Little Lamb'?"
"No, no," Daniel protested. "I was decent. I can play Beethoven sonatas. The 'Moonlight Sonata.' 'Pathetique.' Chopin waltzes."
"Can you play the 'Appassionata'?" Shapiro asked.
"No," Daniel said with a knowing laugh. "But that was always my goal."
"So who was Haydn's favorite composer?" Daniel scrunched up his face and half-heartedly suggested Beethoven. Shapiro shook his head. "And it wasn't Mozart, either," he said. "His name was von Weber, who almost no one has heard about. It's beautiful stuff, but no one knows about him." The conversation moved on to 12-tone scales and then, somehow, to gefilte fish. "Did you know," Shapiro said, "that Mrs. Goldberg, the chemistry teacher, makes her own gefilte fish? And it's fabulous."
"Those are two words," Daniel said firmly, packing up his books, "that should never appear in the same sentence -- gefilte' and 'fabulous."'
On the Saturday afternoon I visited Daniel, we crossed Argyle Road to Etan's house, and the two boys fetched the Rube Goldberg device from the basement. While setting up the apparatus, they talked about the research they were conducting for their Intel projects. Rube would not have approved.
Through an uncle who is an orthopedic surgeon, Daniel had found a position working in a lab at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, testing the effect of naturally occurring estrogens (known as phyto-estrogens) on bone-forming cells known as osteoblasts; this has suddenly become a hot avenue of research lately because of concerns about hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women. Etan, meanwhile, was working with psychiatric researchers at Columbia University who were investigating the biology of several drugs that seemed to mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia.
"Ready?" Etan said, with a sly self-aware smile, after they had set up the device. "Ready to be amazed?" It doesn't translate readily into words but involved a golf ball rolling down a tube that hit a lever (which caused cereal to fall into a bowl) and then knocked another ball, which caused a container of milk to tip over, slowly filling the cereal bowl until the weight completed a circuit underneath the bowl that turned on a motor, which removed a nail from the lower end of the tubing, allowing the golf ball to descend and then plop into a little basket and activate a pulley, which lifted it, as the rules required, exactly 30 centimeters above the surface, returning the ball to its starting height.
It was a little hard to reconcile the geeky exuberance of their creation with the heavy exertion usually required to maintain teenage indifference, and I was curious if Daniel and Etan felt the same defensiveness that characterized the students in the picture from my yearbook. "We're friends with people on the lacrosse team that we hang out with," Daniel explained. "We hang out with a lot of kids who are, quote, popular, although they do make fun of us all the time and call us nerds. But," he added with a triumphant smile, "we have better grades than they do."
Perhaps the shrewdest observation came from Lauren Mikulski. "I think a lot of people perceive that the Intel students are supersmart and dorks," she admitted. "But there is so much cultural diversity at Midwood, I guess, that you don't see it as much." Brilliance, in other words, is just another form of diversity at a school with an Islamic Society and Gay-Straight Alliance. As Marc Ostrega, a teacher, put it one day, science is just another alternative lifestyle.
 
For Every Action, an Equal and Opposite Reaction
Whether you are an athlete or an intellect, there is nothing more humbling than the day you discover that you are no longer among the best, after having been there for so long. For a lot of students in the research program, that day came on Jan. 10, when all 44 Midwood seniors who entered the Intel competition filed into a classroom on the third floor to learn who had been selected as Intel semifinalists. The media had been alerted, and juniors like Alice also attended. "I felt nervous for the people who were there," she recalled, "and I was sitting there thinking: Oh, God, this is going to be me next year. Who wants to find out in front of all these people?"
It was a great day for Midwood, with 13 semifinalists in all -- 11 from the science research program and 2 from the school's social science program. That total tied a school in Bethesda, Md., for tops in the nation. But three out of four research students did not make the cut, and some of the teachers took it harder than the kids.
That thought came to mind when I spoke to Lauren, who squeezed in an appointment with me between her daily stint at the yearbook office, where she is head photographer, and a meeting of the prom planning committee. She wore a copper-colored V-neck sweater and tight black pants and fairly bristled with energy. For her Intel project, Lauren, 18, worked in the Rockefeller University laboratory of A. James Hudspeth, searching for a gene that creates tiny hairs in certain cells of the inner ear, allowing an animal (the bullfrog, in her case) to detect sound. She worked in the lab seven days a week for one summer and four or five days a week during the school year. But the Intel deadline arrived before Lauren had found the gene she was looking for. (A crushing paradox about the Intel competition is that some of the most ambitious and interesting projects are in effect penalized because they can't be completed in time.)
"I was down to five or seven genes," she said. "So it was very frustrating." Not that she didn't have a few other things to divert her. In addition to her many extracurricular activities -- being director of Midwood's Black Heritage Alliance Show and an officer in the student government -- every afternoon, after getting up at 5 a.m., attending classes and then putting in her time at the Rockefeller lab, she would head over to N.B.A. headquarters in Midtown, where she worked (sometimes as late as 10 p.m.) in human resources for the Women's N.B.A. And then she would transfer four times on the subway ride back to her home in the Windsor Terrace section of Brooklyn. When I casually asked if she had a boyfriend, she practically shouted, "Does it sound like I have time for a boyfriend?"
She, too, was sitting in the room when the Intel semifinalists were announced, and she ended up having to console her teachers. "All of my advisers were very surprised," she recalled. "Miss Nicastri was apologizing to me. She was saying, 'I'm so sorry, you should have won, I'm so sorry.' And I'm saying: 'Miss Nicastri, it's not your fault. It's O.K., it's O.K."'
Failure happens to the best of them. One day in mid-May, Eugene Simuni returned to Midwood after having spent the previous week at the International Science and Engineering Fair in Detroit. He was Midwood's star science student this year; he had already won $10,000 in cash as the grand prize winner in New York City's annual science fair and $25,000 in scholarship money as the fifth place finisher overall in the Intel Science Talent Search, which is considered the most rigorous science competition. He had been accepted at Harvard, M.I.T. and just about every other place he had applied.
"So what'd you win?" somebody asked when he walked into Room 256.
"I got a T-shirt," he laughed. He did merit an honorable mention in the biochemistry competition. (Emmanuelle finished third in microbiology.) The consensus at Midwood was that the judges at the Detroit fair simply did not understand Eugene's project.
 
'Welcome to New York, Eugene'
Alice has her pugnacious moments, and they often surface during a long-running friendly disagreement she has with Eugene, a senior in her Spanish class. Eugene spent much of April wrestling with the enviable problem of deciding whether to attend Harvard or M.I.T. (Harvard won out.) But for the time being, he doesn't plan on pursuing a career in science. "Eugene wants to make money," Alice told me one day, confiding this in a way that made it clear she considered it a prodigious waste of intellectual talent.
"I don't see my career as a scientist," Eugene confirmed. "Now I'm thinking about working in the technology field, but not as a scientist. More as an administrator. My personal feeling about money is, it's not the most important thing in life -- you should love what you're doing. But it's still important!" A year ago he would have been inclined to pursue a career related to computers. "Now, because I've been doing so much biochemistry, I'm more interested in biotechnology. So this choice is not easy."
Born in St. Petersburg, Eugene attended a special mathematics and science academy in Russia. In December 1997, when he first arrived at Midwood, Eugene would sit alone in the cafeteria, barely able to speak English yet resolutely determined not to be fazed by the experience. "I couldn't say I was too much shocked," he said. He has a cheerfully phlegmatic personality, quick to laugh when he is teased but serenely unruffled by the experience of learning his chops as an American teenager in the crucible of an inner-city public high school. "I wasn't shocked by anything. I realized that that would be the case, so I didn't feel especially bad when I sat alone in the cafeteria."
As far as I could determine, the only things that left Eugene even moderately puzzled about life in America were episodes of "Seinfeld" and how to operate the mimeograph machine in Room 256. One morning when he was standing by the machine, Emmanuelle, Midwood's other Intel finalist this year, came in. "Did you get your check yet?" she asked, referring to the $1,000 each semifinalist received. "I got it yesterday," Eugene said.
"How come you always get your money before me?" she demanded. Eugene shrugged and smiled. "I already know what I'm going to buy with mine," she continued. I immediately thought of a stereo, a bushel of CD's, clothes. "Stock," she announced confidently. And she knew exactly which biotech company she was going to invest in.
 
'If You Make Gazillions of Dollars. . . .'
It wasn't just that they invested in stocks and won six-figure scholarships. It was the level of the research they conducted that frankly stunned me. As a high school student in the 1960's, I knew I didn't have the right stuff for the science-fair circuit from my very first (and only) project, which was based on the profoundly misguided idea that water pollution might actually benefit the health of animals. Almost everything associated with this benighted project was wrong, including the assurances I gave my family that frogs could not possibly escape from an uncovered laundry tub in the basement.
The Intel students don't do science projects -- they do science, period, often working at the frontiers of knowledge and sometimes under intense competitive pressures. Eugene, working at Rockefeller University with Ethan Marin, used computerized data on the three-dimensional atomic structure of two proteins (known as G proteins) to compare the way they relayed a biological signal inside cells. He showed that the structure of one of these proteins differed in a way that could explain why it acts in a more delayed fashion in the rod cells of the eyes (and thus affects vision) but not in other cells of the body. Emmanuelle, working with a biologist at New York University Medical Center named Jayne Raper, identified a portal-like molecule on the surface of trypanosomes, the family of microbes responsible for sleeping sickness in Africa and a disease in cattle. This "scavenger" molecule allows the parasites to feed on cholesterol in the bloodstream of humans and animals, and thus the research suggests possible strategies for developing medicines that would block the parasites' ability to feed. Emmanuelle doesn't even have a driver's license yet, but, Raper said in an interview, "she will get her name on a scientific paper."
The Top 40 Intel finalists, including Eugene and Emmanuelle, converged on Washington last March for the mother of all high school science fairs, the Science Talent Search, which was originally conceived by an advertising and public relations executive at Westinghouse in 1942. The students stayed for six nights at the elegant Mayflower Hotel, set up their little booths to explain their projects to public visitors at the National Academy of Sciences and endured several grueling days of questioning by a panel of judges. "We called the Massachusetts Room, where three of the judges were, the 'Massacre Room,"' Emmanuelle explained later. The Top 10 finishers were announced at an annual black-tie awards banquet.
The contest has always been exceptionally prestigious, but it has the added aura now of New Economy money. The winner of the top prize this year, Viviana Risca, of Paul D. Schreiber High School in Port Washington, on Long Island, went home with a $100,000 scholarship, part of the $1.25 million in prize money provided by Intel. A representative of a major pharmaceutical company circulated through the crowd of finalists, practically promising summer internships on the spot. There were lots of stock market jokes.
I don't think the sea change in the way the world views these kids became truly apparent to me, however, until two weeks later when I accompanied the Midwood contingent to a reception at the New York City Board of Education honoring all the city's Intel finalists and semifinalists. "This has a special meaning for me," said Harold O. Levy, then interim chancellor, in a ruefully witty, been-there-done-that riff, "especially as a Bronx High School of Science student who did not get what was called, in those days, a Westinghouse. But I tried." As an endless stream of board members, educational officials and other functionaries took the podium, I couldn't help thinking of something Touger mentioned several days earlier: "I tell the kids that if they're lucky enough to win, I will take full credit, and Mr. Shapiro will take full credit, and the principal and the district superintendent will take credit, and the Board of Ed and the borough president will take credit, and their parents will take credit. And whatever is left over is theirs."
But it was the eleemosynary pitch by Judith A. Rizzo, the deputy chancellor for instruction, that truly signaled the fact that nerds now rule: she already had her hand out. She implored the students to remember that they had been the product of a public school education. "If you start a company and make gazillions of dollars," she said hopefully, "maybe you can buy a few computers for the schools." Where once it was assumed that they would "do well" in the traditional academic sense, the new economy has made clear that they will most likely do well -- fabulously well, in some cases -- in the financial sense, too, and it's never too soon to get your hand out.
 
'We Expect to See You Win a Nobel Prize'
For a good part of April and May, one Midwood student after another walked into Room 256 with news of intellectual approbation -- and financial reward. Amber Iqbal, a petite girl from Pakistan, stopped by to report that she was being honored by the Society of Microbiology for her project. The American Academy of Neurology faxed a letter saying they were flying Lawrence Fung, the son of a Chinese immigrant truck driver, out to San Diego as one of three high school students in the country to collect a $1,000 award. And Ilya Sherman, one of the Russian kids, walked in with the news one day that he had received a college scholarship from Chase Manhattan Bank worth more than $100,000.
Midwood's 13 Intel semifinalists also took a victory lap through the city. While the seniors posed for pictures on the steps of City Hall, savoring Peter F. Vallone's parting words at a City Council reception ("We expect to see you win a Nobel Prize one of these days," he said), the juniors at that very moment were schlepping to labs all over Brooklyn and Manhattan, facing a hot summer of 18-hour days, hopeful that they, too, would enjoy a similar victory tour in the spring of 2001. At about 4 on an afternoon not long after the City Hall celebration, Alice sat in front of a computer in a large high-ceilinged lab at Rockefeller University, the indirect light of a glorious afternoon spilling in through the windows. The scene had an air of monastic serenity -- not least because the most recent personal crisis seemed to have passed. Alice's mother assured her that she wouldn't move until Alice finished up at Midwood.
As it turns out, the lab was in a scientific race on a very competitive project, and she was hardly a teenage bottle-washer. They needed her! Constantine Pavlides, the lab chief, began to explain to me that they were looking at the activity of a certain "immediate-early gene" called zif-268, which alters synaptic architecture and in so doing "cements" what has been learned into permanent memory. Suddenly he stopped himself short and laughed nervously. "I'm not sure how much I should tell you," he said.
In the next room, Alice sat at a computer plotting some preliminary data under the tutelage of Sidarta Ribeiro, a Brazilian graduate student. The software automatically converted the activity of the gene they were studying, in dreaming and wakeful animals, into side-by-side columns. The results were preliminary, but nonetheless promising. "We have a long way to go," Ribeiro said carefully. "But it's very . . . auspicious. Very interesting. We're going to pursue this." He got out a calendar and laid out a crash program to confirm the results, which would require an intense, coordinated plan of experimentation every day over the ensuing four weeks.
Several other scientists stopped by to stare at the data on the computer screen. "It's a nice result," one said. "A cool result," another said. A look of sudden, unexpected rapture briefly flickered across Alice's face, as if she had just discovered an extraordinarily interesting way to be cool. "I'm so lucky to be here," she whispered, and then went back to the numbers on the screen.

HEADLINE: Before the Flood

BYLINE: By John Noble Wilford; John Noble Wilford covers science for The Times. Harf Zimmermann is a Berlin-based photographer.

 BODY:
Each day the dammed waters of the Euphrates River rise another three feet, encroaching on the present and the past in southeastern Turkey. While people in the modern village of Belkis abandon their homes, archaeologists are fighting a rear-guard action to save what they can from the ruins of Zeugma, once a thriving outpost on the eastern frontier of the Roman Empire. Theirs is a losing battle.
When Turkey began building a hydroelectric dam near Belkis in 1992, few were aware of any significant ruins that would be endangered. But villagers, digging up their valuable pistachio trees, kept turning up building stones. Archaeologists eventually arrived on the scene and began digging, uncovering two large hillside villas. Despite pleas from scholars for more time to rescue artifacts, Turkish officials have refused to hold back the flood; the country is in desperate need of electric power. In a few days, the main excavation site will be inundated. By September, some 15,000 acres of the ancient city will be submerged. 
 Hurried excavations at the site have yielded a trove of art and other artifacts from antiquity. Frescoes uncovered from the villas appear almost as fresh as when they were painted nearly 2,000 years ago. Beautiful mosaics depict a vanished culture's mythology. Many graceful stone columns stand in place, and around them are remains of walls and plumbing, iron window frames and lamps that illumined nights long ago.
Christine Kondoleon, a curator at the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts, has just returned from a month's study at Zeugma, impressed and dispirited. "It isn't quite Antioch," she says, referring to one of the richest sites in that part of the Roman world. "But the extent of preservation is really unusual."
At its peak in the third century A. D., Zeugma prospered from caravan trade at the river crossing. Among its 70,000 residents were wealthy merchants and commanders of a Roman legion garrisoned there. They lived in imposing houses in the hills and imported artisans, probably from Antioch, to decorate them in a style befitting their lofty station. Before the century ended, Persians sacked Zeugma, leaving the ruins to be buried by time's accumulation of dirt. Only a few lines in contemporary records bore any written trace of the city's existence. But thick layers of clay sealed off the buried site from damaging moisture, accounting for the pristine state of much of the art.
How much of Zeugma's exquisitely preserved past will be lost in the deluge is unclear. Because the city was built on a steep hillside, scholars think half of the city's still-buried ruins will remain above water. But of necessity, excavations have been quick and dirty, focused on the recovery of works of art and other remains of the wealthy.
"What is lost is an understanding of the more humdrum aspects of a society -- where people of all strata lived and worked," says Stephen L. Dyson, a classics professor at suny Buffalo. "The best archaeology is a discipline of social-economic history, not just art history."

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Building a New Conservatory the American Way

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHOENBAUM; David Schoenbaum teaches history at the University of Iowa and is working on a social history of the violin.

DATELINE: CINCINNATI

 BODY:
BETWEEN his sensational debut in 1781 and his premature death in 1805, among the stack of plays, verses and histories that he produced, the German writer Friedrich Schiller also found time to think about the link between arts education and civic education. For Schiller the connection was obvious.
Although some of his contemporaries thought so, too, including Thomas Jefferson, the well-known architect, prose stylist and amateur violinist, the connection has never been obvious to the United States Congress, most state legislatures or countless school boards. But Americans have never entirely dismissed it, either. 
 Today, Schiller's "On the Aesthetic Education of Man" is tough going even for a Ph.D. candidate in German. Yet its traces can be seen in contemporary American translation, from Wes Craven's film "Music of the Heart" to the new conservatory complex in this Middle American metropolis, which once elected Jerry Springer mayor.
Historically, Americans have envied the public largess that Europeans used to consider normal. Today, as their own baby-boomers age, health costs climb and economies stagnate, Europeans increasingly ask how Americans manage so well without it.
Mr. Craven's homage to Roberta Guaspari's landmark Suzuki violin program in East Harlem provides part of the answer. Artistic differences with Madonna caused Mr. Craven to substitute Meryl Streep in the leading role. Yet the very fact that two such different superstars should leap to play an inspirational violin teacher might tell us that there is more to the current American classical-music scene than empty seats and graying audiences.
The long march to a Miramax film by way of Germany, Japan and East Harlem might tell us something, too. In 1921, Shinichi Suzuki went to Berlin to study the violin. In 1929, he returned home with a German wife, Schiller's conviction that great art makes good people, and a hunch, worked out over the next few decades, that children could learn an instrument the same way they learned a language.
But it was in America where his method took off, after a contingent of tiny Japanese fiddlers dazzled the 1964 meeting of the American String Teachers Association. By latest count, there are some 1,500 registered Suzuki teachers in Japan, 5,600 in the United States.
Among them is Ms. Guaspari, whose program acquired such resonance that the New York music establishment famously stepped in to save it when the Board of Education cut financing in 1991. Fed from the uniquely American salad bar of private contributions, patron-friendly tax laws, media attention and civic respect for achievers, her nonprofit Opus 118 Music Center has since become something of a Field of Dreams for inner-city children with quarter-size Chinese violins.
If the lesson is, "Build it and they will come," the University of Cincinnati's new conservatory complex is as instructive as East Harlem and in many ways more representative. A major river's length from the cultural citadels of the east coast, Cincinnati is American Generic, with an impressive waterfront, a lovingly preserved art deco hotel, a bank mysteriously known as Fifth Third, and the large civic presence of Procter & Gamble. It also boasts a May Festival, clearly descended from Schumann's Dusseldorf prototype; a 3,400-seat concert hall in a part of town still known as "Over the Rhine"; and a long history of local support to cover the resulting deficits.
By the 1960's, the old infrastructure, including two 19th-century conservatories and a city university, was nonetheless badly frayed. The solution turned out to be a cocktail of personal initiative and American-style public spending that Schiller himself might have proposed had he been a management professor at the University of Cincinnati rather than a sometime history professor at the University of Jena.
First, the conservatories merged. Second, they were absorbed as the College Conservatory of Music of the University of Cincinnati. Third, the university was absorbed in the Ohio public system. By the early 1990's, 1,000 students were pushing hard on the conservatory's resources, and administrators were again thinking seriously about the links between the arts and the civic culture.
When the new conservatory opened recently, guests could admire the architect Henry Cobb's elegantly functional ensemble of stages, recital halls, classrooms and storage spaces, neatly designed to bridge a former gothic dormitory and a recycled women's gymnasium. The name of the Corbett Center for the Performing Arts recognizes a major patron. That of the Robert J. Werner Recital Hall honors the entrepreneurial dean who leveraged private patronage into a major commitment by the board of regents and the Ohio legislature.
Many of the guests walked past a plaque in the lobby that most Americans would take for granted. But Schiller would probably have noticed it, and it is hard to imagine that it escaped the attention of one guest in particular, Robert Helmschrott, the director of the Bavarian State Conservatory in Munich. The plaque acknowledges more than 40 corporate and individual contributors, all private except for the National Endowment for the Arts. Private contributions accounted for about 25 percent of the $90 million project. But above all, they document the easy interaction of the private and public sectors. Combined with a historic capacity for importing and energizing immigrant enterprise, this may be America's biggest comparative advantage in the early 21st century.
The interaction is virtually personified in Kurt Sassmannshaus, the chairman of the conservatory's string department. On arriving in Cincinnati in 1982, Mr. Sassmanns haus began developing and combining a clientele extending from 6-year-olds to concert performers with networks extending from the Ohio Valley to China. What an economist might call Mr. Sassmannshaus's vertically integrated violin multinational is one of the conservatory's comparative advantages. And it leads full circle back to Schiller.
Like many American success stories, this one begins with opportunity knocking. In the 1920's, Dorothy Richard Starling earned a teacher's certificate and diploma from the Cincinnati Conservatory. She also studied for one year with the great Eugene Ysaye and for three more with the legendary Leopold Auer. On her death in 1969, her husband, Frank M. Starling, of Houston, created a foundation in her name, dedicated to violin teaching.
The special relationship with Cincinnati began with a call to Mr. Werner's predecessor as dean, Jack Watson. Since then, the Starling Foundation has also endowed chairs at Indiana University, the Juilliard School, the Curtis Institute and Carnegie-Mellon University. But Cincinnati has always been the bellwether and pacemaker. After consulting the renowned LaSalle Quartet at the university, Mr. Watson offered a new chair to Dorothy DeLay, of Juilliard, a legendary teacher in her own right.
To everyone's delight, Miss DeLay accepted, bringing with her three assets that helped turn a promising start-up into a global player. The first, amplified by scholarship money from Starling, was her own magnetic field, drawing talent from as far away as Korea, China, Japan, Germany, Russia, Romania, Albania and Israel. Today, 60 percent of the Cincinnati conservatory's violin students are international.
The second was her own network of artist managements, concert managements and instrument dealers going back to the 1940's, and extending from Juilliard, still Miss DeLay's institutional home, to the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado and the Beijing Conservatory.
The third asset was Mr. Sassmannshaus. A violin teacher's son from Wurzburg, Germany, and a graduate of the Cologne Conservatory, Mr. Sassmannshaus reassessed his own sense of the instrument after hearing and meeting a few of Miss DeLay's prodigies in the late 1970's. With a grant from the German Academic Exchange Service, he set out for Juilliard. On the eve of his return to Germany for a respectably tenured career as a big-city concertmaster, a job opened at Sarah Lawrence College.
It was already clear to Mr. Sassmanns haus that the typically American conjunction of conservatory and foundation would let him do things that were practically impossible at home. In Germany, as on most of the Continent, foundation aid is underdeveloped. Civil-service status practically forecloses private, even nonprofit, spinoffs. Civil-service law defines permissible working hours. Mr. Sassmannshaus took the American job on the spot. He has never regretted it.
A new job in Cincinnati allowed him to act on a second observation. All the emblematic teachers, he noticed, made their mark with very young players. Aided again by seed money from Starling, he added another working day to his conservatory teaching week and started a Saturday music school for 9- to 16-year-olds.
Their names and faces as diverse as the unit roll call in a World War II movie, some 20 youngsters have turned up weekly since 1987 from as far away as Chattanooga, Tenn., Sioux City, Iowa, and St. Louis. Awaiting them on arrival is a full-service curriculum of theory, ear training, private lessons and quartet playing, as well as the Starling Chamber Orchestra, which appears regularly at the Aspen Festival and has toured Germany, Turkey and China.
At first, Mr. Sassmannshaus himself did the management and paperwork. He then turned again to the parent foundation; created the Starling Project Foundation with a board made up of Starling parents, including an executive of the city's power company; opened a downtown office; and hired a manager to deal with logistics and grant applications. Referred by teachers, chance acquaintances and, in one case, the violinist Isaac Stern, Starling players emerge from an audition process that admits one candidate in 10.
ITHINK of a Saturday without Starling as a wasted day," said Ryan Miller, a high school senior from nearby Middletown, Ohio. Linda Johnson, a Starling mother from Festus, Mo., said that the students regard one another as peers and mentors. Their mothers regard one another as a support group.
Last year, with help from selected conservatory students, Mr. Sassmannshaus took the next step, a pilot program for 6-year-old beginners at Seven Hills, a group of private elementary and prep schools. The program is intended to generate a school chamber orchestra within four years.
If participants in the Starling program opt for careers in music, Mr. Sassmanns haus will be pleased. His job, as he sees it, is to ensure that they learn what they need to know to make it as teachers, orchestra players, chamber musicians and, at least in theory, soloists.
But solo careers are not the object. Nobody thinks less of a law school graduate for not making the Supreme Court. If Starling students prefer to be lawyers, that is O.K. with Mr. Sassmannshaus, too. Then they can come back and join his board, he adds cheerfully.
Among them, the pieces make up an arabesque of synergies and virtuous circles. Parents, patrons, foundations and the conservatory, which subsidizes the Starling program with rent-free rehearsal halls, classrooms and practice space, dance cheek to cheek. Younger students create jobs for older students. Talent attracts more talent. Contacts lead to more contacts.
University fund-raisers travel with Starling CD's. A letter from Ms. Streep accompanies the orchestra's recent videocassette. "Music has the power not only to bring great joy to children's lives," she writes, "but to encourage in them an awareness that diligent effort brings lasting rewards." In other words, arts education as civic education.
At the dedication, Liu Yang, 23, wowed the opening-night audience with a scorching performance of Sarasate's "Zigeuner weisen" on a Guarneri on loan from Dietmar Machold, whose shops in New York, Bremen, Zurich, Tokyo and Vienna make him perhaps the world's only truly global violin dealer. A Chinese national prize winner, originally dispatched to America to study with Miss DeLay, Mr. Liu now studies with Mr. Sassmannshaus.
Next January, Mr. Liu will perform at a national New Year's concert in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, which will be televised around the nation. Meanwhile, the Starling orchestra has been invited back for another tour of China. While there are no current plans for Germany, Schiller's Weimar should come due around 2005, the 200th anniversary of his death.

HEADLINE: DANCE;
A Baroque Blockbuster With a Cast of Hoofers

BYLINE: By TESSA DECARLO; Tessa DeCarlo writes about the arts from Northern California.

DATELINE: WALNUT CREEK, Calif.

 BODY:
THE feathers and costumes hadn't arrived yet, and the music came from a tinny boom box, not a live orchestra. The dancer was all concentration nevertheless, flying across the rehearsal space, muscles taut, legs kicking rhythmically, feet striking the ground just so.
"Beautiful!" exclaimed the choreographer, Creeky Routson, from her perch on the dancer's back. Then she reached down and rewarded him with an alfalfa pellet. 
 Ms. Routson and her horse were preparing for "Le Carrousel du Roi," a Baroque equestrian ballet that is the centerpiece of a weeklong early-music festival based in Berkeley, Calif. And while the 20 horses starring in this ambitious production are considerably taller, broader and hairier than the average ballerina, they are as disciplined and carefully trained as any human corps de ballet.
Their dance, which will be performed on Friday and Saturday, recreates an equine extravaganza presented in Paris in 1612 in the Place Royale (now the Place des Voges) to celebrate the betrothal of Louis XIII. It uses the vocabulary of dressage, a demanding method of horse training that in 17th-century France was the cutting edge of military technology.
"These moves require enormous strength from the horse and enormous cooperation," said Ms. Routson, a medalist in national dressage competitions. "I think people are going to be thrilled. The horse people are excited about it and the music people are, too."
In addition to the horse ballet, the Berkeley Festival and Exhibition will present more than 25 other musical events starting today through next Sunday, including concerts of Bach motets and vocal music from the library of Cardinal Richelieu, a fully staged version of Handel's cantata "Aminta e Fillide" and selections from the "lost" operas of Johann Kapsberger.
More than 50 additional "fringe" concerts will supplement the main events. The festival also offers symposiums on Bach performance and Renaissance spectacle, master classes in lute and harpsichord, displays and sales of instruments and recordings and meetings of enthusiast groups like the American Guild of Organists and the Viola da Gamba Society.
"People from the early-music community come from all over to see each other and perform together," said Robert Cole, the director of Cal Performances, which produces the festival and other performing arts events at the University of California, Berkeley. "This is not only a festival but a big party."
Berkeley's thriving early-music scene, nurtured by the university town's rich tradition of eccentricity and erudition, inspired Cal Performances to organize the first Berkeley Festival in 1990. It takes place in even-numbered years, alternating with a similar festival in Boston.
In each of their biennial programs, Berkeley Festival organizers try to include one blockbuster capable of attracting both early-music fans and broader audiences. At the 1998 festival it was the United States premiere of "Platee," a little-known 1745 opera about a lovelorn frog composed by Jean-Philippe Rameau and vividly reimagined by the choreographer Mark Morris. Both audiences and critics loved the production, which went on to a successful run at the New York City Opera this spring.
This year's blockbuster is the equestrian ballet, which will be performed at a dressage arena here. It is highly unlikely that this production will travel to another venue, however. "The impetus was that we had something here that nobody else in the world could do, that nobody else is ever going to do," said Mr. Cole. And weeks before show time the response was already tremendous. "It's off the map in terms of ticket sales," he reported happily. "We're reaching a whole new audience."
THE reconstruction of the horse ballet was made possible by Kate van Orden, a musicologist at Berkeley who unearthed the choreography and music of the 1612 event. That elaborate spectacle included not only dancing horses but lions, elephants, flaming volcanoes and an audience of 200,000 people.
The current edition of the ballet, though modest compared to the original, still promises plenty of excitement. To the sounds of trumpets, drums and an orchestra of shawms, sackbuts and bagpipes, led by Richard Cheetham, tumblers will vault over their horses and knights will stage a mock combat. There will be singing and poetry and a dance by six "demoiselles" riding Haflinger ponies, a fantastical-looking breed with thick white manes and tails.
The horse ballet, the program's final act, will feature knights, squires and horses in richly decorated period costumes, dancing to the original 1612 score by Robert Ballard and following the original choreography. The horses will pirouette, skip and canter sideways in response to the music and subtle shifts of posture by their human partners, whom Ms. Routson calls "some of the best competition riders in Northern California."
Those expecting horses to jump about on their hind legs "Fantasia" style, will be disappointed. This equestrian ballet, like human ballet of the same period, emphasizes obedience to pattern and hierarchy rather than over-the-top emotionalism. "This is a very French aesthetic," Ms. van Orden explained, "all about effortlessness and economy of gesture."
These are horses, however, so even small gestures are not all that small.
And while some of the movements may be subtle, the trumpets, drums and colorful costumes will be anything but. "This is going to have all of that knightly pomp and circumstance," Ms. van Orden said. "The kind of thing that people loved back then and that they still seem to love now."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/Readers' Questions;
Building's Name, Gallery's Photo, Complex's Origin

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:

A Wall Street Skyscraper
Q I have been tracing my family ancestry and know that Helena Gillender Asinari built the Gillender building in memory of her father. But who was he? . . . Katey Gillinder, Cambridge, England.
A Her father was Eccles Gillender, born in New York in 1810, a millionaire tobacco merchant who made his fortune during the Civil War and died in Paris in 1877. Although his obituary spells the name Gillender, earlier directory and census records sometimes render it with the spelling you use in your signature. The 19-story Gillender Building, an unusually thin skyscraper designed by Berg & Clark, was built in 1896-1897 at the northwest corner of Wall and Nassau Streets. It was put up in a hurry to beat contemplated legislation to outlaw tall buildings, although serious regulation did not come until 1916. The $500,000 structure was demolished only 13 years after completion, replaced by the Bankers Trust Company skyscraper at 14 Wall Street. 
 Although no period sources definitely indicate how Helena Asinari named the structure, it does seem more likely that she would have named it for her father than her mother, Augusta Gillender. In 1884 Augusta Gillender had disinherited her daughter in favor of her Italian son-in-law, the Marquis of San Marzano, from whom Helena had separated in 1883. Helena Asinari had already inherited the land at Wall and Nassau.
Helena Asinari sold the Gillender skyscraper in 1909, and she was able to purchase the newly built Norman-style apartment house at the northwest corner of 82nd Street and West End Avenue. It was apparently she who gave it the name still in use -- the Umbria. She died there in 1932.
 
A Fifth Avenue Gallery
Q For a new edition of "The Golden City," my book about classical versus modern architecture first published in 1959, can you locate an old photograph of the Duveen art gallery at the northwest corner of 56th Street and Fifth Avenue, designed in 1911 by Horace Trumbauer and Rene Sergent? . . . Henry Hope Reed, Manhattan.
A The oldest good photographs apparently available were made after World War II, long after the building was completed in 1913 and only a few years before its demolition in early 1953. Joseph Duveen was one of the top old-master dealers, closely associated with the collections of Henry Clay Frick, Paul Mellon and others.
The design for this richly sculptured structure was apparently not published in a contemporary architectural journal (such publications are frequently sources for photographs). At the time of construction, Duveen had just pleaded guilty in federal court to art smuggling. The federal prosecutor, Henry A. Wise, described Duveen's company in 1910 as "low down swindlers." Duveen barely escaped prison, and the company paid more than $1 million in fines for evading customs duties by framing valuable paintings underneath lesser works and "mistakenly" shipping furniture to the United States with antique tapestries inside.
The Duveen building was the first of three powerful family-run art galleries to open near 57th Street and Fifth Avenue. They included Durand-Ruel's eight-story gallery and residence at 12 East 57th Street, in 1913, and the richly modeled Knoedler palazzo at 14 East 57th Street, in 1925. Both were designed by Carrere & Hastings, architects of the New York Public Library at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, and both have since been demolished.
The Duveen gallery is generally described as having been based on the Ministry of the Marine in Paris, but the building merited only minor notices in Architectural Forum and Architectural Record, both in the 1920's and long after completion. The 1924 Architectural Forum article noted that "the style of Louis XVI has been so closely followed that one might almost imagine the address to be Rue de la Paix instead of Fifth Avenue."
The successor building, an office structure completed in 1954, was designed by Emery Roth & Sons in the "ribbon window" style popular at the time.
 
The East River Homes
Q My daughter lives at 517 East 77th Street, a complex that appears at one time to have been a hospital. On every other landing there are built-in seats, presumably for patients to rest, since there are no elevators. Can you tell me the genesis of the buildings? . . . Bernice Foege, Newtown, Conn.
A The complex was not built as a hospital, but it was supposed to be healthful. The East River Homes -- four connected buildings covering the west side of Cherokee Place from 77th to 78th Streets -- were built in 1912 by Anna Harriman Vanderbilt, who sought to develop a more healthful kind of working-class housing. Mrs. Vanderbilt was following the advice of Dr. George Shively, who was researching the high rates of tuberculosis in crowded urban housing.
Near the East River and facing a public park, the tenements were laid out by the architect Henry Atterbury Smith with sitting areas exposed to sunlight and fresh air, including wide central courtyards, rooftops and the stair landings.
The open stairwells were a reaction against the dark, fetid hallways of traditional tenements. Apparently the lack of elevators was purely an economic issue. According to research by Virginia Kurshan at the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the apartment interiors were also designed with health in mind.
Radiators were mounted on the walls to prevent dust from collecting underneath; flooring material was curved up to the walls; and the unusual triple-sash windows, extending all the way to the floor and leading out to the extensive balcony system, provided more than the usual interior ventilation. The buildings are landmarks.
According to the 1915 census, residents' occupations included electrician, chauffeur, druggist, brakeman, cigar packer and telephone operator. Most apartments held two or three people.
When first rented, one quarter of the apartments were let to tuberculosis patients. In 1924 the buildings were sold to the City and Suburban Homes Company, which already operated the more extensive group of model tenements just to the north. The buildings are now co-ops.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Helping 10-Year-Olds Find Common Ground

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON 

DATELINE: MAMARONECK

 BODY:
AT first it might seem just delightfully precocious: 10-year-old children onstage in sneakers and oversize black T-shirts, bringing smiles to parents' faces by reciting lines from "Romeo and Juliet."
But the performance at the the Murray Avenue School here last month was not just a school play. It was also a closely monitored pilot project involving two classes from very different backgrounds. 
 A fourth-grade class from the Chatsworth Avenue Elementary School in Larchmont, where most students are from upper-income neighborhoods, staged the Shakespeare play with a fifth-grade class from the Mamaroneck Avenue School, where many students (white, black, Hispanic and Asian) are from lower income areas and are the children of immigrants.
The elementary schools in the Mamaroneck district have some of the widest disparities in the county, from the upscale white neighborhoods of Larchmont to poorer immigrant neighborhoods. And the need to bridge this gap, especially before students are thrown together in junior high, has long been a concern, said Steven Bluestone, the teacher of the Chatsworth class.
"These two groups of kids would probably never even meet, much less work together, at this age if not for this," said Mr. Bluestone, who conceived the project.
In 1998 he applied for a grant from the Mamaroneck Schools Foundation to buy six computers and five laptops to help students make classroom presentations. Then the district superintendent, Dr. Sherry King, had computers put into Ken Taylor's fifth- grade classroom at the Mamaroneck Avenue school, so the two classes would learn technology together.
For a subject, Mr. Bluestone suggested staging "Romeo and Juliet." Before going to Chatsworth Avenue three years ago, Mr. Bluestone had worked in the New York City schools for 12 years and long wanted to involve students of diverse backgrounds in performing Shakespeare. The classes began discussing the play online in chat rooms and by e-mail before meeting for rehearsals in May.
"I always wanted to bring students of different backgrounds together, but I never knew exactly how that would occur," Mr. Bluestone said. "I hoped the technology would prepare and support, finally bringing the kids together."
A consultant from the Educational Development Center for Children and Technology in Manhattan monitored the project for the district. The Murray Avenue school was chosen as a neutral site for rehearsals and performances to make the children more comfortable, Mr. Bluestone said.
"Most of my students come from upper-middle-class or wealthy neighborhoods, and Ken's students are a real mix, with a good deal of lower income and immigrant families," Mr. Bluestone said. "And to have them working together and getting along, blind to any differences, that stuff just doesn't happen much here."
The average academic achievement of Chatsworth Avenue students, based on fourth-grade tests, was significantly higher last year than that of Mamaroneck Avenue students. Demographic information was unavailable, but 17.5 percent of Mamaroneck Avenue students are eligible for free lunch, compared with none at Chatsworth Avenue.
For school officials hoping to use fair Verona as a sociological petri dish, here is what they saw: any gaps stemming from ethnic and economic differences were nonexistent onstage. Students quickly dropped their guard and began cooperating enthusiastically, helping one another deliver dialogue from the diaphragm, and trading high-fives afterward.
Riding the bus to rehearsal, Aron Baigelman sat with two Chatsworth classmates, Nathaniel Lowenthal and William Moore, all of whom are white. They said they rarely ride their bikes out of their neighborhood, so they did not know Mr. Taylor's students.
But in the auditorium, Aron rehearsed the role of the prince along with two Mamaroneck Avenue students, Marcus Rohim, 11, who is black, and John Pierre Hohl, who is Peruvian. Between scenes, they discussed television programs, the New York Knicks and even the Montague-Capulet feud.
Floyd Rumohr, artistic director for the Chekhov Theater Ensemble in Brooklyn and the acting coach for the project, said that Shakespearean drama "lets students from different backgrounds meet on new turf."
"All the children are dealing with language that's 400 years old," he said. "It's almost a foreign language, so no child has all the advantages."
At the actual performance, Inocencio Arias and his wife, Beatrice, sat in an otherwise empty balcony. Mr. Arias, who works on a truck collecting recyclables in town, watched his 11-year-old daughter Daisy play the part of Benvolio.
Speaking in broken English, Mr. Arias said he left school in Mexico after sixth grade. He said he was unfamiliar with Shakespeare's plays but hoped his daughter would learn them.
Regardless of their income, ethnic background or fluency in English, most parents said they had enjoyed their children marching around the house reciting lines of iambic pentameter and answering questions with words like cometh and goeth.
Julie Spielvogel, 9, a Chatsworth student, can recite lines from several plays.
"I mean, most of Shakespeare's plays are pretty well known," said Julie, who along with a blond-haired classmate, William Moore, shared the role of the Nurse with two Mamaroneck Avenue students, Elena Reyes, 11, and Yajaira Gonzalez, 10.
Julie's mother, Lisa Spielvogel, said her daughter never stopped reciting lines since the Shakespeare project started, even appointing her cat, Kitty-O, as a stand-in for Romeo. Julie was enrolled in a children's Shakespeare theater troupe when the family spent a year in London last year. Mrs. Spielvogel and her husband, a doctor, rented Julie a cartoon version of "Romeo and Juliet" and recently took her to see the New York City Ballet perform a dance version.
For Jonathan Brewton, however, a student in the Mamaroneck Avenue School, Shakespeare was less accessible. At first, Jonathan, 11, resisted learning the play, Mr. Taylor said, but after a few rehearsals, he became fascinated with it and pestered his mother to find books and a videotape of it.
Mr. Taylor said his students were hesitant about embracing Shakespeare, but were challenged by discussions and rehearsals with the Chatsworth students.
Naomi Lowenthal's son, Nathaniel, is a Chatsworth student who played Friar Laurence. She and her husband, Daniel A. Lowenthal, a lawyer in Manhattan, said students from different elementary schools in Mamaroneck need to mingle more before junior high.
"There's Little League," she said, "but things like this also help neighborhoods from being too insular."
Beth MacErlen, whose son Ryan goes to Chatsworth and played Friar Laurence, agreed, calling Shakespeare a common language to bring them together.

Higher Profile for a Little-Known Foundation

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY 

 BODY:
IT took a Nobel prize-winning Austrian economist to turn a New Orleans' welder's son on to the joys of free-market capitalism. But once Donald J. Boudreaux discovered the work of Freidrich von Hayek, co-winner of the Nobel prize in 1974, there was no going back. "This is my greatest hero," Mr. Boudreaux said of the man whose photograph is one of several pictures of free marketers lining the mantelpiece in his office at the Foundation for Economic Education, a libertarian nonprofit educational group in Irvington.
"I love his depth, his erudition, his seriousness," said Mr. Boudreaux, a friendly, down-to-earth 41-year-old who left a tenured professorship in economics at Clemson University in South Carolina in 1997 to take over as head of the foundation. "A lot of people on both sides of the debate are facile, but he thought about their arguments seriously. He didn't dismiss them." 
 For years, the group, founded in 1946 by a Westchester County business executive, Leonard E. Read, has remained little known and low profile -- drivers whizzing south on Broadway might have noticed its small sign stuck high up on a roadside tree trunk. But the foundation never advertised, gave few seminars, was rarely quoted in the press.
No more, thanks to Mr. Boudreaux, whose passion for the dismal science could illuminate the Manhattan skyline. His plans for the foundation include fund-raising, Web sites, remaking its monthly magazine, creating new educational programs and distributing their materials nationwide to high school debaters and teachers.
Mr. Boudreaux recently hired Nicole Gray, formerly with Steve Forbes's presidential campaign, as his development director. Ms. Gray, who has also worked for the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, intends to create and nurture new relationships with members in one region of the country that has, historically, provided the foundation with relatively little support -- New York.
One local fan is John Stossel, the ABC "20/20" correspondent who describes himself as "libertarian leaning." Mr. Stossel discovered the foundation through its magazine. "I had read it and found it really stupid and boring," he said. "Then these new people came in. I was skeptical, as it had always been tedious, but the articles now are often original and well written. It's a jungle gym for the brain."
A longtime Westchester resident who appreciates the foundation's point of view is Sheldon Jacobs, editor and publisher of The No-Load Fund Investor, a monthly newsletter in Irvington. Mr. Jacobs admits that, even after living in Irvington for five years, with the foundation blocks away, "I'd only heard vague references to it." Eventually, a colleague, a fellow investment newsletter publisher in Florida, introduced Jacobs to the group and its activities, including seminars and lectures. Those wanting more information about the foundation can visit its Web site at www.fee.org.
"My attraction to them is that they stand for smaller government," said Mr. Jacobs, who reads the foundation's monthly publication, attends its seminars and hopes, someday, to write for the foundation. The organization puts out a quarterly newsletter, called FEE Today and the 64-page monthly magazine, called Ideas on Liberty. "The thing that really impressed me about them was their 50th anniversary dinner," he said. "It was a huge event at the Waldorf-Astoria, with Bill Buckley as the host and Margaret Thatcher as their keynote speaker. People came from all across the country."
Herb Grossman, who teaches mathematics in Oradell, N.J., but who taught at Roosevelt High School in Yonkers from 1968 to 1985, has, for many years, handed out the foundation's literature to any student he thinks might find it useful. "The materials they get are very inadequate," he said. "I feel the period dealing with the robber barons is terribly portrayed. They were major benefactors. They also learn that the Depression was a failure of the free-enterprise system and the government bailed us out. What I object to is that the kids never hear anything to the contrary."
Only 5 percent of the foundation's 5,000 contributors are from New York, although the group has been based here since it was founded. Members, most of them older and male, traditionally come from Wisconsin and Michigan, Washington State, Texas and California because the last time the Foundation for Economic Education was on the radar screen, fund-raising was strongest in these areas, Mr. Boudreaux says.
The group's annual budget of $2 million comes exclusively from private individuals and a few foundations. Given that its credo is libertarian -- "We're skeptical of state power, no matter what its use," Mr. Boudreaux said -- it would never consider accepting government funds.
"We're looking for local libertarians," Ms. Gray said. "It's just a matter of connecting with them. They just haven't seen us lately."
The group is definitely graying and needs new blood, Mr. Boudreaux said. "Most of our members are in their 60's. When they became interested in free markets they were in college or even in high school." Back then, he says, the foundation was well-known, and Mr. Hayek was a celebrity on a par with his fellow economist Milton Friedman.
But Mr. Hayek's theories, popular from the 1930's through the 1950's, fell out of favor in the 1960's and the age of government expansion, Mr. Boudreaux says.
He has little illusion that the group's work and ideas, filtering slowly through its small and relatively invisible network of supporters, will change the world overnight, or even in his lifetime.
"What FEE does is not going to have an effect on the world tomorrow -- Cato will," he said.
But he went on confidently to say: "I'm out to make people more suspicious of collective political action. I do think ideas matter longterm, but our time horizon is very long. It's not a hard sell because the ideas we espouse are esoteric or out of this world. They're not weird or bizarre. But because the ideas making up an ideology are deeply rooted you can't change them easily."
Mr. Boudreaux, who studied at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, La., received his law degree at the University of Virginia and his Ph.D. at Auburn University in Alabama, enjoys his own subsidy of sorts -- he and his wife, Karol, and their 2-year-old son, Thomas, live rent free in a carriage house on the foundation's property.
The foundation is currently struggling, he admitted, to define itself. Legally, it is a nonprofit educational organization, and he rejects the term think tank. Instead, he said, "We're more abstract, and focus on the fundamentals."
The trustees, who meet twice a year, "judge us on our inputs" -- seminars, the monthly magazine, with a circulation of 14,000, lectures and summer programs for college and graduate students.
The group does not take positions or create policy like the Cato Institute, with whom it shares trustees and information. This, Mr. Boudreaux said, has kept its profile low. When reporters call, as they often do on deadline seeking a sound bite on economic issues, Mr. Boudreaux doesn't offer them prepackaged answers.
"Some headline," he said with a laugh. "Economist says 'I Don't Know.' "

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
Upscale Rentals Finding a Ready Market in Suffolk

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
REFLECTING the continuing popularity of upscale rental housing, Trammel Crow Residential has started construction on almost 800 luxury apartments in central Suffolk County.
The development, called Alexan Brookhaven, will have 795 apartments and will occupy 117 acres in South Yaphank between Woodside Avenue and Horse Block Road, east of Station Road-Bellport Avenue. When completed in 2002, the development will be one of the largest rental projects on Long Island. 
 Trammell Crow's entry into the Long Island market is another indication that this area is increasingly attracting upscale rental housing that offers many, if not all, of the features of for-sale units, along with extensive recreational amenities.
The increasing popularity of upscale rental apartments can be traced, in part, to the region's growing number of young professionals, many of them working at high-technology companies, who may be too busy, or too unsure of their next move, to put down permanent roots.
Rental housing is also attracting older people, former homeowners who have raised their families and sold their houses and who want someone else to attend to all the details, even those as minute as fixing a leaking faucet in the bathroom.
Developers say that these two groups also don't want to be locked into homeownership at a time when house prices are high and could turn downward if the economy weakens.
"Rentals offer a very flexible lifestyle choice," said Joseph S. Torg, the development partner in the Northeast division of Trammell Crow's MidAtlantic/Northeast Group, which has offices in Fairfield, Conn. The MidAtlantic side of the partnership has its headquarters in Rockville, Md. Each of the five groups that constitute Trammell Crow Residential, which has its headquarters in Atlanta, is an independently owned partnership.
"There are plenty of people who can afford to purchase a house but choose not to," Mr. Torg said. "Many people now feel they don't want equity tied up in a house because they can get much better returns on the stock market."
The tenant mix in South Yaphank, he said, is also expected to include couples, with or without children, who have not yet saved up enough money to buy a house in today's costly market.
The biggest difficulty on Long Island, developers say, is not in finding tenants, but in finding land. Preapproved sites like the 117 acres that Trammell Crow bought from Horseblock Associates, an investor group, "are very hard to find," said Paul K. Gruber, the president of PKG Associates of Woodbury, the broker for the $17 million deal.
The property's apartment zoning dates back to the mid-1980's and might not be granted today. Felix Grucci Jr., the Brookhaven town supervisor, has gone on record several times saying he opposed any housing on the site because the surrounding area is largely industrial.
But Mr. Torg said the location was a very convenient one. The State University of New York at Stony Brook, the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, county offices in Riverhead and large employers like Computer Associates International in Islandia and Symbol Technologies in Holtsville are all close by.
To attract the different groups of renters, Alexan Brookhaven, designed by the Lessard Architectural Group of Vienna, Va., will have a variety of layouts. The choices include one- and two-bedroom flats in two-story town-house-style buildings; two- and three-bedroom two-story town houses, some with the master bedroom on the ground floor to accommodate older couples who do not want to climb stairs, and some ranch-style units for tenants who want all the living space on one level without having anyone above them. Each of the units will have direct access to a one-car garage.
Rents will range from $850 for an 825-square-foot one-bedroom flat to $1,400 for a three-bedroom, 1,250-square-foot town house. The two-bedroom, 1,150-square-foot flat will rent for $1,200 a month, and the three-bedroom 1,300-square-foot ranch-style unit will rent for $1,400. Rents will not include heat or utilities. Leasing for the first phase of 549 apartments is expected to begin at the the end of the year, with the first apartments to be ready for occupancy early in 2001. When complexed, the complex will have as many as four pools, tennis courts and an 8,000-square-foot clubhouse.
Trammell Crow Residential, which was founded in 1978, is the second national builder to build luxury rentals on Long Island.
THE other is AvalonBay Communities, a real estate investment trust traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It started out as the Trammell Crow Mid Atlantic/Northeast Group until it went public in 1995 as Avalon. Avalon took the AvalonBay name after a merger in 1998 with a West Coast apartment builder called Bay Communities. A new Trammell Crow Mid Atlantic/Northeast Group was set up in 1997.
Until 1997, when Avalon opened a 312-unit rental complex in Smithtown called Avalon Commons, the rental stock in Suffolk, where most of the new rental complexes are springing up, consisted largely of brick garden apartments built after World War II.
Companies like Trammell Crow were building luxury rentals in the Southeast and Southwest long before the idea was brought to the Northeast, said Gary Steinfield, AvalonBay's vice president for development for the New Jersey and Long Island regions. "The Northeast was a little slower in understanding that people are willing to pay for a better-quality, better-amenitized apartment community," he said.
At Avalon Commons, the apartments are in two-story town-house-style buildings with clapboard exteriors. They range in size from an 862-square-foot one-bedroom to a 1,527-square-foot two-bedroom with a loft. Some of the apartments have two bathrooms, and some have fireplaces. Rents range from $1,499 to $1,949. The complex has a clubhouse, a fitness and business center, a pool and an indoor half court for basketball. Prices do not include heat or utilities.
Avalon now owns and operates four complexes on Long Island with a total of 915 apartments. In addition to Avalon Commons in Smithtown, two are in Melville and one is in Long Beach. The most recent to come on the market, the 340-unit Avalon Court North in Melville, opened in April and is already fully occupied, Mr. Steinfield said. Rents there range from $1,600 for a 740-square-foot one-bedroom to $2,299 for a 1,390-square-foot three-bedroom. Seventy-five percent of the apartments have direct access to their own garages. In addition to the pool, tennis court, clubhouse and fitness center that have become standard for these complexes, Avalon Court North also has a putting green and a jogging trail.
Local developers are also aggressively entering the luxury rental market. Fairfield Properties of Commack had been buying and upgrading older apartment complexes for 27 years, amassing a portfolio of 40 rental properties with a total of 4,000 apartments. It has now begun building new apartment complexes, with almost 300 units either completed or under construction and another 411 in the planning stages.
Its first new project, the 169-unit Fairfield Hills in Farmingville, opened last summer. Like the AvalonBay projects and the Trammell Crow development, it offers a choice of apartments to suit different groups of renters. Sizes range from a 1,207-square-foot one-bedroom flat renting for $1,485 to a 1,575-square-foot three-bedroom two-story town house renting for $1,835. There is a 7,000-square-foot clubhouse with a fitness and business center, a pool, a playground and courts for tennis, volleyball and basketball. The complex is fully rented and has a waiting list.
Last month, Fairfield began leasing its newest project, Setauket Gables, and it took deposits on 37 of the 64 apartments on opening day, said Mark A. Broxmeyer, one of the principals in Fairfield. The Setauket development has five floor plans; a 1,150-square-foot one-bedroom with a loft rents for $1,750, a 1,195-square-foot two-bedroom for $2,000 and a 1,150-square-foot three-bedroom for $2,200. Each apartment has direct access to a private garage. Of the 64 apartments, 28 are town houses, and a third of the apartments have fireplaces. There is a clubhouse with a fitness and business center, a pool and an electronic gatehouse.
"Many of our tenants have combined incomes of $150,000 or more," Mr. Broxmeyer said. "They have chosen to rent because they don't want to worry about maintenance. They're retired, or they work long hours, and they just want to turn the key in the door and be done."
Fairfield's third project, which has not yet been named, is under construction in the Village of Port Jefferson. It will have 66 apartments. Another complex with 202 apartments will start construction this summer across the street from Fairfield Hills, and yet another, for people 55 and over, is planned for Port Jefferson.
Ross C. Cassata of Babylon, who with a partner, Glenn D. Feldman, is building a 402-apartment rental complex in Holtsville called Victorian Gardens, said the 300 apartments completed there so far are all rented. Rents range from $1,250 for a 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom to $1,450 for a 1,200-square-foot two-bedroom. Mr. Cassata said he has three more projects with a total of 800 apartments in the planning stages. All three will be for people 55 and over.
Demand for these rentals is so strong, Mr. Cassata said, that "we paint our apartments in the morning, and by afternoon people are already moving in."

HEADLINE: Apartments, Finally, for Downtown Los Angeles

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
AN upscale rental project that will eventually fill three city blocks and have 658 apartments is rising at the edge of the central business district here, where no market-rate housing has been built for nearly a decade.
The $100 million development, known as the Medici, is one of a number of recent projects in downtown Los Angeles that have brought -- or will bring -- a new sports arena, a new museum, a new concert hall, a new cathedral and new housing to a business district that formerly had little but high-rise office buildings and hotels. 
 The first phase of 92 apartments is expected to be completed in July, and all have been leased, with the exception of two penthouses, said Geoff Palmer, the Medici's developer and the president of G. H. Palmer Associates of Los Angeles.
As an entirely private development with no public subsidies, the Medici is an anomaly in an area where nearly all housing in recent years has been subsidized, low-income apartments.
"It's a major turning point to have a private developer take the initiative to build housing downtown on his own," said Donald R. Spivack, the deputy administrator of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency, the leading builder of low-income housing downtown.
Mr. Palmer said, "I'm ahead of the curve," but he added that his project was a response to a demonstrable demand. Downtown has a vacancy rate of only 2 percent, he said, and rents are rising sharply.
The Medici project is currently under construction immediately west of the Harbor Freeway, an elevated 10-lane road that serves as the unofficial western boundary of the central business district.
The project's only neighbors are office buildings and busy streets, although two or three restaurants are within 100 yards of the project, and the Staples Center sports arena is within easy walking distance.
Mr. Palmer said his rents would be about 15 percent higher than those of other market-rate apartments downtown. In the first phase, rents will range from $1,280 for a 641-square-foot one-bedroom to $2,608 for a 1,208-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. A small number of penthouses will also be available; $8,200 a month will rent the largest, with 2,200 square feet.
Mr. Palmer, who developed an apartment building in downtown Los Angeles in the 1980's but has spent much of his career putting up rental apartments in the suburbs,said that downtown living has found a new cachet in Los Angeles, and that, along with a growing frustration over traffic congestion, helped him sell his project.
LOCATION was the overriding concern of Loren Stassart, one of first tenants to reserve an apartment at the Medici.
"I figured I was driving 19 hours a week," said Mr. Stassart, who owns a produce company and drives 65 miles from Riverside County to his company on the southern edge of downtown. "I had to buy a new truck every two years just to go back and forth to L.A."
Mr. Stassart said he was looking for "a nice, clean place that was well secured." He is pleased with the view from his fourth-floor apartment and is looking forward to moving in. "There are city lights at night," he said. "It's almost like coming home to a resort."
Marketing for the Medici makes note of the Italian marble vanities in the bathrooms, the black granite counter tops and maple cabinets in the kitchens, the solid oak front doors, the nine-foot ceilings and the double-paned windows. The complex also has an outdoor pool with a 24-foot waterfall and a rubberized running track and a golf driving range, both in a one-acre private park. About 17,000 square feet will be devoted to retail space, with a coffee bar, a juice bar and a convenience store.
The Medici's second phase, with 133 apartments, including some studios, is scheduled to open in August, and the third and final phase is to open next year.
The new apartments are part of a larger change in the development patterns downtown. In the 1970's and 80's, the city's redevelopment agency aggressively promoted office development, in the attempt to make downtown into a traditional city center. That created a forest of high-rise office buildings on Bunker Hill and in the financial district a few blocks west of City Hall.
Critics contended that the enormous public investment in downtown was inappropriate for a nontraditional city like Los Angeles, which has many business centers. By one estimate, the city and state governments have spent $2 billion on downtown in the last two decades, $1 billion of that from the redevelopment agency alone. Office development boomed during the economically confident early and mid-1980's, and between 1979 and 1992, developers built nearly 20 million square feet of office space downtown.
The recession of the early 1990's halted the construction of speculative office space, and vacancy rates remained in the 20 percent range for much of the decade.
In recent years, developers have concentrated on entertainment and cultural projects, not office buildings. Two recent projects -- the Medici and a set of six motion-picture sound stages completed last year -- were both built on sites originally zoned for high-rise office buildings.
The Japanese-American History Museum in the Little Tokyo District on the east end of downtown has expanded. Last month, the Southern California Institute of Architecture, a private professional school, announced that it would relocate from Santa Monica to a building on the east end of downtown. And the long-delayed Walt Disney Concert Hall, designed by Frank O. Gehry, resumed construction in December after a five-year fund drive.
THE new Roman Catholic Cathedral of Los Angeles is rising at the north end of downtown, between the Los Angeles Music Center and the Hollywood Freeway.
The east end of downtown has a growing number of artists' lofts in aging warehouses. Loft conversions are continuing on Fourth Street in the historic district just east of City Hall; the Bank District development, by Gilmore Associates of Los Angeles, will have 250 rental lofts.
But the venture that will possibly have the biggest impact on downtown is the $350 million Staples Center, a basketball and hockey arena that doubles as a concert hall. It was completed last October.
Mr. Spivack, the redevelopment official, credited the popularity of Staples Center with reviving interest in downtown itself. "Staples is bringing people into downtown on evenings and weekends who otherwise might not have come," he said. "A lot of people are pleasantly surprised when they come down here that downtown is a fairly attractive place to be."
Mr. Palmer, the Medici developer, said that the construction of the sports arena was "an added consideration" in his own decision to build upscale housing nearby. "I knew that with Staples Center coming, there would be an exodus back to the city," he said. "I knew it would generate a lot of activity, just as the stadiums in Denver and Baltimore did."
The further revival of downtown will depend on building a base of full-time middle-class residents, Mr. Palmer said. So far the area has only a few thousand residents, although about 375,000 people commute into downtown daily.
"You can't get downtown moving again just with low-income housing," Mr. Palmer said. "You need to bring in middle-class, working people, and that is what we are doing. A lot of professional people work downtown in beautiful buildings with glass and marble, and they are used to a certain level of quality. I could not see them coming home to Formica and linoleum."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey;
Building for High-Tech Tenants in the Meadowlands

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
HOPING to capitalize on the expansion of technology companies, a small group of developers in the Hackensack Meadowlands are constructing buildings or converting warehouses for new-economy tenants.
For decades low-slung warehouses, mostly manufacturers' distribution centers, have dominated the Meadlowlands, a 32-square-mile region that stretches through 14 communities in Bergen and Hudson Counties. But with dot-com companies and Internet service providers pushing into areas like the garment district in Manhattan and the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City, the Meadowlands offers an alternative, commercial brokers said. The draws are its proximity to transportation, access to fiber optics and lower rents. 
 "The shift is real," said Richard Fritzsky, the president of the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce.
Frank Lopriore, a managing director in the Saddle Brook office of Insignia/ESG, the national commercial brokerage company, said, "The issue is that there is a demand but no inventory."
Some developers, like Penhorn Construction of Secaucus, are responding by putting up high-tech flex buildings, as they are called, because they can be used for offices or for distribution or assembly operations. The company recently completed and leased two buildings totaling 100,000 square feet on Penhorn Avenue in Secaucus, drawing e-commerce companies as tenants. Now it is advancing plans for two more buildings.
And on Meadowlands Parkway at Castle Road in Secaucus, M. Rappaport Real Estate of Englewood Cliffs recently completed leasing a 145,000-square-foot building. It had rebuilt 55,000 square feet of office space there and turned the remaining 90,000 square feet of retail space into office space for high-tech tenants. The company is selling 10 acres nearby, also on Meadowlands Parkway, to Hudson Development L.L.C. of Brooklyn, which is planning a high-tech building as big as 225,000 square feet to appeal to similar tenants.
Meanwhile, Whitehall Industrial Properties of Edison bought a 170,000-square-foot industrial building in Carlstadt last month and plans to reconfigure it into smaller spaces for technology companies. Young Woo & Associates of Manhattan is buying a 200,000-square-foot warehouse, also in Carlstadt, and plans to turn it into a telecommunications center, a so-called "telco hotel," with a number of technology and telecommunications tenants under one roof.
Such businesses, including companies that provide Internet data centers, which manage Internet sites for businesses, are scouring the Meadowlands for space. Last month, Gift Certificate.com of Manhattan leased a 100,000-square-foot warehouse in Carlstadt and plans to transform it into an order-fulfillment center. In February, Webvan Inc., an Internet grocer, leased a 348,885-square-foot warehouse in North Bergen from Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus, among the largest property owners in the Meadowlands. It plans to use the warehouse as a distribution center.
Tenants requiring over 500,000 square feet of space are still in the market, said Jonathan S. Meisel, an associate director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage company. "We see the Meadowlands as the next hotbed of activity for Web-centric businesses," he said.
From 1994 to 1999 the number of high-tech jobs, including telecommunications and computer software development and related services, grew in New Jersey by 59,000 to 295,0000 jobs, according to state figures. A report released last month by Nasdaq and the American Electronics Association ranked New Jersey seventh in the nation in the number of such jobs.
While the presence of high-tech operations in the Meadowlands is growing, such companies are not completely new to the area. Mr. Fritzsky of the Chamber of Commerce said that over a decade ago Ernst & Young and Salomon Smith Barney set up data centers in the Meadowlands.
COMDISCO, an international technology management company based in Rosemont, Ill., is consolidating four operations in the region into a 302,000-square-foot building under way on Central Boulevard in Carlstadt. Next door, Chase Manhattan Bank is developing a 176,000 square-foot check-processing operation
Brokers say the presence of such tenants is one of the reasons the Meadowlands will appeal to high-tech companies. In addition, it is close to Newark and Teterboro airports and to Manhattan, where many clients have offices, Mr. Lopriore of Insignia/ESG said. And, he added, the tight commercial market in Manhattan is pushing companies to seek space elsewhere, and one of those places is the Meadowlands.
The Meadowlands will also be more accessible once transportation improvements are made. Construction is under way on the $448 million Secaucus Transfer rail station, which will link several rail lines to provide direct train service to Manhattan from Bergen and Passaic Counties. The project, which will allow employees to commute more easily from New York City, is to be completed by 2002.
The vacancy rate in the 72-million-square-foot Meadowlands industrial market is 3.25 percent, Mr. Lopriore said. That translates to 2.3 million square feet, much of it in obsolete industrial buildings, he said, adding that such buildings can be converted to suit the needs of technology companies. The average annual asking rents in the region are $6.50 a square foot, he said, compared with asking rents in Manhattan of $30 to $40 a square foot.
That price difference makes the Meadowlands "a competitive alternative," said Mr. Meisel of Cushman & Wakefield. The area also has access multiple sources of electric power and a fiber-optic network, he added.
Those factors encouraged Gift Certificate.com to lease the Carlstadt building at 190 Jony Drive, said Alan J. Desino, a senior managing director in the Manhattan office of Insignia/ESG, who represented the company. It had looked at space in Manhattan, he said, but in terms of price and access to labor, the Meadowlands was more favorable. He said the company would occupy 77,000 square feet initially and would reconfigure it as an order-fulfillment center.
To meet this sort of demand by high-tech tenants, Hari Bhasin, the president of Penhorn Construction, was prompted to to develop two high-tech buildings in Secaucus. The $8 million buildings at 501 and 601 Penhorn Avenue contain 100,000 square feet, 70,000 square feet at 501 and 30,000 at 601. Each building is divided into blocks of 5,000 to 20,000 square feet to draw start-up as well as expanding companies needing office and distribution space. The project was completely leased even before it was finished in March, he said. Annual rents average $8 a square foot triple net, meaning that tenants pay taxes, common-area charges and utilities.
One tenant is Vitamin Shop.com, part of Vitamin Shop Industries of North Bergen, which took 20,000 square feet at 501 Penhorn. "As our Internet business grows, we need to expand our distribution capability," said Steven Linn, the director of operations. The building has the telecommunications capacity, including high-speed Internet connections, that the company will eventually tap for its online business, he said.
Mr. Bhasin said he was seeking approvals to develop two additional buildings on 12 adjacent acres, which he would lease at slightly higher rents. Construction of those buildings, totaling 175,000 square feet, is to start this fall. They are expected to be completed in 12 months at a cost of $14 million, he said.
Smaller companies are the tenants that Hudson Development expects to draw to Castle Industrial Park, the high-tech building with a maximum of 225,000 square feet the company plans to build on the 10 acres it is buying in Secaucus. "The activity in Manhattan feeds Secaucus, and we are seeing an overflow," said Daniel P. Gleich, a principal in Hudson Development. His company plans to divide the $12.5 million building into blocks of 7,500 square feet.
Mr. Gleich said he expected to start construction this summer; the building is to be completed next year. In Carlstadt, Whitehall Industrial Properties L.L.C. plans to carve the 170,000-square-foot warehouse it bought at 401 Washington Avenue into 50,000- to 60,000-square-foot spaces. "Traditional companies are changing to e-commerce and doing more business over the Internet, but they still need production and distribution space to get their products out," said Michael Nachamkin, the president of Whitehall, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs.
The Whitehall Street Real Estate Fund committed $75 million to the company, which was formed last November to acquire, develop and redevelop industrial properties in the Northeast. The Carlstadt project, valued at over $5 million, is the company's first in New Jersey.
Mr. Nachamkin said he expected to start work in June on the exterior of the building, which the seller still occupies. Annual rents are expected to be $7 to $10 a square foot, triple net.

HEADLINE: Battle Lines Drawn on New Zoning Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
BY a margin of almost 2 to 1, the 26 speakers at the City Planning Commission hearing last month offered their support for a zoning proposal that would reshape development, neighborhood character and architectural innovation in every corner of New York.
But that consensus in favor of the plan may have been misleading. Several fathoms below the level of public review, a battle is being fought over the proposal, called the Unified Bulk Program, which is to go to the City Council later this year. Though no one predicts that the measure is headed toward defeat, it faces high hurdles. The debate over key aspects of the rezoning package is believed to be going on within the Giuliani administration itself. 
 Asked on Thursday whether the Unified Bulk Program had the unqualified support of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles replied simply, "The mayor has an open mind."
As proposed by Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission and the director of the City Planning Department, the Unified Bulk Program would be the most thorough revision to zoning rules since they were entirely rewritten 40 years ago. These are some of the provisions of the program:
*It would impose height limits for the first time in neighborhoods citywide.
*It would effectively restrict transfer of development rights.
*It would eliminate bonuses for plazas at new apartment towers.
*It would create a review panel that could recommend waiving restrictions in the interest of better design.
*And it would eliminate complex zoning formulas that are understood only by a few technicians.
Leaders of the real estate industry do not like the proposal and are making their displeasure known through public testimony and private communiques to politicians. They have a formidable ally in nonprofit institutions that fear new limits on their ability to transfer development rights, known as air rights, or to build what the law calls "community facilities": schools, hospitals, medical offices, nursing homes and houses of worship. The Greater New York Hospital Association has spoken out against the rezoning, and New York Presbyterian Hospital has raised concerns about a project it plans on West 165th Street. The Archdiocese of New York is in talks with city planners but will wait to comment until the matter comes before the City Council, a spokesman said.
On the other hand, community planning boards, professional organizations like the American Institute of Architects and American Planning Association, and civic groups like the Municipal Art Society, Citizens Union and Civitas generally support the program, with qualifications. They see it as a rare opportunity to clear out a regulatory thicket that confounds the public and benefits only skilled manipulators.
Though the proposal is often portrayed as a weapon against out-of-scale projects like the 856-foot Trump World Tower at First Avenue and 47th Street (the new height cap on that site would be 495 feet), the height limits would also be felt in medium-density districts, including residential zones known as R6, R7 and R8 that are mapped broadly through Brooklyn and the Bronx, the Lower East Side and Harlem, and the M1-5 manufacturing districts found in Lower Manhattan and elsewhere.
Even as developers chafe at the proposed height limits of 55 to 140 feet in medium-density districts, neighborhood leaders are asking planners to draw the limits lower yet, to curb the liberally regulated community facilities and to tune zoning more closely to the prevailing physical context.
All of which goes to a broader issue: Is the goal of a municipal land-use regimen to preserve the context of older neighborhoods or to provide enough flexibility that neighborhoods can change, and new neighborhoods can emerge, as economic and social trends dictate?
Mr. Rose believes it is possible to do both, to ensure that a neighborhood's prevailing scale is not violated without straitjacketing design and development. Critics of his proposal believe it will stymie construction in areas that could most benefit from an infusion of new housing and usurp the architect's role, forcing the production of predictable, unwieldy building types.
Reacting to comments and suggestions, city planners have proposed 76 possible modifications. In response, Mitchell J. Silver, the president of the New York chapter of the American Planning Association, told the commission at its May 23 hearing that "on the whole, we're very enthusiastic about the direction of this proposal."
But the modifications do not go nearly far enough to persuade the Real Estate Board of New York to drop its blanket opposition.
"This is still a totally objectionable proposal," Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board, said last week.
Before the proposal is sent to the Council, it is likely to undergo further overhaul.
Mayor Giuliani has made no public comment on the proposal, and a spokesman said on Wednesday that he would have none at this time. (In contrast, the mayor personally announced a rezoning of the theater district in December 1997 from the stage of the Lyceum Theater. It was adopted by the Council eight months later.)
It may be that Mr. Giuliani is not ready to place his imprimatur on a proposal that is still very much in flux. As Mr. Coles said, "City Planning is going through a process where it's listening to different constituencies." Or as opponents of the proposal hope, the mayor may seek to distance himself from the undertaking.
AS to the proposal's prospects before the City Council, Speaker Peter F. Vallone was noncommittal. "If this improves the quality of life for the people of the City of New York," he said on Wednesday, "it will be very favorably reviewed.
"If not, forget about it."
Mr. Rose has embarked on a difficult political maneuver, since the proposal enjoys qualified support from some quarters but faces implacable antagonism from others, all of this against a backdrop of relative public indifference.
It is a paradox of land-use issues that the broader they are, the less popular attention they claim. The landmarking of a single building or the rezoning of several blocks might draw hundreds of people to City Hall, since the impact is so evident. But the rezoning of an entire city is a far more abstract undertaking. And the Unified Bulk Program is a long and complicated document that defies easy categorization.
"I see in place dynamics that could result in defeat as well as success," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens, who heads the zoning subcommittee. "There is strong support for this though, and I don't think that general principle should be trivialized in any way, shape or form. This is an aggressive, strong approach to the zoning text, and Joe does deserve credit for that."
Height limits are a key hurdle, according to Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, as is the opposition of hospitals. "Once landowners outside Manhattan are concerned about height limits," he said, "the consensus becomes more fragile."
Mr. Spinola said the rules would foreclose the construction in medium-density R6, R7 and R8 zones of buildings ranging from 180 to 240 feet, or about 18 to 24 stories.
"The city's future is going to be in neighborhoods that are emerging or neighborhoods we haven't even thought about," he said. "To propose height limits of 55 or 75 or 140 feet just is counter to what New York City is all about."
But Mr. Rose said that on normal sites in medium-density districts, "there isn't that great a disparity between what is currently permitted and what the Unified Bulk Program would allow."
The New York State Association for Affordable Housing, an organization of for-profit builders, has appealed directly to Deputy Mayor Coles, saying in a letter dated May 25 that the Unified Bulk Program "will impede new housing construction, thwart neighborhood revitalization and undermine the economic resurgence initiated by this administration."
Donald Capoccia, the founder and vice president of the builders' association and a principal in BFC Partners, said the rezoning would penalize those who had taken risks investing in areas like Upper Manhattan and the Lower East Side against the hope that there would one day be a market strong enough to attract large-scale, unsubsidized, private development.
"Very big players are not interested in getting involved in small six-story and eight-story endeavors," he said. "If they can't build big buildings, it just isn't worth their while. When you find neighborhoods reaching a critical mass where the next logical step is higher density, the Unified Bulk Program stops this from happening."
But one person's critical mass is another's critical injury. In Kew Gardens, Queens, the relief promised from oversized development cannot come quickly enough, said Sylvia Hack, the chairwoman of Community Board 9, which includes Woodhaven, Richmond Hill and South Ozone Park.
"We care desperately in Queens about the height of buildings," she said. "There are tremendous monstrosities sitting on tiny lots that overwhelm the buildings around them." She said current controls are too complicated and too open to interpretation.
"Unified Bulk sets a definite height," Ms. Hack said. "It says, 'This building shall be 21 feet high.' You don't have to figure it out. You know where the top of the floor is supposed to be. We're so pleased that there is a height regulation."
The Unified Bulk Program would also change the rules governing building sites that straddle more than one zoning district, a perennially vexatious land-use issue. Ms. Hack praised the proposal for limiting the application of medium-density R7 controls on adjacent low-density R2 lots. "That's a tremendous protection," she said. "The sooner this gets passed, the better for us."
Another issue stirring the neighbors in medium-density zones involves community facilities, which can in some districts produce a structure with almost twice as much floor area as a residential buildings on the same site.
Height limits directly affect institutions that need higher-than-normal floors for auditoriums, operating rooms, gymnasiums and the like. Mr. Rose has said that limits placed on community facilities, "especially in a campus-type environment, may warrant greater latitude."
At the same time, neighbors worry about the potential disruption caused by such institutions. "You buy a house next door to another family and suddenly you're living next door to 200 people," Ms. Hack said.
Councilwoman June M. Eisland of the Bronx, who heads the Land Use Committee, said the failure of the proposal to tackle the community-facility issue in greater detail was "one of the main sticking points."
Another element of the plan that has drawn skeptical reaction is the proposed design review panel, made up of seven members appointed by the planning director who would have "knowledge and experience in the areas of architecture and urban design," in the language of the zoning amendment. This group could recommend waiving height limits, lot coverage requirements and setback rules for a building that "exhibits superior design quality."
Bruce S. Fowle, co-chairman of the zoning task force for the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, told the commission on May 23 that the chapter had "serious questions whether or not the proposed panel will encourage design excellence on a meaningful scale." Allowing that it might provide a greater opportunity for innovative design in unique situations, he urged city planners to adopt the program on a five-year test basis.
It is possible, of course, that the whole idea of a design review panel could be withdrawn, although city planners might still try to devise a process under which aesthetic quality could be used as a criterion to allow the development of buildings that do not conform to standard zoning rules.
Another serious point of contention is grandfathering; that is, just where will the cutoff be set between projects governed by the old and new zoning? Mr. Rose has said that projects under construction would be unaffected. But what about a project that has not begun to dig foundations but has all of its building permits in place? Or a project that has just obtained its financing? Drawing this line will be a challenge.
One significant obstacle seems to have been cleared. In January, city planners proposed a requirement that a tower occupy at least 33 percent of the merged zoning lot from which it draws air rights. This was intended to prevent the harvesting of air rights up and down a block and piling them on a single building site, as was done at Trump World Tower, which occupies only 13 percent of the merged zoning lot.
Developers were understandably upset about this provision, but they were not alone in criticizing it. In April, the A.I.A. expressed concern that the result would be "bulkier, poorly proportioned" buildings that "create darkness for more hours of the day; provide long, dark interior corridors and like many of the least desirable developments in the last several decades, will be characterless and flat-topped."
Since then, planners have proposed adjusting the minimum to 25 percent. "It creates greater flexibility," Mr. Rose said. "That's the essence of the proposal: to come up with a set of rules that are clear; that allow for as-of-right, economically viable development; that have some relationship to neighborhood scale; and that end the elaborate series of zoning manipulation, loopholes and inconsistency."
THE readjustment of the tower coverage provision was endorsed by the A.I.A. and the Municipal Art Society, which said it would "allow the as-of-right construction of slimmer towers that allow more light and air to reach the street." Even Mr. Spinola of the Real Estate Board said it was a "meaningful change."
But he also said there had been no progress in resolving the board's objection to height limits in the medium-density R6, R7, R8 and M1-5 districts and the high-density M1-6 manufacturing district that is found around the Hudson Square area in Lower Manhattan.
"There's little reason to believe that some kind of compromise is going to be worked out," Mr. Spinola said. "That's not to say that one can't be worked out."
"I don't believe in taking on fights that are impossible to win," he said, "so I believe there's a chance that this process will lead to its not being enacted. But on the other hand, it's probably an uphill battle."
That battle is waged on many fronts. According to records compiled by the New York City Campaign Finance Board, Mr. Vallone, a potential mayoral candidate, has received $72,125 from 25 members of the board of governors of the Real Estate Board since 1999. Eight of these contributors, including Bernard H. Mendik, the chairman of the Real Estate Board, gave $4,500, the maximum permitted for a citywide contest under the public financing law.
Mr. Spinola said contributions do not "buy us anything other than the ability to have a direct conversation and make our point."
And Mr. Vallone dismissed the notion that any contribution -- much less such small contributions -- could affect a vote. "No respectable elected official is going to be influenced solely by campaign contributions," he said. Moreover, he added, he hears "a lot of conflicting real estate opinions."

Chart: "Zoning Change as Work in Progress"
REZONING AS FIRST PROPOSED
To limit the use of development rights, the Unified Bulk Program originally required that a new apartment tower occupty at least 33 percent of the merged zoning lot used to calculate its floor area. The example shows a 10,000-square-foot corner site that makes use of development rights - know as air rights - from five adjacent properties, creating an overall zoning lot of 19,000 square feet. A tower that covers 33 percent of that merged lot could rise 25 stories, with 173,000 square feet of floor area. This virtually mandates a bulky building type that covers most of the corner site.
 
REZONING AS MODIFIED
In response to objections from the real estate industry and organizations like the American Insititute of Architects, planners are considering a requirement that a tower cover 25 percent of the overall zoning lot. In this example, that would permit the addition of a sixth property to the assemblage, creating a 20,000-square-foot zoning lot. A tower that covers 25 percent of that merged lot could rise 32 stories and still not exceed the 360-foot height limit for the area, with 181,000 square feet of floor area. The benefit for a slight increase in floor area is much greater flexibility in design.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY;
Americans Aren't in the Market for Freedom

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
EVERYWHERE you turn nowadays, somebody is trying to sell you something. And why not? The American economy is churning out unprecedented prosperity, and consumers (the creatures formerly known as "people") are snapping up vacation houses, fancy cars and other nifty appurtenances of the good life.
Folks are entitled to enjoy their earnings, after all. And why should anyone attend social critics who, from their tasteful vacation houses in Amagansett, berate the masses for buying his-and-hers Barcaloungers? 
 Unfortunately, the one thing nobody is insisting you rush out and buy is freedom. Ever hear of it? I don't mean freedom of speech or religion, which we enjoy in spades. I mean the freedom to do what you want -- including, if necessary, telling your boss to drop dead. For non-lottery winners, it's the kind of freedom that comes of thrift, and maybe also self-knowledge.
What I'm suggesting, in other words, is to forget that big new professional-quality range or $40,000 sport utility vehicle and buy yourself some freedom; you really can, because it's a commodity just like any other.
In a two-earner household, for instance, maybe one of you can quit and go back to school, or even see the kids once in awhile. Save enough and perhaps live a little more modestly, and you might be able to ditch that lucrative but unworthy gig you've been slaving at all these years and do something you believe in -- teach school, start a business, move to the country, join the Elks. Read a book, for Pete's sake.
The current boom comes at a steep price. Cell phones, pagers, e-mail and other technological tethers keep us on our toes at all hours. Those who hand out Internet freebies insist that you pay with your privacy. Even the dot-com elite find themselves bound by so-called golden handcuffs: They can't leave until their options vest, and now that investors are showing signs of coming to their senses about Internet valuations, it may all be for naught anyway.
At a time when more people than ever have the opportunity to do what they want in life, many lack the imagination to do anything but accumulate possessions. Freedom is losing market share to stuff.
Why? One possibility is that freedom has a marketing problem. All the other stuff is hawked day and night in commercials suggesting that a product will somehow make you more free rather than less. Yet freedom itself goes unpromoted.
This woeful lack of advertising for America's very best product means relatively few people know about it, at least judging by consumer behavior. Easy credit and record-high personal indebtedness mean that, despite rising affluence, lots of people still owe their souls to what amounts to the company store. "Money is coined liberty," Dostoyevski rightly observed long ago.
People who make pronouncements like that are usually well-fixed in the things department; the poor regrettably don't have the option of blithely giving up some of their income to change their lives. Besides, Americans really like all the stuff they buy, even deriving a sense of identity from it. Yet many of us are so rich that we need not give up much material well-being to become a whole lot freer to do what we want to do.
Perhaps Americans aren't in the market for more freedom because they already enjoy an extraordinary degree of personal liberty, by global and historical standards. It's odd that we aren't any happier, though. Maybe we have too much of some kinds of freedom and too little of others.
Recognizing that money buys freedom (if not love) might change the way you look at all you make and spend. If you're smart, it will induce you to save more. It might also challenge you to think about what you're doing with your life. Then again, money has always heavily taxed the imagination. In this day of unbacked currency and electronic balances, the whole concept requires a leap of collective faith.
Maybe that's the reason there's so little call for more material freedom in this country. More than anything else you buy, freedom demands that you do something with it. It's not something to tuck away in the garage or unload a few years later on ebay. When someone asks, "Free to do what?" the answer doesn't always come easily. But when you're lucky enough to live in a time and place like this one, perhaps that's your real job -- not making the money, but figuring out what you ought to achieve with it.

Doing God's Work Where Hope Is Rare

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
HOW do you find God in a place of faded glory, far from home? The question haunts Amira Hernandez. Ms. Hernandez, who recently graduated from college, works in Bedford Park, the Bronx, near the part of the Grand Concourse that is no longer grand, with its drug-dealing side streets and ground-down life stories.
Ms. Hernandez, 23, came to New York last summer from Spartanburg, S.C., to volunteer with a nonprofit group called Part of the Solution, which provides poor people with food, housing and legal services. Ms. Hernandez's spiritual faith made her want to change the world, and her idealism has not faded. But her search for God in the Bronx has been far harder than she ever imagined. 
 "Something's out of sync when you've got so many women and children and men being abused and neglected in some way in a world that should be able to feed everyone," she said, explaining her mission. "I didn't want to participate in the injustice. "
But justice can be a mighty big concept to wrestle down to human size and parcel out. Ms. Hernandez would organize meetings so people could deal with the bad things in their lives, like dilapidated housing, but often they would not show up. Sometimes it was because of a long wait at a clinic to treat a sick baby. Sometimes it was because of too many drinks the night before.
Ms. Hernandez, a thin woman with a curtain of bright red hair, also felt the heartbreak of seeing suffering up close, day in and day out. Homelessness. Unemployment. Addiction.
"You come in with these great, idealistic intentions," she said. "Grass roots all the way. Work from the bottom up. On a practical level, sometimes it's hard to get everybody to go to a meeting they're supposed to go to."
"It's a challenge to remain respectful and at the same time try to demonstrate the importance of follow-through," Ms. Hernandez said. "There are days that I am so frustrated, I'm not convinced this is the level on which I'm supposed to be working. The flight response is huge."
"I am angry not just about the disproportion of wealth but also the simplicity of what people ask for," she said. "Some days, all they want is someone to talk to."
Ms. Hernandez is part of an effort called the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, a Roman Catholic organization that sends recent college graduates to volunteer in poor communities. They work in exchange for food, board and a small stipend. In New York City, the volunteers are in every borough, working at organizations like New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition and the Urban Justice Center. They are teachers, counselors and health workers, among other vocations.
Like the other volunteers, Ms. Hernandez was recruited from college. She is a 1999 graduate of Sweet Briar College, which has a 3,600-acre campus in Sweet Briar, Va. She was not especially keen on coming to New York, she said, but was attracted to Part of the Solution because it offered so many services and seemed so engaged with the community. She was heartened when she found that many people in the neighborhood were eager to share their lives with her.
Many of the smells and sounds of the neighborhood were familiar, Ms. Hernandez said, from the trips she took to Colombia with her father, a college professor who is a native of that country. She speaks Spanish.
"I guess the greatest surprise has been how much of their lives they want to share with you," she said. "In detail many of us out of fear of embarrassment or judgment would not divulge to anyone. The honesty is beautiful and humbling. There's not a lot of surface you have to go through to get to the real person. That's the greatest gift."
Ms. Hernandez lives in a long, narrow house with five other volunteers. White and well-scrubbed, they do not exactly resemble their neighbors, who are mostly poor black and Latin people.
If nothing else, the volunteers seem well intentioned, and no one in the neighborhood bothers them. Sharing the same values for the most part, they support one another through those dark nights of the soul.
"A lot of my personal anguish this year has been over women," Ms. Hernandez said. "The cycles of abuse they seem to be stuck in or the presence of drugs and alcohol in their lives.
"At the end of the day, someone will say let's go and have a beer, and I flip out. I can't hear it without seeing the face of someone here and seeing the loss of life and the loss of independence because of alcohol."
Ms. Hernandez's tour of duty ends early in August. She is not certain what she will do next. But even if her search for faith in the Bronx has been met with silence sometimes, she has seen a God with a different face, the face of the people she has tried to help. They have endured in the absence of answers.
"They're homeless and they're housed," Ms. Hernandez said. "They're addicted and they're clean. They're men and they're women.
"I'm grateful to them. If it wasn't for them, I don't know if I would have survived."

$5 Billion Benefit Seen From LIPA Rate Cut

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
Reductions in electricity rates by the Long Island Power Authority have expanded the Long Island economy by $5 billion in the past two years, making it a $100 billion economy for the first time, an economist, Irwin Kellner, said last week.
Dr. Kellner, a professor of economics at Hofstra University, made the estimate at ceremonies attended by Gov. George E. Pataki and Richard Kessel, the utility's chairman, held on Tuesday for LIPA's second anniversary. 
 Mr. Pataki, who led the authority's partial takeover of the former Long Island Lighting Company, said the rate reductions, averaging 20 percent, "benefited all Long Islanders, but especially small-business owners, who are the backbone of the local economy." He estimated direct savings from lower rates at nearly $1 billion over the two years.
Dr. Kellner said the $5 billion figure took into account a multiplier effect that included new jobs and construction, business expansion and higher wages and disposable income. The unemployment rate on the Island is an extremely low 2.5 percent.
He said more than a million workers on the Island were employed by private businesses, and that 40,000 jobs were added last year, the highest figure since 1985.
Much of the savings in the partial takeover of Lilco resulted from refinancing of Lilco debt, including more than $4 billion for the Shoreham nuclear plant, which never opened, with tax-exempt state bonds.
Critics of the takeover said repayment of the bonds over the next 30 years would eventually drive electric rates higher. They also said the authority could act on its own to raise rates at any time, unlike private utilities, whose rates were regulated by the New York State Public Service Commission. JOHN RATHER

HEADLINE: From Tech Schools To Wine Cellars

 BODY:
It was cruel irony to have placed the article about the pressure to cede the building that houses the area's only technical high school to the town of Stamford on the same front page that describes the elaborate wine cellars being built in local homes ("House Wine Gets Its Own Room" and "A Tale of 2 Schools, but Only 1 Building," May 7).
The same population that spends lavishly on a home for liquor is too frugal to invest in the education of manual laborers -- the same population that does the sort of skilled carpentry work in such demand. 
 But, on second thought, it is probably true that both are reflections of the same economic phenomena. Stamford "needs" the tech school space in order to improve its schools, which in turn attract wealth and support real estate values. The wine cellars are "needed" in order to support fragile egos.
Fulfullment of such needs is shortsighted in the extreme, to the extent that they marginalize the very people we require to keep things in working order.
Instead, we need to do more to insure that all forms of talent are nurtured equally in our schools.

It's Harder in Queens
 
Q.: Is New York City water "hard" or "soft"?
 
A.: Soft. Hard water is a domestic nuisance, since it is generally not as quick to form suds, leaves spots and a scummy residue, and contains minerals that can recrystallize when heated, plugging pipes and hot water heaters. It can also taste chalky or rusty. Hardness is based on the amount of dissolved sediment -- mostly calcium and some magnesium -- in grains per gallon. Below 3 grains is considered soft. 
 All but a few city residents are served by the 1,969-square-mile watershed to the north and west, which provides 1.3 billion gallons daily. About 90 percent arrives from the Catskill and Delaware watersheds, according to Geoffrey C. Ryan, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. When tested in 1998, this water averaged a velvety 1.1 grains of sediment per gallon. Mr. Ryan said less than 10 percent of the city's water is drawn from the old Croton system, which averaged 4.9 grains per gallon, considered only moderately hard.
The city's groundwater system, comprising 27 wells in southeastern Queens, accounts for about 2 percent of the city's total supply. Water in wells tends to act as a solvent, and generally has a higher mineral content. New York well water tested at wildly different levels in 1998, from 1.1 grains to a whopping -- and let's face it, rock-hard -- 24.7 grains per gallon. Hey, Culligan man!
 
Airy Ape
 
Q.: To mark the 50th anniversary of the movie "King Kong," an inflatable replica of the big ape was attached to the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building and displayed for several days in the early 1980's. What became of the giant balloon?
 
A.: Roarrr! Pfffffft! Scheduled to spring to life on the morning of April 7, 1983, the vinyl-coated King Kong balloon only dangled from the building like an empty sack while torrential rains, twisted ropes and a series of fabric tears in the armpits, shoulders and neck delayed the inflation for days. Midtown pedestrians, accustomed to looking down instead of up, continued to do so, even as two hired biplanes buzzed the tower.
The $150,000 publicity stunt was conceived by Robert K. Vicino, president of a San Diego company that manufactured giant inflatable advertising displays. Plans called for King Kong to tour the world after he left New York, visiting London and Tokyo -- even the Eiffel Tower -- before finding a permanent perch, perhaps back on the Empire State Building itself.
Since the 3,000-pound balloon was inflated with 600 pounds of cold, compressor-driven air, not helium, the armatures and rigging required were substantial, and the rips and tangles crippling. After struggling round the clock for over a week, the crew finally managed to bring the 10-story balloon to its feet on April 15. Later, the winds picked up again and a 16-foot gash opened in the right shoulder. By the next morning the balloon had deflated again, and the exasperated crew gave up.
"They brought him in and tried to haul him down the stairs, but he got all ripped and torn," said Richard T. Dickson, a former employee of Mr. Vicino's company. "When they finally got him to the bottom, he was destroyed."
 
La Grande Pomme?
 
Q.: Apart from New Amsterdam, has New York City had other European names?
 
A.: In August 1673, New York was briefly returned to Dutch rule, and under Governor General Anthony Clove, commander of the fleet that had snatched the town from the English, was re-christened New Orange. When the city was returned to the English in February 1674, "New York" was restored.

Craving Solitude but Needing Community

BYLINE: By LESLIE BERGER 

 BODY:
WENDY PARIS, a travel writer, bikes across Lower Manhattan to get to work at an office loft shared among a dozen writers, editors and graphic artists. Ms. Paris, who also contributes to women's magazines, sought out the ersatz newsroom at 72 Madison Avenue to beat back the sense of anonymity she felt when working at home. For $315 a month she gets not only a desk with fax, phone and computer lines, but a conference room, cafe and camaraderie.
"Working at home I felt like I was invisible, like I didn't exist," Ms. Paris said. "I felt like I could wear the same clothes every day and nobody would even notice. Now, when I sleep over at some guy's house and come in wearing the same sweater, everyone knows and I find that very comforting." 
 Ms. Paris's work space was borne of the city's crushing real-estate market. For years, during recessions, it was possible to find a cheap little hideaway apart from home. Patricia Bosworth, a biographer, fondly recalls one she took over from a nudist-magazine publisher that cost her less than $100 a month, 20 years ago. Many writers were also able to grab a spot at the Frederick Lewis Allen Room at the New York Public Library, or in the privately established Writers Room, a nonprofit loft with 35 desks that started in 1978 and remains at 10 Astor Place.
Today, the writer's paradox of craving solitude but needing community, too, is still there but it's subsumed by the crasser calling of cash. Commercial office space commands as much as $50 a square foot and library spots are pretty much spoken for. The Writers Room -- which charges $185 every three months -- has a two-year waiting list of 250 names, said Donna Brodie, the executive director.
"When I fund-raise now," Ms. Brodie said, "I point to the real-estate crisis and to the fact that, particularly for emerging writers who tend to be young and living doubled and tripled up, writers' rooms and places like them are absolutely essential."
Some writers manage to work in circumstances that evoke prerevolutionary Russia. Before he quit his day job in publishing, Nicholas Weinstock would write from 5 a.m. till 8 a.m. (HarperCollins is to release his first novel, "The Assistant," next year). He toiled just four feet from his girlfriend's bed, behind a purple curtain, in an apartment he estimates was 200 square feet. Now married and expecting their first child, Mr. Weinstock and Amanda Beesley, an essayist, both write from their new home in a two-bedroom apartment, only Ms. Beesley's office, which was a bedroom, has become the nursery. The author of "Something New," her reflections on the beginnings of marriage, she works from a secretary in their living room.
"If you have 8.5 by 11 inches free, you can pretty much do it," Mr. Weinstock said. "Only in New York, it might be called a one-bedroom."
The issue is so pressing that the Authors Guild Foundation sponsored a panel discussion last fall called Writers and Their Work Spaces. Several hundred writers attended, said the foundation's president, Sidney Offit. He said the idea for the evening was inspired partly by the many letters of recommendation he had been writing lately for writing spaces. "It used to be for grad school," he said. "Now it's for Yaddo and the Writers' Room."
The Authors Guild president, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, is sharing office space with five other women as she works on a novel. Ms. Pogrebin said she writes nonfiction from a study at home, but felt she needed a "zone for fiction." She pays about $250 a month for part of a suite on West 57th Street.
"The space is the novel," she said. "I open the door and the characters are all there. There are no plants to water, no bills to pay, no maps to study for summer vacation."
The bigger, slightly rowdier writers' commune where Ms. Paris goes each day apparently works because of mutual respect, staggered routines and the gentle but firm oversight of the magazine consultants Basia Hellwig and Anne Mollegen Smith. "Every once in a while I'll put out a note saying, 'Please put your coffee cups directly in the dishwasher as opposed to the sink or your desk or whatever,' " Ms. Smith said.
Former magazine editors, Ms. Hellwig and Ms. Smith rented the renovated loft, on Madison between 27th and 28th Streets, after they formed their own company. The atmosphere is casual yet professional, enhanced by lots of natural light.
For settled writers loath to completely give up the single life, rent-regulated bachelor apartments have become a popular form of office space. "My husband had his place 25 years, and when we got married he had all these excuses for why he had to keep it," said Susan Shapiro, a journalist who teaches at New York University and the New School University. Her husband, a screenwriter who shuns publicity, works out of his old apartment for $700 a month.
Susan Cheever also wrote for a while from her old singles place, one of a series of small apartments she rented in the same Upper East Side neighborhood in an endless quest for privacy after she was married and had children. At one point, Ms. Cheever would run between her office and home to nurse her infant son; her nanny learned to recognize the baby's hunger cries and would summon her as needed. Later, she invited another nanny to live in the apartment she was using as an office, an arrangement meant to eliminate the Filipina emigre's commute and have her nearby.
"I forgot it takes a lot more space to live than it takes to work," Ms. Cheever recalled. "Slowly that apartment became like the home to many Filipinos passing through New York and a kind of gathering place for my baby sitter and her friends, the way my home does. It became less and less a place where I could work. I had to laugh at my own pretensions."
Single again and writing from home, Ms. Cheever said she had concluded that where and how one works is as individual as the writer. She noted that her father, John Cheever, wrote in a guest bedroom, a railroad station and a tent, among other places.
"Writing is very mysterious," Ms. Cheever said. "Nobody really knows what the best conditions are for writing. Writing doesn't happen in real time. It doesn't happen the way anything else happens, thank goodness. The hardest part of being a writer is understanding that and finding your own rhythm."

HEADLINE: Shared Prayers, Mixed Blessings

SERIES: HOW RACE IS LIVED IN AMERICA

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: DECATUR, Ga.

 BODY:
Howard Pugh, head usher, is on patrol. May the good Lord have mercy on any child, or adult for that matter, who dares to tread across the lobby of the Assembly of God Tabernacle with so much as an open Coca-Cola in his hand. Because first he will get the look, the alert glare of a hunting dog catching its first scent of game. Then he will get the wag, the slightly palsied shake of the left index finger. And then the voice, serious as a heart attack and dripping with Pensacola pinesap: "Son, this is the Lord's house. And they just shampooed that carpet last week."
It goes without saying that Howard Pugh knows what is going on in his lobby. So when Mr. Pugh, a white man with a bulbous pink nose, spots 81-year-old Roy Denson slipping out of the sanctuary, he doesn't even have to ask. He just knows. He knows because he has seen Mr. Denson flee the 10:30 service time and again, and it is always when one of the choir's black soloists moves to center stage. 
 This time it is Robert Lawson, a soulful tenor with a fondness for canary-yellow suits. As he begins to sing, the Pentecostal faithful gradually rise. First a few black members clap and sway. Then more join in. Finally, the white members are moved to stand, and before long the 2,000-seat sanctuary is washed over with harmony. Stretching their arms toward the heavens, the congregants weave a tapestry of pinks and tans and browns.
But to Mr. Denson's ears, Mr. Lawson's improvisational riffs sound like so much screeching and hollering. And so he sits there seething, thinking about how he joined this church 56 years ago, how he followed it from downtown Atlanta to the suburbs, how he hung the Sheetrock with his own hands, and how the blacks are taking over and the whites are just letting it happen.
He gets angrier and angrier, listening to these boisterous black folks desecrate his music, until he simply cannot bear it. "I ain't sitting there and listening to that," he mutters on his way out. "They're not going to take over my church."
And there waiting for him is Mr. Pugh, at 65 another white man of his generation, always with the same smart-alecky question. Never mind that Mr. Pugh and his wife, Janice, have themselves become uneasy about the direction of their church, that they have been quietly contemplating a walk of their own. "Now, Roy," Mr. Pugh begins, stroking his seafarer's beard, "what are you going to do when you get to heaven? Walk out of there, too?"
Back inside, the ecstatic singing has ended, the speaking in tongues has melted into a chorus of hypnotic whispers and the members of the Tabernacle have been invited to roam the sea-foam carpet, welcoming visitors and greeting one another.
They embrace, the white people and the black people, with long, earnest hugs. Eletia Frasier, a Guyanese immigrant, kisses all who come her way, whether she knows them or not. Brad Jackson wraps his thick white arms around Eugene Glenn, a slender black man, and jerks him cleanly off the ground.
Ruben Burch, a 6-foot-7 black man whose blue usher's blazer is a tad short in the sleeves, saunters down the aisle with an irrepressible grin. During the Sunday fellowship, Mr. Burch makes a point of approaching older whites to gauge acceptance. Will they offer hugs, or merely handshakes? Will they linger, or recoil?
Halfway down the aisle, he encounters Madge Mayo, the spry 85-year-old widow of a pastor from the Tabernacle's segregated days. She stands 4-foot-9 and keeps her luminescent white hair in a tight bun.
There was a time when Mrs. Mayo could never have imagined hugging a black man, and even now she is not sure she approves of the integration of her church. But she has been touched by the bigheartedness of the Tabernacle's black members. And like so many of the whites who have stayed, she reasons that all believers are going to the same heaven, so they might as well get used to one another right here on earth.
Mrs. Mayo sees Mr. Burch heading her way and trots a few steps toward him in her shiny black pumps. They smile fondly, and he bends at the waist to embrace her. She pats Mr. Burch on the back and presses her cheek against his, passing his test.
It is a moment that would probably chafe some of his relatives, who feel that he and his wife, Vanessa, are compromising their blackness by attending "the white church." But the Burches feel blessed by the blendedness of the Tabernacle.
"Man," Mr. Burch reflects later, "30 or 40 years ago I would have been hung for just touching this lady."
 
Praying Side by Side
Sixteen miles east of downtown Atlanta, a vast granite monolith known as Stone Mountain looms over DeKalb County. Up on that mountain in 1915, the 20th-century Ku Klux Klan was born. And virtually in its shadow, the Tabernacle, all brick and glass and sharp angles, sits along Interstate 285 in the thick of the Atlanta sprawl.
Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. scolded Christians for making 11 a.m. Sunday the most segregated hour of the week, the Tabernacle is the rarest of religious institutions: a truly integrated church in a nation where 90 percent of all congregations are at least 80 percent one race. It is, to many of its 800 members, a slice of heaven on earth, a church whose spirituality is magnified by its multiracial character. What better evidence of God's presence, they reason, than the sight of whites and blacks praying side by side?
And yet, the Tabernacle is not some liberal church like the one nearby that took down its white stained-glass Jesus and replaced him with a black one. It is deeply conservative, socially and theologically. What draws the Pughs and the Burches and so many others is the intensity of their Pentecostal faith, which teaches that the Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all believers, regardless of background.
Pastor Roger W. Brumbalow's mission statement, displayed prominently in the lobby, challenges the congregation "to be a multiracial, multicultural maturing body of believers," and, indeed, the church is blended in almost every way. Fifty-five percent of the members are white, 43 percent are black and the rest are Asian or racially mixed. Perhaps a third of the blacks are foreign born, and the church flies 36 flags to honor their homelands.
The Tabernacle has had trouble integrating its eight-member pastoral staff, a legacy of the Assemblies of God's history as a white denomination. Its first black associate pastor resigned last fall after two years. Over the last 13 months, Pastor Brumbalow, who is white, filled two openings with white associate pastors before finally hiring a black youth pastor last month. The board of deacons, by contrast, has been integrated since 1994 and became majority black after elections in March.
The choir is thoroughly mixed, and its praise-and-worship-style music falls comfortably between the traditional country hymns of white Pentecostalism and the thumping gospel funk of the modern black church. Pastor Gary Smith, the music minister, jokes that his choir would be faultless "if we could just get the whites to clap on time and just get the blacks to be on time."
The congregation does not mix only in the pews. Blacks and whites visit each other in the hospital, share motel rooms at retreats and attend potluck dinners at one another's homes. They come together in kitchens and living rooms, forming circles of prayer around an ailing old man or a hopeful young couple, then laying hands on the supplicants' foreheads and shoulders. Visiting one another's suburban homes, with their manicured lawns and large-screen TV's, these accountants and teachers, nurses and software consultants discover the common threads of their middle-class lives.
Yet for all the utopian imagery, for all the hope and faith that the congregation has moved beyond race, the life of the church is still driven by race in countless ways.
Most everyone has made accommodations of some kind. The whites, mostly native Southerners, have been forced to confront their racial assumptions and cede some control over church governance and liturgy. The blacks have ventured from the safe harbor of the African-American church and, in many cases, have suppressed lifetimes of racial resentment and distrust.
The little compromises can be detected any Sunday. They show in the frustration of some black members with the regimentation of the morning service, which opens with exactly 30 minutes of singing and usually lasts precisely two hours.
"There are times when we're praising God and then they just cut it off," complains Robert Lawson. "You can't do that. You can't put God in a box."
Some whites, meanwhile, dart glances at black churchgoers who they feel may be worshiping too exuberantly. They search for delicate words to explain.
"In a lot of cases, the blacks are really more committed," says John F. Kellerman, a former deacon.
"More outgoing," agrees his wife, Grace.
"Where the whites are more reserved, you know," he says.
Behind such concerns, though, is the question at the heart of the Tabernacle's future: Is the church simply enjoying a fleeting moment of integration on the way to becoming predominantly black? With the church growing rapidly and blacks joining at twice the rate of whites, the Tabernacle could tip, like those neighborhoods where blacks move in and whites eventually flee.
The Tabernacle is a work in progress. But how far is it willing to go? And how much are the Burches, the Pughs and the others willing to concede in order to realize St. Paul's declaration that "you are all one in Christ Jesus"?
 
Making 'Colored' Friends
On a chilly Saturday afternoon in January, a racially mixed crowd gathers at Howard and Janice Pugh's house for a catfish feast. They segregate quickly, of course. The men decamp to the garage, handicapping the Super Bowl and admiring Mr. Pugh's skill with the deep-fat fryer. The women settle in the sun room, swapping tales about the cold snap and the flu bug.
When the group comes together for dinner, everyone laughs knowingly at Eugene Glenn's stories about his 16-year-old daughter's interest in buying a car and lack of interest in finding a job. Before long, the joshing turns to the male love affair with the channel changer and, eventually, to Mr. Pugh's vigilance in the church lobby. The guests tease their host about how he was spotted letting the youth pastor's wife cross the carpet with an open can of soda.
"You're slipping, Howard," taunts William Turner, a black deacon.
"Yeah," he chuckles, "I'm getting soft."
As much as anyone, the Pughs have been transformed by the church's integration. Having lived most of their lives with little exposure to blacks, and little interest in gaining any, they now count blacks from the church among their closest friends.
"My feeling before I got to know them was that there really wasn't that many good blacks out there," Mr. Pugh explains. "After being around them and working with them, shoot, I don't even think about them as colored anymore."
Of course, Mr. Pugh's "colored" friends would prefer he use a synonym. But in his mind, his choice of words marks some progress. "Hey, I've come a long way," he says. "I don't say nigger anymore."
"That's right," his wife chimes in, "they should see where you've come from."
Where they both came from were country churches in the piney woods of northwest Florida. When Howard was an infant, his mother would slide him under the bench so he wouldn't get trampled while they danced in the spirit. Janice was abandoned by her parents and raised by a grandmother who enforced a strict Pentecostal code: no smoking, no drinking, no dancing, no makeup, no short pants.
They found each other 21 years ago via CB radio and began courting over a cup of truck-stop coffee. Mr. Pugh, a widower, could be gruff as an Alabama trooper. But he was also giving and good-hearted and a fine provider. She was pretty and sweet and recently divorced. She kept a Christian household and had no problem letting her husband be head of it. Even today, she cooks and cleans and lays out his clothes.
"All he has to do is put them on," she says, rolling her eyes.
"Yeah," he grins, sunk into his recliner, his toy poodle, Pepe, in his lap, "all them guys at the church comes up to me and says, 'Boy, your wife dresses you nice.' "
After working for years in pulp mills, Mr. Pugh brought his bride to Atlanta 19 years ago and started a lucrative business pouring concrete in the ever-expanding suburbs. With its sizable black middle class and political structure, the city was a shock.
The Pughs had come up in a strictly segregated culture. Mr. Pugh remembers having little childhood exposure to blacks, and during the civil rights movement he couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about. As far as he could tell, blacks had the same opportunities as he and other poor whites, even if they did have their own neighborhoods and schools.
"I just wanted to stay on my side of the fence and for them to stay on theirs," he says. "I never abused them. But they pretty much knew that I was white and they were niggers and we just ran our own way."
Mrs. Pugh, 46, says she was never taught prejudice but recalls her grandmother's warning to avoid the black side of town. Her view of black men, she says, came from movies that portrayed them "raping a white woman or something."
In Atlanta, she had to confront her fears. "You'd turn the TV on and it's a black mayor and a black city council," she says. "I'd say: 'Howard, where did you bring me? Are there any white people here?' "
When the Pughs joined in 1992, the Tabernacle was perhaps 10 percent black. They had never worshiped with blacks before. But the black folks tended to sit on the right side of the sanctuary, separated from the whites by a demilitarized zone of empty pews. "We came at a good time," Mrs. Pugh recalls. "There weren't so many of them that it was overwhelming. We could adjust."
 
The Burden of Blending In
Last year, Ruben and Vanessa Burch moved into a new house with an orange-brick facade in a subdivision that is perhaps a third white. Determined to raise their two daughters in an integrated setting, the Burches had been impressed while house hunting that white neighbors had waved to them, a black couple, from their lawns.
A week after the Pughs' fish fry, many of the same couples gathered for a house-blessing dinner at the Burches'. To the strumming of a guitar, the crowd welcomed the Holy Spirit into the airy two-story home. "Come in today, come in to stay," they harmonized, "come into my house, Lord Jesus."
Vanessa Burch, tall, slender and poised, handed out cups of olive oil, and the blacks and whites anointed doorknobs, bedposts and televisions with slick smudges of oil. The ceremony ended when the Burch family -- Ruben, Vanessa, 12-year-old Jessica and 7-year-old Gabrielle -- huddled in the center of the living room and surrendered to the prayers of their friends. The guests gave them a wall plaque, and little Gabby haltingly read, "May the Lord bless this home and keep you in the company of angels." Then spaghetti was served.
Like most black Southerners of their generation, the Burches have experienced their share of racism. Mr. Burch, 46, grew up in Albany, Ga., a stronghold of resistance to the civil rights movement. His wife, 40, grew up in Blakely, a south Georgia town whose high school still has separate homecoming queens and class reunions.
Both remember "colored only" water fountains and parental warnings not to be caught on the white side of town after dark. Mrs. Burch still recalls the indignity of hearing white children call her mother by her first name. And then there was the day, perhaps 15 years ago, when her white boss in a South Carolina bank informed her that the one thing he hated was an "uppity, educated nigger."
"It almost knocked me to my knees," says Mrs. Burch, then a teller at the bank. "I walked off and went into the restroom and cried because it hurt me so bad."
The Burches reacted to all this in different ways. Mr. Burch, happy-go-lucky and confident to a fault, says he never grew deeply bitter. His mother shielded him from the worst affronts, and when his high school integrated, he saw it as an opportunity to date white girls, discreetly. "You knew how far to take it," he says. "I mean, you wouldn't walk down Broadway holding somebody's hand."
Mrs. Burch was more defiant. When her school desegregated, her white classmates learned that anyone who tossed a racial epithet her way was liable to go home with bruises. At age 12, she dressed down a white woman who had scolded her sick mother for sitting in the white section of a doctor's waiting room. "After that," she says, "Mama didn't take me too many times to the doctor's office."
Their experiences left both Burches, though, with a strong understanding that their world would be multiracial, and that schooling, diction and personality would be important tools in getting ahead. Those lessons were reinforced in the Navy, where Mr. Burch spent 22 years as a medic.
In 1996 they moved to Atlanta, where he found work inspecting commercial waste-water systems. They looked for an Assemblies of God church and found the Tabernacle, then about 30 percent black. Before long they were fully involved, he as an usher, she as a Sunday school teacher and both as scout leaders.
"I liked the diversity," says Mrs. Burch, an administrative assistant for a computer company. "I wanted my children to grow up with differences in a church so they could see that whenever they went to heaven it wasn't going to be all black and it wasn't going to be all white. It was going to be mixed."
 
A 'Walk With the Lord'
When the Tabernacle was founded, in 1916, it was most definitely not mixed. And it remained that way through most of its history, moving twice to escape the migration of blacks into its neighborhood. In the 1940's it affiliated with the Assemblies of God, a historically segregationist Pentecostal denomination. But ultimately, the church could outrun neither the changing demographics of postsegregation Atlanta nor some stark fiscal realities.
Shortly before the Pughs arrived, an unmanageable mortgage put the congregation in debt. To dig out, the church called as its senior pastor Coy Barker, a onetime rodeo rider, and agreed to pay him 25 percent of tithes and offerings. With a financial incentive to fill the pews, Pastor Barker tapped the most readily available market -- the middle-class blacks flocking into the area.
By 1984, when the church's current building was completed, the surrounding suburbs were in the midst of a stunning transformation. In 1970 there was one black among the 11,000 residents in the church's census tract. Twenty years later, two-thirds of the residents were black.
Pastor Barker, a typecast televangelist with silver hair, flashy jewelry and a black Lincoln Town Car, had a high-stepping style that mimicked the traditional black preacher. By the time he was forced out in 1993, in the throes of a messy divorce, the church was perhaps 20 percent black and on the road to financial recovery.
Predictably, some whites left. Susan Carithers, a member since birth, could never quite accept integration as God's will. Her husband grew agitated, she says, because "he just didn't want black boys sniffing up to his daughter." They left in 1996, shortly after a black man gave Mrs. Carithers a big hug during a Sunday service.
The Pughs could also have left, but they liked Pastor Brumbalow's preaching and their son's participation in the youth group. And as they got to know black members, they found they liked them, too. A lot.
The black churchgoers did not fit the Pughs' stereotypes. Mr. Pugh noticed that they did not loll around or always have their hands out like the black men who smooth his concrete, the ones he calls "the boys."
Even today he draws distinctions between his black employees and his black church friends. Sometimes he cannot recall his workers' last names, though they have been with him for years. He says that he occasionally has to bail one out of jail, and that if he drives around a corner fast enough he will catch some lounging.
But he admires the blacks at the Tabernacle. They work hard and dress well, often better than the whites, and live in two-story houses on well-tended lanes. "As I began to be around them a lot more," he says, "I saw that there was a lot more of them trying to benefit themselves."
The Pughs held cookouts and invited mixed crowds, disregarding, even slightly savoring, their white neighbors' stares. On Saturday mornings Mr. Pugh would round up a crew of church men, white and black, to go paint a widow's house or serve soup to the homeless. One Easter the Pughs took their black friends Paul and Rudine Hardy to an all-white club for dinner.
"Oh, my God, it was so funny," Mrs. Hardy says. "I said: 'Janice, Janice. These people are all just looking.' They had all this fancy food, and every time I chewed they was just looking."
Mrs. Pugh sometimes gets weepy talking about her deep kinship with Mrs. Hardy and other black women from church. She feels connected to them spiritually and turns to them when she needs prayer.
As she has learned about the bigotry they face, she has come to empathize. It isn't guilt exactly. She doesn't feel she owes black people anything. After all, her life hasn't been so easy either. But she understands, and that is something new.
"When I moved to Atlanta," she says, "I had never had any occasion to know what these people were going through. I'd never had anyone come up to me and say, 'I was treated this way because I was black.' When you hear someone say that, with tears in their eyes, you know they just want to be loved. And I guess I connected with them because I was the same way when I was a little girl. All I wanted was to be loved."
As she sees it, God is using the Tabernacle's integration to test "whether you move on in your walk with the Lord."
Her husband's walk has been less steady. He remains capable of offending black friends even as he beckons them into his life. They recognize that he has come a long way, that he has a good heart. But they also suspect that he continues to use the word "colored," often to their faces, to make it clear that he, not they, will define the terms of their relationships.
"It's a control thing," Mrs. Pugh says. "He wants people to know that he still knows the difference."
Last August, one of Mr. Pugh's black friends decided to confront him, fearing newcomers might be put off by his ways as head usher. But the man later backed down. Don't major in minor, his wife had advised him. "I do value my friendship with Howard and Janice," the man reasoned, "and if it's my friendship with them versus this, it's really very insignificant."
Mr. Burch reacted much the same way at a retreat last year, when Mr. Pugh told him a joke, the one about the black guy who moved next door to the white guy:
The white man was leaning over his fence as his new neighbor mowed the yard. With each pass, the black neighbor taunted the white man, "I'm better than you are, I'm better than you are." Exasperated, the white man finally asked, "What makes you so much better than me?" And the black man replied, "I don't have a nigger living next to me."
"Old Ruben just about fell out," Mr. Pugh remembers. "He didn't have a problem with it." And, in fact, Mr. Burch says he didn't have much of a problem with it, though he was surprised Mr. Pugh felt comfortable enough to tell him the joke. "That's just Howard," he told himself. He let the moment pass, thinking that Mr. Pugh was like an old car, sputtering down the highway: "You just say, 'Well, this is just an old car smoking and we'll go ahead and pass it and one day it'll give out and be gone.' "
 
What the Relatives Say
The Burches may want to make sure, as Mrs. Burch puts it, that their girls don't grow up "in an all one-race anything." But when it comes to their choice of church, they have been wounded by second-guessing from their relatives, particularly Mr. Burch's sister Jacalyn Ray. It has become personal, and at times ugly.
"It's a wannabe thing," says Mrs. Ray, who attends a black church. Her sister-in-law, she thinks, is too eager to make white friends and entertain them in her home. "Some people don't know who they are and have to go somewhere to validate themselves. She doesn't feel comfortable being black."
Mrs. Burch cannot figure out what she did to provoke Mrs. Ray, other than marry her brother. But other family members, while more tactful, do not fully reject Mrs. Ray's assessment. Mr. Burch's half-brother Frederick Caldwell has long noticed that Mr. Burch feels most comfortable in interracial settings.
"I think of Rick as my white brother," he laughs, using a nickname. "He has Caucasian features. Not facial features, but he has a white body type. He can't dance. He'll wear plaid pants. He played on the tennis team in school. He's a Newt Gingrich fan. I wouldn't necessarily say he wants to be white, but he has opinions not normally associated with a black man in the United States."
The relatives say they are also concerned that the Burches may be sending their daughters mixed signals. "I do know with Jessica there's kind of a working out of who she is," Mr. Caldwell says. "My concern for Gabrielle and Jessica is that they have a healthy respect for who they are."
Mr. Burch concedes some concern that his daughters may be too colorblind, that a life without overt discrimination has left them with little racial identity. Someday, he fears, an act of bigotry will shatter their naivete.
Still, he resents the suggestion that he and his family prefer integration because they want to be white. He is comfortable with who he is. "I enjoy me," he says. "And I feel if you don't know me you're missing out." As for his sister, he says: "She's not in touch with reality. I mean, how do we want to be white? Because we want different things, want to live in different neighborhoods? No, she's totally wrong. I think it's a chemical imbalance."
Jessica, tall and outgoing like her parents and engagingly mature for her age, acknowledges inner conflict over racial identity. But it is not that she rejects her blackness or wants to be white. Rather, it is that she feels torn between her parents' insistence on living an integrated life and her black peers' suspicion of anyone who does.
Her parents insist that she and her sister speak "proper English" and scold them gently if they slip into black slang. But her classmates tease her relentlessly for her speech and for having white friends, and sometimes she cannot resist the pressure.
"I do talk improper English, or ebonics, with black friends," she admits. "Maybe I think they'll pick on me if I don't."
Two years ago, she decided to drop her white friends to placate the black ones. But she felt distracted, her grades suffered and she concluded that God was not pleased.
"I finally told myself that it doesn't matter what they think about me, it doesn't matter what color I hang out with," she says. "I have too much respect for who I am."
Not surprisingly, Vanessa Burch is annoyed by her daughter's problems and her in-laws' carping. But it has all made her think.
"I think long and hard about it to see, you know, could this really be true," she says. "And then I go and ask other people, 'Do you think I try to be white?' And they're like: 'What? No. You couldn't be if you wanted to.' It used to really weigh on me and I used to pray about it. 'Lord, what is it? Show me. If I'm doing something to make people see me like this, show me.' "
It hasn't come. People just don't understand, she says, that she is motivated by pragmatism, not racial treason. The reality is that her daughter will face a white world, with certain rules for getting ahead.
"I know that being black is one strike against us," she says, "and in the business world, where she's going to have to compete, being a woman is two against her. So I want her to have enough education that they can't resist her. I want her, when she gets up to speak, that they're like, 'Wow, who is that?' And believe me, voice and articulation get attention."
She is trying, she says, to help her daughters realize that there are no limits, that the restraints and prejudices of her own youth have been lifted. They can do anything, live anywhere, even someplace more extravagant than their new three-bedroom house.
"You want to live in that house on the hill over there," she challenges them, "you can live there. You have the same rights as the next person before you, beside you, behind you, around you. All of you can do the same thing. Once upon a time we couldn't. But now we can."
 
A Colorblindness Test
There was little chance that the Burches and Pughs would miss the wedding of Dorothea Lemon and Curtis Lockridge last June. It was to be the Tabernacle's first big interracial ceremony, and as Madge Mayo explained it, "Something is about to happen that we haven't all fully digested."
The bride, 43 and black, and the groom, 58 and white, had both recently been widowed. The two couples had been friendly at church, and Mr. Lockridge and Mrs. Lemon comforted each other through their grief. Before long, they were holding hands through the Sunday service and scribbling notes on the church bulletin.
"I luv you, Curtis," she would write.
"I'm glad," he would respond.
It raised some eyebrows when Pastor Brumbalow announced their engagement. One elderly white lady asked if Scripture permitted mixed marriages, and he told her there was no prohibition. Blacks and whites asked if it was wrong to want their children to marry within their races. He said it wasn't, and made a point of telling the men's group that he was not encouraging interracial dating.
The afternoon of the wedding, Vanessa Burch slid into a pew toward the back. "What are these people thinking?" she remembered wondering. "How many are going to be in an uproar, and how many aren't going to be back?"
Howard Pugh recognized that the couple were grownups and could do as they pleased. But interracial relationships just went against his upbringing.
"Oh, Lord," he thought as the bride walked down the aisle. But by the end of the afternoon, Mr. Pugh could not help smiling. The couple looked awfully cute, and very much in love. The ceremony had been elegant, the reception lavish. "I'll tell you the truth," he said. "I haven't seen many white folks' weddings put on like that."
Still, some remained uneasy. "The thing that worries me most," said Madge Mayo, "is that this is going to turn things loose for the young people and it's going to get, I shouldn't say entangled, but I'd just say more mixed."
 
Sense and Sensitivity
What Janice Pugh cannot understand, despite her newfound empathy, is why black folks remain obsessed with race, why they can't just let it all go. She and Rudine Hardy talk about it from time to time, sitting on a green leather couch outside the sanctuary. Mrs. Hardy will wonder why the pastoral staff is so white, and Mrs. Pugh will bristle.
"You need to stop being so sensitive about all this," she will say.
"You don't understand," Mrs. Hardy will respond. "You're not black."
"I'm not black, and I never will be black," she will answer. "I just think there are other issues out there that you have to be concerned about that have nothing to do with race."
She thinks about it often. The church should be about love, and love should know no color. "If I were in their shoes," she says, "I would take the attitude that the past is past. You have to go on, and the blacks now, this is the time for them. They're more accepted now."
Because the Tabernacle is an island, and a refuge, it is often hard to accept that racial tensions lie just beneath the surface, vulnerable to exposure from the slightest scratch. But the island is in the world, and in the world there is no refuge.
Kathy Watson, a children's pastor, learned that lesson when she was rebuked by a black parent for referring affectionately to her toddlers as "monkeys." Another youth pastor got an earful about a Bible lesson that equated the color black with sin.
But those flare-ups do not rival what happened last summer with the Homebuilders, a Sunday school class for couples. Until two years ago it was led by a white couple, and attendance was predominantly white. Then Enefiok Umana, a deacon from Nigeria, and his wife, Eno, assumed the leadership, and the class became overwhelmingly black.
Many blacks concluded that whites were simply unwilling to submit to black leadership. And their suspicions were stoked one August morning when two associate pastors interrupted class to introduce a white couple as leaders of a Bible study being started for younger couples. One pastor, Ray Martin, added that the Homebuilders would come under the new class's "umbrella."
After church, the blacks huddled in the parking lot and burned up the phone lines. Some wrote in protest. The implication was clear, they felt. The church was starting a white class for those unwilling to attend the black-led class. And the bit about the umbrella really set them off.
"It was like a kick in the behind to me," said Mrs. Hardy.
Pastor Brumbalow ate lunch at William and Lula Turner's house that day. And as they told him of the discontent many blacks were feeling, the pastor started to weep and vowed that the Enemy -- meaning the Devil -- would not divide his flock. But he had to leave town the next day, and the flames raged on.
The associate pastors were flabbergasted by the reaction and wounded that the blacks could think there was racial intent. "I really thought they were a little further down the healing curve," Pastor Martin said. "It let me know that we're dealing with people that still have some wounds."
In conversations with class members, Pastor Martin acknowledged that the word "umbrella" had left the wrong impression. What he had meant, he said, was simply that the two classes would be parallel ministries that would occasionally come together for functions.
When Pastor Brumbalow returned, he took charge of damage control, delaying the new class to let emotions calm. The next night, though exhausted from his trip, he made a point of attending a Homebuilders potluck dinner.
Still, when the new class finally began, it was attended mostly by whites. And when the new group held a retreat, only one Homebuilders couple chose to attend.
 
When to Preach on Race
Two Sundays after the Homebuilders incident, Pastor Brumbalow did something he had hardly ever done. He preached about race. "I don't normally get this blunt," he began, slapping his hands for punctuation, "but I will get this blunt this morning."
"I want to say to you of color and you that are white" -- he was screeching like the brakes on a train -- "that if you look at a person based on the color of their skin and you evaluate them right then and there, then, my friend, you have missed the purpose of the love of God."
Sometimes, he said, it takes a while to catch on -- to comprehend that God is working a miracle at the Tabernacle so people might have a glimpse of heaven. "When I look across this congregation," he said, "I understand what God is doing. I understand the eternal kingdom."
Pastor Brumbalow recognizes that not everyone was brought up that way. In fact, he wasn't brought up that way. Growing up near Atlanta, he didn't really know any blacks, and he wasn't particularly godly. It was only after some wild days as a rock guitarist with a band called Completely Souled Out that he found God and his future wife, Becky, at a Pentecostal revival. He left shortly for Vietnam, where he won decorations for heroism.
His previous pulpit, in suburban New Orleans, had few blacks. And yet, at 50, he has managed and accelerated the Tabernacle's integration with considerable skill. Both races trust him like a parent and admire his evenhandedness, political instincts and common touch.
"He'll drink out of the same glass," Mr. Burch says. "That's the kind of feeling I get from him, you know, that I'm not higher than you."
He is a gifted preacher, fashioning sermons that are neither inaccessibly erudite nor insultingly shallow. But he prefers, he says, not to preach about race. He would rather lead by example, embracing each in his flock with the same tenderness, blessing each with the same prayers, accepting dinner invitations from all.
"I think the pitfall of having a blended church is when you make race the issue," he says. "What we're doing here as a church is not about race, and if we make that the emphasis then we miss the bigger picture. Our main goal is to reconcile people to God."
He would never say it, and maybe doesn't even let himself think it, but there is another reason not to make race the issue. To preserve the Tabernacle's fragile balance, he must reach out to newcomers without alienating old-timers like the Pughs.
The blacks at the Tabernacle were jubilant about the pastor's race sermon. And the Pughs, like many of the whites, had no real problem with its content. But that he delivered the sermon at all rubbed them the wrong way. He was playing to the crowd, they felt, or at least to part of it.
From time to time, the Pughs had discussed looking at other churches. The Tabernacle was a long drive from home. Now they shared this gnawing sense that race was beginning to supplant God's love as its driving force.
"What would cause me to leave," Mrs. Pugh said, "is for them to constantly have a platform on the black issue, to always talk about race, and not let the Holy Spirit lead us."
Sometimes, though, Pastor Brumbalow says, God just lays a message on his heart and he can't shake it loose. It happened again in February, when, voice quavering, he read Dr. King's "I Have a Dream" speech and prophesied that the Tabernacle would become a beacon for others.
"God is saying, 'I am going to prepare you to be a light, to be an example to the city of Atlanta and to the state of Georgia,' " he said. "I want to tell you, God has a dream and his dream is being fulfilled in this house this morning in the name of the Lord. Hallelujah!"
The Pughs would have preferred a different topic. "He keeps bringing it up and bringing it up," Mr. Pugh said. "With this race deal, once a year is adequate, not every other Sunday."
Several weeks later the Pughs visited another church.
 
A Delicate Balance
 If the Burches and other black leaders at the Tabernacle have a complaint, it is with the level of diversity in the staff. They do not always protest publicly, fearing they might break the spell of racial good will. But they are always watching and counting. All you have to do, they say, is look at last year's Christmas card photograph of "the Tabernacle team," 19 red-sweatered staff members, every last one of them white.
And yet when positions have opened, black deacons have chosen not to lobby Pastor Brumbalow to fill them with blacks. They recognize, they say, that the task is not easy. The Assemblies of God is still virtually all white, with fewer than 400 blacks among its 32,000 licensed ministers. And because Pastor Brumbalow holds a statewide leadership position with the Assemblies, it might be considered bad form to hire from outside the denomination.
Even before last month's success, he had searched assiduously for black prospects, knowing that "it would certainly speak volumes that I pretty much practice what I preach." In several instances he let the congregation know that he had offered jobs to black prospects, only to be rebuffed. That seemed to satisfy his black constituents.
"He interviewed black people and they turned it down, so what can you do?" Mr. Burch said after one such search.
In general, black members suspect that it may not take much to upset the racial equilibrium of the church. Ultimately, they assume, it will come down to power. If black numbers increase to where whites feel disenfranchised, whites will leave, they predict.
For the moment, the pastors feel they must move incrementally. That was never clearer than in the planning of last year's Christmas pageant.
Like other blacks, Ruben Burch had long noticed that blacks had never been cast as Joseph, Mary or Jesus. The whites, he assumed, would have a fit. "Boy, if they figure out there was a black Jesus they probably wouldn't want to go to heaven," he joked.
Pastor Smith, the music minister, badly wanted to break that color barrier. He knew that Scripture was largely silent about Jesus' appearance and that various cultures portrayed him in their own images. But he, too, was unsure if the older whites were ready for an ebony Jesus.
So he devised a scheme to soft-pedal the racial transformation of Christ. He selected for the lead roles Stephen and Sobrina Smith, a light-skinned multiracial couple who happened to have a newborn son, Joshua. Mrs. Smith, born in Trinidad, is part African, Chinese, East Indian, Hispanic and South American Indian. Her husband, a New Yorker, is part Italian, Polish, black, Jewish and Native American.
The pastor theorized that if he could sell the Smiths, he could cast darker-skinned blacks in future years. "The first time it shouldn't be such a shock," he said. "They're not as dark. They're sort of a medium."
The pageant went off without a hitch, down to the triumphant finale, when an adult Christ figure, adorned with a crown and scarlet cloak, rode into the sanctuary on a stocky white horse. Mrs. Smith was fetching as Mary, dressed in a blue satin robe and a white shawl, cradling Joshua as her husband knelt nearby. Mr. Burch, playing a wise man, watched on bended knee.
Pastor Smith could not have been more pleased. He received lots of compliments and not a single comment about the racial makeup of the cast, which was how he wanted it. Most white members, if they noticed at all, reacted about the way the Pughs did, with a shrug.
"I think the white people have been shocked so many times that it doesn't make any difference anymore," Mrs. Pugh said. "They just say, 'Well, that's the way it is now.' "
Even the Smiths, told later that they had been selected for their complexion, said they didn't mind too much, so long as it helped move the church forward. And yet the whole experience made them wonder.
"If we are an integrated church, as we claim to be," Mrs. Smith asked, "why do we still have to go through hoops and loops to make a point and get a message across and pacify certain people and keep waves from starting? If we're still playing around with this, then maybe we're not really who we say we are."
 
HOW RACE IS LIVED IN AMERICA
 
Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race still ignites political debates -- over Civil War flags, for example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of race relations seems muted by a full-employment economy and by a sense, particularly among many whites, that the time of large social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports arenas, in pop culture and at worship, and especially in the workplace. These encounters -- race relations in the most literal, everyday sense -- make up this series of reports, the outcome of a yearlong examination by a team of Times reporters.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Honda Insight;
High-Mileage, High-Stakes Hybrid

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
WITH gasoline prices pushing toward $2 a gallon in some parts of the country, Honda could not have picked a better time to bring out a car that gets 70 miles to the gallon on the highway. Sure enough, the Honda Insight, the first hybrid car to be sold in the United States, is off to a fast start, at least by the standards used to measure alternative vehicles.
Honda has sold more than 1,100 of the futuristic-looking Insights since the car went on sale in December, and the company recently raised its sales target for this year to 6,500 cars, from 4,000. While even that new goal might seem small, it is double the number of purely electric cars sold by all manufacturers combined in the last few years. 
 That raises the question of whether hybrid cars, which combine gasoline engines and electric motors, will provide an alternative to electric vehicles for reducing emissions. The issue is expected to come to a boil in September when the California Air Resources Board considers whether to relax its mandate that starting in 2003, 10 percent of all vehicles sold in the state must give off no emissions or extremely low emissions.
Even though the Insight became the first product ever honored by the Sierra Club for "excellence in environmental engineering," environmentalists worry that the auto industry will try to argue that hybrids, which still emit low levels of pollutants, should be allowed to substitute for true zero-emission vehicles, weakening air-quality goals.
The biggest problem with electric vehicles is their limited battery range. The cars can travel only 50 to 100 miles or so before the batteries must be recharged, a process that takes several hours. But a hybrid uses the batteries only to supplement a gasoline engine. Moreover, the batteries can be recharged automatically using power from the gas engine or from braking, so hybrids do not have to be plugged in. Indeed, the Insight rarely has to be taken to a filling station because it can travel 600 miles on a single tank of gas.
The high mileage comes not just from having batteries carry some of the load. Honda went all out to achieve an eye-popping economy rating, but some of the steps it took ultimately limit the car's appeal.
The Insight seats only two people. It has only a five-speed manual transmission. Its gas engine is a tiny 1-liter, 3-cylinder, although Honda says that because of the Insight's lightweight aluminum body, aerodynamic design and assistance from the batteries, the Insight behaves like a 1.5-liter subcompact. Finally, the aerodymanic design, with its tapered rear end and skirts over the back wheels, will discourage drivers who don't like to be stared at on the road.
The Insight might also be vulnerable to competition from the Toyota Prius, another hybrid that goes on sale this month. The Prius gets "only" about 50 m.p.g. but seats four or five people and has an automatic transmission; it also received the Sierra Club's engineering award, during the New York auto show in April.
Toyota executives, in a put-down of the Insight, boast that the Prius is a "real car" and say that they hope to sell 12,000 in the first year. The Prius will be priced around $20,000, not much different from the Insight's list price of $18,880 without air-conditioning and $20,080 with it. Both Toyota and Honda are presumed to be losing money on each hybrid they sell.
The Insight drives pretty much like any other car. One difference, which makes the car eerily quiet, is that the engine shuts off when the car is not moving, the shift is in neutral and the foot is off the clutch. The engine starts up immediately when the clutch is engaged and the car is put in gear.
Also different is the dashboard, which has some extra displays showing the car's fuel economy at any given instant and providing up and down arrows suggesting when to shift. That makes driving the Insight like playing a video game -- one with the goal of maximum fuel economy. My score was about 45 m.p.g. on fairly empty city streets and 60 on a smoothly flowing highway, below the E.P.A. estimates of 61 in the city and 70 on the highway.
But despite hybrids' high fuel economy, some environmentalists fear that the vehicles will be used as an excuse to postpone or eliminate California's requirement for zero-emission vehicles.
The state air resources board is scheduled to review its so-called mandate in September, and lobbying is expected to be fierce. The mandate, which once called for 10 percent of a company's sales to be zero-emission vehicles, has already been weakened twice. It now says that only 4 percent of sales have to be truly emissions-free and the other 6 percent can be extremely low polluting vehicles.
But automakers say it is next to impossible to meet even the 4 percent target because battery-powered electric vehicles will be the only way to achieve zero emissions by 2003, and those cars have been shunned by consumers. Fuel cells, a new technology for achieving zero emissions, are not expected to be widely available until the second half of the decade.
While the industry has not yet publicly stated its position, some automakers are expected to argue that a greater improvement in air quality could be achieved by selling a larger number of pretty clean hybrids rather than trying and failing to sell a smaller number of totally clean electrics.
But environmentalists say the auto companies have not tried hard enough to develop and sell all-electric vehicles, and they don't want hybrids to be used as an excuse to take the pressure off. Hybrids "are still running on gasoline," said Roland Hwang, transportation program director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "You still have to have something in the program that says we're moving to zero."
Officials of the air resources board have said they hope to keep some of the zero-emission requirement because it has prodded the development not only of electric cars but of hybrids, too. If the mandate is relaxed a third time, electric vehicles might never be commercialized. What California does is expected to be followed by New York and Massachusetts as well, and possibly by some other states.
But hybrids might not be the total answer either. "Hybrids are a means of increasing fuel efficiency," said Robert J. Bienenfeld, manager of sales and marketing for alternative-fuel vehicles at Honda. "They are not necessarily the way to approach air-quality regulations."
Indeed, the Insight is now classified in California as a ULEV, or ultra-low-emission vehicle, and as such it would not qualify to be counted in the 6 percent of extremely low-emission vehicles that each manufacturer must sell in the state starting in 2003. The Toyota Prius, however, is a SULEV, or super ultra-low emission vehicle, which could qualify if it meets certain other requirements.
Moreover, while all companies are developing hybrids, some probably won't have them on the market by 2003. Ford has announced that its first hybrid will go on sale that year, a version of its new Escape sport utility. The president of Toyota, Fujio Cho, recently said that his company was working on a hybrid S.U.V., too. DaimlerChrysler is showing off a hybrid Dodge Durango that uses an electric motor not so much for high fuel economy, but to bolster the performance of a gasoline V-6 engine.
Under the current regulations, SULEV's are given only partial credit toward the emissions goals. It might take three hybrids to count as one zero-emission vehicle in the overall 10 percent goal. Thus, if hybrids are to account for 6 percent of the emissions goal, they will actually have to account for 18 percent of actual sales, which would mean 100,000 hybrids for the top six manufacturers alone. Even with the extra practicality of hybrids, that could be a tough goal to reach, especially if gasoline prices drop.
"We didn't see this as a mass-market car," Mr. Bienenfeld said of the Insight. "Six months ago, gasoline was $1.10 to $1.15 and no one was walking into a dealership demanding a high-fuel-economy car."

Microsoft WillTest Justices' Prowess

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN the Supreme Court confronted its first Internet case three years ago, the justices received special training from their library staff. The lessons "helped assure each of us that we knew how to use the Net and understood the technical matters at issue," Justice Stephen G. Breyer recalled a few weeks ago at a symposium on biomedical research in Cambridge, Mass.
Thus empowered, the court went on in that case, Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, to produce a unanimous decision that struck down the Communications Decency Act on First Amendment grounds and established the primacy of free speech principles in cyberspace. 
 Soon, the Microsoft -- antitrust case will be heading toward the Supreme Court -- although whether directly from Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's final federal district court ruling, expected this week, or after review by the Court of Appeals here remains to be seen. The court has gotten its collective feet wet, clearly, but in the world of platforms, applications, source codes and interfaces, familiarity may not be fluency.
So the question remains: are the justices ready to swim?
The answer is almost certainly yes, in the view of a broad consensus of antitrust experts and students of the court. Year in and year out, they pointed out, the justices manage to handle hard cases requiring substantial specialized knowledge across many fields. But the intersection of old law with new technology that the Microsoft case represents offers a special challenge that at least one expert cautioned could test the limits of the court's competence.
Institutionally, the court remains a novice. The Supreme Court launched its first Web site (www.supremecourtus.gov) only two months ago, long after many other courts had established an Internet presence. A rather static venture that lets users read the court's opinions and check its calendar, it received one million hits in its first month, to the considerable surprise of officials.
Meanwhile, though Windows NT runs the court's computers, and the justices' law clerks are undoubtedly as computer savvy as other members of their generation, the justices themselves, who range from 52 to 80, all came of age at a time when doing legal research meant reaching for a book, not a mouse.
Substantively, the Microsoft case presents layers of complexity -- not only the technology of the specific products at issue, but fiercely contested assumptions about the relationship between competition and innovation in the fast-changing technology marketplace. To be told that they hold the future of the information industry in their hands -- a point the briefs will undoubtedly try to impress on the justices -- would be more than a little daunting for anyone.
STILL, in recent interviews, several people pointed to Judge Jackson as an example of the judicial ability to climb a steep learning curve. Whether or not they agreed with the trial judge's approach to the case, no one seemed to doubt that by the end of it, he had an impressive mastery of the subject.
"Judge Jackson never founded a dot-com or acquired any special credentialing," observed John Shepard Wiley Jr., a professor of antitrust and intellectual property law at the University of California at Los Angeles. "For 200 years, federal judges have had the brains and the motivation to deal with cases people might assume are beyond their competence. They are used to rolling up their sleeves."
Patent law, for example, "puts incredible demands on generalist judges," Professor Wiley said, because new patents are by definition at the cutting edge of technology. "You can have a degree in gene splicing, but if it's 10 years old, it's not worth much," he noted.
One antitrust expert, Andrew I. Gavil of the Howard University Law School, noted that the justices regularly decided complex cases, in antitrust, food and drug law and many other fields requiring specialized knowledge. "It's hubris to think that the Supreme Court can't figure this out," he said.
"Of course," he added in a wry tone, "it's not like Aspen Skiing" -- a reference to an admittedly more accessible 15-year-old antitrust decision that found the owner of three mountains in Colorado to have maintained an illegal monopoly by refusing to deal with the owner of a fourth mountain.
The Microsoft case presents "interesting legal issues, but not unique ones," Professor Gavil said, noting that at the heart of the case are antitrust principles with which the court is completely familiar. "What Microsoft did with its monopoly and how the law treats that is not that complex," he said. "Did it have a pro-competitive justification, or did it engage in behavior that cost it something in the short run in order to hinder its rivals in the long run? That's a very conventional antitrust question."
The aspect of the Microsoft case that most closely combines law and technology, Professor Gavil said, is whether Microsoft's bundling of its Internet browser with its Windows operating system was an illegal tying arrangement.
JUDGE Jackson -- who earlier in the case conducted his own experiment, disabling Internet Explorer on his own computer in 90 seconds -- ruled that it was in his April conclusions of law.
"But on that, the justices will be able to use pretty standard doctrine," Professor Gavil said. "You don't have to be able to read source code to know what you see on the screen when you turn on your computer. If you know that there are programs that can be downloaded from the Internet, you've gone pretty far toward being able to understand the government's theory."
The broader question of how judges deal with the substantive complexity of the cases before them has been a subject of growing interest, much of it revolving around the capacity of so-called junk science to sway impressionable jurors. In an important 1993 decision, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the Supreme Court reinterpreted the federal rules of evidence to require judges to serve as gatekeepers, weeding out bad science and preventing unqualified "experts" from testifying.
The Daubert case and two subsequent Supreme Court cases that elaborated on it have spawned a whole body of law, still a work in progress and all of it judge-made.
To cite just one example, federal appeals courts are split over how to assess the reliability of a doctor's testimony about a differential diagnosis -- the conclusion that a plaintiff's symptoms are caused by one medical condition and not another. Some courts allow testimony that reflects standard clinical practice, while others reject testimony not based on published scientific studies. The Supreme Court may eventually feel obliged to resolve the dispute, as well as others stemming from the Daubert case.
"We rely on judges who are generalists, and judges learn what they need to learn," said Richard M. Cooper, a Washington lawyer who has argued many technically complex cases since his days as general counsel for the Food and Drug Administration. Most recently, he won a Supreme Court case on behalf of the tobacco industry against his former agency's effort to regulate cigarettes as drug delivery devices.
"The parties and friends of the court briefs educate the judges," Mr. Cooper said. "The lawyer's job is to marshal the relevant science, economics and technical information in a manner that an intelligent lay person can understand.
"That's our system, and it's a useful discipline," he added. "The Endangered Species Act, for example. Are we really wiping out that rare species? How do we know?" For the Microsoft case, he said, "if it's something economists can understand and explain to lawyers, lawyers can explain it to the court."
Cass R. Sunstein, a University of Chicago law professor whose recent book on the Supreme Court, "One Case at a Time" (Harvard University Press, 1999), commends an incremental approach to deciding hard cases, was one hesitant voice who warned that the Microsoft case might indeed lie at the outer limits of the court's institutional competence.
In an interview, he noted that antitrust cases, unlike most other cases of equivalent complexity, go to court in raw form, without having been predigested by an administrative agency with special expertise.
"When a court is stuck with a technically complex case, it can usually turn to strategies of avoidance," Professor Sunstein said. "In administrative law, you defer to the agency. A real development of 20th century law was the shift from judicial to administrative lawmaking. We don't have the common law of nuisance; we have the E.P.A. We don't have the common law of fraud; we have the F.T.C."
But in antitrust, essentially common law constructed by judges from the Sherman Act's cryptic phrases, the strategy of avoidance "is not available," he said. Without an expert agency to defer to, explained Professor Sunstein, judges cannot take the path of least resistance -- that is, "letting specialists make the first-line decisions, subject to review by generalists for some sign of arbitrariness or unfairness."
In the Microsoft context, he said, that leaves the court without much of a lifeline as it navigates uncharted territory. "To the extent that this case can be resolved on standard antitrust doctrine, the facts are pretty straightforward," Professor Sunstein said. "What's messy is to figure out how to apply antitrust when technology and the market are both changing rapidly."
AMONG the justices, no one has given more thought to the relationship between law and science than Justice Breyer, who also happens to have taught antitrust at Harvard Law School.
"I believe that in this age of science, we must build legal foundations that are sound in science, as well as in law," he said in a 1998 speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which he praised for a study on expanded roles for court-appointed experts.
More recently, in his speech last month at the Cambridge biomedical research symposium, Justice Breyer said the view that Supreme Court justices "need not know science but only law to make decisions" was "increasingly unrealistic."
The challenge of "creating a generalist voice that will speak for an age of specialization," he said, was "difficult to accomplish, but it is important to try."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Fortune Telling For Profit And Policy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THIS column has been lent a crystal ball for one week. Reception is a bit fuzzy, but here goes.
The Federal Reserve will raise interest rates once or twice by the end of the summer, and then will call a time out. 
 Six rate increases in less than a year, to little obvious effect, have left economists and analysts fretting that monetary policy has lost its punch. But now there are at least tentative signs that the rip-roaring economy is slowing. Moreover, the Fed still has faith in its tools, and after tightening by another quarter-point at the end of this month, and perhaps again in August if its hawks insist, it will pause to reassess the outlook.
It is clear that technology and globalization have changed the economy in ways that even Alan Greenspan does not fully understand, and slowing its growth may require a bigger dose of interest-rate medicine than in business cycles past.
But monetary policy seems to be working much the way it always has. Long-term interest rates on corporate debt have risen substantially, and companies are turning away from bond issuance and toward bank loans and commercial paper to avoid being locked into high-cost long-term debt.
At some point, the cost of borrowing short-term will rise so much that companies will choose to defer plans to expand or modernize -- or they will absorb the higher interest costs in the form of diminished profits. Either way, business activity and the economy will slow.
Consumer mortgage rates have jumped and the housing market is cooling. Retail spending may have peaked. Stocks are volatile but no longer rising relentlessly.
Unemployment is still so low, and consumer confidence so high, that Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues are not comfortable holstering their weapons quite yet. But unless the stock market takes off again or unambiguous acceleration in growth and inflation appear, the Fed will show great patience later this year.
The federal budget surplus will again prove larger than expected, with implications for the presidential race and the bond market.
Congress and the White House will update their long-term surplus projections over the summer; both will rise substantially, reflecting the strength of tax receipts this year and the spreading consensus that the economy is capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth than in the past. The economy has been so strong that economists now expect a fiscal-2000 surplus of at least $200 billion and perhaps $225 billion; in January the Congressional Budget Office was estimating $176 billion.
Even if growth slows substantially, the economy will still be bigger than had been forecast, yielding more tax revenue, and the budget office has gradually been raising its estimates of growth potential.
Economists at Goldman, Sachs recently raised the possibility that this summer's new surplus numbers could allow the federal government to pay off the entire $3.5 trillion national debt held by the public as soon as 2007, six years ahead of the Clinton administration's current schedule.
More money on the table would give George W. Bush an opportunity to argue that the nation can afford both his big tax cut plan and his proposal to create private investment accounts within Social Security. Vice President Al Gore would get a chance to call both for accelerated reduction of the national debt and for additional spending on Democratic priorities like adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
Defining and nurturing the new economy will emerge as a major political issue.
In Congress -- especially in the House -- the two parties will continue falling all over each other to prove that they are au courant with the wired world (and happy to receive its campaign contributions).
Republicans will push through a bill to extend for five years the current moratorium on Internet taxation, and the two parties will reach agreement on granting more visas to skilled workers from abroad to meet demand from technology companies.
The whole topic of the government's role in the new economy will take center stage when the federal judge presiding over the Microsoft antitrust case orders, perhaps this week, that the company be broken up.
But even as they maneuver for political advantage, politicians will continue trying to decipher what these issues mean to voters. A recent poll by the centrist Democratic Leadership Council found voters to be optimistic about the new economy's prospects, dubious that it should be regulated like any other industry and willing to endure more frequent job changes but insistent that government support job training and education.
Full disclosure: This crystal ball appears to be a prototype, and carries no warranty. Check back in a few months to determine its accuracy.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Utilities Rally To Yield Some Powerful Results

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
NOTORIOUSLY vulnerable to rising interest rates, utility stocks fell 23.5 percent last year, their worst performance in a quarter-century, as the Federal Reserve made credit more expensive on three occasions, starting June 30.
So what has happened this year as the Fed raised rates another three times? The stocks have not only rallied but have performed better than any other group. The Standard & Poor's utility index has returned 20.6 percent through Friday while the S.& P. 500 has fetched just 1.1 percent. 
 What's to explain this turnaround? Several things, industry analysts and portfolio managers say, not least the fact that utilities are among the few sectors that pay handsome dividends, resulting in yields that are high even by historical standards.
Despite this year's rally, dividend yields for new investors in many utilities are flirting with 7 percent -- quadruple the 1.51 percent yield for the Dow industrials.
"Dividend income is one of the few real things you get from a company," observed William H. Reaves, president of a Jersey City money management company that specializes in utilities.
Unfashionable as such thinking has become in a technology-dominated investment world, it is clearly attracting some investors partial to equities but weary of the gyrations that have become commonplace on the Nasdaq and, all too often, for high-priced blue chip stocks as well.
"They're jumping into utilities," said Edward J. Tirello, who analyzes the group for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. The appeal is not just high yields, he added, but that utility stocks are highly liquid and the companies in many cases offer prospects for growth in a newly deregulated environment.
Indeed, the industry is steadily, though slowly, shedding its traditional reputation as supersensitive to changes in interest rates. No longer do most utilities need to borrow huge amounts to build new generating capacity. Many of the companies are raking in so much cash that they have become lenders and investors themselves.
And many analysts say that after years of underperforming, utilities are bargains.
THE values are pretty compelling right now," said Daniele Seitz, director of equity research at UBS Warburg. She cited "hidden value" that deregulation is unlocking for many companies, such as from energy-trading and telecommunications, and the relatively friendly attitude that state officials have taken in awarding compensation for so-called stranded costs for plants that are no longer competitively viable.
With federal encouragement, half the states have facilitated some form of free market in electricity and natural gas, with consumers getting a choice of suppliers. This kind of deregulation is changing the risk-reward profile of the industry.
Although strategies differ, the industry is gravitating roughly into three camps -- those oriented toward generating power (such as Edison International, -- based in Rosemead, Calif.), those that distribute it (GPU of Morristown, N.J.) and those that follow the traditional route, doing both (Southern of Atlanta, Ga.).
Generation is considered riskier but distribution remains subject to price regulation, and analysts say it is too early to know the winning strategy.
"We don't know which plan's going to work out better," Mr. Tirello said.
Still, the companies do stand to benefit from strong growth in demand for power, which many believe will result in shortages in some parts of the country this summer. And there is little risk that fresh capacity will put downward pressure on rates anytime soon since independent "merchant" plants have become difficult to finance, analysts said.
Meanwhile, utility dividends, after a decade in which many companies cut payouts in response to Wall Street pressure to transform themselves into vehicles for rapid growth, seem relatively secure again.
Asked about favorite stocks, Ms. Seitz cited American Electric Power, -- a Columbus, Ohio, holding company yielding 6.93 percent with an energy-trading operation, good fuel diversification and the scale to be a major supplier. She also likes New Orleans-based Entergy -- (4.09 percent), the company that has the industry buzzing about its aggressive embrace of deregulation, and Duke Energy -- of Charlotte, N.C. (3.81 percent).
Mr. Tirello favors Atmos Energy, -- a Dallas-based gas distributor (6.12 percent); American Water Works, -- "a natural monopoly" in Voorhees, N.J., (3.63 percent); and such electrics as the Dallas-based TXU (7.07 percent) and New Jersey's Public Service Enterprise Group -- (5.90 percent).
AS FOR Mr. Reaves, who has been following the industry for some 50 years, the high-yield standout is the St. Louis-based Ameren, -- paying 7.04 percent and increasing its earnings 6 percent a year. He also likes Virginia's Dominion Resources -- (5.73 percent) and, for the patiently venturesome, the growth-oriented Peco Energy -- in Pennsylvania (2.30 percent).
"The stocks tend to do better when there's caution in the market" generally, Mr. Reaves said. But he said many investors were still inhibited by old notions about these suppliers of basic household services.
That is likely to change.

What Are You Afraid Of? A Hidden Issue Emerges

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A HOT new issue is lurking just below the political radar, ready to explode onto the American electorate.
"It tests off the charts!" said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster. 
 Mark Penn, President Clinton's pollster, said, "Everybody's seen it in their surveys -- it's pretty hard to miss. It's a pretty powerful groundswell."
Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who held three hearings on the subject last week, gushed, "Boy, you prompt it with just a couple words and you're going to get a torrent of responses from people."
The issue is privacy. It encompasses far more than peeping toms, or even hackers invading Web sites or intercepting cell phone conversations. Not only are people frightened that information about their personal peccadillos could turn up in hostile hands, but also that thieves could cash in on their financial data.
Increasingly, people confess to pollsters, they are suspicious of companies that have access to their financial and health care records, and are frightened that the information will be used against them. They are no less wary of what the government could do with such data.
To many voters, that their movements and activities are being tracked on the Internet -- perhaps even by their bosses -- may not pose a direct danger. But the very idea of it is, well, creepy.
Spotting an opportunity, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have begun speaking out about protecting the dissemination of private information.
"Today, there is greater protection for your video rental receipts than for your most intimate medical information," Mr. Gore said in a speech at New York University two weeks ago. "I've seen cases where people's prescription drug histories are sold freely to direct mail companies without their permission; where hundreds of employees at an H.M.O. have access to patients' records."
Even Mr. Bush offered a nod, telling Business Week recently, "I'm a privacy-rights person. The marketplace can function without sacrificing the privacy of individuals."
In many ways, privacy seems like a sure-fire political issue: it touches day-to-day anxieties triggered when people are asked to divulge their credit card number over the telephone or when they retrieve cash from an A.T.M. machine. It is always a draw for press coverage. And as Internet useburgeons, so will fears.
But politicians face a challenge to convert privacy from a subliminal worry to something that will actually affect how people vote. Complicating that challenge,privacy is not, at first glance, a matter that would drive voters to one party or another.
DEMOCRATS have been the most aggressive in vying for the privacy niche. They are framing it as a tension between civil libertarians and consumers on one side and big business on the other. Already, in the House, Democrats have zeroed in on a vote taken last July, in which most Republicans opposed instituting rigorous privacy protection for customers' medical and financial records.
Although privacy comes up less among Republicans, they argue that it would not be out of character for them to seize the issue. After all, libertarians have always been big on privacy. And Republicans were the most outspoken in condemning the Census Bureau's long form, asserting that it was an infringement on privacy.
"This is a hill that nobody holds, and either party could seize the ground," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who for months has been using flip charts to persuade his clients that privacy "is a huge issue waiting" for someone to grab. "The issue of privacy is very much in the place that health care was a decade or so ago," he said.
Acknowledging that either party could potentially become identified with privacy, Mr. Newhouse said the competition will be over who "can be there first and strongest and be the noisiest on it."
Indeed, a Gallup poll in March asked who would better handle protecting ordinary Americans against invasions of privacy. Mr. Gore drew 41 percent; Mr. Bush, 47 percent.
Privacy may be so potentially hot that some candidates did not want to publicly admit they were husbanding the issue for their fall arsenals. Who wants to tip off a rival to a fresh line of attack?
"My campaigns are reluctant about showing leg early on this," said Jim Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
But candidates who face primary opponents do not have the luxury of holding off. Last week, former Representative Maria Cantwell, who is running for the Democratic Senate nomination from Washington state, began broadcasting a television commercial on privacy. Ms. Cantwell, who lost her seat after one term in the Gingrich revolution of 1994, went on to make between $25 million and $50 million in the Internet business.
Peering into the camera, Ms. Cantwell says in the 30-second spot: "What you do on your own computer should be your business and nobody else's. I want to make sure no child is left behind and that the Internet remains a tool for learning, not another way for government, banks or insurance companies to invade your privacy."
The campaign of another Democrat, Mike Ciresi, a trial lawyer who is seeking the Senate nomination from Minnesota, swamped potential supporters last week with thousands of glossy brochures featuring the headline, "Mike Ciresi Will Protect Your Privacy!"
When voters are asked what concerns them most, they seldom cite privacy right off the bat. Yet pollsters find that when voters are probed about issues that affect their lives, privacy shoots to the top -- or close to it.
"God gave me a couple of ears -- I just listen to people," said Brian Schweitzer, a peppermint farmer and soil scientist from Whitefish, Mont., who is running for the United States Senate. "Everywhere I go in Montana people want to protect their privacy. It's huge!"
Mr. Schweitzer, a Democrat who hopes to oust Senator Conrad Burns, accused his rival of co-sponsoring a bill that "would force the individual consumer to contact corporate America and beg them not to collate and sell your personal information."
For his part, Mr. Burns insisted that Mr. Schweitzer "mischaracterized the legislation" and was simply "trying to get his name in the paper." He is just as committed, he said, to guarding people's privacy.
No one knows whether this issue will truly rouse voters in the fall of 2000 to the same extent as health care and education. After all, even after the tax revolt of 1978 in California, it took years for cutting taxes to become a winning issue nationally. And despite stirrings about smog and dirty water in the 1970's, the environment did not emerge as a top-of-the-mind concern of American voters until years later.
The other challenge facing both sides is that there are no easy remedies for protecting privacy. Even if consumers clamor about their rights, no politician wants to be seen taking steps that could hobble the new economy -- or provoke the Internet industry, which has become increasingly generous in doling out contributions.
Candidates should also be mindful that there can be unintended consequences when they try to capitalize on a new issue.
Strategists for Representative Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said that in their drive to topple the incumbent Republican, Senator Spencer Abraham, they plan to castigate him as siding with big business -- and against consumers -- on privacy matters.
But Mr. Abraham shot back that he intends to play up that his campaign has an "Internet privacy policy on our Web site -- and she doesn't even have one."
"It would be interesting for Congresswoman Stabenow to make that an issue," he said. "We're explicit. We will protect the privacy of people who log on to our Web site."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS WORLD;
Eastern Europe's Foray Into 'M-Commerce'

BYLINE: By PETER S. GREEN

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
THERE'S no need to fiddle in your pocket for loose change if you want a Coke on the streets of downtown Prague. Simply walk up to a Coca-Cola vending machine and point your mobile telephone at it.
Punch a few buttons on your phone and bang, a cold bottle clatters down the chute and 20 Czech Koruny, about 50 cents, is charged on your mobile phone bill. 
 As consumer spending in the former Communist bloc has risen, so has the use of mobile phones: in some countries as many as one in four households now owns one. But the creaky banking system inherited from Communism has left Central and Eastern Europe mostly cash economies. Credit cards and checks are seldom used, and both merchants and consumers are deeply fearful of losing their life savings to credit-card fraud.
Now, with the advent of sophisticated wireless technologies, improved data security and increasingly versatile handsets, Eastern Europe -- and the Czech Republic, in particular -- are at the forefront of a movement to put e-commerce in the hands of consumers. The result is m-commerce, for mobile. Moving far beyond the quick Coke, companies like Nokia and Citigroup want to turn mobile phones into virtual credit cards.
"People perceive mobiles as trusted personal devices," said Jari Paakkarinen, of Nokia Telecommunications, the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer, which is using the highly competitive Czech mobile phone market to test new technology. "You eat with it, you rest with it. It's an extension of your personality, so it's a very short step to trust it to pay with it."
M-commerce is likely to take off much more rapidly in Europe, especially the Czech Republic, than in the United States. Although some former Communist countries lack readily available wired telephones, most of Europe has mobile networks that are several generations more advanced and more secure than the older United States systems. And most European systems function across entire countries, not just several cities or states.
In the United States, the widespread use of checks and credit cards reduces the need for a new payment system. And Americans would be more likely than Europeans to see the spread of m-commerce as a threat to their privacy.
But Central Europe lacks the sophisticated database of consumer credit that card issuers require. Akshaya Bhargava, general manager of Citibank's Czech operations, says that the bank is instead arranging, by this fall, for retailers to accept payment by mobile telephone for goods sold on their Web sites.
The Czech Republic's 10.5 million people already own more than 2 million mobile phones and pay their bills religiously. But credit cards have hardly made a dent, with few Czech adults holding them.
Nor do Czechs use checks. Instead, most use A.T.M. cards to withdraw money, then pay their bills and make their purchases in cash. Czechs commonly pay for kitchen furniture, airline tickets and even new cars with wads of bills.
But merchants complain that cash transactions encourage theft and that customers often forgo purchases because they simply do not have enough cash in hand.
The prophets of m-commerce, here and around the world, therefore, see a double boon: The phone will replace or pre-empt the credit card, giving merchants authorization to immediately debit a shopper's bank account or add the charges to a phone bill. It can also become the prime means of gaining access to the Internet, allowing consumers to browse stripped-down Web sites especially tailored to small mobile phone displays. Only about 7 percent of Czechs have regular access to the Internet at home or work.
The m-commerce revolution depends on a series of technologies meant to bring information from the Web to screens not much larger than a watch face. The current technology, called Wireless Application Protocol, is seen as only the first step toward high-speed data transmission for mobile phones that will receive a constant flow of news bulletins, stock prices or suggestions for nearby restaurants, as determined by the nearest transmitter.
With an average monthly income of around $341, not many Czechs are likely to charge a new Lexus on their mobile phone. But Jack Schrantz, founder of Albumcity.cz, an Internet record shop, says he expects compact discs to sell well. "It matches the demographics here -- it's the young and tech-savvy who buy CD's," Mr. Schrantz said.
Several European airlines and banks are already making plans to extend m-commerce. Finnair and Lufthansa allow passengers to check for delays and change their reservations with Web-enabled telephones. Over the next two to three years, Lufthansa plans to offer everything from ticket purchases to check-in.
Banks in several European nations also are allowing customers to use telephones and the Internet to make transfers, check account balances and spend cash downloaded into an "electronic wallet." Others see the technology going even further. At Globopolis (www.globopolis.com), a collection of regularly updated city guides to major European cities, mobile phone surfers some time this year will be able to not only find a restaurant, cinema or nightclub, but to make a reservation and pay for tickets, and in some cases, even meal bills.
As with many an Internet business, however, it remains unclear how m-businesses will generate revenue and profits. Banner advertisements simply cannot fit on phones.
For now, the airtime that callers burn up while browsing is the main source of revenue for mobile phone operators. But competition and further generations of technology could replace charges by the minute with flat monthly rates, leaving the operators looking for a new model.
PROFITS from m-transactions are often small: hi-technology Coke machines will not make anybody rich. "The question with micropayments is how you split commissions: There's not much there," said Robert Chvatal, the marketing director of Radio Mobil, whose Paegas mobile telephone service, provided in a partnership with Deutsche Telekom, is the second-largest in the Czech Republic with nearly one million subscribers.
Both Paegas and its larger rival, EuroTel, whose partners are Bell Atlantic and Media One International, say they may eventually make their money much as Visa and American Express do, by charging merchants a percentage on every transaction.
EuroTel and Paegas count on Web traffic to be dominated by the mobile telephone, not the personal computer, or even palmtops. "Many of these customers simply cannot or will not invest in a home PC, so the ability to get to the content and applications of the Internet via the mobile is very attractive," said Mike Burns, EuroTel's marketing director. "What's in it for us is to be essentially the primary provider of Internet services in this country."

HEADLINE: The World: A Different Kind of Rogue;
When Democracy Runs Off the Rails

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
FOR years the United States has classified some countries, like Iraq and North Korea, as "rogue states." Now, as the world becomes more democratic -- more than 60 percent of countries have elected leaders -- something more complicated enters the political lexicon. Call them "rogue democracies."
These are democratic governments that go off the rails, either in aggressiveness toward neighbors, cruelty to citizens or backtracking on the promise that democracy will foster liberty and equality. 
 How to deal with this new type of rogue, or to know when to recognize one, is not easy for established democracies. It is, after all, tempting to assume that when other nations choose to freely elect their leaders, good things automatically follow.
The case of Peru is the latest example. There an elected president, Alberto K. Fujimori, has rewritten the constitution, cut the power of his Congress and chipped away at political liberties, all in the name of social order. Now he is claiming a third term after an election so riddled with irregularities that the opposition boycotted it and the Organization of American States won't approve it.
What's the world to do? Shun Peru? Impose sanctions? When Austria's voters put the xenophobe Jorg Haider near the seat of power, Europe got together and forced his ostracism. But in Peru a similar outcome seems unlikely.
It has been obvious for some time that democracy no longer has one universally accepted definition, and so it is hard to say when a country ceases to be one. Consider the variety of forms in Peru, Russia, India, Zimbabwe, the United States, Austria and Japan. There is also a growing understanding that elections don't guarantee free expression or fair treatment of minorities.
Yet a nation's ability to call itself a democracy often buys it sympathy among voters in the West and among human-rights advocates everywhere. Elected leaders on almost every continent have, indeed, long used the forms of democracy as political wool to pull over the eyes of those abroad who would judge their legitimacy to rule.
Throughout Latin America, constitutions are routinely amended or rewritten to expand the terms and power of presidents.
In Zimbabwe, where parliamentary elections are now less than three weeks away, President Robert Mugabe has systematically attacked the opposition under the guise of a violent campaign to seize land from white farmers.
In Iran, lame-duck conservatives tried to block the newly elected reformist parliament; it was seated only with the suffrance of the Islamic republic's "supreme religious leader," who can veto such earthly procedures as elections.
In Singapore, and now Malaysia, elected Asian governments dominated by intolerant leaders have fashioned the most sophisticated, perfectly legal methods of destroying political opponents through the courts. The slow-moving prosecution on sex charges of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's once-fast-rising deputy prime minister, is a prime example.
As for the component parts of the former Soviet Union, tidy definitions of democracy are surely confounded by the criminalization of the economy and, to some extent, political life, not to mention the tenacity of Communist-era and Communist-style political bosses who see elections pretty much as nuisances.
THERE have always been imperfect democracies; the very messiness of the political form invites imperfection. The United States has had segregation, internment of Japanese-Americans and repeated episodes of local police brutality. Europeans differ on the limits of free expression and how to treat minorities. But those can be seen as shortcomings in realizing democracy's ideals, not a negation of them. A more fundamental problem arises when institutions are too weak to provide eventual remedies for such flaws -- a role often played by elected legislatures and, in America, the courts.
Arguably, a democracy strays into rogue territory when a country cannot muster any checks on the power plays of an elected leader who chooses not to step aside and rewrites the rules accordingly. A corollary is almost always oppression of some kind, often beginning with the political opposition. And the mix becomes lethal, as it did in Yugoslavia, if race, ethnicity or religion are then used to inflame political passions.
Lorne W. Craner, president of the International Republican Institute, which is supported by the Republican Party, said that in some dodgy democracies, "a lot of people have figured out you can have a bad election and get away with it." So his organization and its opposite number in Washington, the National Democratic Institute, have been thinking for years that it might be better to concentrate more on what happens between elections. European democracy groups and the Organization of African Unity are making a similar shift, he said.
"It's very frustrating when there's no other reason why countries that have poor human rights and democracy records don't get sanctioned," he said.
Susan Kaufman Purcell, president of the Americas Society in New York, classifies the governments of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Mr. Fujimori in Peru as "imperfect democracies" -- adding that often "it is a hard call where to draw the line between imperfect democracies and fake democracies." A democracy, she says, "at the very least must have some basic defining characteristics, the most important being the ability to vote an incumbent out of power through the use of a functioning electoral process that allows competition."
Bengt Save-Soderbergh, who runs a new intergovernmental organization in Stockholm called the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, says even free and fair elections don't define democracy: "Deep down it's a culture, with values and also respect, tolerance -- all these things."
At Emory University in Atlanta, Robert Pastor, an expert on Latin America who served in the Carter administration and who has advised and monitored elections as far afield as China, draws a line at downgrading the essential role of national elections. There are those who say, for example, that building in voting experience from the village up, as China and Pakistan say they are doing (and as Americans did before 1789), may be more useful than imposing periodic national elections on an inexperienced people.
"There's been an argument that says democracy is more than elections," Mr. Pastor said. "I agree with that, but not when one takes the next step and says that elections are not that important for democracy. On that I completely disagree. Democracy should be more than free elections, but it can't be less."
And then there is the problem of a different kind of rogue: The democracy whose human rights record or foreign policies fall short of international standards but don't raise eyebrows. The contrast between attitudes in America toward India and Pakistan is instructive, one that human rights organizations often point to.
The State Department's annual international human rights survey is very critical of India for its treatment of women, minorities and people declared "untouchable" by the Hindu majority. In the disputed territory of Kashmir, which is under Indian military occupation, the report found significant abuses of the local Muslim population. Moreover, American officials say that India has only narrowly escaped being placed on the list of terrorist nations for its backing of unrest in neighboring nations, including bombings and perhaps assassinations in Pakistan.
But at Human Rights Watch in New York, Kenneth Roth, the executive director, said that Americans often overlook the record because most of India's governments have been freely elected, while neighboring Pakistan gets much closer scrutiny, having lurched in and out of military rule. "India has many attributes of a democracy," said Mr. Roth. "But it's too facile to embrace India as a democracy without recognizing the flawed nature of its political system when it comes to marginal populations or perceived security threats."
Ram Narayan Kumar, an Indian human rights leader, worries about the precedent. "Around India," he said, "the lesson other countries there will learn is that you just have to appear to be democratic."
E XAMPLES matter everywhere, said John L. Hirsch, a former American ambassador to Sierra Leone who is vice president of the International Peace Academy, a research organization with close ties to the United Nations. In Africa, he said, the two countries in which to hope for continued success are Nigeria and South Africa, both of which held open elections last year.
Michael Joseph Smith, a political science professor at the University of Virginia, said that strong democracies "haven't given enough thought to maintenance and sustaining of democracy." In the case of Peru, he added, the United States could have given stronger support to the Organization of American States. Instead, the Clinton administration first endorsed, then backed away from, an unusually bold O.A.S. judgment that the election was flawed. Professor Smith and Mr. Craner said that was a bad message to send to Latin America.
"We need to mobilize the multilateral organizations to a far greater extent," Mr. Smith said. "Democracy needs constant attention."

HEADLINE: The World;
2 Elections On an Island. So Close, So Far Apart.

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
WILDA SEVERE carried the future in her mind and body as she waited to cast her ballot last month in Haiti's legislative elections. Though five months pregnant, she stood for hours on a slowly moving line, hoping that her vote would usher in a better life for her baby.
"I want the conditions of the country to change," she said. "The conditions are not good for anybody right now. People suffer and there is no work. And there is insecurity. The country is still not at peace." 
 More than five years after a United States-led military occupation restored democratic rule in Haiti, the civil serenity that she and many Haitians hoped for remains elusive. In the weeks before the elections, politically motivated violence had left 15 people dead, and in the slums the sense of poverty only deepened.
When the last American troops left Haiti this year, some policy makers saw it as the end of a successful mission to restore democracy. But the fact that the elections (in which former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's party did well) found so many Haitians still pining for peace and progress belies any boast. It raises questions about why Haiti seems to stagger from crisis to crisis as it tries to embark on the path to democracy.
Part of an answer lies just a short flight away in the Dominican Republic -- a nation that shares not just the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, but also a history of dictatorship, violence and American intervention. It too has had an election in the last month.
But there, just over the border, the economy is expanding rapidly. New roads, modernized government agencies and investment have transformed the capital. Though many of the poorest Dominicans felt excluded from the boom times, they peacefully voiced their dissatisfaction at the polls, where a near majority elected Hipolito Mejia president on May 16. And then the ruling party abandoned its quest for a runoff and conceded defeat for the good of the country.
Like the border that separates the two countries -- where the lush green landscape of the Dominican Republic gives way to the barren, deforested soil of Haiti -- the contrast in political and social fortunes is sharp. Considering that Haiti was once the more prosperous and cosmopolitan of the two countries, and that the violence of Gen. Rafael Trujillo's dictatorship in the Dominican Republic 35 years ago ago rivaled if not exceeded that of the Duvalier family here, why do the two nations seem headed in opposite directions?
"A big part of the answer can be summed up in two words: 30 years," said Michele Wucker, author of "Why The Cocks Fight," a book exploring the relationship between the two nations. "Haiti is now where the Dominican Republic was not too long after the United States invasion in 1965."
Even within the shared experience of military intervention, however, there are differences. After the 1965 intervention, when Joaquin Balaguer came to power and ushered in years of repressive rule, the United States essentially kept a hands-off policy in the Dominican Republic, Ms. Wucker said. In Haiti, the United States restored President Aristide to power in 1994, but placed narrow constraints on the exercise of his power. Mr. Wucker said that the United States also contradicted itself, pressing for elections while cutting aid to help finance them. "They talk in pretty terms about democracy," Ms. said. "But deep down they are reluctant to let Haiti muddle its own way in that direction."
The legacy of dictatorship also played out differently. While some Dominicans still bear scars -- physical and psychological -- from Mr. Balaguer's early years, just as many recall benefiting from jobs, homes and other favors. So strong are those memories that nearly a quarter of the votes went to Mr. Balaguer, even though he is 93, blind and infirm. In Haiti, the experience of a former president running again is relatively rare, since most have gone into exile after enriching themselves. "They had Balaguer, we had Duvalier, but the histories are very different," said Raoul Denis, a record store owner in Port-au-Prince. "On our side, Duvalier destroyed the institutions and everything."
Those institutions, like the courts and the police, still struggle to maintain a semblance of law and order in Haiti. At the same time, other forces that could help bring pressure to bear lack sufficient experience to prove effective. In the Dominican Republic, public-interest advocates have played an important role in calling for clean elections and good government. Business owners, aware that tourists and factory jobs can flee unless there is social and political stability, also had a stake in the future and supported it with investment.
"Our problem is we in Haiti do not have an authentic bourgeoisie that has invested in Haiti," said Patrick Pierre-Louis, a law school professor. "All their money goes to the United States."
Dominican business leaders were a major force for their country's stability, said a diplomat who has worked there and in Haiti. When the United States worried about elections in the mid-1990's, such leaders were vulnerable to friendly pressure, since business owners wanted trade parity with the United States.
"In Haiti there isn't much tourism," said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The assembly sector is still not large. They weathered the embargo and other bad situations. I'm not sure the levers we had in the Dominican Republic could work here."
While Haiti's elections are the first step toward achieving a normal government, bigger obstacles remain in a country where winner-take-all has been a rule applied literally by victorious candidates. Haiti's political leaders have yet to understand that the power of the vote extends beyond election day.
"Dominican interests are the interests of their country," said Georges Sassine, a factory owner active in civic groups. "Here, you have people who come here, get rich and leave. We are still a colony of ourselves."

HEADLINE: RECKONINGS;
Green Cheese Rules

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Argentina is a faraway country about which most people in the United States know only what they learned from Andrew Lloyd Webber. And while the government of Fernando de la Rua is facing serious economic problems -- a weak recovery from last year's nasty slump, growing labor unrest -- "crisis" would be far too strong a word.
Yet Argentina has special symbolic importance in the battle among economic ideologies. The Latin nation has been a sort of poster child for the anti-Keynesian counterrevolution, for those who want to banish discretion and human fallibility from monetary policy. The nation's current difficulties won't cause the true believers to lose faith. But the contrast between the bad economic news in Argentina and good news elsewhere in Latin America is a reminder that green cheese has its virtues after all. 
 Puzzled? Let me explain. Until the 1930's, recessions were generally regarded as inevitable, and perhaps even desirable -- a sort of purging process that cleansed the economy after the excesses of the preceding boom. The government's job was to provide sound money and balance its own budget; a depressed economy would heal itself.
But in the face of mass unemployment some economists -- most notably the British theorist John Maynard Keynes -- concluded that recessions were neither healthy nor inevitable. They were, instead, an economic pathology that resulted when too many people tried to hoard cash instead of buying real goods and services. In a famous passage Keynes declared that "Unemployment develops . . . because people want the moon: men cannot be employed when the object of desire (i.e. money) is something which cannot be produced and the demand for which cannot readily be choked off." And he offered an answer: "There is no remedy but to persuade the public that green cheese is practically the same thing and to have a green cheese factory (i.e. central bank) under public control." In other words, the government could and should print money to stimulate a depressed economy.
For hard-money types this was and remains anathema. The dream of going back to an objective monetary standard -- preferably gold, but anyway something untouched by human hands -- has been kept alive by a small but well-financed group of enthusiasts. And in 1991 they got their wish: Argentina, desperate to regain credibility after decades of irresponsible policy, not only pegged its peso to the dollar but backed each peso with a dollar in reserves. In effect, the national green cheese factory was shut down.
In the years that followed, Argentina -- helped not only by the end of hyperinflation but also by the removal of many controls that had strangled business -- experienced an economic surge, and the hard-money enthusiasts took full credit. Only last year, as the currency of neighboring Brazil tumbled, an op-ed writer at The Wall Street Journal held up Argentina as a model: "No stimulating of the economy through inflation, no improving the 'competitiveness' of exports through currency devaluation. Just money that works." And she went on to express her ultimate wish: "Now if only America could make the dollar as good as gold."
But while Argentina's money may work, many Argentines don't, because they can't find jobs. The devaluation in Brazil was followed by a flight of manufacturing to Argentina's suddenly lower-cost neighbor. Although Argentina's government has insisted that slashing spending and raising taxes to balance the budget will promote recovery by restoring confidence, the actual effect -- as Keynes could have told you -- has been the opposite: with lower incomes, consumers are spending less, and recovery has been delayed.
And meanwhile Brazil has bounced back: that devaluation has turned out to be just what the doctor ordered. Chile and Mexico, with their floating exchange rates, are doing well. Right now Argentina has the worst, not the best, of Latin America's major economies.
I'm not saying that Mr. de la Rua should devalue the peso. Too many loans, even from one Argentine to another, are in dollars -- and anyway the political cost would be catastrophic. At least for the time being, I fear that Argentina is stuck. But its travails are a lesson for the rest of us, especially those who are nostalgic for the certainties of the gold standard: Keynes was right. Taken in moderation, green cheese can be good for your health.

HEADLINE: Race in America

 BODY:
A generation ago, after riots in several major cities, the Kerner Commission warned that the United States was in danger of becoming two nations, one black and one white. That has not happened. America is now an inescapably multiracial society from which there is no turning back for whites or blacks -- in its schools, its workplaces, its churches, its military and its cultural institutions. Yet divisions and frustrations persist on both sides, in minds and hearts if not in the laws of the land.
For various reasons, however, most Americans, especially white Americans, do not like to share their personal feelings on race. In 1997, President Clinton proposed a national "conversation" about race. A committee was appointed and town meetings were duly organized across the country. Most of those who showed up were civic activists interested in public policy. Almost no one dared to discuss private attitudes, a more subtle and potentially divisive subject. Yet these attitudes lie at the heart of the racial question because it is attitudes and feelings that determine how we actually interact with one another, and whether we get along. 
 Partly with that in mind, the editors of The New York Times's news department decided over a year ago to investigate the state of race relations in the United States, not with an eye to providing analysis or policy solutions, but simply to report in detail on the actual interplay of whites and blacks on a daily basis. The result was a series of a dozen or so articles that will be published over the next six weeks. The reporters who wrote these pieces spent as much as a year on their projects, returning again and again to the people who eventually came to inhabit their narratives, learning a bit more each time about their fears and frustrations and hopes.
In nearly every case, African-Americans were far more willing to talk about race, in large part because they have endured America's long history of discrimination and live with its consequences every single day. Yet in the end whites began to open up as well, sharing their thoughts about a subject that many would just as soon avoid and others do not think about at all. The fact that whites and blacks, as well as Latinos and Asian-Americans, were eventually able to address painful issues with great candor is one of the series' great reportorial accomplishments.
The first article appears today. It examines what happens in a Pentecostal church in Georgia when blacks begin to join an all-white congregation. In broadest terms, the piece is an examination of the struggle of two races to coexist in a world neither wants to leave, of the compromises accepted by both sides, of the narrowness of some parishioners and the bigheartedness of others. The struggle to coexist, in fact, defines most of the pieces in this series.
An article later this week, for example, will explore the daily tensions among white and black soldiers in the United States Army, an institution where the work force is fully and officially integrated and where racial resentments are usually thought to be a thing of the past. Another details the extraordinarily complex, painfully edgy relationship between the black producer and white writer who together created HBO's extraordinary documentary on Baltimore's drug culture.
In some cases there is evidence of progress, moments of growth and reconciliation, small epiphanies when one side comes to understand the motivations of the other and both come to understand that they need each other. In others, the divisions seem too great to bridge. The lifelong friendship between two Cubans, one white, the other black, loses its intimacy under the centrifugal strains of racial isolation in their adopted home of Miami. Whites, blacks, Mexicans and American Indians competing for rock-bottom wages on the factory floor simply cannot connect when racial animosities are sharpened by economic fears. White and black boys and girls, fast friends in a suburban elementary school, are tugged apart by seemingly irresistible cultural and academic forces by the time they begin high school.
Whether they chronicle success, failure or just plain inertia, these are stories that report race relations as they actually exist on a human scale in America. In a way, without deliberately trying to, the people who populate these stories provide the uncomfortably candid conversation about race that Mr. Clinton sought but never got. The stories hardly depict a perfect world, but they do depict a country in which citizens bring strong feelings, deep thought and, in a heartening number of cases, resilient spirits to one of the abiding issues of American life.

Fed's Moves Brighten The Outlook For Equities

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
REMEMBER the Goldilocks economy? The not too hot, not too cold, low inflation porridge beloved by Alan Greenspan and financial markets?
Although it's too early to say for sure, the latest numbers seem to indicate that what had been a steaming dish is beginning to cool. But there is little reason, at this point, to suspect it will turn stone cold. 
 Last week, purchasing managers said the manufacturing sector expanded in May, but not as fast as previously. And the government said the private sector actually shed some jobs last month, but not too many.
This sort of stuff is music to investors. The Nasdaq had its best week ever, rising more than 19 percent. The Dow and the S.& P. 500 also moved up briskly.
Christine Callies, chief United States market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, took some time last week to talk about the economy and the stock market as spring begins to molt into summer. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. The data suggests that the Fed's interest rate increases are beginning to slow the economy. Is that how you read these numbers?
 
A. We think economic growth is plateauing, and will gradually slow down over the next several quarters. But there is a lot of natural volatility in reports like retail sales and in housing data, and activity there is not weak. By the end of the summer, we will get more conclusive evidence that the Fed tightening is having an effect.
Recently, the stock market has assumed a bigger slowdown than is coming, a slowdown that will cause the Fed to ease. But we may be waiting for a while before we know for sure that the Fed has moved to neutral. I don't think we will know the Fed has reached that point until sometime next year.
 
Q. So you think the Fed hasn't yet finished tightening?
 
A. We see two more tightenings of one-quarter percentage point apiece, the first later this month and another in August. Then we think the Fed will be on hold. The Fed is trying to slow the U.S. economy to what is still a healthy growth rate against the backdrop of the first synchronized global expansion that we have seen in a dozen years.
The fact that every region of the world is in a reasonably healthy recovery mode will place some demand on the supply of goods and services.
The Fed is therefore operating in a situation where global growth is reinforcing itself. That will put a floor under global inflation, albeit at a low level.
We maintain this is potentially good news, because if the Fed is in a gradualist monetary mode that means it might tolerate a little inflation without going overboard.
 
Q. What does this mean for stocks?
 
A. All in all, this is a fairly benign environment for equity prices. We think the market is in a trading range, and will tread water until price/earnings multiples get down to the point where there is a little bit of headroom. We are almost there.
 
Q. How much cheaper does the market have to get? And what sort of a trading range are you talking about?
 
A. In order to support a major rally, we need to see multiples down another 10 percent or so. But that doesn't mean prices have to fall. If they stay at these levels, profits will catch up over the next couple of quarters. Trading range corrections are a substitute for faster, steeper corrections, where prices fall by 25 percent or so.
On the upside, the S.& P. 500 could go as high as 1,540 to 1,550 and the Nasdaq composite could go back to 4,000 or 4,100 and still not change the sideways trend.
 
Q. What are the risks to this forecast on the upside, and on the downside?
 
A. Bull markets need liquidity in the form of excess money. In order for the market to break out of the trading range on the upside, we would need to see a very substantial increase in liquidity, and we would need to see it over the next month or so.
On the downside, a major correction in the S.& P. 500 could only occur as a result of a major accident. And the economy, monetary, financial market and foreign exchange risks of this occurring are probably as low as they have been in many years. The one residual weak point in this scenario is that margin debt was not totally neutralized in the April correction. But in all, the environment is remarkably benign.
 
Q. It has been widely noted that while valuations in the aggregate are high, big chunks of the stock market are cheap, and have been for some time. Do you agree?
 
A. There are pieces of many sectors that look quite good.
The central concept is to identify companies that deliver growth at a moderate price. That is in contrast to last year, when the trick was to find the fastest-growing companies and buy them, because someone else would come in afterwards and pay more. You can find a lot of the companies I am talking about now in the capital goods area.
A lot of electrical equipment companies are developing new-economy growth rates and are trading at old-economy prices.
Three names we like are SCI Systems, Sanmina and General Electric, which is not overpriced relative to the top-line growth it is generating.

HEADLINE: The World;
Autocrat? Democrat? Well, Both.

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
THE year was 1991. Alberto Fujimori was Peru's newly elected president, and diplomats were rejoicing that every government in Latin America except Cuba's was now democratically elected. So President Fujimori joined the leaders of Peru's four Andean neighbors in proposing a radical plan: the Organization of American States would require all 34 member states to sever diplomatic relations with any government that took power unconstitutionally.
Nine years later, Mr. Fujimori must be happy his plan was never adopted. This week, the Organization of American States is to consider how to punish Mr. Fujimori for claiming a third five-year term after an election last Sunday that was tainted by dirty tricks and re-interpretation of the constitution, which limits Peru's presidents to two terms. His opponent, Alejandro Toledo, wound up boycotting the vote. 
 Still, Peru is probably safe from any drastic measures, in large part because the Clinton Administration is reluctant to punish a strong ally in the war against drugs and because Peru is not alone among its peers in slipping back into old authoritarian patterns.
The current president of Ecuador, a civilian, came to power in January by military coup. The elected president of Venezuela is a former military coup leader who has made all-out war on the Congress and the courts. Paraguay's civilian government is teetering.
Does this turn of events mean the man on horseback is coming back in Latin America? Or is it that Latin America never completely unsaddled him?
In fact, authoritarianism and democracy have long coexisted in Latin America, and a swing toward elections has never meant autocracy is dead. A pattern of generals replacing civilian presidents only to be replaced again by generals has been the rule from Panama to Argentina for the better part of a century. A variant on the theme, in places like Peru and Mexico, is a civilian leader who is elected and then rules by fiat, fraud or manipulation of the courts and congress.
"The box on the outside is labeled a democracy," said Piero Gleijeses, a professor of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins University, "but inside you have an authoritarian system." A history of oligarchy, class division and racial conflict makes it hard to establish the social compacts on which liberal democracy is most often built.
Mr. Fujimori is not so much a model of a new kind of authoritarianism as an exemplar of something older. "Our military regimes were never that tough and our elected governments were never that democratic," said Carlos Tapia, a former Peruvian congressman and social critic. "Our coups were never initiated by the military alone. There was always a group of civilians ready to manipulate the military to jump in."
The model for the civilian strongman in Peru goes back at least to the 1919 election of Augusto B. Leguia, a businessman with a taste for top hats and thoroughbred horses, who served until a coup upended his rule in 1930. Like Mr. Fujimori, Mr. Leguia was a master builder of roads and ports who eagerly sought foreign investment. He also displayed little compunction about breaking democratic rules. He ordered the army to shut down the Congress, he closed down newspapers that opposed him, and his race horses had remarkable success at the track as soon as he took office.
As for governing Peru, neither the military nor the civilian strongmen have a stellar record. Most recently, the military regimes that ruled from 1968 to 1980 pushed through a radical land reform. But it ultimately failed, leading to a slump in agriculture and a chaotic peasant migration to the cities that created shantytowns that are still spreading. It did little for public confidence in military efficiency.
When civilians returned to power in 1980 the people were overjoyed. But the next 10 years were marked by hyperinflation, massive corruption and the eruption of terrorist violence. This ultimately discredited all the traditional political parties, leaving the public in despair about their hopes for order.
Finally the people turned to Mr. Fujimori, the ultimate outsider, a son of Japanese immigrants who belonged to no party and promised a clean break with the past. His popularity soared when he disbanded the Supreme Court and Congress in 1992, claiming that their corrupt ways were blocking his battle against terrorists including the Shining Path group -- whose leaders he then captured. In 1995, he won re-election in a landslide; it amounted to a democratic affirmation of authoritarianism and left advocates of democracy worried.
"A full democracy means more than elections," noted Carlos Ivan Degregori, an anthropologist at the Institute of Peruvian Studies. "It requires sturdy institutions: strong political parties, an independent judiciary and a Congress willing to vote against the executive branch." Most often, he said, "the boundary between democracy and authoritarianism is not so clear."
This is particularly true in the region's poorest countries, like neighboring Bolivia, where the democratically elected president is a former military dictator. But it is also true in Latin America's more economically and politically developed countries.
Chile is still governed under a constitution that was written when Augusto Pinochet was dictator; it gives the military independent powers over selecting its commanders and even senators. The new governor of Buenos Aires province in Argentina, when faced with a rising crime problem, selected as his police chief a former army colonel who had led a 1987 uprising to block trials against former junta leaders.
"Whichever way the pendulum swings," said Felipe Noguera, an Argentine political consultant, "it's not like the people overnight become perfect democrats and the next day become supporters of coups. People in this region are aware of both the weaknesses of democracy and the perils of authoritarian rule."
That may explain why in the days leading up to last Sunday's election, opinion polls showed that even though a majority of Peruvians said they thought the election process was tainted, they would vote for Mr. Fujimori.

Even a Worm Needs Love

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
LAST month a hyperactive computer program bearing the message "I Love You" ricocheted around the world's e-mail systems in less than 24 hours and infected tens of millions of computers.
The "I Love You" bug, allegedly launched by a computer student in the Philippines with too much time on his hands, touched off a cyber-flu season. More than 29 variants have emerged so far, including diabolical derivatives with names like "NewLove" and "Resume -- Janet Simons." Most of the mutants arrived without tidings of love, and some instead carried a software payload designed to erase victims' disks once the message's attachment was opened. 
 While "I Love You" was startlingly swift and effective, most of its imitators went almost nowhere. According to some computer security experts, the copycat cyberplagues should have spread just as rapidly as the worm (in computer entomology, worms propel themselves while viruses hitchhike on other documents) they were mimicking.
The question is, what's love got to do with it?
Quite a lot, perhaps.
Computer experts looking at the different contagion rates are divided about whether Internet users learned a hard lesson in computer hygiene or whether the world is actually a lonelier place than anyone realized.
"I've been told that men were much more likely to open the 'I Love You' worm than women," said George Cybenko, a computer scientist at Dartmouth University and a founder of the Institute of Security Technology Studies.
Indeed, the "I Love You" message was so simple and beguiling that in some cases it hoodwinked even the most sophisticated computer programmers.
Steven Capps, a senior Microsoft software designer, padded downstairs at 5 a.m. on the morning of the "I Love You" infection, poured himself a cup of coffee and sat down at his computer to read his e-mail. It happened to be his birthday, so as he scanned his mailbox he thought he saw a love note from his wife.
After opening the program Mr. Capps quickly realized his error and managed to delete the bug before it spread widely. "What I remember thinking was, "How did Marie manage to sneak downstairs late at night to send me a birthday note?" he said sheepishly.
Mr. Capps was not alone. Hewlett-Packard & Company acknowledged last week that its computers suffered more than 700,000 infections from the "I Love You" worm -- more than 500,000 in the United States.
The total damage -- primarily time spent restoring files and cleaning out clogged e-mail systems -- may reach $950 million, according to ICSA.net, a computer security company that tracks the cost of computer infections.
Two weeks ago, the far more lethal "NewLove" bug began infecting the address books of users of the popular Microsoft Outlook e-mail program, sending itself to every person on the list. But instead of delivering the endearingly named document LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS, NewLove cloaked itself by snatching a recent document name from its victim's hard disk and using that name in the subject line of all subsequent messages sent from the address list, destroying data on the hard drives of affected computers.
Last week, the "Resume" bug urged e-mail recipients to look at a job seeker's fabulous curriculum vitae, helpfully included as an attachment -- which, of course served as an electronic Trojan Horse.
Despite their cleverness, however, both "NewLove" and "Resume" were stopped in their tracks. "If 'NewLove' had come before 'I Love You' it would have spread more slowly but we would have had a bigger disaster," said Peter Tippett, chief technology officer of ICSA.
Mr. Tippett, who was trained as an epidemiologist before starting an antivirus software company in the 1980's, has long argued that computer viruses and infections closely mimic the biological world.
THAT might be another reason why the lethal "NewLove" was less effective than "I Love You." In the real world as well as in cyberspace, diseases that kill their hosts quickly tend to have limited success in spreading through large populations. "Viruses that kill their hosts never make it," Mr. Tippett said.
Whether it's the Darwinian imperative or the irresistible power of love at work, experts believe the current cyber-flu season will not be the last, especially as the millions of PC's of the 1990's are transformed into billions of cell phones, personal digital assistants and even toaster-connected Internet appliances by the end of the decade.
For each new device connected to the Internet there are dozens of new ways to spread infection. Even now, computer security experts are warning that the growing popularity of music and file-sharing programs like Napster, Gnutella, iMesh and Scour Exchange will virtually insure new vectors for diseases.
That will mean that disease in the cyberworld will become as routine as cold season is today.
"That's what concerns me," said Kevin Kelly, author of "Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems and the Economic World" (Addison Wesley, 1994). "These new systems leave us completely open to these infections and we may just have to learn to live with them."

HEADLINE: Can Craig McCaw Keep His Vision Of Teledesic From Crashing?

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: KIRKLAND, Wash.

 BODY:
IT'S time for the latest installment of "Who Wants to Second-Guess a Billionaire?" In today's episode, Craig O. McCaw, the publicity-shy cable television and telecommunications entrepreneur with a fabled knack for anticipating the future, hits quicksand in his pursuit of a high-risk dream.
Mr. McCaw's investments include a maze of advanced wired and wireless services. But none presents a more formidable puzzle than Teledesic, his futuristic scheme to dot the heavens with a 288-satellite network for voice and data communications. 
 To most satellite experts, Teledesic's prospects have always seemed uncertain. But the outlook for attracting investors would appear to be considerably gloomier now that the spectacular bankruptcy of the Iridium phone system, problems in several other satellite ventures and the relentless advances of land-based competitors have confirmed Wall Street's worst fears about how tough it is to build a successful satellite business.
Teledesic is already scaled back from the mind-boggling 840-satellite system Mr. McCaw first announced in 1994 and the start of service has been delayed from 2001 to 2005. Still, the venture Mr. McCaw has referred to as "an Internet in the sky" remains by far the most ambitious commercial project in space.
Just last month, Mr. McCaw and his backers put up $1.2 billion to take control of bankrupt ICO Global Communications, a smaller satellite venture. But that hardly made the outlook any clearer. ICO could, as Mr. McCaw contends, be a steppingstone to Teledesic. Some experts, however, predict it will become the rationale for scaling back Teledesic into a more marketable venture.
For now though, Teledesic continues to grandly promise nothing less than a full array of high-speed video, data, and voice services to the vast portions of the planet beyond the reach of today's ground-based wired and wireless networks.
"He's thinking of tens of millions of customers for satellites," said Samuel A. Farrer Jr., a Reston, Va.-based satellite expert. "No one else is talking those numbers."
Perhaps no one else would dare to. In an age of singular entrepreneurs who have achieved unfathomable wealth by leading the charge into the Information Age, the 50-year-old Mr. McCaw has been among the boldest, repeatedly going deeply into debt to buy licenses and communications properties that soared in value as he improved them and new technology spread.
Associates say they have often talked of the need to be "90 percent" certain before embarking on a new investment or strategy. "But Craig's feeling of 90 percent was often Craig alone," said Wayne Perry, who was a young Seattle attorney helping an equally youthful Mr. McCaw buy cable television companies when he went to work full time for him in 1975. "It might be 40 percent to someone else."
To understand the complexity of the challenges facing Teledesic, consider the hurdles that were already in its path when Iridium collapsed last summer.
TO START with, rapidly evolving and expanding terrestrial services have been chipping away at the parts of the world for which satellites had been the only option.
Moreover, demand for satellite systems is certain to be fragmented among services already in orbit or soon to be there. Teledesic's focus is on computer users at fixed sites rather than mobile customers like ICO Global and other satellite phone companies. But those who might compete in certain segments range from international phone companies like Globalstar, a Vodafone Airtouch PLC subsidiary, and regional operators like the Asian Cellular Satellite System as well as proposed high-capacity satellite networks from consortiums led by Hughes Electronics, Alcatel and Lockheed Martin.
In addition, Teledesic's technical feasibility is still in question. The company has missed deadlines to settle specifications with Motorola, its prime contractor -- which is expected to be replaced by Hughes Space Systems, ICO's prime contractor.
The need for overseas phone companies to sell Teledesic services locally is another risk factor. "It's a mess trying to get your partners around the world working together when it's not their core business," said J. Armand Musey, who follows the industry for Banc of America Securities in New York.
But even assuming those hurdles could be completely overcome and the service launched for $10 billion, the lowest estimates around, what then? Teledesic has just two groups of potential customers that seem out of reach of the competition: computer users in remote lands and waters who will pay for the electronic equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet and users in the developed world who will pay to have a backup satellite Internet connection.
"I try to construct a business model with a $10 billion investment and I can't," said Mr. Farrer. "He clearly sees things I don't."
Preternatural far-sightedness, though, is part of Mr. McCaw's track record. "He's the billionaire whom even billionaires find interesting," said O. Casey Corr, whose biography of Mr. McCaw, "Money From Thin Air," is scheduled to be published next month by Times Books/Random House.
Mr. McCaw's admirers include Bill Gates, a childhood acquaintance and now a neighbor, who put $5 million into Teledesic in 1994 after reviewing the business plan on his honeymoon. (He has since added millions more.) Mr. Gates told Fortune magazine in 1996 that Mr. McCaw "understands the communications business and where it's going better than anyone I know."
Detractors tend to have more qualms than criticisms. "I'm not sure he's a visionary," said Michael Cleamon, a San Francisco consultant who has worked with Teledesic. "He's a gambler."
LOYALISTS say that perceptions of Mr. McCaw as an extreme risk-taker underestimate his fanatic attention to escape routes from his bets and his willingness to shift course when conditions change unexpectedly.
"He always knows where the back door is," said Robert Ratliffe, a long-time aide. "I don't know of a single time where conditions have changed so much that Craig couldn't morph his position into something useful."
And therein may be the clue to Teledesic's future. Mr. McCaw and his backers could have acquired Iridium for far less than the sum they are sinking into ICO. But ICO offered a big advantage: None of its 12 planned satellites is in the air yet, and that gives Mr. McCaw's engineers a chance to tinker with the design of both the satellites and the ground stations.
The McCaw group's stated goal when ICO goes into service in 2003 is not only to sell phone service to mobile customers, as its founders originally planned, but also to deliver email and data. The data capacity will be just an hors d'oeuvre compared to the Teledesic feast, but it will be a step in the direction Mr. McCaw wants to go.
His latest plan calls for merging the two ventures as soon as possible, generating revenue from ICO to help fund Teledesic, using ICO's connections to local phone companies around the world to market Teledesic, and tailoring Teledesic's satellite network to run traffic through ICO's ground stations, which have already been linked by a high-capacity fiber network.
Some analysts suspect, though that ICO -- even if it manages to become profitable -- will be less a steppingstone than a path of retreat for Mr. McCaw from his intentions to launch and operate a full-scale Teledesic network.
After getting ICO running, step two will be to move on to Teledesic, predicts Roger Rusch of Telastra, a consulting firm in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., that advised bondholders in the ICO bankruptcy. "But step three," he said, "will be to cancel step two."
History suggests, though, that Mr. McCaw will not abandon his grand vision simply because everyone around him sees that as the sensible option. Many of his decisions have been described as intuitive, an attribute Mr. McCaw himself has often ascribed to his severe dyslexia. Unable to digest long documents, he has become a master at sizing up the interests of those he is dealing with and staying focused on fundamental questions, like how potential customers will perceive a new service.
When his intuitions harden into conviction, associates say, even his most trusted advisers cannot budge him.
One such occasion was Mr. McCaw's decision to acquire control of Nextel in 1995, according to Tim Donahue, a longtime McCaw executive who is now chief executive of Nextel, the digital wireless carrier based in Reston, Va.
UNLIKE other cellular phone systems, Nextel grew out of the radio dispatch sector and can easily tie many users into a single conversation. Five years ago, though, Nextel was burdened by debt and by the poor quality of its two-way radio equipment from Motorola, losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually and searching for billions to build out service in the cities where it had licenses.
Mr. McCaw plunged in anyway, relying in part on Motorola's commitment to improve the system if he became involved. By 1999, Nextel's customer base had more than doubled, its stock was up 600 percent, it was branching out into foreign markets and Microsoft had decided to invest $600 million to develop Nextel Online, an Internet service for Nextel customers. Today, Mr. McCaw and his fellow investors were sitting on a $3.4 billion gain on their investment.
"He loves big problems with big opportunities," said Peter Currie, a senior executive with McCaw Cellular Communications during Teledesic's formative days.
Even Mr. McCaw's charitable interests have a way of escalating into grand schemes. His effort to return Keiko, the killer whale featured in the movie "Free Willy," to the wild has become a multi-million-dollar project to vastly extend knowledge about the lives of the orcas of the North Atlantic where Keiko, then about 2, was captured in 1979.
Mr. McCaw's career began prematurely, in tragedy. The second of four sons of J. Elroy and Marion McCaw, a socially prominent and wealthy Seattle couple, it was Craig who, on a visit home from Stanford University, discovered his father dead from a stroke. Although only 19 years old at the time, Craig had been the son most interested in the family's financial affairs, including a small cable television business where he worked during the summer, and he was quickly accepted as the primary manager of the family's interests going forward.
Sorting out Elroy's estate was no simple task. The elder McCaw had been an avid dealmaker and borrower who loathed documentation and paid little attention to the actual operations of the businesses he owned. But Craig quickly set about expanding the family's cable investments as soon as the legal clouds lifted.
In 1974, Mr. McCaw began adding paging businesses to the portfolio. Seven years later, when the Federal Communications Commission licensed the first cellular phone companies, he was an active bidder.
MR. McCaw prided himself on beating industry service standards. Unlike his father, he concluded early on that happy customers produce more revenue, which helps support more rapid expansion. But he became best known for his willingness to borrow what seemed like astronomical sums to bid aggressively for new properties, confident that they would grow rapidly enough to cover his soaring debts. He was sure that latecomers to the cellular business would pay far higher prices.
Eventually, Mr. McCaw focused on building a nationwide network of cellular phone licenses, in the belief that customers would be attracted to any service that allowed them to roam freely at a reasonable cost with a minimum of trouble. The value of such freedom seemed obvious to a man who preferred flying, kayaking, sailing and camping in remote regions of western Canada to working in his office. (Water pistol wars tend to erupt when Mr. McCaw is stuck at work too long, according to Mr. Ratliffe.)
To build up a war chest for the increasingly expensive battles for cellular territories, he unsentimentally sold his family's cable television business for $755 million in 1986 and, with the help of Michael Milken, became a major issuer of high-yield bonds.
His reputation for making risks pay off was established by the wealth generated in cable television. It exploded into the realm of business legend when he sold McCaw Cellular to AT&T for $11.5 billion in 1996.
"He is like a great painter," said Steven Rattner, who as an investment banker at Lazard Freres was involved in many of Mr. McCaw's dealings. "He doesn't paint the same thing twice, but you can see similarities in the brush strokes."
Mr. McCaw's satellite plans provide the most obvious test of such skills, but they are hardly Mr. McCaw's only concern at the moment. Through Eagle River Inc., an investment firm based in this Seattle suburb, he has controlling interests in both Nexteland Nextlink, which provides businesses with high-capacity telecommunications and Internet services in the United States and Europe. In February, Mr. McCaw gathered $470 million to fund the expansion of Nextel's network into secondary and rural markets by spinning off Nextel Partners Inc. in a public offering; the 40 percent stake controlled by McCaw through Eagle River or Nextel is currently worth almost $1.9 billion.
Mr. McCaw has said there is no grand plan to link his telecommunications empire together, but associates like Mr. Donahue, Mr. Perry, and Dan Akerson, chief executive of Nextlink, look for ways the various companies can work with each other. Nextel uses Nextlink networks, and Mr. Perry foresees both companies promoting Teledesic's capacity as a backup service for their business customers.
Mr. McCaw acknowledged that the companies could end up competing against each other in some areas. "Our dream, however, is to find ways to make competitive situations more synergistic," he said.
Not that Mr. McCaw would announce a grand plan unless forced by some business need. Teledesic came to light when the company had to file a petition for radio spectrum with the Federal Communications Commission. Those in his inner circle say he is open with them, but often difficult to read. Russell Daggett, vice chairman of Teledesic, says associates have to "connect the dots" of McCaw commentary to come up with executable plans, and Dennis Weibling, president of Eagle River and a close financial adviser since 1982, says that Mr. McCaw's good ideas come interspersed with "things that will make you bankrupt."
These days, Mr. McCaw is so wealthy that he has a greater margin of error than early in his career. After remarrying in 1998 following a bitter divorce in 1997, then becoming a father for the first time, he also has less of his life wrapped up in making his business bets pay off. Where he once kept his aircraft, yachts and other toys deployed to make business and vacations as convenient as possible, he now juggles them to support family life, although not always with the same success.
"No amount of infrastructure can keep you on schedule with kids," he recently told a bemused Mr. Ratliffe.
BUT Mr. McCaw remains fascinated by the satellite opportunity and is unlikely to retreat drastically anytime soon. His interest began in 1986, when he explored putting satellites in orbit above the Indian and western Pacific oceans to serve Asia.
It was rekindled in 1990 when Ed Tuck, a pioneer in using satellites to pinpoint the location of boaters, hikers and others with handheld transmitters, suggested using satellites in low-earth orbits for a global phone system that would not suffer the disruptive delays that plagued calls using geo-stationary satellites in high orbits.
In Mr. McCaw's hands, the vision expanded to encompass a variety of computer applications that could benefit from eliminating that signal lag, known as latency. The devil was in the details: No one could see how Teledesic could afford, much less control, the 840 satellites in the original plan, which would be constantly shifting their positions in relation to the earth's surface. Beyond that, no one had ever secured permission from regulators around the world to use the broad swath of high-frequency radio spectrum Teledesic wanted for such communications.
Mr. McCaw handed the challenge to Mr. Daggett, a lawyer by training, and has yet to look back. Today, Teledesic has its regulatory approvals. It also has big name investors like Boeing ($100 million), Motorola ($750 million, including assets from Celestri, a planned network that was folded into Teledesic), and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia ($200 million).
Teledesic's new headquarters in Bellevue, Wash., presents a thrifty facade: it is the back half of a warehouse abutting a railroad line in an industrial section of town. But inside is a confidently over-budget mixture of cool and whimsy, complete with an on-site coffee bar.
Before the ICO deal, the apparent prosperity could not quell reports that Teledesic's progress had stalled. Indeed, if anyone but Mr. McCaw had been involved, Teledesic would probably have been dismissed long ago.
"But McCaw is someone you never bet against," said Mr. Musey.

Chart: "Evolving Vision"
Like many of Craig O. McCaw's businesses, his Teledesic satellite venture has gone through fundamental transformations.
 
1988 -- Venture capitalist Ed Tuck envisions a global satellite phone system. Two years later, McCaw teams with Tuck, expanding the vision to include high-capacity data services.
 
1994 -- The venture, now named Teledesic, is publicly disclosed. It calls for 840 satellites orbiting 435 miles above the Earth, plus 80 spares.
 
1997 -- Boeing is named prime contractor and announces it will invest up to $100 million in Teledesic. Satellite count is reduced to 288, at about 800 miles above the Earth.
 
1998 -- Motorola, investing $750 million, folds its proposed Celestri satellite network into Teledesic and takes over as prime contractor.
 
May 2000 -- McCaw-led investors gain control of ICO Global Communications, aiming to make its 12-satellite mobile phone system a stepping stone to Teledesic. (pg. 6)
 
Chart: "Risk Taker's Record"
Over the last 30 years, Craig O. McCaw has built a succession of businesses, all linked in some way to communications. His pattern has been to go deeply into debt to buy and develop undervalued assets, then cash out after their market value has soared to pursue other growth opportunities.
 
McCAW'S JOURNEY
 
CABLE -- When his father dies in 1969, McCaw, at age 19, becomes manager of the family's cable business. In 1986, he sells the vastly expanded holdings for $755 million.
 
PAGING -- In 1974, McCaw acquires the family's first paging licenses.
 
CELLULAR -- In 1980, forms Northwest Mobile Telephone to bid for cellular telephone licenses. In 1994, McCaw Cellular is sold to AT&T for $11.5 billion.
 
In 1995, gains control of Nextel, a digital cellular system, with a $315 million initial investment.
 
SATELLITE -- In 1990, forms Calling Communications, predecessor to Teledesic; gains control of ICO Global in 2000.
 
WIRED NETWORKS -- In 1994, creates Fiberlink to invest in fiber-optic networks. In 1997, Fiberlink, now named Nextlink, goes public.

Chart: "The Circle Game"
There are two basic approaches to using satellites in telecommunications systems -- low-Earth orbit, as planned by Teledesic, and geostationary orbit. Here is how they compare:
 
Geostationary Orbit
 
ALTITUDE -- 22,000 miles above the equator.
 
POSITION -- Orbit is synchronized with the Earth's rotation, so satellites maintain fixed positions in relation to ground stations.
 
ADVANTAGE -- Relatively easy to manage.
 
PRIMARY COMMERCIAL USE -- Broadcasting
 
COMPANIES -- Hughes Electronics, PanAmSat, Intelsat, Lockheed Martin
 
Low-Earth Orbit
 
ALTITUDE -- Within a few thousand miles of the Earth.
 
POSITION -- Constantly shifting, requiring more satellites to ensure uninterrupted service.
 
ADVANTAGE -- Because the satellites are closer to Earth, there is no delay in communications, so systems can be used for real-time applications like videoconferencing or telephone calls.
 
Low capacity
PRIMARY USE: Paging
COMPANIES: Orbcomm, Vita (Volunteers in Technical Assistance)
 
Medium capacity
PRIMARY USE: Cellular phone service
COMPANIES: ICO Global, Iridium, Globalstar
 
High capacity
PRIMARY USE: Full Internet service
COMPANIES: Teledesic, Skybridge (Alcatel)(pg. 7)

HEADLINE: Donald W. Davies, 75, Dies; Helped Refine Data Networks

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Donald W. Davies, who proposed a method for transmitting data that made the Internet possible, died Sunday at a hospice in Esher, England. He was 75 and had been suffering from cancer, according to a spokesman for the British National Physical Laboratory.
Mr. Davies was a computer security expert and team leader of a group that created one of the first computer programs to translate Russian scientific papers to English, but the work for which he was most noted grew out of concerns that conventional telephone networks were poorly suited for carrying huge amounts of data in short bursts, the ideal for computers. 
 Mr. Davies suggested in 1965 that Britain develop a network that would allow data to follow a variety of pathways. To make the network efficient, the data would be broken into small packets, each carrying a code indicating where it came from and where it was supposed to end up so that a complete document could be compiled at the receiving computer.
Packets would wend through the network on the fastest available route. If any packets were lost because of breaks in the network, only those packets would have to be sent again. He called the concept packet switching.
The concept was similar to an approach advocated by Paul Baran of the RAND Corporation, a research concern in Santa Monica, Calif. Mr. Baran's goal was to devise a system for the United States government that would be less vulnerable to a nuclear attack.
But Mr. Baran's concepts went nowhere until Roger Scantlebury, a member of Mr. Davies's development team, described the British packet switching in a talk in 1967 in Gatlinburg, Tenn., to American computer experts. Mr. Davies's ideas caught the attention of Lawrence Roberts, program director for the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Mr. Roberts had been looking for a way to improve communications among the many laboratories and universities working on research financed by the agency.
Mr. Davies was able to build a demonstration packet-switching network within the National Physical Laboratory by 1969, but the power of his ideas was more fully displayed in the United States where Mr. Roberts melded them with work by Mr. Baran and others to create Arpanet, the forerunner of today's Internet.
Donald Watts Davies was born June 7, 1924, in Treorchy, Wales, just months before the death of his father, John, a coal mine clerk. His mother, Hilda, returned to her native Portsmouth, England, to work in the post office and raise her son and his twin sister. As a teenager, he experimented with radios and read technical books on telephony.
Mr. Davies was an honors student in physics and mathematics, gaining Bachelor of Science degrees in both subjects from Imperial College in London by 1947. His academic years included a break to work for Imperial Chemical Industries and as an atomic energy researcher at Birmingham University.
His career path was set, though, shortly before graduation when he attended a lecture about the National Physical Laboratory's effort to develop a British computer. Entranced by the new technology, he joined the small development team headed by Alan Turing, the cryptography expert who had become a computing pioneer while breaking German codes during World War II.
The device the team created, the Pilot ACE, ran its first program in 1950. Mr. Davies went on to become interested in a wide variety of applications, including traffic simulators and language translation programs. Displaying a rare combination of management skills and equanimity as well as technical expertise, he rose through a series of positions at the laboratory.
"His heart was with the technical side, but he was very skillful at dealing with people," said David Yates, a longtime colleague at the laboratory.
Mr. Davies quit his administrative work in 1979 to concentrate on data security research. The group he built ended up consulting on encryption and related issues for the largest British banks and other major computer users. He continued his consulting work after retiring from the laboratory in 1984. He became a visiting professor at Royal Holloway and Bedford New College in 1987.
Mr. Davies is survived by his wife of 45 years, the former Diane Burton of Sunbury-on-Thames; two sons, Paul, of Godalming, and Michael, of Bridgeport, and a daughter, Sarah, of Kingston-on-Thames.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Troubling the Waters Of Nuclear Deterrence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR nearly half a century the cold war world's tense stability was built on a simple bit of political philosophy. Nicknamed, appropriately, MAD, for Mutual Assured Destruction, it held that the leader of a country advanced enough to build nuclear weapons would never actually use them if he was assured his nation would also be obliterated by his enemy.
Why call this a political philosophy? Because at its core, as at the core of every political philosophy from Plato to Marx, is an appraisal of human nature. MAD's view of human nature was, paradoxically, surprisingly sunny. It held that a leader, no matter how ambitious, ideological or even nutty, would never be so far gone (or allowed to be so far gone by his cohorts) as to risk the annihilation of his own people. 
 That was the heart of deterrence: America's belief that the Russians were rational and their belief that Americans were, too.
As nuclear technology proliferates, however, the nuclear equation is becoming more complicated, and a new view of deterrence is taking hold in the United States. That view was summed up by a bipartisan report last fall from a federal advisory commission studying national security in the 21st century: Threats to American security will be more diffuse, harder to anticipate and more difficult to neutralize than ever before. Deterrence will not work as it once did; in many cases it may not work at all."
Why? Because in the post cold war world, the new thinking goes, there are some countries and leaders who simply cannot be trusted to be rational about nuclear weapons.
The old line in the sand was between two ideologies, each held by people the other believed to be capable of acting sensibly. The new line is between people who can be counted on to behave like us and people who can't. Under the old thinking the best defense was the threat of an overwhelming offense. But in the new world, the new theorists suggest, the best defense in some cases is actually a defense.
George W. Bush embraced this view in a speech recently calling for a robust missile defense of the United States. And President Clinton is in Moscow this weekend to discuss the new thinking, and his own less expansive missile defense plans, with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who holds a treaty barring the United States (or Russia) from deploying a National Missile Defense (N.M.D.).
On his way to Moscow, President Clinton gave a glimpse of the new strategic view. The world, Mr. Clinton suggested during a stop in Lisbon, can be divided between "civilized nations," and "irresponsible new nuclear powers and their possible alliances with terrorists and other groups." Rest assured, Mr. Clinton said, America would share with the civilized the technology to defend against the irresponsible.
Who belongs in this second group? Mr. Clinton named neither the civilized nations nor the irresponsible ones, although there was a hint he was prepared to include Russia in the civilized category because the very phrase was one Boris Yeltsin had once used to describe a world protected by missile defenses.
But what of China, which is on the verge of modernizing and expanding its nuclear force and openly views a system defending the continental United States as a threat to that force?
The Americans say it's not China they're worried about, either, but what the Clinton administration calls "rogue states." North Korea, for example, would fall into this category. But why is Kim Jong Il of North Korea not likely to be deterred by the threat of national devastation, if he struck at America?
To be sure, North Korea is an isolated place, the last Stalinist state and so economically troubled that people flee to China for a better life. When Mr. Kim went on a secret state visit to Beijing last week pictures released afterward showed him wearing a Mao jacket, while China's president, Jiang Zemin, was attired in suit and tie. Certainly he is behind the fashion curve. But does that mean he would risk extinction?
Since the end of the cold war there has been only one real-world test of deterrence against a so-called rogue state, and it supports those who say it remains effective. It came on the eve of the Gulf War. In a variety of ways, including a direct meeting with Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, the American secretary of state, James A. Baker, warned Saddam Hussein that the use of chemical or biological weapons against allied forces would be met by "the most severe consequences."
THE Iraqis did not use these weapons and later said they understood the American warning to mean a nuclear response.
"Saddam Hussein may have been ruthlessly expansionist, but he did not act irrationally," writes Robert S. Litwak, a former member of the national security council staff at the White House, in his book, " Rogue States and U.S. Foreign Policy" (Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2000).
Critics of America's emerging new strategic thinking, which is to say most of the rest of the world, seem to think that the new theories of deterrence have more to do with the mind of America than the mind of Saddam Hussein or of Kim Jong Il.
Americans have always seen themselves as self- reliant, and they have placed great faith in technology. Replacing MAD with N.M.D. relieves you of a dependence on the rationality of your fellow man, in favor of an independence granted by your homegrown radar, computers and missiles. America's allies are not convinced that is an improvement, but Americans seem to be.
While acknowledging that they do not know much about it, nearly 60 percent of Americans said in a survey last month that they favor trying to build a missile defense system against nuclear attack. Told that $60 billion had already been spent, opinion remained in favor. One American in four wants to try to build the system despite the cost, even if scientists conclude it probably won't work, according to the survey, conducted by The New York Times and CBS News.
What most Americans have not begun to consider is that an anti-missile system would represent a fundamental shift in how the nation thinks about nuclear war.
In 1945, the first year of the nuclear age, Albert Einstein described atomic energy as a "menace" and added: "Perhaps it is well that it should be. It may intimidate the human race into bringing order into its international affairs, which, without the pressure of fear, it would not do."
For a half century that is what happened, more or less. What frightens some analysts is that a shield against nuclear attack on the United States would make Americans believe they are safe and thus help lift from their leaders the pressure of fear, which helps motivate the world's one superpower to work for continued order and safety in the world.

HEADLINE: Living in the Shadow of Chernobyl's Reactors

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: CHERNOBYL, Ukraine

 BODY:
They are gardening again at Chernobyl.
Rounding the last corner on the road to the destroyed reactor of Unit No. 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the most striking discovery at the site of the worst radiation accident in history was the two young women in white masks picking gingerly at the earth with hoes and rakes. 
 They were preparing a flower bed in the shadow of the "sarcophagus," the mammoth concrete and steel structure, riddled with leaks and cracks, that now encases the shattered reactor hall where nearly 200 tons of radioactive fuel lie melted and fused with sand, concrete and other debris from the explosion and fire that erupted on April 26, 1986.
"Ordinarily, we would have had flowers growing long ago," said Katya Premak, 33, explaining why nothing was coming out of the ground so late in the spring. "But we are going very slow," she added, leaning on her hoe.
"Last week, they found a hot spot over there," she said, pointing to where a scoop of earth had set off a radiation monitor during a routine sweep. "We wear these masks because we are stirring up the dust and it can be dangerous."
To any visitor, it seems more than unusual that thousands of people still come to work here every day, 14 years after a disaster that killed 28 people outright with high radiation doses and touched off a still accelerating epidemic of thyroid cancers among children who lived downwind of the plant.
Finally, something is to change.
President Leonid Kuchma has declared that Ukraine will close the last operating reactor at Chernobyl, Unit No. 3, sometime this year. He said he would announce a specific closing date during the visit to Kiev by President Clinton on June 5 and 6.
"We ourselves want to shut down the last remaining unit," Mr. Kuchma said in an interview in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, just 80 miles to the south. "So this is not a political game. We will shut it down."
But the shutdown is only the beginning of a new chapter in the life of the ill-fated power station, whose radioactive wastes and debris must be guarded for decades, if not centuries, to prevent them from further poisoning the environment. Not only do tens of thousands of Ukrainians depend on the plant for jobs and power, but Ukraine faces an acute energy crisis, even now, before Chernobyl is closed. Despite intensive medical investigations into the health effects of the huge amount of radiation released from the explosion and fire that ripped through reactor No. 4 in 1986 after an experiment went disastrously wrong, the overall health of the plant workers remains good, though more questions than answers remain about Chernobyl's long-term effects.
The biggest question is who will pay for what needs to be done here. Since 1986, Chernobyl's endgame has been marked by unceasing recriminations among Ukraine, the United States and the world's six other wealthiest industrial nations over financing for major decommissioning projects and the replacement of Chernobyl's electrical output.
Ukraine would like to complete two nuclear power plants that were under construction in western Ukraine before the Soviet Union collapsed, but the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, responsible for Western financing, has failed to offer lending terms Ukraine can afford, in the view of Mr. Kuchma and his government.
"The electricity deficit has been catastrophic in our industries, so if we just shut down a unit that has been producing one million watts," Mr. Kuchma said, referring to Chernobyl, "it will be a complete disaster for the Ukrainian economy because nuclear power is the cheapest."
As it is, controllers from Kiev enforce rotating blackouts for as long as eight hours a day in many parts of the country.
Even if Chernobyl closes, the costs of monitoring what happens inside the sarcophagus, and keeping radiation firmly encased inside, will run on. A permanent corps of safety engineers is needed. Moreover, a new sarcophagus costing as much as $750 million will probably have to be built, since the current one rests on potentially unstable foundations and suffers from intrusions of rainwater that create clouds of humidity in the radioactive darkness, corroding the maze of pipes and steel girders and increasing the risk of collapse.
A plant for processing radioactive waste will be needed, and a $100 million heating plant and new electricity supplies to run all the support facilities. Leaders of the seven wealthiest nations have pledged about $400 million of the money needed for the sarcophagus, but Mr. Kuchma said Western aid had been slow to materialize.
"It's not like closing a big door and putting a big lock in place and then forgetting about it," he said. "We have to continue servicing this plant."
In the interview, Mr. Kuchma indicated that Ukraine would seek Russian help if necessary to replace Chernobyl's electrical output, a step that would undermine the Western goal of reinforcing Ukrainian independence at a time when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is emphasizing the "common roots" between his country and Ukraine.
"We will probably look for a compromise with Russia because 90 percent of the equipment in these plants was made in Russia and so economically and politically it's highly profitable and interesting to the Russians," Mr. Kuchma said.
His remarks may have been intended to put pressure on the West in advance of the July meeting of the Group of Seven leaders with Russia in Okinawa, but he nevertheless is under considerable pressure at home, where the energy sector is notoriously corrupt even as major industries go begging for electricity supplies.
Then there is the question of what to do about Slavutich, the city of 28,000 built in the 1980's to house Chernobyl's corps of engineers.
Units No. 1 and 2 of Chernobyl operated until the early 1990's. Unit No. 2 was shut down in 1991 after a fire swept through its turbine hall, causing extensive damage, though not to the reactor. And President Kuchma agreed to shut down Unit No. 1 in 1994 after pledges from the Group of Seven to help finance an overall plan to decommission the Chernobyl complex -- assistance that has been halting at times.
From Slavutich, Chernobyl's denizens ride an electric train 40 minutes to "the zone," the depopulated area of abandoned farms and villages where 135,000 people once lived within an 18-mile radius of the plant.
Where once there was farmland, weeds and brambles have taken over, enveloping houses and hiding earthen mounds where radioactive trucks and bulldozers are buried, and equipment yards where irradiated helicopters that dumped tons of sand and boron on the burning reactor still are quarantined. Some pilots died from the radiation.
In man-made canals that once carried cooling water to and from the reactor, hefty carp and catfish have taken over. And in the nearby forests the swelling deer population has attracted poachers who ply the trails of the zone at night.
In the aftermath of 1986, Chernobyl became a symbol of nuclear devastation that incited a numbing fear in Ukraine and Belarus, a fear that researchers suggest has so far been more destructive to public health than the huge release of radiation. The accident also laid bare industrial incompetence and a contempt for the environment that helped to fracture the Soviet edifice.
But for the 6,000 Chernobyl workers and their dependents today in independent Ukraine, the power station represents more than anything a paycheck and a guaranteed apartment when so many in the former Soviet Union are without both.
"I was a student in electrical engineering in Moscow and came here two years after the accident," said Irina A. Kolbich, who works for the plant administration. "Frankly I came for financial reasons because living here on 1,300 rubles a month with your own apartment was better than living in Moscow on 130 rubles a month with no apartment."
Vladimir A. Komarov calls himself "a patriot of Chernobyl" because he has worked here for 20 years. "If you talk to our experts, all agree that this plant could be operated until 2006 or maybe longer," he said.
The culture of safety still is not exactly pervasive. Neither Ms. Premak nor her co-worker, Natasha Poplegina, were wearing their radiation dosimeters while gardening.
"We are supposed to wear them all the time, but I keep mine in my locker," Ms. Premak said.
In the flower bed, the radiation, though low, was about four times higher than the naturally occurring levels in the environment. "Since you don't see it, who knows what to expect anyway?" Ms. Poplegina said.
On the deck that overlooks the sarcophagus, where Vice President Al Gore stood briefly during his visit to Chernobyl in 1997, the radiation goes from 4 times to 10 times the naturally occurring level, still not necessarily dangerous but not recommended for extended exposure.
Control Room No. 3 operates Chernobyl's last functioning nuclear dynamo. On a recent afternoon, Alexander N. Yelchishev, 46, a shift supervisor, monitored the reactor closely.
A veteran of Unit No. 4, Mr. Yelchishev lost a classmate and a neighbor to radiation poisoning in 1986. Still, he remains a believer in nuclear power, and laments that the closing of Unit No. 3 will constitute a waste of about $300 million in safety improvements financed by the United States and other Western donors.
The fixes are intended to prevent the reactor from surging out of control, as Unit No. 4 did during a low power test in 1986, setting off steam and hydrogen explosions that ripped apart the graphite reactor core, blew off the roof and spewed radioactive material into the atmosphere for days.
Mr. Yelchishev does not blame the West for the pressure to close Chernobyl as much as he blames Ukraine's leaders for allowing corruption and inept reforms to retard economic development.
In the accident, about 50 tons of radioactive dust and debris was carried by winds and rain to virtually every country in the Northern Hemisphere, but the worst contamination was in the areas near the zone, especially southern Belarus.
Thyroid cancer rates have increased tenfold in Ukraine and as much as 84 times in parts of Belarus. In 1996, about 800 thyroid cancers had appeared in Ukraine and Belarus, but the numbers have since risen sharply and continue to climb.
"As of today, we have operated on about 1,500 children in Ukraine alone," said Dr. Valery P. Tereshchenko of the Institute for Endocrinology and Metabolism in Kiev.
The health effects from other long-life radioactive elements, like cesium and strontium, have been difficult to measure. There have been no clusters of leukemia or other cancers in the fallout zones where the thyroid cancers have appeared, but the latency period for other health effects may be longer, experts say.
A United Nations conference on Chernobyl concluded in 1996 that the only clear change evident in health to date was a "highly significant" increase in thyroid cancer rates among people who were children in 1986 in the affected areas.
"To tell you the truth," said Dr. Mykola D. Tronko, director of Ukraine's thyroid cancer institute, "even 14 years after the accident, we have more questions than answers."

HEADLINE: All College Graduates, Please Apply

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The 1.2 million college graduates in the nation's class of 2000 are entering an unusually strong job market that is a result of a flourishing economy and, especially, the boom in high technology.
From Northeastern University in Boston to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, from the University of Michigan to the University of Texas, colleges, universities and professional schools are reporting a record number of recruiters competing to hire students in a time of low unemployment. 
 Engineering students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other universities in the East have been flown to Silicon Valley and Seattle for audiences with billionaire executives, while investment banks have flown Stanford University students to New York for high-priced dinners accompanied by job offers.
Some of the graduates have landed jobs paying more than $60,000 a year. With unemployment near its lowest level in three decades, despite the increase in unemployment announced on Friday, salaries overall for this year's graduating class are up 6 percent over last year's, job placement experts say.
"It's gangbusters," said Carol S. Lyons, dean of the department of career services at Northeastern University. "There are even more jobs now than last year. Obviously the hot market is high-tech, but if you're any kind of a business major, you're in fine shape. And even if you're a liberal arts major there are plenty of opportunities."
But those in computer sciences are doing best of all. Many technology companies are offering signing bonuses of $5,000, with stock options often added on top. One graduate of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., has taken an $82,000-a-year job in Silicon Valley.
This year's computer science graduates have landed jobs averaging $48,500, while graduates in accounting average $37,200 and liberal arts graduates, $29,100, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, which represents employers and college job placement officers.
Emily Lowe, a senior at Stanford University who majored in product design engineering with a minor in computer science, said she will earn about $60,000 next year with a software company in San Diego, and that is before the $5,000 signing bonus and stock options.
"I had five job offers, including one from a company in Arizona that agreed to fly me to San Diego every weekend to visit my fiance," she said.
But some university officials see troubles behind this bright picture. A smaller percentage of students from this year's graduating class is planning to go to graduate school. At Columbia University, administrators say, about 20 percent of this year's graduating seniors said they would attend graduate school next year, down from a high of 70 percent in decades past, usually during recessions. This trend makes many college officials fear that a smaller, and possibly less capable, group will choose to become professors.
Another problem, university officials say, is that at a time when educators and government officials see an acute need for more -- and more talented -- teachers, the lavish starting salaries offered by the private sector are drawing away potential teachers.
"The problem isn't so much the high-tech salaries, but the level of teacher salaries," said Stanley O. Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, an association of 3,500 colleges and universities. "Can you imagine a high school teacher of physics or mathematics receiving a paycheck that might be $25,000 a year, as opposed to the $50,000 or $75,000 in a comparable role in business? It's a tough choice for a young person to make."
Some college officials say a bidding war between technology companies, investment banks and consulting firms has pushed salary offers to record levels, with average salaries jumping nearly 20 percent from three years ago.
In one unusual episode, several Columbia University students who had accepted $45,000-a-year jobs from a New York bank were delighted this spring when the bank, fearing it would lose them to competitors, announced that it was raising their starting salaries to $55,000.
"It looks as if the starting salaries for this year's college graduates are the same as that M.B.A.'s were receiving seven years ago," said Margaret O'Hara, a senior consultant with the Hanigan Consulting Group, which advises scores of companies on hiring college graduates. "What's happened in the past few years is we've gone from being employer-centric to being employee-centric."
At Northeastern University this year, there were 440 job recruiters, up from 400 the year before. At the University of Michigan, 170 employers made presentations selling themselves to students, up from 120 last year.
"There are just too many employers chasing too few students," said Patricia Rose, director of career services at the University of Pennsylvania.
Frustrated that there are not enough qualified college graduates, many high-technology companies have pressed President Clinton to nearly double, to 200,000, the number of annual visas for skilled foreign workers.
University officials say the high demand for skilled workers has created improper dealings. Some companies, eager to catch their prey, have made what are called "exploding offers" -- students are told they have 24 hours to accept a job offer or the offer disappears.
Pressured by such offers, students accept and, after continuing to look or after stumbling upon something more attractive, a few renege on those offers and take other jobs.
"There are some downsides to this wonderful market," said Robert Thirsk, director of career development services at Stanford University. "Exploding offers put students in a very precarious position. We tell these companies, 'You put the student in a difficult situation of having to make a decision like that. What do you think they're going to do?' When students renege on offers, it's usually because they haven't been given enough time to think about it."
Stanford has told employers that beginning this fall companies that recruit on campus must give students at least three weeks to respond to job offers.
The giddy job situation at colleges is giddier yet at business schools. There, $25,000 signing bonuses are common, and some companies fly not just prospective employees, but their spouses, cross-country.
Erin Cochrane, director of career services at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, said the average base salary for this year's M.B.A. graduates is $90,000, up from $80,000 last year. She said overall median first-year compensation is actually $135,000, after adding in signing bonuses, a guaranteed first-year bonus and employers' paying a student's second-year business school tuition.

Clinton and Putin Meet In Prelude to Negotiations
President Clinton and Russia's new leader, Vladimir V. Putin, dined at the Kremlin palace where they began discussing a range of topics, including antimissile defense strategies, the ongoing conflicts in the Balkans and the Caucasus, international trade and the state of the Russian economy. 1 

Progressives Meet in Berlin
President Clinton met with 12 other left-of-center presidents and prime ministers in Berlin, who agreed that they all stood for a new brand of progressive leaders. But perhaps inevitably, most of the conclusions beyond that were murky. 8
 
Europeans Pressure Poland
Having achieved full NATO membership only a year ago, Poland finds itself caught between its European aspirations and its loyalty to the United States. European officials, led by France, have pressured Poland to be more accommodating toward a new European defense initiative, senior Polish officials say. 8
 
U.S. Absence in Sierra Leone
As Sierra Leone slid back into war last month, the British were conspicuous as the one Western power willing to shore up the United Nations peacekeeping force. To many, their presence merely emphasized the absence of the United States. 6
 
Report on Torture in Turkey
When a harsh report asserting that torture is widespread in Turkey was released, the surprise was not just the amount of damning evidence it contained, but also the source: the parliamentary committee on human rights. No report by a government human rights body has ever been this extensive or graphic. 4
 
NATIONAL 16-36
 
Food Companies Confront Biotechnology Quandary
The nation's biggest food companies face a marketing quandary in the debate over genetically altered crops, which environmentalists contend are potentially dangerous but which the Food and Drug Administration has deemed entirely safe. Though nearly all the big food producers publicly support biotechnology, a growing number are quietly limiting its use. 1
 
Teacher Initiative Stalls
Gov. Gray Davis's proposal to show support for California's public school teachers by exempting them from state income taxes has met with widespread opposition. Even the teachers' unions, initially flattered, oppose the plan, which would reduce the average experienced teacher's state tax by about $1,350 a year. 16
 
Detroit Braces for Protests
Human rights campaigners plan to unleash in Detroit the same kind of protests that left Seattle with $2.5 million in damage last December after a meeting of the World Trade Organization. The planned protests are directed at a three-day summit on trade being held by the Organization of American States across the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario. 16
 
Competing to Hire Students
The 1.2 million college graduates in the nation's class of 2000 are entering a strong job market, a result of the flourishing economy and, especially, the boom in high technology. 26
 
Janitors Approve New Contract
Service Employees International Union Local 1877, representing janitors who clean more than 70 percent of the buildings in Silicon Valley, reached a contract agreement with cleaning contractors. 24
 
NEW YORK/REGION 39-44
 
In a Bronx Court Experiment, Youths Get Juries of Peers
In a quiet experiment in Family Court in the Bronx, teenagers arrested on misdemeanor charges and even minor felonies -- anything from graffiti writing to small-time robberies and drug sales -- are being judged, quite literally, by a jury of their peers. All first-time defendants, the youths are referred as an alternative to prosecution. 1
 
Third Parties' Endorsements
With as much relief as enthusiasm, New York's Conservative and Liberal parties reverted to type, endorsing Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate, after both parties had endured several queasy months that left their nominations in doubt. 39
 
Health Officials' Concern
Though health officials in New York say they are seeing more exotic diseases, they also must turn the public's attention to the more mundane diseases that emerge each year. 39

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
For Corzine and Florio, Money Bags vs. Baggage

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 3

 BODY:
The state's newspapers are falling in behind Jim Florio. The party establishment is squarely backing Jon S. Corzine. The airwaves are full of nasty commercials about each of the Senate candidates. So what is a Democratic voter to do?
The New Jersey primary season, which culminates in Tuesday's election, has been the most competitive in a generation. The retirement of Frank R. Lautenberg left a Senate seat open for the first time in decades. And though the Republican primary drew four reasonably experienced but little-known contenders, the Democratic contest between Mr. Florio, the former governor, and Mr. Corzine, who spent tens of millions to gain name recognition, gave rise to a rarity in state politics -- a match between two household names. 
 "This is a singular story in New Jersey," said Clifford Zukin, a longtime political observer and director of The Star-Ledger/Eagleton Poll. "We've never had a marquee matchup like this between two people universally known by the citizenry."
Because the race has been so hard fought and so well publicized, it has confronted voters with an unusual number of important questions.
Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, arose as the answer to a search by Democratic officials for an anyone-but-Florio candidate. Even though Mr. Florio remains popular with many rank-and-file Democrats, he was considered by party leaders to be unelectable in November because of the memory of a $2.8 billion tax increase he pushed through the Legislature as governor in 1990.
Mr. Corzine's appeal to voters, not surprisingly, has been framed as a choice between an unhappy memory, embodied by Mr. Florio, and Mr. Corzine's own idealized vision for the future, with strict gun controls and ambitious new programs for health care, education and long-term care for the elderly and disabled. But to judge from the attack commercials Mr. Corzine has been running for more than a month, it remains, at its root, a not-Florio campaign.
Mr. Florio, too, has naturally cast the race in terms that suit him. For months, he described the primary as a choice between his 30 years of experience in government and Mr. Corzine's naivete.
More recently, Mr. Florio has seized upon Mr. Corzine's unprecedented campaign spending, asking voters whether they cared to let Mr. Corzine buy the election.
Voters can seize on a few issues on which the men hold opposing views. Mr. Corzine opposes the death penalty, and Mr. Florio favors it, for example. And Mr. Corzine supports a limited investment of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market, to extend the fund's solvency, a position Mr. Florio has vilified in the starkest terms. But the sharp line between the men on this subject was blurred when it was reported that Mr. Florio's and Mr. Corzine's positions were identical as recently as a year ago.
There are more subtle questions, too. A vote for Mr. Corzine's platform, for example -- with its hard-line support for abortion rights, gay rights, affirmative action, gun control and big government programs -- would seem to represent an embrace of the kind of liberalism that has been out of fashion for decades.
Mr. Florio, meanwhile, has in many ways made his own campaign a referendum on the nation's economic boom, warning voters that the fantastic wealth created by the new economy has momentarily obscured looming problems on issues like Social Security and pension financing. Mr. Florio has hammered away at Mr. Corzine on trade policy, corporate mergers and government borrowing. In doing so, he has employed the kind of class-based attacks Democrats often aim at Republicans.
If there is one watchword in the primary, however, it is electability. On the Republican side, voters must pick a contender for November from a field of four relatively unknown candidates: William L. Gormley, a veteran state senator from the south; Robert D. Franks, a four-term congressman from New Jersey's prosperous midsection; James W. Treffinger, a county executive in predominantly Democratic Essex County; and Murray Sabrin, a former Libertarian candidate for governor. In this race, where turnout is expected to be light, party endorsements are likely to play a heavy role.
On the Democratic side, every attack that Mr. Florio and Mr. Corzine employ can be reduced to the idea that only one of them has a reasonable chance to prevail in November. To Mr. Florio, his foe is too left-wing, too soft. To Mr. Corzine, Mr. Florio is too combative to win over even the most moderate Republicans.
"Democratic voters have to ask themselves whether they're selecting a candidate, be it Florio or Corzine, who can win," said Gerald M. Pomper, a political science professor at Rutgers University. "Primaries are about such practical calculations. After all, you're selecting somebody to carry the party's banner, not just somebody you like."

HEADLINE: CLINTON AND PUTIN MEET AT KREMLIN WITH WIDE AGENDA

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 3

 BODY:
In his final visit to Moscow as president, Bill Clinton arrived here today and dined tonight with Russia's new president, Vladimir V. Putin, at the Kremlin palace, where the two leaders made a "very serious and focused beginning" on a full range of issues, including the search for a compromise on antimissile defense.
During a nearly three-hour working dinner, the two men also discussed the American-Russian nuclear relationship, ongoing conflicts in the Balkans and the Caucasus, international trade and the state of the Russian economy, said a senior Administration official who sat in on the talks. 
 The official described the talks as "businesslike," "congenial" and "easygoing."
"Businesslike is good; businesslike is good," the official said, putting a positive cast on the talks, but declining to discuss them except in the vaguest terms. "Remember that the two presidents do know each other, and that was quite apparent from the beginning."
Mr. Clinton met Mr. Putin twice last year when he was prime minister, once at a tribute in Oslo to the late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and a second time at the annual economic summit of Pacific Rim countries, but the talks that started today and will continue through Sunday represent their first face-to-face encounter since Mr. Putin was elected president in March.
During their talks, Mr. Putin spoke some English and both leaders showed an enthusiasm to hear out the other's position on items of dispute, the administration official said. But he acknowledged that the initial exchanges lacked the first-name familiarity that characterized the relationship between Mr. Clinton and Russia's last president, Boris N. Yeltsin, where it was always Boris and Bill.
After a dinner of cold boiled boar, baked ham and cabbage and goose with berry sauce, Mr. Putin led Mr. Clinton on a tour of the residence, showing him a personal study, a small chapel, a gym and a massage room. The leaders settled into armchairs in an intimate wood-paneled theater for a jazz tribute to Louis Armstrong, conducted by one of Russia's best-known band leaders, Oleg Lundsrem.
Mr. Clinton has arrived to find Mr. Putin absorbed with domestic politics, a wrenching set of economic reforms just getting under way and an unresolved war in Chechnya.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton has come to a Russia that is relatively stable, poised for economic recovery and more politically united -- though disputes abound -- than at any time since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
This is a sharp contrast with Mr. Clinton's most recent visits here -- in 1996 when former President Yeltsin was fighting for his political life against an entrenched Communist opposition, and in 1998 when the Russian ruble and much of the country's economy had collapsed.
Like a younger Bill Clinton eight years ago (Mr. Clinton was 46 when he entered office; Mr. Putin is 47), Mr. Putin has taken command of the Kremlin with an apparent determination to focus on his country's economic problems and other pressing domestic issues while keeping things quiet on the foreign policy front. There, America still looms as an enormous force in Russia's calculations on everything from financial assistance and debt restructuring to NATO expansion and arms control.
Mr. Clinton is seeking agreement to modify a 1972 treaty and thus go ahead with a national antimissile defense; Russia has so far refused.
Right after his inauguration last month, Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, stirred liberal fears about his commitment to democracy when heavily armed police raided the offices of a top news media organization. On Sunday, Mr. Clinton will sit for a radio interview -- with live questions from the audience over the Internet -- on the popular Ekho Moskvy station run by the media group in what is intended as a gesture of support for freedom of the press in Russia.
On Monday, Mr. Clinton will address the Russian Duma, or lower house of Parliament, which has formed a strong pro-reform, and pro-Putin majority since elections last December, though many battles over land ownership, regional autonomy and national investment lie ahead.
The economic reality that Russia faces was highlighted most glaringly by Mr. Putin himself after he was named acting president on New Year's Eve when Mr. Yeltsin resigned.
"To reach the production level of Portugal and Spain, two countries that are not known as leaders of the world economy," Mr. Putin said, "it will take Russia approximately 15 years" even under optimistic growth assumptions of 8 percent a year. Only twice in the 20th century, he said, had Russia been so weak, "after the October Revolution in 1917, and in the 1990's."
Mr. Putin, as a political unknown whose disposition to the Western eye is somewhat dour, seems unlikely to achieve with Mr. Clinton the easy-going "Boris and Bill" chemistry that dominated during Mr. Yeltsin's two terms.
Under Mr. Putin, still very much the man in the gray suit, a more pragmatic and businesslike style prevails these days in the Kremlin, though he has bonded in an openly friendly manner with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
And Mr. Putin has betrayed a certain admiration for Mr. Clinton. When the two leaders met last fall in New Zealand at a meeting of Asian-Pacific leaders, Mr. Putin was still a novice prime minister, whose popularity among Russians was soaring due to his resolute prosecution of the war in Chechnya. Mr. Putin admitted to a group of interviewers from the newspaper Kommersant that he was charmed by Mr. Clinton.
"In that first meeting, he paid special attention to me," Mr. Putin said, referring to Mr. Clinton. "He made a point of coming up to me. We had been seated at different tables. We talked about something for a while, and then he said, 'Well, shall we go?' All the heads of state lined up. And he and I walked together along that corridor. We exited the hall to the sound of applause. I appreciated this sign of special regard," Mr. Putin said.
While clearly Mr. Putin has strong views, especially on NATO expansion and on the restoration of Russian power and national dignity in international affairs, he has shown great pragmatism in avoiding confrontation with the West, where he says he sees Russia's future as a European nation.
Mr. Clinton adopted that theme on Friday, when he used a speech accepting a prestigious European award to appeal to western Europeans to admit Russia, eventually, to both NATO and the European Union.
One of the problems facing Mr. Clinton is that both leaders know that history has assigned them different time slots in different decades. Mr. Clinton is almost at the end of his term and Mr. Putin is just embarking on his. And this difference in phase may do more to define the psychology at this summit meeting than any other factor.
Mr. Clinton has come here seeking to make progress on his proposal to build a system of national missile defense that requires an agreement to amend the treaty banning such nationwide systems signed by Moscow and Washington more than 30 years ago.
If accepted by Russia, the American proposal represents a profound turning point from offensive to defensive strategies by the world's two largest nuclear powers, one with the potential to reignite an arms race and alienate China, whose small nuclear arsenal would loose its deterrent credibility. Mr. Putin sent his foreign minister to New York last month to warn at the United Nations that America's missile defense plans could destabilize three decades of arms control agreements.
However, in an interview just before Mr. Clinton's arrival with "The NBC Nightly News," Mr. Putin hinted that the United States and Russia might collaborate on new ways to shoot down enemy missiles soon after they were launched, and thus address the problems posed by nuclear weapons being acquired by so-called rogue states. Mr. Clinton says the United States seeks an antimissile defense only to address that threat, although the Russians and Chinese are skeptical that this is the true purpose.
Although Mr. Putin will certainly engage Mr. Clinton's arguments, the Russian leader knows that he also has the luxury to wait for the next American president. That gives him an advantage over Mr. Clinton, who is in a hurry to improve the final cornice work of his presidency.
On the domestic front, Mr. Putin has opened his term with a strategy to strengthen federal power over Russia's vast region in preparation for slogging economic reforms. He has also has proposed legislation to gut and remake the upper house of Parliament and bolster the independence of the judiciary. His proposals appear so sweeping that his critics have attacked him for trying to recreate the vertical power structure of the Soviet Union.
The Russian leader's personal views on the subject have only deepened those concerns. "From the very beginning, Russia was created as a supercentralized state," he told interviewers this spring. "That's practically laid down in its genetic code, its traditions and the mentality of its people."

HEADLINE: Third Parties Make Choices In Senate Race

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 3

 BODY:
With as much relief as enthusiasm, New York's Conservative and Liberal Parties reverted to type today, endorsing Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate after both parties had endured a queasy several months that had left their nominations in doubt.
Less than two weeks into his campaign, Mr. Lazio, a congressman little known beyond his district in Long Island, has been working to establish himself in voters' minds as a centrist, but today his campaign veered to the right. Addressing the Conservative Party's nominating convention at a hotel a few blocks from the state Capitol, he promised "a crusade," offering up a list of favorite conservative causes, like tax cuts, the death penalty, longer prison terms and greater military spending. 
 He also spoke of the issue most identified with the Conservatives in recent years: what opponents call partial-birth abortion. "There is no place in our society for the gruesome procedure partial-birth abortion," he said to enthusiastic applause.
A few hours earlier, at the Hotel Inter-Continental in Manhattan, where Mrs. Clinton accepted the Liberal Party endorsement, she and the state party's leader, Raymond B. Harding, said Mr. Lazio was more conservative than the man he replaced as the Republican candidate, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York.
"In many ways my views are closer to those of the mayor than those of my opponent," Mrs. Clinton said. "He is out of step with the mainstream.
"My views are centrist views, positive views," she added at a news conference.
The day's events highlighted the danger to Mr. Lazio -- that the Conservative Party's backing can be both an aid and a burden -- as both candidates try to claim the political middle ground. Unlike the Liberals, the Conservatives still hew to an ideology in keeping with their name, taking strong stands against abortion, gay rights, affirmative action and big government. And the party's ready embrace of Mr. Lazio as a real conservative contrasts sharply with its rejection of Mr. Giuliani as too moderate.
Mr. Lazio said nothing to distance himself from the Conservative Party, even as he obliquely acknowledged that the affiliation could be used against him. "The other side is going to try to demonize me," he said. "They're going to try to demonize you, too."
He also peppered his speech with attacks on Mrs. Clinton, who barely mentioned him today. "You won't catch us trying to nationalize one-seventh of our economy," Mr. Lazio said, a reference to Mrs. Clinton's failed plan to restructure the nation's health care system. He reminded his audience several times that Mrs. Clinton was new to New York, saying, "I was able to jump into this race without a listening tour because I've been listening to New York all my life."
Of Mrs. Clinton, he said, "She comes to New York with the support of every left-wing special-interest group, from Washington insiders to the Hollywood elite."
As long as Mr. Giuliani was the presumptive Republican nominee, the race had both the Liberal and Conservative Parties in turmoil. The Liberals, whose longstanding support of Mr. Giuliani had alienated many Democrats, faced an internal battle over which side to take.
The state Conservative Party chairman, Michael L. Long, vowed that his party would not support the mayor because he was not conservative enough, especially on abortion. Party leaders said they would nominate someone to Mr. Giuliani's right, even if undermining him meant helping Mrs. Clinton and damaging the Conservatives' relationship with the Republican Party. But the Conservatives were having some trouble finding a candidate of their own.
But when Mr. Giuliani dropped out of the race last month, and the Republicans nominated Mr. Lazio, the battle lines became clear and the Liberals and Conservatives fell into their comfortable old roles as contentious allies of the major parties.
Conservative delegates said today that they were relieved to be able to unite with the Republicans, and, one after another, they said abortion was the key issue. "Abortion is the big difference between Lazio and Giuliani," said Viola Hunter of Syracuse, the party's vice chairwoman. "We're not a one-issue party, but it is a very vital, important issue."
Mr. Lazio supports legal abortion, but unlike Mrs. Clinton -- and Mr. Giuliani -- he opposes government financing for it, and would ban what he calls partial-birth abortion.
In nominating Mrs. Clinton, the Liberal Party went some distance toward mending its frayed relationship with the Democratic Party. The Liberals had alienated many Democrats by backing the mayor, and by refusing to support the Democratic nominee for governor in 1998, Peter F. Vallone, and instead nominating Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross.
The Conservative Party has fewer than 2 percent of the state's registered voters, and the Liberal Party fewer than 1 percent, but they wield an influence beyond their size. In recent statewide elections, Republican candidates have pulled as many as 300,000 votes on the Conservative line, while Democrats often get well over 100,000 on the Liberal line.

HEADLINE: Merton H. Miller, 77, Nobel Winner in Economics

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Merton H. Miller, a professor of finance who won the 1990 Nobel in economic science for helping develop theories that were used to evaluate the risks of individual investments, died yesterday at his home in Chicago. He was 77 and had been suffering from lymphoma, said Allan Friedman, a spokesman for the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.
Mr. Miller's ideas have been credited with changing Wall Street and the investment habits of millions of Americans. Until Mr. Miller and Franco Modigliani, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed the theories, it was generally assumed that companies could raise capital cheaply by borrowing or raise it safely by issuing more stock. 
 But the pivotal Miller-Modigliani theory, published in a 1958 paper, held what has become the most basic tenet of corporate financing: that the value of a company is determined by its investment decisions and not by its financing choices.
In a statement yesterday, Robert Hamada, the dean of the University of Chicago business school, said Mr. Miller was "the founder of modern finance and the person who fathered the discipline from an institutional field of study to one that is truly a legitimate and well-accepted part of economics and business."
Mr. Miller taught at the business school for 32 years.
His theory was based on the notion that while more corporate debt might make profits vary from year to year, the extra risk should not affect a stock's price because conservative investors could always "deleverage" their assets by holding more of a low-risk asset, like a bank deposit. Mr. Miller could be viewed as among "the intellectual fathers of the mutual fund" for this work, Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution, once said. Mr. Miller was also known for showing corporations the tax benefits of repurchasing their stock rather than paying dividends, now a common practice.
Merton Howard Miller was born in Boston. He received a bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1943. He worked as an economist in the Treasury Department and at the Federal Reserve during World War II before earning a doctorate in economics in 1952 from Johns Hopkins University.
After appointments at the London School of Economics and Carnegie-Mellon University, Mr. Miller joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1961, and remained there until his retirement in 1993.
Mr. Miller's first wife, Eleanor, died in 1969. He is survived by his wife, Katherine; three daughters, Margot Horn, Pamela Chwedyk and Louise Lorber; and two grandsons.

HEADLINE: William E. Simon, Ex-Treasury Secretary And High-Profile Investor, Is Dead at 72

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
William E. Simon, who directed the nation's energy policy and served as treasury secretary in the dark economic days of the 1970's and then proved to have a golden touch as an investor in the boom days of the 1980's, died yesterday at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 72 and lived in Santa Barbara.
The cause of death was complications from pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease that he had been fighting for more than a year, said James Piereson, executive director of the John M. Olin Foundation in New York, where Mr. Simon was president. . 
 A conservative Republican, Mr. Simon left a successful Wall Street career as a bond trader in 1973 to join Richard Nixon's administration as deputy treasury secretary. He went on to become director of the Federal Energy Office -- or "energy czar," as he was known -- later that year when the economy reeled in the wake of the Arab oil embargo, and in April 1974 he was named treasury secretary, a post he retained when Gerald R. Ford succeeded Nixon.
After leaving office at the end of the Ford administration, Mr. Simon returned to Wall Street, where he became emblematic of a breed of aggressive investor. In 1982, Mr. Simon and a partner, Raymond G. Chambers, paid $80.5 million, almost all of it borrowed, to purchase Gibson Greetings, a card maker, in one of the first high-profile leveraged buyouts.
Fourteen months later they sold the company in a public offering to shareholders for $290 million, yielding Mr. Simon and Mr. Chambers a profit of $70 million each and creating a mystique about Mr. Simon's investing prowess that was only partly tarnished in recent years by a string of disappointing deals.
Mr. Simon also served as the United States Olympic Committee's treasurer from 1977 to 1980, and as its president for the subsequent four years, playing important roles in the American decision to boycott the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, and in planning the 1984 games in Los Angeles.
William Edward Simon was born on Nov. 27, 1927, in Paterson, N.J. His father was an insurance agent, and he lived a middle-class life through the Depression. After graduating from high school in 1946, he served in the Army and then enrolled at Lafayette College, in Easton, Pa., where he met Carol Girard. They were married in 1950.
After graduating from Lafayette in 1952, he got a $75-a-week job trading municipal bonds. By 1964, he was working at Salomon Brothers, where he was known as a quick-tempered, outspoken and very skilled bond trader. Within Salomon's aggressive culture, his sometimes-abrasive personality was no drawback. By the early 1970's, he was one of the firm's senior partners and was earning more than $2 million a year.
On the recommendation of Attorney General John Mitchell, a former Wall Street lawyer, Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz recruited Mr. Simon as his deputy at the beginning of Nixon's second term. Even as the Watergate scandal was beginning to envelop the White House, Mr. Simon was enmeshed in another national crisis, the embargo imposed by Arab oil producers on nations friendly to Israel.
By the end of 1973, Mr. Simon was coordinating the administration's efforts to encourage conservation and to allocate scarce supplies of oil -- favoring factory production and home heating oil over gasoline for motorists. It was a job that brought him criticism from all sides, not least from consumers, who resented gasoline shortages and high prices.
"I'm the guy that caused the lines at the gas stations," Mr. Simon once said.
But Mr. Simon seemed sufficiently thick skinned to cope and more than willing to fight back.
"We have become a nation of great energy wastrels," he said in 1973. He publicly chastised another administration official for crossing him, saying the official should "keep his cotton pickin' hands off energy policy." He labeled statements by the shah of Iran, then a key ally of the United States, "irresponsible and reckless."
By early 1974, the country was in a recession, and when Mr. Shultz resigned as treasury secretary, Nixon quickly named Mr. Simon to replace him. Mr. Simon spent much of his time on international policy, pressing Arab nations to reinvest the dollars they were reaping through oil sales in the United States and creating an international credit line for poor nations that had been hurt by soaring energy costs.
At home, with inflation rising, he counseled against deficit spending to stimulate the economy, in keeping with his fiscal conservatism. In 1975, he created a political firestorm when he helped persuade President Ford not to bail New York City out of its deep financial crisis. He argued that coming to New York's aid would encourage profligacy among other cities.
"Then came the New York fiscal crisis, and I was Genghis Khan," he recalled a dozen years later.
Under pressure from bankers, who countered that if New York City were to default on its debt, it could reverberate through markets around the world, Mr. Simon and Mr. Ford ultimately agreed to aid the city.
After Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976, Mr. Simon left Washington and became a consultant to investment firms and businesses, as well as becoming treasurer of the Olympic committee, for which he had raised funds before entering government service.
In 1980, when President Carter urged the committee to boycott the Moscow Olympics that summer to protest the Soviet presence in Afghanistan, most American amateur sports officials and athletes were opposed. Mr. Simon's impassioned speech to the committee's house of delegates in favor of the boycott swung the vote.
The next year, when Mr. Simon was elected president of the Olympic committee by acclamation, the organization was $9 million in debt and had to meet an $88 million budget for the next four years. The boycott had hurt fund-raising.
But Mr. Simon turned potential doom into a financial bonanza by having the Olympic committee become an equal partner with the Los Angeles Olympic organizers. Despite a retaliatory boycott by the Soviet Union and most of its allies, those Olympics earned $225 million.
The Olympic committee, with its 40 percent share and an additional $35 million from the Olympic coin program, created the United States Olympic Foundation as a permanent financial source for American amateur sports. That became the major legacy of Mr. Simon's era at the committee.
During the same period, Mr. Simon was building a fortune with his investments in leveraged buyouts, of which the Gibson Greetings deal was the best known. The company he operated in partnership with Mr. Chambers, Wesray, bought undervalued companies with borrowed money, whipped them into shape or waited until a willing buyer appeared, and then sold them, often for hefty profits. By the late 1980's, Forbes magazine was estimating Mr. Simon's wealth at $300 million.
But his partnership with Mr. Chambers came apart in 1986, as Mr. Simon turned to building a network of financial institutions on the West Coast and across the Pacific.
He had some success purchasing banks and failed savings and loan associations and reselling them, but he never approached his stated goal of building a trans-Pacific merchant banking empire. In 1993, federal regulators seized one of his properties, Western Federal Savings and Loan, when it sank into insolvency.
In recent years, Mr. Simon had dedicated more of his time to philanthropy and charitable work.
He gradually turned much of the responsibility for his business over to his two sons, William E. Simon Jr., and J. Peter Simon.
In 1996, Mr. Simon received the Blessed Hyacinth Cormier Award for outstanding Catholic leadership, and in 1999, he was honored by the Olympic committee.
Mr. Simon's first wife, Carol, died in 1995. He is survived by his second wife, Tonia Adams Donnelley, whom he married in 1996, and by seven children from his first marriage. In addition to his two sons, they are Mary Beth Simon Streep; Carol Leigh Simon Porges; Aimee Simon Bloom; Julie Ann Simon Munro and Johanna Katrina Simon.

HEADLINE: Fund-Raiser May Be Achilles' Heel for Gore

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
Fred Baron has perhaps the best party house for fund-raisers in the whole state of Texas, a 15,000-square-foot Dallas house designed by Robert A. M. Stern. And Mr. Baron, a wealthy plaintiffs' lawyer, has plenty of rich friends to fill it.
So when he agreed last year to work as a big fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore, he had all the right tools. 
 In a few weeks, Mr. Baron, 52, will be the new president of the powerful Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which has vowed to do everything it can to defeat Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has long made curbing civil litigation and limiting jury awards and lawyers' fees a centerpiece of his campaign.
But while Mr. Baron has given Mr. Gore a great fund-raising boost, he has also given the Republicans a ready target in their campaign to link Mr. Gore to the image of greedy trial lawyers.
Several years ago, asbestos defense lawyers seized on a memorandum written by a paralegal in Mr. Baron's law firm, and charged in court papers that it had been used to coach the testimony of witnesses in asbestos cases. The document received wide publicity at the time, and conservative columnists and politicians have used it to repeatedly pound Mr. Baron. Asbestos companies have used it to castigate him in advertisements.
The attacks on Mr. Baron come as the trial lawyers engage in what is probably their most critical and intensely fought presidential election. Beyond picking judges, the next president will shape federal policy on issues in which the trial lawyers have a big stake. The lawyers have taken the lead in major legal battles against big tobacco companies and, with help from the federal government, are seeking to make it easier to sue gun manufacturers and health maintenance organizations.
Mr. Bush has long cited tort reform -- laws that restrict civil litigation and limit jury awards -- as one of his greatest accomplishments as governor of Texas, and has said that if elected president he would take it to the federal level.
"This election goes right to where trial lawyers live," said Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause and a former Democratic attorney general of Massachusetts.
Not surprisingly, lawyers like Mr. Baron are fighting back. In 1999, trial lawyers, who historically give the bulk of their contributions to Democrats, gave $4.4 million to Democratic candidates and political committees. That figure was two and a half times more than they gave in the same 12-month period during the previous presidential cycle, according to Common Cause. And many trial lawyers were among the big givers at a gala Democratic dinner on May 24 in Washington that raised $26 million.
It is against this backdrop that Mr. Baron, whose firm gave $135,000 in campaign contributions to Democrats in 1999, finds himself pushing the interests of trial lawyers, while defending his own reputation as a bruising litigator.
"I walk around with a bull's-eye on my head," said Mr. Baron, a short, trim man who wears expensive suits and wire-rim glasses.
Mr. Baron has long said that the controversial memorandum was written by an overzealous paralegal, who subsequently swore in court papers that she was its author. The document, which emerged in 1997, instructed claimants never to testify that they saw a warning label on asbestos packages or knew about its dangers. Some asbestos companies sought court-ordered sanctions against Mr. Baron's firm, and a Texas judge asked a state district attorney to investigate the memorandum. The United States attorney's office in Dallas also apparently made some preliminary inquiries into the matter, according to people who said they were interviewed by federal investigators.
Those inquiries, however, soon fizzled out. Also, several lower court findings by Texas state courts against Mr. Baron's firm were thrown out on appeal. Mr. Baron said he was also confident that the last legal dispute over the document, which is in an Ohio state court case, would be resolved in his favor.
As a result, Mr. Baron has declared himself and his firm exonerated. Still, even as he takes over a group that is a cornerstone of Mr. Gore's support, he remains haunted by the document and its implications of witness coaching.
It was cited earlier this year in newspaper advertisements paid for by the GAF Corporation, an asbestos producer, and others then pressing Congress for legislation limiting asbestos lawsuits. "You should be aware of the FACTS concerning Baron and his modus operandi," proclaimed one advertisement, which described the memorandum as one of his many "flagrant abuses" that make a "mockery of our legal system."
Walter Olsen, an adviser to Mr. Bush on tort reform, said he was surprised that the trial lawyers' group elected Mr. Baron president, given the document's controversy.
"The idea that he is going to be representative of a whole industry after the disclosure of the memo suggests a boldness on their part or an imperviousness to public criticism," said Mr. Olsen, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a research group, who has written articles critical of Mr. Baron.
Mr. Baron said that tort-reform advocates like Mr. Olsen and conservative opinion shapers like the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal had kept the memorandum controversy alive as a way of smearing him. To defend himself he has hired legal troubleshooters like Abbe Lowell, the chief investigative counsel for the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
But he has also struck back at his accusers with zeal. Some companies that filed legal challenges against Mr. Baron's firm over the legal document soon found themselves negotiating settlement deals favorable to him after he threatened to bring more asbestos claims against them. And he has intensified his pursuit of a former asbestos company executive who Mr. Baron contends spearheaded the assault against him, charging in court papers that the executive stole millions earmarked for asbestos claims.
"I learned early that it's best to let the other guy take the first shot," Mr. Baron said. "And then you come back at him."
It is a tactic Mr. Baron has used frequently in a career that has mirrored the transition of many trial lawyers from scrappy advocates for workers and consumers to wealthy businessmen eager to influence policies and politics.
These days, Mr. Baron, who was also a major contributor to President Clinton, plays golf with the president and dines several times a year at the White House. In recent years, he has been the host of a party for the Democratic National Committee at its annual retreat in Aspen, Colo., where he and his wife, Lisa Blue, a former prosecutor who is now a partner in his firm, have a second home.
A graduate of the University of Texas Law School, Mr. Baron went to work in the early 1970's for a Dallas law firm whose clients included the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union. He was asked to look at conditions at an asbestos insulation plant in Texas and said he found them appalling.
"It was disgusting," he said. "People were working in there shoveling up asbestos and they weren't even wearing masks."
He soon joined forces with a small group of lawyers around the country who had uncovered documents showing that asbestos producers like the Johns Manville Corporation long knew that asbestos, a mineral fiber that is now banned, could cause fatal diseases. By the 1980's, thousands of workers exposed to asbestos had filed lawsuits and Mr. Baron's firm, Baron & Budd, would eventually handle more claims than any other.
Before long, he was an extremely wealthy man whose political influence and contributions were felt in elections for Texas state judges, both Democrats and Republicans said in interviews.
"Fred is a very likable guy who throws a lot of parties," said Tom Pauken, who was chairman of the Texas Republican Party from 1994 to 1997. "He pays close attention to who is running and who isn't, and he has an ability to influence the process."
Mr. Baron also played a critical role in a 1997 United States Supreme Court decision that still hangs over asbestos cases today. At the time, some major lawyers representing asbestos claimants, including some of Mr. Baron's longtime colleagues, struck a deal with producers under which all current and future asbestos cases would be settled as part of a huge class-action lawsuit.
But Mr. Baron, who opposes the use of class-action lawsuits as a means of resolving legal disputes, led the fight against the plan. He poured $4 million into opposing it, hiring experts like Prof. Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School to argue against it before the Supreme Court, which struck down the settlement as unconstitutional.
Some critics asserted that Mr. Baron's motive was profit, not legal principles, saying that his once pioneering firm had evolved into an asbestos "mill" that raked in a large fee for every claim it handled, and that the stream of cases would have been shut off under the settlement. But even some supporters of the plan disagreed.
"Opposing the case was in Baron's economic interest but he is a more complex person," said John Aldock, a lawyer for a consortium of asbestos companies involved in the failed plan.
By the late 1990's, Mr. Baron said, he decided it was crucial for him to get involved in the trial lawyers' lobbying group as its battles with advocates of tort reform intensified. One possible inspiration: Mr. Bush signed the sweeping tort reform bill in Texas in 1997, ending a legal mechanism that Mr. Baron had helped engineer.
Under it, asbestos claims from other states could be filed in Texas state courts. Ralph Wayne, the president of the Texas Civil Justice League, a tort reform group in Austin, said a 1996 study by his group found that Mr. Baron's firm had filed the majority of the roughly 56,000 out-of-state asbestos claims pending in Texas courts.
Mr. Wayne said that many of those cases had been filed in Texas jurisdictions with reputations for high jury awards.
"He knows courts in Texas and he knows where to file the cases," Mr. Wayne said of Mr. Baron.
It was also around that time that the memorandum controversy erupted. While a lawyer from Mr. Baron's firm turned over the document to defense lawyers in pretrial testimony in an asbestos case, the lawyer said that publicity about it was fueled by a former asbestos company executive who had been his longtime nemesis.
Over the past decade, Mr. Baron and that executive, Craig Smith, a former top official of the Raymark Corporation, have waged a lengthy court battle over the assets of the bankrupt concern. In 1988, a federal judge in Oregon found that Mr. Smith had engaged in a number of complex business transactions in a bid to escape Raymark's asbestos liabilities.
More recently, Mr. Baron and others said in court papers filed in United States District Court in Hartford that Mr. Smith and members of his family engaged in a scheme to illegally divert millions of dollars earmarked for asbestos claims for their own benefit.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Smith, who now runs a business in Wales, denied any wrongdoing in the bankruptcy proceeding. But he acknowledged meeting with Federal Bureau of Investigation officials in 1997 to encourage the agency to look at the controversial memorandum. He also said he hired lawyers who, among other things, filed lawsuits against Mr. Baron and other asbestos lawyers.
Mr. Smith insisted, however, that his actions were driven not by any animus toward Mr. Baron but by his belief that many of the asbestos claims filed by the Texas law firm were groundless.
"I believe they are undermining the industrial strength of this country," Mr. Smith said.
Mr. Baron's interpretation of Mr. Smith's motives is quite different. "He is absolutely a down-in-the-dirt crook," Mr. Baron said.
Some defense lawyers involved in asbestos litigation said that while Mr. Baron and his firm might have escaped sanctions in connection with the memorandum, they remained convinced that his firm had used questionable tactics to press dubious claims.
Elizabeth L. Phifer, an outside lawyer in Dallas for the Borg-Warner Corporation, which challenged Mr. Baron over the memorandum, said that asbestos claimants she had questioned in pretrial testimony over the past decade had repeatedly given the same answers to questions about events that happened decades earlier. "It is remarkable how similar the answers sound," Ms. Phifer said.
Mr. Baron is unmoved. After Borg-Warner challenged him, he brought two asbestos cases to trial, winning large judgments. The company soon withdrew its legal challenge and now settles claims with Mr. Baron's firm for more than it previously did, the Texas lawyer said.
"She is bitter," said Mr. Baron, referring to Ms. Phifer. "She lost."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
At What RateDoes a Market Really Grow?

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT is a truism of the investing world: Over the long term stocks grow at an annualized rate of 10 to 15 percent.
Sure, equities may do better in some decades, as they did in the 1980's and 1990's, just as they may do worse in others, say, the 1930's and 1960's. But, eventually, their long-term growth rate will level out within this range -- a rate economists know as the stock market's "expected return." 
 This is the rate investors require to compensate them for the risk in equity investments, and it should remain relatively constant over the long term.
But what if it turns out that we've all been too optimistic about the expected return of stocks? Then asset allocation models would have to be recalculated to cut their equity weightings. Indeed, huge swaths of capital would need to be shifted into nonequity asset classes. And certainly investing the Social Security Trust Fund in stocks, as George W. Bush and many others have proposed, would suddenly make a lot less sense.
Well, two of this country's most influential finance professors, Eugene F. Fama of the University of Chicago and Ken French of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have just completed research showing that the expected return from stocks is more than five percentage points a year lower than previously thought. Though this research has not yet been published, word of it is beginning to spread.
Determining stocks' expected return isn't easy, since it requires viewing the markets over extremely long periods. Professors Fama and French focused on United States stocks over the last 130 or so years. In particular, they observed that the stock market's average annual return from 1950 through 1999, at 14.8 percent, was about 6 percentage points higher than it was from 1872 through 1949, when it was 8.8 percent.
The key question: Which period represents the rule and which the exception?
The professors are confident that the last 50 years constitute the exception. That means we're on shaky ground if we extrapolate recent decades' stellar returns into the future.
One of their more compelling points is based on the fact that corporate America's average annual return on equity over the last 50 years has been 11.9 percent, nearly three percentage points lower than the stock market's average return over that period.
This, the professors say, all but proves that stocks' expected return should be below what their historical return has been over the past five decades.
Why is that? If the market's expected return is greater than a company's return on equity, the rational thing for the company to do is close up shop and invest its assets in the stock market. Alert balance sheet readers will note that, because the market's expected return is also the rate at which a company's future income stream is discounted for valuation purposes, the present value of such a company's future earnings would be negative.
In other words, if you believe that stocks' historical return over the last 50 years reflects their genuine expected return, then, in effect, you must also believe that corporate America on balance has been unprofitable on a discounted valuation basis over the past 50 years.
The professors' point is that corporate America's returns on equity, on average, cannot have trailed the market's true expected return for five full decades.
So investors have been overestimating the expected return from stocks: It should be no higher than their underlying companies' returns on equity, or three percentage points a year less than the equity market's annual return over the past 50 years.
Moreover, returns on equity are widely assumed to be upwardly biased because they are based on artificially low book values. So even this overstates expected return.
Why then have stocks bested what might be called their true expected return for 50 years? Likely, it is because they have benefited from some unexpected good news. The professors don't discuss what that good news was, but it undoubtedly includes America's emergence after World War II as an economic and political superpower and its winning of the cold war.
The professors note that unexpected good news is just that -- unexpected -- and its salutary effect on past returns should not be extrapolated into the future. They don't predict a bear market, but argue that we need to cut our expectations of future stock market performance, not just for the next few years but in perpetuity.

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday with the Strategies column, about the expected long-term return of stocks, misstated the average annual inflation rate for two periods. From 1872 through 1949 it was 0.9 percent, not 4.1. From 1950 through 1999 it was 4.1 percent, not 6.2.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Long-Term Perspective"
What long-term growth rate can be expected for stocks? The answer depends on how far back you look for guidance. Average annual returns have been much higher over the past 50 years than over the previous 80. Higher inflation explains only part of the difference.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 6-4-00: Idea Lab;
Greens Peace

BYLINE: By David Plotz; David Plotz is the Washington editor of Slate.com.

 BODY:
Since the rise of the nation-state, scholars and politicians have been struggling to answer the critical question of geopolitics: Why do some countries fight wars and others remain at peace? Yet to date, they have made little progress. Some contemporary thinkers, alarmed by Kosovo and Rwanda, predict that ethnic conflict will be the prime cause of war in the 21st century. Environmental scholars argue that scarce water and land will drive nations to battle. Students of the theory of interdemocratic peace contend that the structure of national government will be the driving factor. But policy makers should discard these dry, unsatisfying academic formulations and start paying attention to a much more powerful explanatory tool: golf.
Countries where golf is popular never fight other golfing nations -- and don't fight much at all -- while countries without golf are strikingly belligerent. Have you ever met an Afghan who golfs? Are there any Serbs on the P. G.A. tour? 
 I can hear the skeptical tennis fans out there asking, Where's the proof? Years of rigorous data collection and analysis -- or at least days of casual data massaging -- confirm the theory of greens peace. I consulted experts at the National Golf Foundation and Golf Digest and scoured the records of PlayGolfNow.com to determine which countries take their golf seriously and which are mere duffers. Because the only remotely reliable international golf statistic is the number of courses, I estimated golf's popularity in each country by calculating the ratio of golf courses to people. Using well-established scientific and astrological methods, I determined that a country needs one course per million people to count as a golf nation. (Fewer than one course per million suggests that golf is confined to rich folks and tourists.)
About 50 countries meet the one-per-million standard. Golf-mad New Zealand leads the world with 136 courses per million. The United States has about 60; France, 11; and Singapore, 6. Sri Lanka, by contrast, has 0.1; Peru 0.08; China 0.05.
I compared the golf stats with a list of the 300-odd major conflicts since World War II, and the evidence is irrefutable. Golfing nations haven't fought one another in 50-odd years, and they aren't very likely to fight one another today. Of the 27 current major armed conflicts, none match golfing nations. Take a quick spin around the globe. Every peaceful European country loves golf. But Russia, at war in Chechnya, doesn't hit the links. Non-golf Greece and non-golf Turkey have long warred over non-golf Cyprus. The former Yugoslavia has fragmented into five states. Only peaceful Slovenia swings the sticks.
Do India or Pakistan golf? Of course not. Algerians shoot one another; Moroccans next door shoot par. Peaceful Thailand is a regular at the range, but belligerent Myanmar isn't. Golf is sadly absent from Sierra Leone, Congo and Eritrea. The Middle East has hardly any courses; Iraqis still think a bunker is something you want to be in. Colombia and Peru have guerrilla wars but little golf. Venezuela has lots of golf but no war. Malaysia is crazy about the game, but Indonesia has been too busy brutalizing East Timor to pick it up. Taiwan loves golf; China doesn't -- which one of them invaded Tibet and India? Germany and Japan have become golf junkies since the Second World War ended; South Korea took up the game after the Korean War. Is it any accident they've remained at peace?
And the more golf you play, the more peaceful you are. Sweet-tempered nations like Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Canada play the most golf. Of the 10 countries where golf is most popular, only the United States and Great Britain have a recent history of autonomous belligerence. But the United States has dispatched troops only against anti-golf tyrants: Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic, Panama's Manuel Noriega, Somalia's Mohammed Aideed.
Two British conflicts do mar the record. The U.K. and Argentina warred over the Falkland Islands in 1982. (Argentina barely meets the one-per-million cutoff today, and I suspect that it wouldn't have had enough courses to qualify in 1982.) And Northern Ireland's Troubles set the golfing Irish against the golfing English. Apartheid-era South Africa also tarnishes the theory, with the white golfing minority violently oppressing the black, non-golfing majority.
Philosophers and social scientists will undoubtedly puzzle for decades over the association of golf and peace, but I have a few preliminary theories. Golf teaches players to be gentlemen. It relies on an honor system in which golfers police themselves. Golf has no physical violence, unlike basketball, soccer, football, rugby and so on. (Soccer fans riot, and at least one soccer match ignited a war. Have you ever heard of a golf riot?) Golf is not zero-sum. Your performance is independent of your opponent's, and nothing you can do to your opponent can improve your score. War, which is founded on violence, cheating and crushing your rival, is golf's antithesis.
Some cynics may complain that I have it backward: golf doesn't cause peace, peace causes golf. Golf, they may say, presumes a stable economic and political system. Golfers have to be relatively prosperous people with leisure time. They live in countries that can afford to set aside valuable land and water for golf courses. People who have the time and peace of mind to play golf aren't worrying about whether rioters are looting their stores or barbarians are swarming across the borders. (This argument parallels Thomas L. Friedman's "golden arches theory of conflict prevention," which holds that countries with McDonald's are too prosperous and complacent to wage war with one another.)
But the far-sighted people of South Korea, who know firsthand the benefits of golf, are conducting a perfect experiment to prove that it can pacify even the most benighted nation. According to recent news reports, South Korea's first significant capital investment in North Korea will include a multimillion-dollar resort with several golf courses to be built by the Hyundai Group. These will be North Korea's first courses, and they may be the best investment South Korea ever makes. What better way to end 50 years of strife than to teach North Koreans to make par, not war?

HEADLINE: Best of Friends, Worlds Apart

SERIES: HOW RACE IS LIVED IN AMERICA -- Second article of a series.

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
Havana, sometime before 1994: As dusk descends on the quaint seaside village of Guanabo, two young men kick a soccer ball back and forth and back and forth across the sand. The tall one, Joel Ruiz, is black. The short, wiry one, Achmed Valdes, is white.
They are the best of friends. 
Miami, January 2000: Mr. Valdes is playing soccer, as he does every Saturday, with a group of light-skinned Latinos in a park near his apartment. Mr. Ruiz surprises him with a visit, and Mr. Valdes, flushed and sweating, runs to greet him. They shake hands warmly.
But when Mr. Valdes darts back to the game, Mr. Ruiz stands off to the side, arms crossed, looking on as his childhood friend plays the game that was once their shared joy. Mr. Ruiz no longer plays soccer. He prefers basketball with black Latinos and African-Americans from his neighborhood.
The two men live only four miles apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by a far greater distance, one they say they never envisioned back in Cuba.
In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to the white one, they have grown apart in the United States because of race. For the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of their skin defines the outlines of their lives -- where they live, the friends they make, how they speak, what they wear, even what they eat.
"It's like I am here and he is over there," Mr. Ruiz said. "And we can't cross over to the other's world."
It is not that, growing up in Cuba's mix of black and white, they were unaware of their difference in color. Fidel Castro may have decreed an end to racism in Cuba, but that does not mean racism has simply gone away. Still, color was not what defined them. Nationality, they had been taught, meant far more than race. They felt, above all, Cuban.
Here in America, Mr. Ruiz still feels Cuban. But above all he feels black. His world is a black world, and to live there is to be constantly conscious of race. He works in a black-owned bar, dates black women, goes to an African-American barber. White barbers, he says, "don't understand black hair." He generally avoids white neighborhoods, and when his world and the white world intersect, he feels always watched, and he is always watchful.
Mr. Valdes, who is 29, a year younger than his childhood friend, is simply, comfortably Cuban, an upwardly mobile citizen of the Miami mainstream. He lives in an all-white neighborhood, hangs out with white Cuban friends and goes to black neighborhoods only when his job, as a deliveryman for Restonic mattresses, forces him to. When he thinks about race, which is not very often, it is in terms learned from other white Cubans: American blacks, he now believes, are to be avoided because they are delinquent and dangerous and resentful of whites. The only blacks he trusts, he says, are those he knows from Cuba.
Since leaving Havana on separate rafts in 1994, the two friends have seen each other just a handful of times in Miami -- at a funeral, a baby shower, a birthday party and that soccer game, a meeting arranged for a newspaper photographer. They have visited each other's homes only once.
They say they remain as good friends as ever, yet they both know there is little that binds them anymore but their memories. Had they not become best friends in another country, in another time, they would not be friends at all today.
 
Two Boys on a Bus
They met on a bus, No. 262, the one that took Joel from his home in the racially mixed neighborhood of Penas Altas to middle school, 35 minutes away. Achmed got on in Guanabo, and they sat together talking, as boys do, about everything and nothing.
Both grew up in orderly homes, with hard-working parents who supported the Castro government. Their fathers worked for the state oil company. Their mothers -- Joel's was a nurse, Achmed's an administrator in stores for tourists -- knew each other and sometimes met for coffee.
The boys' friendship was cemented through school and sport. They stood up for each other against troublemakers. "Just to know we were there for each other was good," Mr. Ruiz recalls. When his girlfriend got pregnant in high school, Achmed was the first person he told. They played soccer and baseball and ran track. Joel often stayed for dinner at Achmed's, where there was a color television and an antenna powerful enough to pick up American channels.
Because of her job, Achmed's mother had access to some of Havana's best restaurants. Every year she would take him out for a birthday dinner, and every year he would invite his best friend, Joel. "I couldn't think of anybody I would rather spend my time with," Mr. Valdes recalled.
But as they grew older, each became restless with the limitations of life in Cuba.
Achmed was in sixth grade when an aunt who had fled to Venezuela gave him a pair of white sneakers. He loved them so, he immediately wore them to school. Almost as immediately, the principal visited him at home to warn him about the troubling political implications of those foreign sneakers. At the university, too, his professors wondered why he wore foreign clothes and rode a nice bicycle. He wondered right back why he could not wear and ride whatever he wanted. When he was expelled for failing two classes, he saw it as punishment for being politically incorrect.
Before long, he found work at sea, trapping lobsters and selling them for $4 each. In a country where most people earn less than $10 a month, it was a living, though not a life. When the government allowed thousands of Cubans to leave in small boats and rafts in 1994, he was ready.
His friend Joel was ready, too, though it had taken him far longer to make up his mind. Indeed, given Cuba's racial history, it is hardly surprising that black Cubans have generally been far less eager than whites to flee to America. After all, in pre-revolutionary Cuba, blacks and whites had lived largely segregated, separated by huge disparities in economic and social standing. But two months after he seized power in 1959, Fidel Castro ordered whites to look upon blacks as equals and began leveling the economic and educational playing fields.
When Joel was very small, his family lived crammed into one room of an old carved-up mansion. Soon, the government gave them a three-bedroom apartment in a development that Joel's father had helped build. Before the revolution, Joel's mother had made a living cleaning white people's homes. It was Fidel, she told him over and over, who had given her the chance to become a nurse. And so Joel came to believe that it was no big deal, being black in Cuba.
As for America, he had seen the images on government television: guards beating black prisoners, the police loosing dogs or training hoses on civil-rights marchers.
But as Cuba's economy fell apart in the 1990's, he began to see things differently. He left military school for a cooking program, hoping for a well-paying job at a tourist hotel. Once he graduated, the only job available was washing windows. Look around, co-workers told him, look who's getting the good jobs. The answer was whites.
He noticed, too, when he watched the American channels at Achmed's house, that some blacks seemed to live well in America. He saw black lawyers, politicians, wealthy athletes. It made him think: "It's not so bad over there. Blacks are all right."
On Aug. 21, 1994, he climbed onto a raft and made for Florida. Like his friend before him, he was intercepted by the United States Coast Guard and sent to the American base at Guantanamo. The next year, they were freed -- first Mr. Valdes, then Mr. Ruiz -- and headed straight to Miami.
 
A Shock of Identity
In Miami, Joel Ruiz discovered a world that neither American television nor Communist propaganda had prepared him for. Dogs did not growl at him and police officers did not hose him. But he felt the stares of security guards when he entered a store in a white neighborhood and the subtle recoiling of white women when he walked by.
Miami is deeply segregated, and when Mr. Ruiz arrived, he settled into one of the black urban sections, Liberty City. He had family there. His uncle Jorge Aranguren had arrived in 1980 and married an African-American. Mr. Ruiz took a job at his uncle's liquor store and started learning English.
The first thing Mr. Ruiz noticed about his new world was the absence of whites. He had seen barrios in Havana with more blacks than others, but he had never lived in a place where everybody was black. Far from feeling comfortable, he yearned for the mixing he had known in Cuba.
In Cuba, he says, he had been taught to see skin color -- in his case, the color of chocolate milk -- as not much more important than, say, the color of his eyes. But this was not Cuba. This was Miami, and in Miami, as the roughly 7 percent of the area's Cubans who are black quickly learn, skin color easily trumps nationality.
Mr. Ruiz began to understand that in earnest on Valentine's Day 1996, three months after his arrival in Miami. He had gone to dinner with his uncle Ramon Suarez at Versailles, a popular restaurant in Little Havana, a bastion of white Cuban-Americans. They took three light-skinned girlfriends along. Mr. Ruiz wore one of his nicest outfits -- black jeans and a red-and-green checked shirt. He was new to the country and unsure how to behave, but he felt comfortable at Versailles. After all, he remembers thinking, he was among Cubans. He knew the food, he could read the menu, and he could talk to the waiters.
The five sat in the back. Mr Ruiz concentrated on the conversation and on his meal. More than four years later, he remembers what he ate: a breaded steak with rice and beans and fried plantains.
Shortly before midnight, the five left in a new red Nissan. One of the women drove. Mr. Suarez sat next to her, taking pictures of his nephew and the other women laughing in back. Twenty blocks from the restaurant, four police cars, lights flashing and sirens wailing, stopped them. The woman who was driving saw them first and yelled for Mr. Suarez to drop the camera.
The officers, with weapons drawn, ordered them out of the car. Terrified, Mr. Ruiz did as he was told, spreading his legs and leaning face down on the car as the officers frisked him. It seemed like a very long time before they were allowed to go.
That was when one officer, a white Cuban-American, said something in Spanish that forever changed Mr. Ruiz's perspective on race. "I've been keeping an eye on you for a while," Mr. Ruiz recalls the officer saying. "Since you were in the restaurant. I saw you leave and I saw so many blacks in the car, I figured I would check you out."
Mr. Ruiz and his uncle stood speechless until an African-American officer approached them, apologized and sent them on their way. Afterward, his uncle said he was sure the police had been called by restaurant patrons uncomfortable with Mr. Ruiz's racially mixed group. His English teacher, an African-American, told him that white police officers liked to single out blacks driving red cars. Mr. Ruiz is not sure what to believe, but the truth is not in the details.
"Up until that day, I thought all Cubans were the same," he says. "It took a while to sink in, but that incident made me start thinking in a different way."
All at once, he had to learn how a person with dark skin should behave in this country: if an officer is following your car, do not turn your head; the police don't like it. Do not stare at other drivers, especially if they are young and white and loud. He has even learned how to walk: fast in stores, to avoid security guards; slower in the streets, so as not to attract the attention of the police. On the street, he avoids any confrontation.
He pays bills in cash because of an incident at a bank two years ago. When he asked to buy a certificate of deposit with $6,000 in lottery winnings, the bank officer, a white Cuban woman, looked puzzled, he recalls, and told him: "This is different. Your kind likes to spend the money, not save it." Since then he has not had a checking account.
And, of course, he avoids Cuban restaurants in white neighborhoods.
"In Cuba, I walked as if I owned the streets," he says. "Here I have to figure out where, what, when, everything."
He often finds himself caught between two worlds. Whites see him simply as black. African-Americans dismiss him as Cuban. "They tell me I'm Hispanic. I tell them to look at my face, my hair, my skin," he says. "I am black, too. I may speak different, but we all come from the same place."
He has started to refer to himself as Afro-Cuban, integrating, indeed embracing, the ways of his black neighbors. He enjoys what he calls black food -- fried chicken, collard greens, grits -- though he still lusts for a Cuban steak and plantains. He listens to rhythm and blues at home and at work; in the car, though, he listens to a Cuban crooner whose romantic ballads he has memorized. He dresses "black," he says, showing off his white velvet Hush Puppies and silk shirts. When he speaks English, he mimics black Miamians, but his words carry an unmistakably Spanish inflection.
Some months after the Versailles incident, when Achmed Valdes first saw his old friend, he was puzzled. "Joel has changed," he said. "He is in another world now."
 
A Seamless Transition
Pretty much anywhere else in America, Mr. Valdes would fit nicely into the niche reserved for Hispanic immigrants. If the question of race came up, he would be called a light-skinned Hispanic. Here in Miami, such distinctions do not apply. Here he is not a member of any minority group. He is Cuban and he is white.
This, after all, is a city run by Cubans, white Cubans. Not only are the mayors of Miami and Dade County Cuban, so are 7 of 13 county commissioners and 3 of 5 city commissioners. Spanish is the dominant language heard in the streets.
Mr. Valdes's transition to this world has been seamless, so much so that he does not really think of himself as an immigrant at all. His self-image is of someone well along on a sure, quick path to the middle class, someone who would be right at home in a quiet neighborhood of well-kept houses and neatly mowed lawns. And that is where he lives, with his wife, Ivette Garcia, and his mother in a one-bedroom apartment off 17th Avenue in southwest Miami.
He drives the car he likes, a 1998 Nissan that he plans to trade in soon for a newer model, says whatever is on his mind and dreams of opening his own business selling mattresses in a strip mall.
He has had to learn about punctuality and paying bills on time, but being white and Cuban, he has not had to learn how to behave. His English is tentative, but that does not matter too much here. His childhood friend may wrestle with a new identity, but when Mr. Valdes is asked how he has adapted in a strange land, he looks dumbfounded and jokes: "What are you talking about? I was born in Hialeah Hospital." Hialeah is south Florida's most Cuban city, often the first stop for Cuban exiles.
Still, he struggles the immigrant struggle. He has held a dozen jobs, from delivering Chinese food for tips to cleaning monkey cages for $6.50 an hour. Each time, he has traded up a bit, to the point where today he makes $9.60 an hour, with paid vacations and frequent overtime, to drive an 18-wheel Restonic mattress truck all over the state.
On weekends, however, he looks refreshed and energized, positively glowing with the middle-class knowledge of having earned his weekly respite.
It is 2 p.m. one recent Saturday, and Mr. Valdes is home from his soccer game. Before he is out of the shower, the apartment fills up with his crowd -- athletic white couples, all friends from Cuba. The men drive delivery trucks. The women, like his wife, work as medical or dental assistants.
The men plop themselves on the couch and watch soccer on television. The women cluster around the kitchen table, talking about the pill. They are all in their late 20's, all still childless, focused on the English classes or professional courses that will advance their careers. The pill is pharmaceutical insurance for their dreams: eventually having children, owning businesses, buying suburban homes. It is all planned.
With some pride, Mr. Valdes shows recent pictures of his house in Cuba. When he comes to one of his father with his new wife, his mother recoils at the sight of her ex-husband with his arm around a black woman. Mr. Valdes concentrates on the coconut trees he planted in the backyard years ago. "Look how tall they are," he says, as if surprised that his house, his father, his trees have gone on without him.
The talk drifts back to Cuba, as it so often does in Miami. Like much of Miami's Cuban community, Mr. Valdes is quite conservative politically. A favorite topic is how much he says he has learned about the Cuban government since arriving here -- the political prisoners, the human-rights abuses.
He listens to Miami's Cuban exile radio every day, particularly enjoying a program in which the host regularly reads the names of the men and women who have died in prison or were killed trying to overthrow the Castro government. Like most Cubans in Miami -- but unlike Mr. Ruiz and most Americans -- he believes that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor, should stay in this country rather than return to Cuba with his father.
Ninety miles and four and a half years later, Mr. Valdes has ended up back in Cuba -- albeit a new and improved Cuba.
"The only thing I miss from Cuba is being able to see the ocean from my windows," he says. "Everything else I need and want is right here. This is exactly the country that I always imagined."
 
Confined in a Comfort Zone
"Que bola, acere?" ("What's up, brother?") Joel Ruiz asks a friend who has stopped to share neighborhood gossip. It is noon on a Tuesday, Mr. Ruiz's only day off.
The friend leans in the window of Mr. Ruiz's 1989 Buick, and they talk about a shootout in front of the friend's house the day before. Drugs, for sure. Both men know the shooters from the neighborhood, and his friend is worried that they may come back. His little daughter was in the front yard when the gunfire started.
Mr. Ruiz cuts him off politely and heads to the house of another friend, a middle-aged Cuban woman who, he says, loves him like a son. What she would really love today, though, is $30 for rice and meat. "I don't have any money in the house," she says, lighting a cigarette. "It's terrible."
Having just cashed his paycheck -- $175 for six days of work at the bar -- Mr. Ruiz has money in his pocket. He peels off two 20's, and as he drives away, the woman yells after him, "Come by tonight and I'll make you dinner." He waves her off. He is in a rush. As always on these days of rest, relaxation is in short supply.
Like Achmed Valdes, Mr. Ruiz is a man of middle-class ambitions. He is studying English and wants to be a physical therapist. With the help of his uncles, he bought a house in Allapatah -- a neighborhood of dark-skinned Latinos and African-Americans -- and rents out half of it for extra income. Sure, he would like to be spending his day off hanging out, having a beer, watching sports on TV. But this day, like all his days, is circumscribed by race and the responsibilities that come with being a black man in a poor place.
For the most part, blacks are outsiders in this racially charged city, the scene of some of America's worst race riots. Blacks, especially black Cubans, lack economic and political power and resent the white Cubans who have so much of both. Steadily, relentlessly, the problems of Miami's poor have become Mr. Ruiz's, too.
When his uncle was imprisoned for drug-dealing, Mr. Ruiz was shamed and told almost no one. But the uncle had helped him get started in Miami, and so he stepped in to keep his bar going and help support his little girl. When another uncle was killed by a drunken driver and left his family with no insurance, Mr. Ruiz stepped in to help the widow and her 3-year-old daughter. He also sends money to his 11-year-old son in Cuba.
His entire routine, almost his entire life, is focused on a 20-block area around his home. Occasionally he ventures to South Beach, the fashionable zone where race is not much of an issue. Once, he went to a park in Little Havana, where Cubans, mostly retirees, gather to play dominoes and reminisce.
"But I left right away," says Mr. Ruiz, whose politics, despite a dislike of the Castro government, are more moderate than Mr. Valdes's. "I couldn't be sitting around talking about Cuba and Fidel all day."
Indeed, if his life is confined, he also feels comfortable in this place where he can be black and Cuban, where he can belong. As he drives with the windows down, he waves at people he knows, black men and women, Cubans and non-Cubans alike.
He has ambitions for the evening -- some basketball, a date with his girlfriend, a black Cuban, to see "Best Man," a film about successful black professionals.
But 4 o'clock finds him at the bar, Annie Mae's, getting things ready for the night. He puts beer in the cooler, sweeps the floors, cleans the bathrooms, polishes the tables and waits for the women who are supposed to run the bar when he is off. He waits, goes out for a while, then waits some more. Still no relief. He turns on the TV and begins watching the news.
"Have you noticed there are no blacks on television?" he says suddenly.
He should have been playing basketball by now, but instead he begins to play video tennis, his eyes fixed on the ball's glowing path through the darkness of the bar.
 
Encountering the Unknown
When Mr. Valdes arrived in Miami, friends and relatives did not just give him the obligatory immigrant lessons on how to fill out forms and apply for jobs. They also sent him a clear message about race, one shared by many, though not all, white Cubans: Blacks in America are different from Cuban blacks. Do not trust them and do not go to their neighborhoods.
Mr. Valdes has visited his old friend's home just once. In late 1995, when he heard that Mr. Ruiz had arrived in Miami, he went to see him in Liberty City. Following his friend's directions, Mr. Valdes found the place -- a small wood house set back in a huge grassy lot. A chain-link fence surrounds it, and there is an air of abandonment about it, but it does not inspire fear.
Still, he felt uneasy, the only white man in a black neighborhood. The houses were ugly, he says; the few people on the streets stared at him.
"Maybe it's just because, for us, that world is the unknown, but we felt uncomfortable," says his wife, who is as talkative as her husband is reserved. "It's like this: In Cuba I ventured out into the ocean, swimming by myself, because I knew the water, the currents. Here, when I swim, I never stray far from shore because I don't know what's out there."
One of Mr. Valdes's early jobs was delivering Ritz soda. Twice, he says, his truck was broken into in black neighborhoods. He lost 16 cases of soda and $2,000 in checks. "Everywhere else you leave the truck open and nothing happens," he says.
Those experiences have left him with no interest in the black world and not a kind word for African-Americans. "They basically have kids and go on welfare," he says. "What else is there to know?"
In Cuba, he says, he grew up with blacks. It was almost impossible not to, and so he never gave it much thought. His immediate neighbors were mostly white, and he never dated a black woman -- "I just don't find them attractive," he explains -- but he attended racially mixed schools, and several of his soccer buddies were black.
Here, his contacts with African-Americans are limited to chance encounters at work, his relationships with blacks to those he knows from Cuba. "As far as blacks," he says, "I only trust those I know, because I know they are not delinquents."
Mr. Valdes does not flinch when expressing his feelings about blacks. He is passionate and definitive, but he can also be generous and kindhearted, a man who shared his food with children in Guantanamo and regularly sends care packages to his friends, black and white, in Cuba.
Mr. Ruiz, he explains, is not his only black friend here. He is also friendly with Fernando Larduet, a man he knew marginally in Cuba but grew to like at Guantanamo. In a video of their time there that Mr. Valdes likes to watch to relive his daring escape from Cuba, there is an image of Mr. Valdes, who, for lack of a mirror, is gently shaving Mr. Larduet.
"It's not that I'm racist," Mr. Valdes says. "But even in Cuba, I had a vague sense blacks were different. That becomes more real here. In Cuba, everybody's the same, because everybody's poor. Not so here."
Soon after arriving in Miami, Mr. Valdes and his wife went to visit a friend at a hotel downtown. On their way, they made a wrong turn and ended up deep in black Miami.
"It was a cold night and it was really dark, even though it was early," his wife says, over dinner at a restaurant in Coral Gables, a fashionable and very white area of Miami. "People were walking around with sheets over their heads, and there was a fire in a trash can in every corner."
"And the houses were boarded up with pieces of wood to keep the cold away," her husband chimes in, barely lifting his eyes from his lasagna. "And people were smoking crack in the middle of the street."
She shudders. "We got out of there fast," she says.
 
In Cuba, the Limits of Equality
The soccer field where Joel and Achmed played back in Guanabo is still a busy place, a scrum of young men vying to put the ball into a goal strung together with scraps of fish netting. On this January day, the game is still an easy mix of blacks and whites.
A few miles away, in the main plaza of the University of Havana, about 200 students of all colors form a circle around a troupe of dancers. They are not clustered by race. At one point they form a human chain and then they, too, begin to dance, a rainbow of Cuba's best and brightest bathed in sunlight.
At first blush, Cuba might seem to be some kind of racial utopia. Unlike the United States, where there is limited cultural fusion between blacks and whites, Cuban culture -- from its music to its religion -- is as African as it is Spanish. But despite the genuinely easy mixing, despite the government's rhetoric, there is still a profound and open cultural racism at play.
The same black students who were part of that dancing rainbow say it is common to call someone "un negro," or "black," for doing something inappropriate. "When a man insults a woman in the street, I will shout at him, 'You are not a man, you are black!' " said Meri Casadevalle Perez, a law student who is herself black.
And a white mechanic named Armando Cortina explained that he would never want his daughters to marry a black. "Blacks are not attractive," he said.
Blacks, he added with conviction, commit the overwhelming majority of crimes in Cuba -- a statement impossible to assess in a country that seldom publishes crime statistics. Even Cuba's racial breakdown is uncertain, with a black population thought to be as large as 60 percent.
What is clear is that while the revolution tore down most economic barriers between blacks and whites, there is inequality at the top. Blacks hold few important positions in government or tourism. They are underrepresented at the university and in the nicest neighborhoods. And the few blacks who have tried to organize around the issue of civil rights have been jailed or ostracized.
Bill Brent, a former Black Panther leader who lives in Cuba, said he had arrived full of hope that the government had found the "antidote to racism." Not only does racism persist, he lamented, but black Cubans lack the racial identity to do anything about it.
"The revolution convinced everyone that they are all Cuban and that their struggles were all the same, not separate or different because of their race," he said. "If a Cuban raises his voice to say, 'I am being discriminated against because I am black,' then he would be labeled a dissident."
Still, a voice of black identity can occasionally be heard.
In a sun-scorched neighborhood outside Havana, that voice resonates in the angry rap of Tupac Shakur. It blasts from a boombox at the feet of a group of young black men propped casually against a wall, dressed in a fair imitation of American hip-hop fashion: baggy jeans, oversize T-shirts, Nike sneakers and khaki caps with the brims turned down.
Relatives in Miami sent them the clothes and the rap tapes, they say. As they listen to the music now, it is clear they have not mastered the English lyrics and have only a sketchy sense of the song's meaning. But it does not seem to matter.
"It's about the lives of black people," says 18-year-old Ulysses Oliva. "It is for us. That is why we love it."
 
Two Men in Two Miamis
When Joel Ruiz told his mother that he, too, would be joining the migration to America, she fell to her knees and begged him to stay. Only when she realized she could not change his mind did she get up, dry her tears and cook him his favorite meal -- sugar-coated ham with rice and black beans. Then she accompanied him to Guanabo and cried and cried and waved his wisp of a raft out toward the horizon.
Mr. Ruiz rarely talks about his mother; at the thought of her, his eyes seem to melt under a curtain of tears. But he says he does not for a minute regret leaving Cuba. It's not that he isn't acutely aware of the way his blackness has guided his story so far in America. He understands the bargain he has made. In Cuba, he says, he did not think about race, but he had no freedom and few options. Here he cannot forget about race, or his many responsibilities, and he has grown apart from his best friend. But instead of the limits, he focuses on the opportunities.
"To eat a good steak in Cuba, I had to steal it from the restaurant where I worked," he says. "Here, I may not want to go to Versailles because I feel uncomfortable, but I can go anywhere else I choose, and no one can stop me at the door because it is illegal and I know my rights."
Along with his identity as a black man, he has found refuge in a community that welcomes him. And he has acquired an American vocabulary to frame his Cuban past. Thinking back, he points to instances of racism that he once shrugged off.
Once, on a bus in Havana, he got into a scuffle with a man he felt had stolen his seat. Afterward, a white friend's mother told him he had behaved like a black man.
" 'Te portaste como un negro,' that's what she told me," he says. "Now, what could she possibly have meant by that, and how come I didn't see it then?"
Another time, at one of those special birthday dinners with Mr. Valdes, the maitre d'hotel stopped him at the door and asked, "And who is this?"
"What he really meant was, 'Who's the nigger?' " Mr. Ruiz says. "If that happened to me now, I would know."
Mr. Ruiz insists he does not dislike whites. He cites his friendship with Mr. Valdes as an example of his open-mindedness, just as Mr. Valdes uses their relationship to establish that he is not racist. And talking to the two men, watching them in one of their rare times together, it is impossible not to feel their fierce loyalty and genuine affection.
Yet both also know that theirs is now mostly a friendship of nostalgia. They are adults with ambitions and jobs and bills to pay, they point out, with little time to talk on the phone. When they do they seldom discuss anything beyond their families in Cuba or how busy they are with work.
When it comes to race, Mr. Ruiz will give his friend the benefit of the doubt. Mr. Ruiz is proud that when he turned 30 in February, Mr. Valdes ventured to black Miami for the party at Annie Mae's. "I understand that it is more difficult for him to cross the line than it is for me," Mr. Ruiz says. "It's not his thing and I respect that."
Mr. Valdes seems uncharacteristically thoughtful when discussing his friend's life. His friend, he says, has chosen to live as a black man rather than as a Miami Cuban.
"If I were him, I would get out of there and forget about everybody else's problems and begin my own life," he says. "If he stays it is because he wants to."
Mr. Ruiz thinks his friend cannot possibly understand. Even after he moved in April to an apartment south of Miami to escape the pressures of his needy relatives, Mr. Ruiz could not cast his family or his blackness aside. He spends most of his time back in Allapatah, near the bar and the neighbors who have embraced him.
"I know he would do anything for me if I ask him to, but the one thing he can never do is to walk in my shoes," Mr. Ruiz says of his old friend. "Achmed does not know what it means to be black."
Mr. Valdes and Mr. Ruiz have never talked about race. When told of his friend's opinion of blacks, Mr. Ruiz shifts uncomfortably in his seat.
"He said that?" Mr. Ruiz asks, lifting his eyebrows. "I don't know why he would think that blacks are delinquents. I know he doesn't think that of me, and I'm black. I've always been black." A pause. He thinks some more. "He grew up with blacks," he says. "I don't understand it. Maybe something bad happened to him. I am sure he is talking about American blacks."
Mr. Valdes has never told him about his experiences in Miami's black neighborhoods, just as Mr. Ruiz has never told him about the police outside the Versailles.
Yet Mr. Ruiz says he understands his friend's fear of crime in black neighborhoods. There are parts of Liberty City even he avoids. What he is wariest of, though, are white neighborhoods. Thinking back on that encounter outside the Versailles, he says: "Now I know enough to be grateful we weren't killed that night. The police could have thought Ramon's camera was a gun."
In Mr. Ruiz's new world, whites, even white Cubans, have become a race apart, and while they are not necessarily to be avoided, they must be watched and hardly ever trusted. He can no longer see himself in a serious relationship with a white woman. "Not for marriage," he says. "Not for life."
When he is working in the bar, the only man running a place where money, alcohol and loud music flow into the early hours of morning, the customers who catch his attention are the white men who sometimes wander in.
As he sat at a corner table right before Christmas, a black plastic Santa smiling down at him, Mr. Ruiz was relaxed, debating whether to leave for a quick basketball game or stay to help out.
Just then, two white men walked in. It was easy to tell they were Cuban. They walked as Mr. Ruiz does, that chest-first Cuban walk. Mr. Ruiz perked up. He trailed the men with his eyes. They ordered beers, and as they walked over to the pool table they were momentarily blinded by the light reflecting from a hanging ball of mirrored glass. Averting their eyes, they looked toward the darkness. There they found Mr. Ruiz's cold stare. He stared them down until they left.
"You see," he said, relaxing again, "this is why I can't leave this place. You never know who is going to walk in."
 
About the Series
 
Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race still ignites political debates -- over Civil War flags, for example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of race relations seems muted by a full-employment economy and by a sense, particularly among many whites, that the time of large social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports arenas, in pop culture and at worship, and especially in the workplace. These encounters -- race relations in the most literal, everyday sense -- make up this series of reports, the outcome of a yearlong examination by a team of Times reporters.
 
This series will continue over the next five weeks and conclude with a special issue of The New York Times Magazine on July 16.
 
The articles in this series can also be read at The New York Times on the Web. The site offers forums in which visitors can discuss the articles and the racial issues in their own lives and respond to a questionnaire. Photo essays, video and audio presentations -- including comments by people from around the nation -- and lesson plans from The Learning Network are also available:

HEADLINE: NEW ECONOMY;
Acquisitions by the technology companies of start-up small-fry offer a sampler on how deals can go wrong.

BYLINE: By Seth Schiesel 

 BODY:
IN no sector of the technology business have more companies with less revenue been acquired for richer sums than in communications equipment. It is almost routine for obscure start-ups with little or no revenue to be acquired for hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in stock by industry giants unable to keep up with all the changes in communications technology.
Just last week, for instance, Lucent Technologies agreed to pay $4.5 billion in stock for Chromatis Networks, which is developing technology to enhance the capacity and capabilities of fiber optic networks within cities. 
 On the surface, many of these deals look good for everyone, and they often are. The buyers can move into new areas. The entrepreneurs become rich, as do the venture capitalists who buy into the target company. But not every deal can be a success, and as the pace of acquisitions grows, so may the number of bad deals -- like the examples below, all of which offer lessons on the risks of the get-bigger-by-buying strategy.
 
CIENA-OMNIA, $429 MILLION, MARCH '99
Ciena is a leader in optical communications equipment. But when Ciena agreed to buy Omnia Communications last spring, it was trying to move into a new market: data networking. Omnia was developing products using a technology called asynchronous transfer mode, which uses optical networks but is not itself an optical system.
So far, Omnia has generated essentially zero revenue for Ciena, and few analysts foresee any such revenue any time soon.
Ciena says that customers simply do not want to buy Omnia's sort of product. That means either that Ciena badly misgauged the market or that its sales force, tailored to optical gear, has not figured out how to sell Omnia's technology. (Ciena's acquisition last spring of Lightera, an optical systems company, has gone much better.)
"We don't expect significant revenue this year from that product, so that's a disappointment to us," said Denny Bilter, a Ciena spokesman.
Lesson: Be careful when expanding beyond your core market and make sure your sales force can distribute the new product.
 
SIEMENS-ARGON, $240 MILLION, MARCH '99
When Siemens of Germany decided to become serious about data networking last year, it bought three United States start-ups -- Redstone Communications, Castle Networks and Argon Networks -- and put them into a new division called Unisphere. Redstone, which makes gear that pools data traffic at the edge of big networks, has been a big success. Castle, which wants to develop the next-generation of voice telephone switches, seems to be making headway. And then there is Argon.
When Siemens agreed to acquire it, Argon wanted to make an ultrahigh-capacity switch for the core of big networks using both asynchronous transfer mode and Internet protocol formats. That was pretty much the last anyone heard about Argon.
One problem was that Argon's technology did not mesh smoothly with Redstone's. Unisphere is trying to work out the kinks.
Siemens might be faulted for not recognizing this problem before spending hundreds of millions of its shareholders' dollars on Argon. But at the time, other European communications giants like Alcatel and Ericsson were rushing into the data communications market, and Siemens apparently did not want to be left behind. Unisphere executives declined to comment.
Lesson: Even if the competition is making noise, take the time to do technical due-diligence research. Moving recklessly can cost a lot of time and money later.
 
TELLABS-NETCORE, $575 MILLION, JUNE '99
In a move somewhat similar to the Ciena-Omnia deal, Tellabs, a leader in optical transmission, tried to move into a new market by acquiring NetCore Systems -- a company that wanted to build high-capacity routers using asynchronous transfer mode and Internet protocol formats for the core of big networks.
But NetCore's technology did not work as well as Tellabs had anticipated, and it is not clear when the deal may start paying off.
"In NetCore's case you have a combination of a less-than-elegant integration of the company into Tellabs, probably a product that was not as mature as Tellabs' management thought it was, and a marketplace that got pretty competitive," said Steven D. Levy, chief communications equipment analyst for Lehman Brothers.
Investors judge older companies like Tellabs mainly on the growth of their per-share earnings. With a market value of only $27 billion, Tellabs cannot throw its stock around as aggressively as bigger companies can, without risking dilution of its earnings. That has led some experts to believe that Tellabs is simply afraid to pony up the money necessary to acquire private companies with the best technology. Tellabs declined to comment.
Lesson: Be careful expanding into new markets but also remember that spending too little may yield little in results.
 
CISCO-MONTEREY, $500 MILLION, AUGUST '99
Cisco Systems' acquisition of Monterey Networks, which makes gear that links optical communications networks at high speeds, appears set to become much more successful than the Omnia, Argon and NetCore deals. But it is not a home run just yet.
And home runs, or at least doubles, are what the market has come to expect from Cisco, almost surely the most successful corporate acquirer the last decade. On the day the Monterey deal was announced, Cisco also said it was buying Cerent, a different sort of optical networking company, for about $6.9 billion. That deal has definitely been a home run; Cerent may well generate $1 billion in revenue for Cisco this year.
But the Monterey deal has just about fallen off the radar screen. People close to Cisco have said the company's original internal target of moving Monterey's products into the market this spring was a result of unwarranted optimism within the Monterey team.
Cisco still has not announced any sales of Monterey's systems, though people close to the company said last week that they expected announcements of some tests with major communications carriers shortly.
Lesson: Even acquisition champs like Cisco can have an off day. That is one reason Cisco, using a portfolio approach, does so many deals.
 
LUCENT-NEXABIT, $900 MILLION, JUNE '99
In this deal, Lucent did not seem to get what it thought it was buying. But at least it got something of value, and even the original vision may finally be coming into focus.
Nexabit was supposed to catapult Lucent to immediate leadership in the market for ultrahigh-capacity Internet routers -- devices that help direct data traffic. According to many communications experts, it turns out that Nexabit's technology is actually better-suited for transmitting information in a format known as frame relay rather than the conventional Internet's protocol format.
The Nexabit deal could still work. This week, Lucent plans to announce that VCities, a small communications carrier based in Dallas, has agreed to buy the Internet protocol version of the Nexabit product.
Lesson: The lesson from Lucent and all these companies is that nothing can replace thorough research before a deal and nose-to-the-grindstone execution afterward. With the pace of acquisitions accelerating, it is only getting easier to make bad deals.

HEADLINE: Merger Plan Facing Review

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, June 4

 BODY:
America Online's $165 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc. faces an extended review by European Union regulators, though the transaction is unlikely to be blocked, analysts and lawyers said.
The European Commission is scheduled to decide by Wednesday whether to approve the transaction, which would form the world's largest media and Internet company, or to examine it for four more months. The agency has until June 14 to make a similar decision in a related case, the proposed merger of Time Warner's recorded-music unit with that of the EMI Group. 
 America Online faces strong Internet competitors in Europe, including T-Online International and Terra Networks, and Time Warner must battle rivals in magazines and films, analysts said. This contrasts with the companies' operations in the United States, where regulators may have more concern about AOL's position as the leading online service and Time Warner's ownership of cable networks, they said.
"The impact in the E.U. is difficult to see: AOL is not the only distributor, and Time Warner is not the only content provider," said Alex Nourry, a partner in the law firm of Clifford Chance in London. "On its own, AOL-Time Warner is basically a U.S. deal."
In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission are reviewing the deal, which was announced in January.
The National Association of Broadcasters suggested the F.C.C. approve the merger only if the company's cable franchises agree to carry rival broadcasters' services. Consumer groups have said the transaction should be approved only if the company sells Internet and media services like Time Warner Entertainment and its stake in the high-speed Internet service Road Runner.
Because Time Warner does not control any cable networks in Europe, concerns about the combination's ability to block media companies' access to cable and Internet customers will not be such a problem, analysts said.
Still, European regulators may want a closer look because of the new company's size -- it would be worth almost three times the second-largest media concern, Walt Disney -- and because of the Microsoft antitrust case, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Ethernet Finds a New Level;
Souped-Up Versions of Familiar Networking Format Promise Swift Improvements in Communications

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., June 4

 BODY:
Several years ago, with tongue only partially planted in cheek, Intel's chairman, Andrew Grove, made an observation: unlike the chip industry, where processing speeds double every 18 months or so, the moribund telecommunications world seemed to double its speed only about once a century.
But here on a test bench at Agilent Technologies is clear evidence that may give lie to Grove's Law -- evidence that the nation's communications networks could be poised for sweeping improvements in speed and efficiency that could rival the breakneck pace of breakthroughs in the chip industry. 
 Using inexpensive high-speed semiconductor components, lasers and mirrors, a small group of Agilent researchers have fashioned a palm-size device capable of shuttling data at 10 billion bits -- or 10 gigabits -- a second.
And the Agilent device, known as a transceiver, does not rely on the costly, complex optical-network formats that telephone companies and Internet backbone carriers typically require to achieve such transmission speeds. Instead, the device uses a new souped-up version of the homely Ethernet format that has been the simple, reliable mainstay of office computer networks for nearly three decades.
But this is not your father's Ethernet; it is Ethernet 3,000 thousand times as fast as the original versions. At the rate the technology is evolving, some analysts expect office desktop computers to soon have access to data networks with speed and power formerly available only in the nation's best research laboratories -- but at prices no higher than today's standard business-office Internet connections.
"This has caught the world by surprise," said Waguih Ishak, director of Agilent's communications and optical research laboratory. "Three years ago, very few people were talking about one-gigabit Ethernet. And people were laughing at us when we talked about 10-gigabit optical networking."
No one is laughing at Agilent now, or at the other companies developing new Ethernet technologies. A mad dash is under way as dozens of start-ups and established giants race to put the 27-year-old Ethernet networking standard on an ever faster price-performance improvement curve.
While 10-gigabit Ethernet transceivers remain mainly at the testing stage, one-gigabit transceivers are already becoming the preferred way to link the new optical switches that are becoming the standard way to route information over the Internet. (Optical components use flashes of laser light, rather than electronic pulses, to convey the on-off semaphore of digital information.)
"The cost of our one-gigabit transceivers will fall below $5 by 2004," said Brian E. Lemoff, an Agilent designer. That number is significant because $5 is roughly the current price of a 100-megabit Ethernet transceiver -- one capable of moving data at only 100 million bits a second.
Industry analysts and executives say the rapid improvements in Ethernet -- and the resulting increase in bandwidth, or transmission speeds, of fiber optic networks -- could bring a frenzied pace of change to the telecommunications world similar to the microprocessor chip's revolutionary impact on the computer industry in the 1980's.
"The beauty of all of this is the cost of optical components is now following the same declining cost curve that drove the semiconductor industry," said Geoff Baehr, chief network officer of Sun Microsystems.
As prices plunge for the new high-speed Ethernet, it could become what economists call a disruptive technology -- one that forces established data communications companies to alter their business models, while creating lucrative new opportunities for fast-moving start-up companies. And the victims of the disruptive technology, according to the data-networking upstarts, will be the nation's giant telephone companies, which have large investments to protect in more costly and complex telecommunications and voice technologies.
Ethernet engineers now routinely cite Clayton M. Christensen's thesis about the power of so-called disruptive technologies in his book "The Innovator's Dilemma" (Harvard Business School Press, 1997).
"Gigabit Ethernet is a totally disruptive technology that until recently looked like a toy" to the telephone companies, said David Isenberg, an industry consultant and a former AT&T engineer. "Now it's going to eat their lunch before they have time to turn around."
That role reversal has not escaped Robert Metcalfe, a co-inventor of the original three-megabit Ethernet standard at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in 1973.
"The guys at the telephone companies have all read Christensen's book by now," Mr. Metcalfe said, "but they're like deer caught in the headlights."
Telecommunications executives, of course, take a dim view of such hyperbole. They note that established network companies have ready access to Ethernet technology, and will not hesitate to use it. They also contend that many of the keys to better networks have less to do with pushing technical boundaries in the laboratory than with mundane issues like obtaining rights of way for fiber optic cables and cellular towers.
And the big companies may not be as beholden to their installed network equipment as the upstarts may assume, according to David C. Nagle, AT&T's chief technology officer and president of AT&T Labs.
"New players do have an advantage," Mr. Nagle said. "But increasingly, we and everyone else are learning how to respond quickly to these disruptive technologies."
The new players include aggressive start-ups like Yipes Communications of San Francisco, which is building a nationwide data-networking service based on a gigabit Ethernet optical network. Customerss, primarily businesses, could use it for any number of current and future high-speed applications, possibly including combined voice and data communications and TV-quality video.
Yipes has raised almost $91 million from venture capitalists and partners and plans to sell Internet connection services in more than 20 metropolitan regions in the United States by the end of the year. The company has moved quickly by leasing unused fibers from other companies and assembling networks in the nation's largest metropolitan areas. Early customers include the Silicon Valley law firm of Fenwick & West, the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and Front Range Internet, a Colorado Internet service provider.
The company says it can give customers connections over optical fiber networks at data speeds from one megabit to one gigabit using Ethernet -- and can do so while significantly underpricing its traditional telecommunications industry competitors.
"To compete, they are going to have to cannibalize their existing customer base," said Jerry Parrick, chief executive of Yipes and a former telecommunications industry executive who has run data networking businesses at the regional telephone companies Pacific Bell and U S West.
According to an estimate by the Del'Orro Group, a telecommunications market research firm in Portola Valley, Calif., the hardware cost for conventional networking equipment at the OC-192 standard -- the optical network format used by phone companies -- was $6,783 for each gigabit. That compares with $350 for a 10-gigabit optical Ethernet connection.
"This makes so much sense because we are able to avoid the multiple layers of what is in effect scar tissue" in telephone companies' networks, said Eric Benamou, chairman and chief executive of the 3Com Corporation. 3Com was the company Mr. Metcalfe founded to commercialize the Ethernet standard in in the 1970's; he left in 1990.
In the beginning, Ethernet was a simple data standard for letting groups of computers communicate within a single office building, or at most an office-park campus, at a top speed of 10 million bits a second. But improvements in the technology now allow for Ethernet networks of speeds of 10 billion bits a second, reaching some 30 miles. As a result, Ethernet has become competitive with the main network techniques now used by the big telecommunications companies.
Those techniques include asynchronous transfer mode, which supports speeds from 1.5 megabits to the gigabit range. Another is a format known as synchronous optical network, or Sonet (pronounced like the short-verse form), which supports data rates ranging from from 51 megabits up to nearly 2.5 gigabits.
The main advantage that asynchronous transfer and Sonet hold over Ethernet is that they offer rich network management -- software that enables engineers to carefully control and monitor communications traffic, be it voice or data. Ethernet provides for only skimpy network management, although many companies are working on more robust management software packages for use with Ethernet.
But in other ways, Ethernet is much more flexible than asynchronous transfer or Sonet. Executives at Yipes, for example, say they will have a significant advantage over the data services offered by traditional telecommunications companies because the Yipes network administrators will be able to dial the amount of bandwidth a customer receives, up or down, quickly on demand.
This flexibility might permit a small Web site, for example, to add capacity quickly and temporarily for a special event, or make it possible for an individual in an office to set up a high-quality teleconferencing connection for a short period.
But in terms of flexibility, the biggest advantage of the new gigabit Ethernet services like Yipes could be the ability to add each new customer to the network with an industry-standard Ethernet connector -- similar to the small circuit boards or plug-in devices that already enable a new PC to be quickly added to an office network or allow a consumer's home computer to be attached to the local cable television system. Telephone companies typically have a much more complicated task in determining how best to connect each new data customer to the local network.
"This makes it a seamless interconnection," said Michael Kleeman, chief technology officer of Aerie Networks, a broadband network start-up in Denver, which plans to use Ethernet technology. "There are no additional boxes."
The most bitter struggle between the new Ethernet data networking upstarts and the traditional data networks may involve voice traffic, currently the revenue backbone of the telephone industry.
Telephone industry technologies have been designed to ensure that data packets carrying voice telephone calls have priority passage through the network, even during peak traffic periods. That capability adds to the complexity and cost of conventional telecommunications data networks, but it also gives voice conversations a reliable sound quality that Ethernet or standard Internet formats cannot yet match.
But service providers like Yipes intend to plunge in to the lucrative voice market by guaranteeing customers a minimum quality of service -- whether for voice or data -- that the companies say they will be able to meet by designing their networks to handle bursts of high-data traffic.
For Mr. Metcalfe, the Ethernet inventor, the venerable technology's new ascent offers a lesson that transcends cost savings. In the current era, where approaches to technical standards in computing range from Microsoft's proprietary control to the free-software approach represented by the Linux operating system, Mr. Metcalfe says that Ethernet illustrates a third way.
Ethernet became a universal standard, he said, because of the licensing practices Xerox adopted in the 1970's. Xerox licensed its Ethernet patents at modest terms, ensuring that it won the standards battle with competing technologies at the time, promoted by companies like I.B.M.
With licenses easily obtained, companies were free to devise the best ways to develop commercial Ethernet-based products.
"What Ethernet is today is a business model based on open standards and individually owned implementations," he said. "It has created a world where there is rapid innovation and fierce competition."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
What Will Happen to the Baby? Among Other Cosmic, One-Act Questions

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Leslie Caputo's "Birth Marks," which closes the first half of the third and final installment of Marathon 2000, the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual festival of new plays, has enough situational complexity to make you want a second act. As it opens, a young woman named Terry -- she's maybe 18 or 20 -- has just given birth to a baby in a hospital on the Lower East Side. Played by Jenna Lamia, she's blond, lovely, Irish Catholic and alone. Her husband, who is Hispanic, hasn't shown up at the hospital, and he never will.
Instead she is visited by her disapproving, bigoted and spineless father (Martin Shakar), who brings letters from his wife to read to her, letters that begin, "To my disgraced daughter." She is also visited by her husband's sister, Yvonne (Nicole Gomez), who is both a spitfire party girl and a genuinely concerned friend, and by her husband's brother, Luis (Ramon de Ocampo), a dopey kid who has been dispatched to find the missing spouse and failed his mission in spectacularly dunderheaded fashion. 
 The plot issue is what will happen to the baby, and the play could stand expansion to more fully simmer the emotional stew that is cooked up in a mere 40 minutes. But the pungency of this small play is in its rendering of the cross-cultural and cross-generational conflicts in a working-class pocket of the city.
From the opening conversation, in which Terry's father speaks to his daughter with an Irish accent and Terry responds in New Yawkese -- "her" is pronounced "huh" -- the ingrained obstacles to every relationship in this play are painfully and realistically evident.
The dialogue is written with a sure ear, no mean feat considering the vernacular variety, and all the actors, but particularly Ms. Lamia and Ms. Gomez, give their characters the sense that for all their will to connect, they're speaking in separate tongues. By the end, an entire neighborhood, its ethnic mix thrown together by economics and circumscribed by limited dreams, has been evoked by four people in a hospital room.
"Birth Marks" is the highlight among the five bite-size plays that make up the program, which runs through June 11. The others are less ambitious, though each has its moments to recommend.
Even "Proof," by Jeff Reich, the play that closes the evening by running bizarrely off the track of its initially comic premise, does have a great beginning. In it a professor of neuroscience at an undistinguished college takes out the frustration of a life of academic obscurity on a classroom full of first-year students. The scene takes the form of his opening lecture, and it is hilariously, farcically bitter, complete with a slide show in which all the slides are upside down. (You wouldn't think an upside-down goldfish would look so weirdly funny, but it does.)
The professor, Nathan Simpson, is played with a delicious comic sense of self-loathing distress by Brad Bellamy. But alas the play doesn't know what to make of the situation it has wrought; it devolves into a windy confrontation between Simpson and his pompous mentor (Forest Compton).
The other plays include "The Final Interrogation of Ceausescu's Dog," by Warren Leight, the playwright's first work on a New York stage since his "Side Man" won the Tony Award for best play last year. An amusing trifle, it depicts the canine companion of the deposed Romanian dictator being questioned by a suddenly liberated citizen. His efforts to crack the dog's smugly privileged demeanor cause him no end of frustration, which Ean Sheehy does a nice job of letting bubble up until he cracks.
Mr. Sheehy has the thankless role, here, however: as the dog, Alexander R. Scott, dressed in a houndstooth jacket and speaking in an Eastern European-accented pidgin English, is the star of the show. "I am simple dog," he says, whenever he's unmoved to respond, an anthropomorphism that makes you giggle every time.
"Alien Boy," by Will Scheffer, is a monologue about a 13-year-old coming to recognize his homosexuality. It has a vivid central anecdote -- the confused boy writes to a psychiatrist, picked out of the phone book, pleading for treatment -- and the performance, by David Greenspan, is an idiosyncratic one, well thought out both physically and verbally. But the play itself has too many familiar signposts -- mother issues, "The Boys in the Band" -- not to feel a bit shopworn.
The play that opens the evening, "Cannibals" by Heather Dundas, is a comic reverie about Jane, a suburban mother who wonders how she got that way. "Here's what I don't understand," she says, stepping out from behind the wheel of her car, in which she's driving her clamorous two children and their friends to school. "Ten years ago I was a bisexual living in New Orleans."
In scenes that flip back and forth between Jane's stressed daydreams and the reality of her stressed morning, she persuasively reveals the understandable conflict between what her life might have been and what it is. The script is detailed enough to make Jane a real character, and in the lead role, Diana LaMar is singular enough to rouse a potentially hackneyed circumstance to the level of a sympathetic predicament.
The switchbacks are directed with comic efficiency by India Cooper, even if the final image, Jane drawing a line down the front of her face with lipstick, is on the heavy-handed side. The main difficulty with the play is in its use of full-grown actors as 7-year-olds and a 3-year-old. Despite their ardent efforts here, the actors come across as such ill-assigned performers generally do, not as children but mentally deficient adults.

HEADLINE: A Magazine Giant Weighs In on Internet Business

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
John Huey is a magazine editor known for his Southern charm and pit-bull mentality: when he has an idea between his teeth, he might be pleasant about it, but he will never let go.
Two years ago, Mr. Huey, managing editor of Fortune magazine, decided that Time Inc. ought to start or purchase a magazine about Internet business. He flew to San Francisco and met with editors and publishers at The Industry Standard, Red Herring and Business 2.0, deciding who or what or whether to buy. 
 No luck.
"We tried to see if there was a way that we each could satisfy the other's goals, and we basically decided we could not," Mr. Huey said.
Since he could not buy 'em, he joined 'em. The result is E-Company Now, a new monthly magazine from Time Inc. that Mr. Huey said cost less to start "than it would have ever cost to pay the Internet multiples everyone was asking for."
With the first issue, released three weeks ago, Mr. Huey and his editors jumped, some would say belatedly, into a fray of magazines that besides The Standard and Red Herring includes titles like Upside, Fast Company and -- take a deep breath -- the newly rechristened Ziff-Davis Smart Business for the New Economy.
And no one expects the dot-com advertising boom to last forever. What's more, Mr. Huey must keep E-Company Now from leeching content from Fortune, its inspirational parent.
But none of this daunts Mr. Huey. "I'm relatively confident this is going to work," he said in an interview last week from his home in Atlanta. (Mr. Huey prefers to commute to work from Georgia most weeks than to live in New York City.) "We figured out about two years ago that the whole Internet story was moving out of the realm of being a tech story alone. But we never wanted Fortune to drill down so deep into the subject that it became a magazine just about the Internet."
E-Company Now may soon have something else going for it that the other magazines do not, words that would make any Internet-magazine mogul's heart go pitter-pat: America Online and Time Warner.
Most of the other magazines in the field do not have the benefit of Time Inc.'s expertise in consumer magazines or the marketing clout of AOL, which has given the magazine special placement on choice CompuServe, AOL and Netscape sites. So far, those sites have generated more than 30,000 subscriptions, said Ned Desmond, editor in chief of E-Company Now.
Mr. Huey said the advantages of Time Inc.'s backing were obvious. "We are not running around trying to raise a new round of financing or preparing an I.P.O.," he said. "We're running around trying to get the best editors and writers we can."
Then again, most of the magazines about Internet business -- even those that are still raising financing and preparing initial public offerings -- are thriving and expanding.
Business 2.0, which is published by Imagine Media in San Francisco, shifted from a monthly to a twice-a-month publication three issues ago. Red Herring, published by Red Herring Communications, will do the same in November; its June issue is 628 pages. Ad pages for The Industry Standard, the weekly from IDG, are up almost 500 percent against last year and have almost surpassed those of People magazine. Its issues often reach 360 pages, including both advertising and editorial material.
Of course, the magazines have been buoyed by the fact that the market for advertising pages promoting dot-com companies has grown exponentially the last three years. Online, Internet and e-commerce companies spent $113.2 million on advertising in American magazines in 1997, according to Competitive Media Reporting. That climbed to $153.6 million in 1998 and then surged to $687.3 million last year.
But the tide has shifted in recent months, as some of the speculative excess in technology and Internet stocks has subsided; many of those advertisers can no longer afford to spend so freely and no longer need to reach the venture capitalists who thumb through the Internet magazines. Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau, said the flow of dot-com advertising would soon abate and probably fall steeply.
"The shift is toward more moderated spending and more effective spending," Mr. LeFurgy said. "You were getting to absurd lengths with some of these magazines as it was. They were getting out of control in terms of the number of ad pages relative to editorial. That will change."
Mr. Huey said he had already thought of that.
"We're not naive about advertising," he said. "We have, along with the dot-com advertising, consumer advertising and business advertising, liquor, cars, fashion. Yes, we will take every dot-com ad that can pay for it, but our business plan is not built on soaking up an ever-growing pool of dot-com advertising."
The real battle among the Internet magazines may play out not in terms of advertising pages, but in the more mundane sphere of old-fashioned circulation. While some of the Internet business magazines have significant circulations, most remain fairly small. Ziff-Davis Smart Business for the New Economy has a circulation of 1,048,941, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, but that was all gained when the magazine was still known as PC Computing. (Ziff-Davis repositioned the magazine to a business-strategy magazine with the May issue.) And Fast Company's circulation is 402,603, according to the circulation bureau.
But the rest of the magazines have circulations closer to that of Model Railroader, and many give away the bulk of their subscriptions free.
Upside, which is not audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, reports circulation of 257,000, of which 15,000 are paid. Gini Talmadge, president of Upside Media, said that the subscriptions were given away to qualified readers, meaning readers who have filled out a survey.
"So our subscriber list reads like a Who's Who of the Internet," she said.
The Industry Standard, which also is not audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, gives away half of its weekly 150,000 circulation to qualified subscribers.
Mr. Huey said that competition like The Industry Standard, Business 2.0 or Red Herring was not a threat to his new magazine, which has guaranteed advertisers a circulation of 200,000 readers.
"The Industry Standard says they are a must-read for anybody doing business on the Internet," Mr. Huey said. "If that's true, why does it have a circulation of 150,000 and half of it they give away? They are the hot trade book. And that's a very good position to have. But look at us. We want to be a national business magazine that is informed by the Valley."
Jonathan Weber, editor in chief of The Industry Standard, does not dispute the circulation figures. But he said paid circulation was growing "at a healthy pace" and that "substantial increases" would be announced soon. He dismissed Mr. Huey's other criticisms.
There are potential pitfalls for Mr. Huey's and Mr. Desmond's magazine. Editors of competing magazines are quick to criticize Time Inc. for coming late to the game.
"They are two years late to the party," said James Daly, editor in chief of Business 2.0. "They have to do something that other magazines are not doing, and there's not a lot of space left."
Another potential problem is that E-Company Now is a monthly in a field now almost exclusively on weekly or twice-a-month schedules. But Mr. Huey said the magazine's Web site, with its daily columnists and a business-to-business component, would help keep readers plugged in. He suggested the shift to twice-a-month publication by Business 2.0 and Red Herring was part of a ploy to get more advertising.
"It seems pretty obvious to me what that's about," he said. "Our argument is that they are not doing the frequency thing for the reader."
About Mr. Huey's theory, Ted Gramkow, publisher of Red Herring, said, "I don't think so." He countered, "This is John Huey's way, and Fortune and Time Warner's way, of attracting dollars that have been beyond their high price in Fortune. This is a pure advertising play."
Of course, it would be hard for any publisher to argue that readers want even more Internet magazines. But the titles continue to proliferate. Business 2.0 will start an as-yet-unnamed offshoot in October, a business lifestyle magazine whose editor in chief is a former editor of Harper's Bazaar and In Style.
The former publisher of Office Products International is introducing line56, an Internet-business magazine whose title was inspired by the Shakespearian soliloquy that begins with the words "To be or not to be," which appear in line 56 of Act III of "Hamlet."
IDG, The Industry Standard's parent company, has just introduced Darwin: Business Evolving in the Information Age.
"It's getting to be way too much for me," Mr. LeFurgy of the Internet Advertising Bureau said. "I have total information anxiety. The magazines just stack up and stack up in my office now."

British Airways Is Seen In Early Talks With KLM
Amid renewed pressure in the airline industry to consolidate, British Airways has held informal merger talks with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, executives close to both companies said.
While the executives stressed that the discussions are preliminary, they underscore the frenzy among airline operators to seek partners hoping to increase profit in an industry that has seen its margins steadily erode. The informal talks take place amid the proposed acquisition of US Airways by UAL for $4.3 billion and overtures from AMR to Northwest about combining their businesses. Page C2.

Technology Deals That Went Wrong
In no sector of the technology business have more companies with less revenue been acquired for richer sums than in communications equipment. On the surface, many of these deals look good for everyone, and they often are. But not every deal can be a success, and as the pace of acquisitions grows, so may the number of bad deals.

Online Integration, Except for Taxes
Many traditional retailers have vowed that by integrating their Web operations into their physical stores, they will eventually bury Internet-only merchants. But even as these companies preach the gospel of Internet integration to the public, some of the best-known merchants are telling government regulators that their Internet and physical-world operations are distinct and separate businesses -- and therefore should enjoy the tax advantages of maintaining separate operations.

Movie to Be Transmitted Digitally
On Tuesday, for the first time ever, a movie will be digitally transmitted across the country over the Internet and then digitally projected to a cinema audience, going from the studio in Hollywood to a theater in Atlanta without ever touching film.

Independent booksellers, which have fought a two-decades war against chains and, more recently, online booksellers, are seeking to gain ground on the Internet with two large-scale Web sites. On June 6, the American Booksellers Association will introduce Booksense.com, a "hub site" for hundreds of individual sites created and maintained by local stores. Next to come, in early July, is Contentville, in which about 40 of the most respected booksellers will provide editorial content. "Booksense.com and Contentville can all act to remind consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice," said Roxanne Coady of R. J.

HEADLINE: Ineffective Humanitarian Aid

 BODY:
Humanitarian disasters have emerged as the most complex challenges facing American foreign policy. There has been strenuous debate over whether America should get involved when there is famine in Somalia or Sudan, genocide in Rwanda, mass killings in East Timor or a refugee exodus in Kosovo. What gets less attention is the question of how to take effective action when we do get involved. An internal State Department report provides an unusually frank assessment of why American action has sometimes been slow or ineffective.
The study was directed by Morton Halperin, head of the policy planning staff at the State Department, and James Michel, counselor to the Agency for International Development. It examines how Washington responded to three man-made humanitarian disasters -- stemming from armed conflicts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Sudan -- and one natural disaster, Hurricane Mitch in Central America. Although the report finds much to applaud, it is also a tale of poor coordination, missions being duplicated or falling through the cracks, and confusion inside the administration and the private humanitarian groups that sometimes cannot be sure with which agency to work. Confusion over which part of the government was leading the response to Hurricane Mitch, for example, led to delays in assessing the damage and getting aid to Central America. Most important, at many times when American policy was made, no one was present to remind officials of the humanitarian consequences. 
 The report can be read as a plea for establishing a single office to coordinate humanitarian assistance, with a chief who would participate in high-level meetings the next time we are faced with a Kosovo or Sudan. This is an eminently sensible recommendation for the next administration, which is sure to find itself wrestling with new famines, hurricanes and wars.
The authors of this unclassified assessment have stirred grumbling inside the State Department for their public bluntness, especially because their criticisms have received most of the attention. But they could have hoped for little impact if they had kept their views classified, and the issue is one that deserves airing. Mr. Halperin and Mr. Michel have performed a service by identifying the shortcomings in America's humanitarian programs, and by allowing the public to know.

HEADLINE: Merton H. Miller, 77, Dies; Economist Who Won Nobel

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Merton H. Miller, a Nobel award winner in economics whose passionate belief in free markets helped him to develop what are now widely recognized guidelines for valuing corporations, died on Saturday at his home in Chicago. He was 77.
He died of lymphoma, from which he had suffered since 1997, said his wife, Katherine. While he did his pioneering work in the late 1950's as a young professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, he spent most of his career, since 1961, on the faculty of the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, where he taught until this school year. 
 Corporate finance in the 1950's was virtually untouched by academia, left mostly to the instincts and seat-of-the-pants judgments of the nation's executives and Wall Street. But as American companies grew and the stock and bond markets that served them became more complicated and faster moving, pioneers like Mr. Miller began to develop formal guidelines, and corporate finance soon became a new branch of economics.
The research that won Mr. Miller the Nobel in economic science in 1990 found in essence that the mix of stock and debt that a company used to finance its operations did not determine the value of the company in the financial markets. Too much debt might make a company's stock riskier because of the earnings that must be earmarked to pay interest on the debt. But investors could protect themselves through arbitrage, which is a process of buying and selling stocks and bonds to alter their mix of debt and equity.
Mr. Miller published these findings in a 1958 paper co-written with Franco Modigliani, who was then teaching at Carnegie Mellon but soon moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During a lecture, Mr. Modigliani touched on views already taking shape in Mr. Miller's head. Mr. Miller then took the lead in carrying out the research, overcoming some early skepticism from Mr. Modigliani that markets could arbitrage so efficiently.
Recounting the story in his book "Capital Ideas: The Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street" (The Free Press, 1992), Peter L. Bernstein reported that Mr. Miller stood his ground. He was "a passionate believer in the power of free markets to forge optimal and predictable outcomes," Mr. Bernstein wrote, and quoted Mr. Miller as saying: "I believed it. I felt from the very beginning that this is right."
The 1958 paper and one three years later elaborating on the theory raised enormous debate. The theory required too many unrealistic assumptions, some argued. Whatever their shortcomings, the findings that brought Mr. Miller a Nobel helped to lift inhibitions on corporate borrowing. The high-yield securities called junk bonds flourished later, as a result, as did arbitrage. And in later years, a friendship developed between Mr. Miller and Michael R. Milken, the investment banker who promoted junk bonds.
Throughout his life, Mr. Miller believed fervently in the power of free markets, unhindered by government -- an unusual stance for economists in his generation. Born in Boston on May 16, 1923, the only child of Joel and Sylvia Miller, he grew up during the Depression, an experience that won over others to the teachings of John Maynard Keynes, the British economist who gave government spending a key role in stimulating an economy.
After graduation from Harvard in 1943, where he had majored in economics, Mr. Miller worked in Washington for the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve. A chance encounter that summer brought Mr. Miller into contact with George Stigler, a conservative economist who later became the first professor at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business to win a Nobel prize in economics. The two became fast friends.
A second mentor, Fritz Machlup, another free-market proponent, drew Mr. Miller to Johns Hopkins University, where he earned a doctorate in 1952, and after two semesters as a teacher at the London School of Economics, he joined Carnegie Mellon. He formally retired from the University of Chicago in 1993 but continued to teach and advise graduate students.
"He had his formative training when Keynesianism was at its height, in the 1940's and 1950's, and he evolved into a proponent of market solutions," said his wife, who was a graduate student in economics when Mr. Miller married her in 1970, a year after the death of his first wife, Eleanor. In addition to his wife, Mr. Miller is survived by three daughters from his first marriage: Margot Horn and Pamela Chwedyk of Chicago and Louise Lorber of Evanston, Ill., and two grandsons.
In his later years, Mr. Miller focused on regulatory issues and became involved in the private sector, serving on several corporate boards, as a director of the Chicago Board of Trade in the early 1980's and as a director of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from 1990 until his death.
The Millers often spent weekends at a farm in Woodstock, Ill., which they had bought as a country retreat, and even there Mr. Miller thought in free-market terms. A neighboring farmer rented the land, and Mr. Miller proposed to the farmer that the rent vary with the price the farmer got for the corn he grew on the land.
"Luckily, the farmer turned down the variable rent proposal," Mrs. Miller said. "If he hadn't, we would have lost our shirts. Corn prices plunged that year."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
An African Ambassador Battles Terror and Indifference

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MANY of the worst photographs are kept in a red paper folder on the coffee table in the ambassador's office.
As some diplomats might want to share photographs of a sun-dappled tourist resort or a new business development in their homelands, Ambassador John E. Leigh asks visitors to the Sierra Leone Embassy to inspect the evidence of the nightmare that has descended on his West African nation. 
 He takes the first photograph from the folder. "Here, what has she done to deserve this?" he asks of the child in the photo, a girl not more than 3 or 4 years old. Her belly is covered with scars from blade cuts. Most of her right arm is missing, removed from above the elbow.
"They just put your arm on the ground and chop it off," he says of the grotesque tactics of the rebels who have mutilated whole villages of people, including infants, by hacking off their limbs, in an undeniably successful effort to spread terror. A second photograph shows a pretty young woman, perhaps 20, with two stumps where her hands had been.
Thousands of other civilians have been killed outright in almost a decade of fighting in Sierra Leone, a diamond-rich nation of five million whose history is bound up with that of the United States. Much of the population is descended from American slaves who fought their way off Southern plantations and returned to Africa.
The ambassador, an American-educated lawyer-turned-diplomat who has run the embassy since 1996, said he did not believe the first reports of the mutilations when they began to trickle out early that year. "I was stunned by it; I thought it was a made-up story," he said.
But quickly enough, the evidence became overwhelming. "When they chop off people's hands, they will say to the victims, 'Let's see how you're going to vote now,' " Mr. Leigh explained. "In Sierra Leone, people are in a state of shock. Nobody thought that fellow Africans could be this vicious."
The extreme violence, he said, is explained by the diamonds, which the rebels -- who have received support from Libya and neighboring Liberia -- seek to control. "The greedier you are, the more violent you are," he said.
Despite the scale of atrocities, the ambassador said, it has been difficult to get Americans, including officials of the Clinton administration, to listen and care. "It's just not important to them. Sierra Leone is small, the economy is tiny." As for the State Department, he said, "They listen to me but they do nothing."
Mr. Leigh said a possibly racist double standard became clear last year, when Sierra Leone continued its descent into chaos as the United States began its multibillion-dollar military campaign in Kosovo. "Here is a white nation getting all of these goodies, and here is Sierra Leone, where they are cutting off the arms of women and children, and they are not paying any attention."
Perhaps worse, he said, the United States joined with other nations last year in pressuring his government to negotiate, producing a cease-fire agreement in which the government pardoned the guerrillas who had been mutilating civilians. After the deal was signed, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright traveled to Sierra Leone and met with the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh. The agreement has collapsed.
"We were forced into it," Mr. Leigh said. "The United States went in and pushed it on us." Not surprisingly, he is unpopular across town at the State Department. "They give me dirty looks," he said with a throaty chuckle. "They don't like me there because I speak out."
Asked for a response, a department official said the United States had provided more than $300 million in humanitarian aid to Sierra Leone over the last decade.
"The notion that we haven't done very much is certainly erroneous," the official said, adding that the United States had not pressed the peace agreement on Sierra Leone but had instead been an honest broker at the request of the government there.
To the 61-year-old ambassador, the anger he arouses is simply proof that he is doing his job. His government asked Mr. Leigh to take over the embassy in the hope that after spending most of his adult life in the United States, he would know how to make his voice heard.
HIS family ties to the United States go back to the 18th century, when his ancestors escaped from Southern plantations and, according to family accounts, fled to Nova Scotia and eventually to Sierra Leone. "Sierra Leone was a place for the guys who were rebellious," he said.
Mr. Leigh grew up in Freetown, his country's capital, and was educated at American- and British-run missionary schools. His father worked for what was then the British colonial government. Like many from elite families, Mr. Leigh went to college in the West. He received an M.B.A. from New York University and a law degree from Suffolk University in Boston.
Over the years, he married an American, had three children, all of them American citizens, and worked for Chase Manhattan and Xerox. When he was tapped to become ambassador, he was a lawyer in private practice in Boston.
But Mr. Leigh says he has no desire for American citizenship. An American passport, he said, would dishonor the memory of relatives who had to risk their lives centuries ago to escape the United States.
"My wife has been on my case," he said. "But I didn't feel right doing that. My ancestors fought their way out of America's slave population. I didn't want to negate that heritage."

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, New Insurgent Takes On an Old Challenger

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, Roger L. Green was a 30-year-old upstart candidate, battling against a political Goliath for a seat in the State Assembly. In that campaign, Mr. Green waged and won a fight against not only against a 20-year incumbent, but against the might of the Democratic Party's political machine in Brooklyn as well.
After two decades in the Assembly, representing the Fort Greene and Clinton-Washington sections of Brooklyn, Mr. Green now finds himself in very much the same position as the man he defeated in that 1980 campaign, Harvey L. Strelzin. Mr. Green is being challenged by Hakeem S. Jeffries, a 29-year-old lawyer waging his first campaign for public office and brandishing many of the complaints made by Mr. Green in his first campaign. 
 Of course, defeating an incumbent, particularly one as steeped in the community's political landscape as Mr. Green, is always difficult. But the race in the 57th Assembly District is being watched for a number of reasons.
Mr. Jeffries, a lawyer at the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, is marshaling a sizable group of young volunteers. And he is campaigning vigorously against an incumbent who has typically had little in the way of competition in this highly Democratic district.
Even if he turns back the challenge, how well Mr. Green does in the September primary will probably affect his prospects for higher office. Mr. Green undertook a brief campaign for public advocate in 1997 and has said he is considering running for Congress one day, when the seat held by Representative Edolphus Towns becomes vacant.
In the meantime, Mr. Jeffries says Mr. Green has become inattentive to the needs of his constituents. Whether it is giving assistance on economic development issues or simply returning a phone call, the assemblyman's performance has become abysmal, Mr. Jeffries asserts.
"The assemblyman has failed to put forth a vision for dealing with the educational needs of the district and developing the business corridor of the community," Mr. Jeffries said.
He complains that a large swath of Fulton Street, a major commercial corridor in the district, is filled with abandoned storefronts, and that "there is no plan coming from the assemblyman to revitalize our community."
Mr. Green acknowledges that he has had his lapses and that his office has not always been as efficient as he would have liked. But he is emphatic in his defense of his record, characterizing himself as a champion of economic development and issues affecting children.
"When I hear what Hakeem is saying, I actually can identify with some of it," he said. "Obviously, as his opponent, the only thing I would say is that you've got to check the record, because if anyone has done institution-building in this area, it's been me."
Specifically, Mr. Green takes great pride in the development of the Benjamin Banneker Academy, a charter school that specializes in math, science and technology, which was proposed and designed by his office.
He also points to his years of working with young people, citing his sponsorship of after-school programs in 18 public schools in Brooklyn. And he talks about his role in founding the Latimer-Woods Economic Development Association, which provides training and economic development opportunities in high technology for young people in Central Brooklyn.
"We have built institutions in this district that I will be reminding the voters of during the campaign," Mr. Green said. "We want folks to know what the real deal is."
In the 1990 census, the district was nearly three quarters black and 12 percent Hispanic. Since then, the district has attracted more higher-income black professionals.
While Mr. Jeffries may speak with vehemence about his view of his opponent's deficiencies, it is clear that Mr. Green sees something of himself in the young challenger, speaking of him almost as though he were Mr. Jeffries's mentor.
"Hakeem is the type of young man that we have struggled to support and, hopefully, to empower," Mr. Green said. "I don't think that we in the party have made a concerted enough effort to get people like Hakeem involved in the political process. When I look at his resume, I think that he could offer a lot."
Mr. Jeffries acknowledges the difficulty of unseating someone of Mr. Green's tenure. But he suggests that he is in part motivated by Mr. Green's history.
"I know that it's difficult to defeat a 20-year incumbent," Mr. Jeffries said. "He is a professional politician backed by the Democratic machine. But I believe that, as long as I can make the people aware that there is a credible alternate choice, there will be an opportunity to be successful. After all, that's exactly what he did 20 years ago."

HEADLINE: Divisiveness at Parade as Mrs. Clinton and Lazio Salute Israel

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick A. Lazio shook hands and stood side by side yesterday, both vowing to support the political and economic stability of Israel. But along the Fifth Avenue route of New York City's annual Salute to Israel Parade, the intense, even angry, division among Jews over the two United States Senate candidates was starkly on display.
The parade, like so many others in New York, typically draws a healthy contingent of vote-seeking politicians. But this year, the political jockeying was so pervasive and the crowd seemed so politically engaged that even some organizers said that campaigning was overshadowing the purpose of the event, to celebrate the 52 years of Israeli statehood. 
 Mr. Lazio marched yesterday with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, just ahead of the New York City Police Department marching band. Mrs. Clinton was farther back, beside Senator Charles E. Schumer and a collection of leaders of Jewish groups.
The first lady proved to be the biggest media attraction, drawing such a large pack of television cameras and photographers that her security team stretched out a rope to corral them. But she also inspired the most vociferous reaction from the crowd, with spectators sporadically booing, screaming and sometimes even crudely insulting her as she passed.
Also marching along the 22-block parade route, in addition to the groups of children, religious clubs and community associations, were three likely future candidates for mayor -- Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, Public Advocate Mark Green and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone -- as well as many other state and local officials.
"Hillary brings out passions in people," said Mr. Green, who described the crowd as perhaps the most intense he had seen in his decade of marching in parades in the city.
Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton went to great lengths to try to demonstrate their devotion to Israel, as both candidates, in what has quickly become a competitive race, clearly recognize the importance of the large number of Jewish voters in New York City.
But despite their competition for votes, the Senate candidates were quite cordial with each other. They shook hands and chatted briefly about Mr. Lazio's two daughters during a break in the parade while they stood at a reviewing stand on Fifth Avenue at 69th Street. It was Mr. Lazio's and Mrs. Clinton's first joint appearance since Mr. Giuliani last month dropped out of the nation's highest profile Senate race and Mr. Lazio replaced him as the Republican nominee.
Mr. Lazio repeatedly spoke yesterday about his support for moving the United States embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to recognize the city that Israel claims as its capital. Mrs. Clinton, who also supports such a move, spoke more generally about what she called her longstanding respect for the country and its people.
"The United States has been and will be always there for Israel," she said, drawing applause from crowd, including the mayor and Mr. Lazio. "And we will always support the Israeli government and Israeli people as they struggle to find a safe and secure peace."
The two candidates stayed away from more controversial topics, such as whether there should be an independent Palestinian state. Mrs. Clinton angered many Jewish voters last year when she voiced support for such a state.
"I am going to take the lead of the state of Israel on this," Mr. Lazio said yesterday when asked by a reporter about the topic. "I have some serious questions about whether or not a Palestinian state is sustainable, considering the security concerns of the State of Israel."
But the animosity felt by some in the crowd toward Mrs. Clinton was evident on nearly every block, with some holding signs recalling her embrace last year of Yasir Arafat's wife, Suha, while others shouted, "Go back to Arkansas," mocking her move last year to New York State and her bid as a Democrat for the Senate seat.
Mira Hakak, a Queens statistician, held a torn-up Clinton campaign sign in her hands, just above an Israeli flag that was propped up in her pocketbook. "She did not do anything in her life and now she wants to be our senator," Mrs. Hakak said. "If she wants to be in Washington, she should get a job as a lawyer."
Emotions ran so high that brief scuffles at times broke out between the two camps, such as when one backer of Mrs. Clinton had her campaign sign pulled out of her hands and torn up. "There was just a lot of hate," said Resi Cooper, 29, of Nassau County, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton, who said she was nearly knocked over by supporters of Mr. Lazio at one point during the parade.
Also amid the crowd were many undecided voters, like Lisa Rosenzweig, 39, a lawyer from Brooklyn, who said she generally votes for Democrats, but has not made up her mind in the Senate race.
"How's your lip?" she yelled to Mr. Lazio, whose lip was still swollen from a fall he took in a Memorial Day parade on Long Island. She later told a reporter that she considered Mr. Lazio a worthy candidate and would not likely decide on her vote until November.
Mr. Giuliani, who was campaigning for his second time with Mr. Lazio, at times seemed to attract more attention than the Long Island congressman, with spectators chanting his name and some even holding his old Senate campaign signs. But the mayor appeared to make an effort to let Mr. Lazio take the lead, allowing him to decide when to break away from the parade and greet supporters.
Both Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton dashed from the end of the Salute to Israel Parade to the smaller Philippine-American Friendship Day Parade on Madison Avenue in Midtown. Mrs. Clinton received a much warmer welcome from this crowd, some of her supporters so excited that they tried to climb over police officers to reach her. Asked about being booed at the Salute to Israel Parade, she responded: "I had a great time. I mean, that's democracy."

HEADLINE: William E. Simon, Ex-Treasury Secretary And High-Profile Investor, Is Dead at 72

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
William E. Simon, who directed the nation's energy policy and was treasury secretary in the dark economic days of the 1970's and then proved to have a golden touch as an investor in the boom days of the 1980's, died on Saturday at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 72 and lived in Santa Barbara.
The cause of death was complications from pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease that he had been fighting for more than a year, said James Piereson, executive director of the John M. Olin Foundation in New York, where Mr. Simon was president. . 
 A conservative Republican, Mr. Simon left a successful Wall Street career as a bond trader in 1973 to join Richard Nixon's administration as deputy treasury secretary. He went on to become director of the Federal Energy Office -- or "energy czar," as he was known -- later that year when the economy reeled in the wake of the Arab oil embargo, and in April 1974 he was named treasury secretary, a post he retained when Gerald R. Ford succeeded Nixon.
After leaving office at the end of the Ford administration, Mr. Simon returned to Wall Street, where he became emblematic of a breed of aggressive investor. In 1982, Mr. Simon and a partner, Raymond G. Chambers, paid $80.5 million, almost all of it borrowed, to buy Gibson Greetings, a card maker, in one of the first high-profile leveraged buyouts.
Fourteen months later they sold the company in a public offering to shareholders for $290 million, yielding Mr. Simon and Mr. Chambers a profit of $70 million each and creating a mystique about Mr. Simon's investing prowess that was only partly tarnished in recent years by a string of disappointing deals.
Mr. Simon also was the United States Olympic Committee's treasurer from 1977 to 1980, and as its president for the subsequent four years, playing important roles in the American decision to boycott the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, and in planning the 1984 games in Los Angeles.
William Edward Simon was born on Nov. 27, 1927, in Paterson, N.J. His father was an insurance agent, and he lived a middle-class life through the Depression. After graduating from high school in 1946, he served in the Army and then enrolled at Lafayette College, in Easton, Pa., where he met Carol Girard. They were married in 1950.
After graduating from Lafayette in 1952, he got a $75-a-week job trading municipal bonds. By 1964, he was working at Salomon Brothers, where he was known as a quick-tempered, outspoken and very skilled bond trader. Within Salomon's aggressive culture, his sometimes-abrasive personality was no drawback. By the early 1970's, he was one of the firm's senior partners and was earning more than $2 million a year.
On the recommendation of Attorney General John Mitchell, a former Wall Street lawyer, Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz recruited Mr. Simon as his deputy at the beginning of Nixon's second term. Even as the Watergate scandal was beginning to envelop the White House, Mr. Simon was enmeshed in another national crisis, the embargo imposed by Arab oil producers on nations friendly to Israel.
By the end of 1973, Mr. Simon was coordinating the administration's efforts to encourage conservation and to allocate scarce supplies of oil -- favoring factory production and home heating oil over gasoline for motorists. It was a job that brought him criticism from all sides, not least from consumers, who resented gasoline shortages and high prices.
"I'm the guy that caused the lines at the gas stations," Mr. Simon once said.
But Mr. Simon seemed sufficiently thick skinned to cope and more than willing to fight back.
"We have become a nation of great energy wastrels," he said in 1973. He publicly chastised another administration official for crossing him, saying the official should "keep his cotton pickin' hands off energy policy." He labeled statements by the shah of Iran, then a key ally of the United States, "irresponsible and reckless."
By early 1974, the country was in a recession, and when Mr. Shultz resigned as treasury secretary, Nixon quickly named Mr. Simon to replace him. Mr. Simon spent much of his time on international policy, pressing Arab nations to reinvest the dollars they were reaping through oil sales in the United States and creating an international credit line for poor nations that had been hurt by soaring energy costs.
At home, with inflation rising, he counseled against deficit spending to stimulate the economy, in keeping with his fiscal conservatism. In 1975, he created a political firestorm when he helped persuade President Ford not to bail New York City out of its financial crisis. He argued that coming to New York's aid would encourage profligacy among other cities.
"Then came the New York fiscal crisis, and I was Genghis Khan," he recalled a dozen years later.
Under pressure from bankers, who countered that if New York City were to default on its debt, it could reverberate through markets around the world, Mr. Simon and Mr. Ford ultimately agreed to aid the city.
After Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976, Mr. Simon left Washington and became a consultant to investment firms and businesses, as well as becoming treasurer of the Olympic committee, for which he had raised funds before entering government service.
In 1980, when President Carter urged the committee to boycott the Moscow Olympics that summer to protest the Soviet presence in Afghanistan, most American amateur sports officials and athletes were opposed. Mr. Simon's impassioned speech to the committee's house of delegates in favor of the boycott swung the vote.
The next year, when Mr. Simon was elected president of the Olympic committee by acclamation, the organization was $9 million in debt and had to meet an $88 million budget for the next four years. The boycott had hurt fund-raising.
But Mr. Simon turned potential doom into a financial bonanza by having the Olympic committee become an equal partner with the Los Angeles Olympic organizers. Despite a retaliatory boycott by the Soviet Union and most of its allies, those Olympics earned $225 million.
The Olympic committee, with its 40 percent share and an additional $35 million from the Olympic coin program, created the United States Olympic Foundation as a permanent financial source for American amateur sports. That became the major legacy of Mr. Simon's era at the committee.
During the same period, Mr. Simon was building a fortune with his investments in leveraged buyouts, of which the Gibson Greetings deal was the best known. The company he operated in partnership with Mr. Chambers, Wesray, bought undervalued companies with borrowed money, whipped them into shape or waited until a willing buyer appeared, and then sold them, often for hefty profits. By the late 1980's, Forbes magazine was estimating Mr. Simon's wealth at $300 million.
But his partnership with Mr. Chambers came apart in 1986, as Mr. Simon turned to building a network of financial institutions on the West Coast and across the Pacific.
He had some success purchasing banks and failed savings and loan associations and reselling them, but he never approached his stated goal of building a trans-Pacific merchant banking empire. In 1993, federal regulators seized one of his properties, Western Federal Savings and Loan, when it sank into insolvency.
In recent years, Mr. Simon had dedicated more of his time to philanthropy and charitable work.
He gradually turned much of the responsibility for his business over to his two sons, William E. Simon Jr., and J. Peter Simon.
In 1996, Mr. Simon received the Blessed Hyacinth Cormier Award for outstanding Catholic leadership, and in 1999, he was honored by the Olympic committee.
Mr. Simon's first wife, Carol, died in 1995. He is survived by his second wife, Tonia Adams Donnelley, whom he married in 1996, and by seven children from his first marriage. In addition to his two sons, they are Mary Beth Simon Streep; Carol Leigh Simon Porges; Aimee Simon Bloom; Julie Ann Simon Munro and Johanna Katrina Simon.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN MOSCOW: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON AND PUTIN UNABLE TO AGREE ON MISSILE BARRIER

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 4

 BODY:
President Clinton and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia concluded two days of talks today with mutual praise, but without narrowing the differences over the national missile defense system the United States wants to build.
The summit meeting did produce two other narrow but significant agreements. One was an undertaking by the United States and Russia each to destroy 34 metric tons (about 75,000 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium, enough to make tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. The other called for a joint center in Moscow to share early warnings about missile launching, a center that would be the first permanent American-Russia military operation. 
 Over all, senior administration officials described the atmosphere between the lame-duck American president and the new Russian president as correct and businesslike, though not necessarily warm. That was evident at their news conference.
Although the two presidents shook hands as they entered the hall, and Mr. Clinton gently nudged Mr. Putin to pose with him for the cameras afterward, they did not look or smile at each other during their opening statements or while answering questions.
The two men had met twice before, in 1999 when Mr. Putin was prime minister, but this was their first meeting since the Russian was elected president in March. And although they had a range of issues on their agenda -- including Russia's struggle to reform its economy and its unresolved war in Chechnya -- arms control dominated their talks.
Seeking to temper expectations, senior administration officials had said before the trip that there would not be a substantial breakthrough on the contentious question of a national missile defense.
But Mr. Clinton is committed to decide before the end of his administration whether to move forward with a limited missile defense system against the possibility that a "rogue state" like North Korea might develop a missile able to reach the United States. Russia says the project would undermine the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, a cornerstone of strategic arms controls, and unleash a new arms race. The proposed American system is also opposed by China, and the European allies have expressed concern.
Mr. Putin evidently felt no urgency to change his position.
He made that clear during the news conference, which was held in the grand, gilt-trimmed St. George's Hall in the recently renovated czarist-era Grand Palace of the Kremlin. While acknowledging that there was "a commonality" in foreseeing the possibility of unspecified new threats, Mr. Putin said, "We're against having a cure which is worse than the disease."
The two sides agreed to a joint statement pledging to continue talks on further cuts in strategic nuclear weapons and terming the ABM treaty the "cornerstone" of global strategic security. The statement called on experts from both sides to prepare a joint report on how to tackle new threats to strategic stability.
But briefing reporters after the press conference, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott stressed that Mr. Putin had not softened his position.
"President Putin made absolutely clear to President Clinton that Russia continues to oppose the changes to the ABM treaty that the United States has proposed since last September," Mr. Talbott said. He said Russia believed that the anti-missile plan "will undermine strategic stability, threaten Russia's strategic deterrent and provoke a new arms race."
At the news conference, Mr. Putin insisted that he was willing to continue working on the issue, if necessary, with the next American president. "We know that today, in the United States, there is a campaign ongoing," he said, adding that he was familiar with the programs of the two main candidates. "No matter who gets to be president, we're willing to go forward."
Though Mr. Clinton has only eight more months in office, that in itself does not necessarily preclude progress on arms control or United States-Russian relations. President Reagan spent a large part of 1988, his last year in office, pressing for improvements in Washington's relations with Moscow and pushing arms control agreements. And just two weeks before Mr. Clinton's inauguration, President Bush signed the Start II treaty, calling for the most significant rollback yet in the formidable nuclear arsenal of the cold war.
Officials said that during their eight hours of talks over two days, Mr. Putin spoke some English, and each leader displayed a readiness to hear the other out. But the exchanges lacked the first-name familiarity that characterized the relationship between Mr. Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin, the former president, where it was always "Boris" and "Bill."
One American in the delegation said of Mr. Putin: "You can see he is not a warm person; he's a cold fish. People say he's a control freak." But the official pointed out that on arms control issues, that may not be bad.
Asked how they would describe each other's personalities and leadership styles, Mr. Putin said of Mr. Clinton, "He's a very experienced politician."
"In my mind, we've established now not only good business ties, but also personal relations," he said. "For me, President Clinton is a person who is a very comfortable and pleasant partner in negotiations."
"I think that if everyone behaves the way President Clinton has behaved, not trying to find dead ends and problems, but to seek ways of moving ahead, I think between us in the future our relations really will be successful."
Mr. Clinton was even more formal in his assessment of Mr. Putin, saying: "If you want to know what my personal assessment is, I think he is fully capable of building a prosperous and strong Russia while preserving freedom, pluralism and the rule of law. It's a big challenge. I think he's fully capable of doing it."
The agreement on the disposal of some 34 tons of plutonium would help prevent the material from being used for weapons, though the financing of the Russian effort remains uncertain. The joint military center is intended to help both nations avoid an accidental missile launching.
In the summit meeting, Mr. Clinton raised other areas of contention besides missile defense. He urged Mr. Putin to seek a political settlement to end Russia's eight-month-long military offensive against rebels in Chechnya and to allow international monitors to investigate charges of human rights violations in the region.
And he called on the Russian leader to protect the rights of a free press. Earlier this spring, Mr. Putin ordered an armed raid on Media-MOST, a major communications company that had been critical of the Kremlin. The invasion was officially described as a tax raid.
Mr. Clinton underscored his message by giving an interview to Echo Moskvy, a radio station owned by Media-MOST.
The joint Kremlin news conference was also an occasion to announce the agreements that had been reached. The two presidents sat at a long gilt-trimmed white table with two sets of pens as an overpowering, disembodied voice filled the vast 40-foot-ceilinged hall relating in both Russian and English each of the agreements and statements.
The voice was so powerful that Mr. Clinton and several members of his delegation -- including the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger; Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson -- could not stop themselves from smiling. Mr. Putin did not smile.
Mr. Clinton also indulged in a bit of sightseeing, visiting the imposing new Christ the Savior Cathedral on the Moscow River embankment near the Kremlin.

HEADLINE: The 00's Finale Of the 80's Tycoons

BYLINE: By Bryan Burrough; Bryan Burrough, a special correpondent for Vanity Fair, is co-author, with John Helyar, of "Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco."

 BODY:
For those of us who remember a time before pimply dot-com billionaires and Gatesian wealth, the recent passing of Saul Steinberg's longtime investment company, Reliance Group Holdings, marks the end of an era.
Weighted down by debt, Mr. Steinberg sold Reliance to a competitor, the Leucadia National Corporation, for pennies on the dollar. Sold as well was Mr. Steinberg's palatial Park Avenue apartment, thought to be the largest in Manhattan, as well as its contents, including many of the fine paintings and draperies that once hung on its walls. And, let's not forget, a multimillion-dollar commode made of rococo-gilded bronze. The 80's, an era when financial alchemy brought jaw-dropping wealth to a generation of Wall Streeters, can now be safely said to be over. 
 For the last 15 years or so, Mr. Steinberg was an oversized symbol of a decade whose legacy will forever be debated by economists and historians. In fact, Mr. Steinberg's reputation was built largely through his groundbreaking but failed attempt to take over Chemical Bank in 1969, a precursor to 80's-style corporate raids. That run enshrined him in Wall Street lore, vividly illustrating to a generation of hungry young men what could be accomplished with a modest amount of cash and a large dose of moxie.
But in the 1980's, aside from collecting $60 million in greenmail, which Disney paid him to go away in 1984, Mr. Steinberg mostly stayed on the sidelines, watching as corporate raiders like Carl Icahn, T. Boone Pickens and Ron Perelman engaged in a financial fox hunt that sent hundreds of American companies scurrying for the woods, baying investment bankers on their heels.
It was what Mr. Steinberg did with his wealth that so aptly capsulized the era. It wasn't just the apartment, once owned by John D. Rockefeller, with its scarlet-and-gold dining room and seven-figure tchotchkes. His third wife, Gayfryd, was conspicuously young. His parties were legend: For his 50th birthday party in 1989, models were dressed as figures in Old Masters paintings. You get the picture.
His sad fate could be taken as yet another lesson on the hollow nature of 1980's wealth, especially when compared to the wealth of the 1990's. This new era has brought a good deal of speculative excess, of course, as is the nature of Wall Street -- raw capitalism is not pretty. But whatever one thinks of the current excesses in stock valuations, it's undeniable that the latest billionaires actually helped build something -- in this case the Internet and all its attendant new technology.
The same can't be said for the 1980's. The billions of dollars made from corporate raids and leveraged buyouts (in an L.B.O., a public company's shareholders are bought out using the company itself as collateral) were about nothing more than paper shuffling. When companies were cracked open like piggy banks, or split up like pizzas to reduce the debt, was anyone really surprised the parts were worth more than the whole?
In these exercises, no breakthrough products were created, no Edisons were uncovered. Is there some gee-whiz product out there that Mr. Steinberg's insurance company engineered? I doubt it. From the very first such deals, there was a sense it was all a shell game, that there was something patently wrong about wealth created by tearing apart companies rather than building them up, by firing, or downsizing, workers rather than hiring them.
Yet even the harshest critics of corporate raids would probably acknowledge that at the dawn of the 1980's too many American companies were overstuffed, overperked and none too sympathetic to the desires of their shareholders. Put aside all the envy, all the sniping about gold-plated cabinetry, and Mr. Steinberg and his ilk were agents of change, pure and simple. They were wolves clearing out the stragglers, forcing the other animals to get into fighting trim. True, they inflicted a great deal of pain, but financial Darwinism has never been for the squeamish.
For those who handle such unpleasant tasks, there is a classic American arc. In 1982, at the beginning of the raider era, the men who launched hostile takeover attempts were lauded as American folk heroes. When they first took to the floors of annual meetings, Gordon Gekko-style, to attack the bloated old boys' networks that ran too many large companies, people actually cheered. While Mr. Pickens and others stormed the ramparts, Henry Kravis and other buyout artists, were standing by in boardrooms, "rescuing" the raiders' frightened prey by taking them private with velvet gloves.
Of course the raiders finally went too far. In 1988, the unseemly free-for-all for control of RJR Nabisco triggered a backlash that killed the golden goose. Afterward it got ugly, as these things usually do, with a barrage of insider-trading and securities-fraud indictments and prison sentences for the untoward and the unlucky.
But many of the raiders, Mr. Steinberg included, now had publicly owned companies tucked under their arms to manage, and it's been informative to see how many of them proved unable to follow through on the promises they made at those bygone annual meetings. Mr. Pickens was unceremoniously ousted from control of his company, the former Mesa Petroleum, in a shareholder uprising. Mr. Perelman's company, Revlon, is a stock-market laggard. Mr. Steinberg's Reliance Group flirted with bankruptcy for years before the last air finally eased from its balloon.
The intriguing question is to what degree the winnowing and strengthening of the 80's set the stage for the explosive growth of the 90's. It's a matter best left to economists, but one suspects it is no accident that a slew of large non-Internet companies, from Wal-Mart to Gillette -- itself a target of hungry raiders during the 1980's -- embarked on rapid growth and stock-price rises in the 1990's. Would they have done so had raiders like Mr. Steinberg not frightened them into shaping up?
It would be the richest irony to argue that Saul Steinberg begat Bill Gates. I won't. But one should also not reach the facile conclusion that Mr. Steinberg's story is simply a fitting end for an era in which ruthless corporate raiders destroyed corporations and laid off tens of thousands of employees.
Then again, it is very, very difficult to envision a day when Mr. Gates would be forced to auction off his living-room drapes.

HEADLINE: PATH Fare Isn't Subsidy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Governors End Port Authority Rift That Blocked Billions in Projects" (front page, June 2):
It is welcome news that Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey will allow several important regional transportation projects to proceed. It is unfortunate that one of the outcomes of their agreement is the commissioning of a study that will likely recommend a PATH fare increase. 
 Rather than shortsightedly view the $1 PATH fare as a New Jersey subsidy, New York politicians should instead recognize it as an incentive for workers to contribute to New York City's economy without flooding the Hudson River crossings and city streets with more traffic.

HEADLINE: End the Cuba Embargo

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your June 3 news article reporting that Cuban officials are receptive to negotiating settlements regarding claims about foreigners' seized assets is another indication that this is an opportune time to negotiate ending the United States embargo of Cuba.
In Cuba, religious groups are highly active, professionals are linked with colleagues throughout the world through the Internet, small private businesses are increasing, foreign investors are making profits, dollars are legal tender, farmers sell a proportion of their production in the open market, and Canadian and European tourists are enjoying the resorts. 
 The Congressional bill to end the food and medicine embargo should be speedily enacted and other issues negotiated so as to end the embargo. These actions will aid the changes already under way in Cuba and facilitate an orderly and just transformation of Cuban-American relations.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Commies and Demmies

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Now that the smoke has cleared from the debate over whether to grant China permanent normal trade with the U.S. and membership in the World Trade Organization, it's time for some wild and irresponsible predictions. I'd like to start the bidding.
My prediction is that in the wake of the China vote two parties in the world will never be the same again: the Communist Party in China and the Democratic Party in America. 
 Let's look at each. For years Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's shift to a free market, described China's economic system as capitalism with socialist characteristics, or was it socialism with capitalist characteristics? I could never keep it straight -- and neither could they. But it no longer matters, because China is now committed to capitalism with W.T.O. characteristics. And that is going to be a huge challenge. If the Chinese Communist Party doesn't adapt, either it will implode or China will explode.
Here's the problem: By joining the W.T.O., China is basically agreeing to replace its current mixed economy -- part free market, part state controlled -- which is run by the arbitrary decisions of the Communist Party, with an increasingly free-market economy that will abide by international rules, on trade, tariffs and investments, set by the W.T.O.
This means the Chinese Communist Party is going to have to back off and shape up or ship out. You can't have a flourishing free enterprise system with party hacks interfering with businesses and distorting prices; you can't have W.T.O.-style foreign investment without moving toward an independent judiciary that is free of arbitrary party meddling and is capable of fairly enforcing contracts; and you can't live up to W.T.O. norms without government agencies ready to enforce W.T.O. rules, not Communist Party whims. All that means a different Communist Party.
"The ideal situation would be if the Communist Party would serve as the bridge and tutor for China's move toward a free-market, rule-of-law-based system," argued the Stanford University China scholar Michael Oksenberg. "If that doesn't happen voluntarily, I see three other possibilities: One is that there will be some catalytic event, like a downturn in the economy, that will force the party to adapt, or face losing power and legitimacy. Second, there will be a split in the party leadership, between those who want to move forward and those who refuse. And third, there could be a mass movement from below. The longer the Chinese Communist Party puts off the first two, the more likely becomes the last scenario."
As for the U.S., the China vote was not really a vote about China. It was a vote about how Americans feel about globalization. And it revealed a deeply fractured Democratic Party. The unions were opposed and advocated building walls; the new-economy types, led by President Clinton, favored further globalization; and a large group of old Democrats advocated some middle ground, but had no leader or program to offer.
"We are becoming the party of resentment and fear, and that is not who we were and that is not who we want to be," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, about the number of Democrats who voted against normal trade with China.
The challenge for the Democratic Party, if it is to remain united, is to articulate a new progressivism that addresses the worries of working Americans about globalization -- without resorting to trade barriers. There is obviously a strong feeling among the party's rank and file that Mr. Clinton's "progressivism-lite" is insufficient. Which is why a lot of Democrats are now groping for a new combination of tax policy, labor policy and social policy that could form a modern progressivism. (It would help if the unions got their heads out of the sand. Imagine if all the money and energy they wasted lobbying against China were applied to health or education funding?)
Without articulating a new progressivism, the Democrats will either become indistinguishable from Republicans, especially under George W. Bush, or, if the unions have their way, the Democrats will become just kinder, gentler Buchananites.
So in the wake of the China vote the key question is: Can the Chinese Communists become a real democratic party and can the real Democratic Party become a true progressive party? Nobody gets to stay the same.

HEADLINE: What Dahl-Wolfe's Eye Created in a Lens

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
When Carmen Dell'Orefice was 15 and modeling to help her mother pay the rent on a Third Avenue walk-up, she made a visit to the 57th Street studio of Louise Dahl-Wolfe. At the time, 1946, Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe, 51, was in her 10th year as the reigning photographer at Harper's Bazaar and her umpteenth as a woman who looked like a home economics teacher at a girls' reform school.
"She seemed ancient," Ms. Dell'Orefice recalled a few weeks ago. "The first thing she said to me was, 'Your mother shouldn't let you wear makeup.' " When Ms. Dell'Orefice answered that she wasn't wearing any, the photographer dragged her to a window and pinched her eyelashes for proof. Finally, Ms. Dell'Orefice was sent home on the grounds that she was too young to stand in front of a tripod for money, or at least too young for Bazaar's older readers. Not long after, she appeared on the cover of Vogue. 
 Louise Dahl-Wolfe would see dozens of models rise and fall before she died 43 years later, in 1989, at 94. On June 12, the Museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology will present the first full-scale retrospective of her work, little of which points to the kind of benighted sensibility her behavior, and a hair bun slathered with beeswax, might have led one to expect.
Curated by Irving Solero and Nan Richardson, the exhibition will run through Aug. 12 and move to the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson in September. A companion book by Ms. Richardson, "Louise Dahl-Wolfe: A Retrospective," is due from Harry N. Abrams this summer. Some of Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe's black-and-white images are on view at the Staley-Wise gallery.
During her time at Bazaar, a 22-year tenure that ended when she quit in 1958, after the magazine's editor, Carmel Snow, and the legendary art director Alexey Brodovitch both resigned, Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe chronicled the birth of a looser, less pinched spirit in American fashion. With Diana Vreeland as her fashion editor, Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe traveled around the world, shooting that new concept, sportswear, out of doors where it comfortably breathed. Before the triumvirate of Mrs. Snow, Mrs. Vreeland and Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe, American style, as Richard Avedon has put it, did not exist.
"Louise has a pivotal role moving fashion photography out of formal studio work into a portrayal of the active, modern American woman," Amy Rule, an archivist at the Center for Creative Photography, said.
Other photographers, like Martin Munkacsi and Toni Frissell, were already capturing the new mood, but Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe distinguished herself with images that implied a languorous sexuality. She often photographed models on the beach, in repose, their eyes closed or averted, their bodies positioned -- trapped -- rigidly in the frame. Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe seemed to realize that new sportswear by Claire McCardell and Bonnie Cashin offered women the semblance of an unconstricted life, not the real freedom that only a challenge to accepted social arrangements could bring.
The daughter of a Norwegian marine engineer, Louise Dahl was born in San Francisco in 1895 and showed no tendencies during her young womanhood to live within the narrow corridor of risk laid out for her sex. After studying art in San Francisco, she moved to New York to take classes in architecture and design. In 1927, she embarked on a tour of Europe with her friend Consuela Kanaga, a news photographer. A year went by, and when the women were bored with the Continent they headed for North Africa.
It was on a train platform in Tunisia in 1928 that Miss Dahl, 32, spotted her future husband, a sculptor from Tennessee named Meyer Wolfe. "She saw him," Irving Solero, who befriended Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe in 1978, recalled, "and said, 'That's for me.' " The two married that same year.
Without fail, those who knew Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe remark on the intense bond she and her husband shared. "They lived together nonstop, 24 hours a day," said Mr. Solero, who spent time with the couple in their Frenchtown, N.J., home, known as the Creamery. "They fought all the time, but a fight would erupt for five seconds and then it was over." Mr. Wolfe would travel with his wife, typically picking her up for lunch during out-of-town shoots.
"When he died at 88 she was self-abandoned," Mary Jane Russell, a friend and favorite model of Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe's, said recently. "Her mourning was coupled with anger: 'How could he have left me? Why couldn't I be first?' "
While she was close to Mrs. Russell, her relationships with others in the Harper's Bazaar orbit were more complex. Well into the 70's and 80's, Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe would talk about her former colleague Mr. Avedon "as though he were a kid," Mr. Solero said, adding, "She'd say, 'He has a long way to go.' "
Lillian Bassman, whose impressionistic photographs began appearing in Bazaar around 1950, said that Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe repeatedly tried to have her fired. In the mid-40's, when Ms. Bassman was still working in the magazine's art department as an apprentice, Carmel Snow sent her to Paris to try to find photographers who had worked for Bazaar before the war. Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe was so irritated at the prospect of competition, Ms. Bassman said, that she complained to Mrs. Snow that the art-director-in-training had been maligning her. Mrs. Snow swiftly dispatched Ms. Bassman to the country and out of the way. "It was a testimony to Louise's stature at the magazine," Ms. Bassman said. After that, their relationship was "a mess," she added.
With underlings in the fashion department, Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe often played the taskmaster. Some 50 years ago, the fashion editor Polly Mellen traveled to Jamaica with Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe for a shoot and recalled waking up every morning at 4:30 to braid the hair that would eventually be cranked into the photographer's signature bun. "In my growing years, she was one of the few people who really formed me," Ms. Mellen said. "She taught me extreme discipline." And demonstrated a certain largesse as well. When Ms. Mellen left Bazaar to marry in 1952, Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe gave her a going-away party and took her wedding pictures. "If she was on your side, you were most fortunate," Ms. Mellen said.
After Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe left Bazaar, she worked briefly for Vogue before relinquishing photography in 1960, saying that advertisers had gained too much influence over magazines. But however frustrated she had become with what she saw as the commercialization of magazines, she was never the sort who demanded that some notion of artistic vision take precedence over the business of showing off clothes. One hallmark of her thousands of published images, 86 Bazaar covers among them, is that the gowns and bathing suits and ski clothes are always visible front and center. "She worked for the magazine because she showed the frocks," said Martin Harrison, a curator and historian of photography. "The models were good-looking, and it was a great time for American fashion."
Even Mr. Harrison, a detractor, admits that Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe had a talent for color. In her effort to show garments to their best advantage, she would typically go to the printing press where Bazaar was churned out and nudge engravers to change a blue backdrop to, say, a yellow one if it made a dress look better. "It was almost as if she were a set designer," said Christopher Greene, who produced prints from Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe's negatives late in her life.
While Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe might flinch at the sort of images that today fill the pages of avant-garde fashion magazines like Dazed and Confused, the striking, saturated colors that are their trademark hark back, in some sense, to her. Before the rise of digital technology, it was impossible to reproduce prints from Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe's Kodachromes that resembled what appeared on the printed page.
That is one reason, said Ms. Richardson, the Fashion Institute curator, that a coffee-table book of her work has never been published before.
Another is that Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe always thought the notion rather flashy and pretentious.

Panning For Gold in New Jersey

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
There's one heck of a lot of money sloshing around the political troughs these days. According to a report in yesterday's Times by William Glaberson, one race for the Ohio Supreme Court this year is going to cost up to $12 million. We have candidates spending a couple of million dollars to become state legislator, a job that generally carries less prestige than that of nightclub bouncer. At this rate, the next bunch of people stranded on a desert island with a TV crew is going to demand a whole lot more than a lousy million dollars for the effort. (Coming soon: "Who Wants to Be a Political Consultant?")
This brings us to the primary today in New Jersey, where a former Wall Street honcho named Jon Corzine has spent close to $35 million trying to win the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate against former Gov. Jim Florio, whose entire budget is approximately what Mr. Corzine will be spending on fax machines and commemorative potholders. 
 Mr. Corzine is in many ways a fascinating story, although the fascinating part does not seem to follow him onto the campaign trail. Despite the very best coaching money can buy and a dramatically left-wing agenda, he makes Steve Forbes look like Franklin Delano Roosevelt. (In a recent debate, Mr. Corzine delivered this defense for his largess: "I have not been a politician and spent 30 million and over 30 years building name recognition and establishing the perspectives people might have. I needed to communicate.")
According to one of his associates, Mr. Corzine entered the race envisioning a $10 million primary, a plan that went awry somewhere between his decision to hire Robert Shrum, the man who gave us Al Checchi's failed $38 million campaign for governor of California, and the moment he started opening his checkbook for the local Democratic organizations. Mr. Corzine used to be famous for his munificent federal campaign contributions. But he assured New Jersey party officials that his newfound interest in state politics would naturally be reflected by a shift in his gift-giving. This had the approximate effect of tossing a chunk of hamburger into a tank of piranhas. "Word got out there was this pot there, and things got out of control," conceded one campaign official.
One of the comforting things about American election campaigns is the way the monetary playing field keeps leveling. You come into the game like George W. Bush with a big fat financial cushion and slurp, it vanishes. Nature may abhor a vacuum, but political campaigns can create one in a minute.
"There's always that pressure -- to donate to the local parties, hire the local potentates' daughters. You end up not saying no to anything," recalled John Weaver, who has run presidential campaigns for candidates with too little cash (John McCain) and too much (Phil Gramm). "Gramm went through the money pretty quickly," he recalled. "We had about 25 opposition research people. We probably needed one."
But there is no way that Mr. Corzine could go through his entire $400 million fortune running for Senate -- potentates have only just so many unemployed relatives and you can only run so many ads on TV before the viewer throws a shoe through the screen. Even as it is, Mr. Corzine may have overdone it. He seems to have made people feel a little sorry for Mr. Florio, a feat most New Jersey residents might have hitherto regarded as impossible. Mr. Corzine not only spent about 20 times as much as his opponent, he also managed to make Mr. Florio, whose household income last year was more than $500,000, look underprivileged.
Mr. Corzine has already broken the record for spending in a U.S. Senate race, set by Michael Huffington in California in 1994. But that was for the entire election, against an incumbent. It takes a lot of money to overcome those odds, especially when your candidate seems both shy and dimwitted. Mr. Corzine is running for a vacant seat, against a primary opponent who is best known for having raised taxes by $2.8 billion. He does not seem to lack aggression. His friends say he is smart, and they rave about his generosity.
In fact, if all the stories about his beneficence are true, every single person who put a Corzine sign on the front lawn this week should expect to be rewarded with a paid-off mortgage or, at minimum, a reshingled roof. When the money starts sloshing, the wise man goes for a pail.

HEADLINE: Words of Clinton: Gains Despite Pains of Growth

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 5

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's address today to the Russian Parliament, as transcribed by eMediaMillWorks Inc.:
A great deal of the 21st century will be strongly influenced by the success of the Russian people in building a modern, strong, democratic nation that is part of the life of the rest of the world. 
 And so many people across the world have sought to support your efforts, sharing with you a sense of pride when democracy is advanced and sharing your disappointment when difficulties arose.
It is obviously not for me to tell the Russian people how to interpret the last few years. I know your progress has come with unfilled expectations and unexpected difficulties. I know there have been moments, especially during the financial crisis in 1998, when some wondered if the new Russia would end up as a grand social experiment gone wrong.
But when we look at Russia today, we do not see an experiment gone wrong.
We see an economy that is growing, producing goods and services people want. We see a nation of enterprising citizens who are beginning, despite all of the obstacles, to bring good jobs and a normal life to their communities. . . .
We see Russian citizens with no illusions about the road ahead, yet voting in extraordinary numbers against a return to the past. We see a Russia that has just completed a democratic transfer of executive power for the first time in 1,000 years.
I would not presume to tell the people you represent how to weigh the gains of freedom against the pain of economic hardship, corruption, crime. I know the people of Russia do not yet have the Russia they were promised in 1991. But I believe you, and they, now have a realistic chance to build that kind of Russia for yourselves in far greater measure than a decade ago, because of the democratic foundations that have been laid and the choices that have been made.
The world faces a very different Russia than it did in 1991. Like all countries, Russia also faces a very different world. Its defining feature is globalization, the tearing down of boundaries between people, nations and cultures, so that what happens anywhere can have an impact everywhere.
During the 1990's, the volume of international trade almost doubled. . . . Now Russia, America and all nations are subject to new rules of the global economy. One of those rules, to adapt a phrase from your history, is that it's no longer possible to build prosperity in one country alone. To prosper, our economies must be competitive in a global marketplace. And to compete, the most important resource we must develop is our own people, giving them the tools and freedom to reach their full potential.
This is the challenge we have tried to meet in America over the last few years. Indeed, the changes we have seen in the global economy pose hard questions that both our nations still must answer. A fundamental question is how do we define our strength and vitality as a nation today and what role should government play in building it? . . .
Another fundamental question is how shall countries define their strength in relation to the rest of the world today? Shall we define it as the power to dominate our neighbors or the confidence to be a good neighbor? Shall we define it by what we are against or simply in terms of what others are for? Do we join with others in common endeavors to advance common interests or do we try to bend others to our will?
This federal assembly's ratification of Start II and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty suggests you are answering these questions in a way that will make for both a stronger Russia and a better world, defining your strength in terms of the achievements of your people and the power of your partnerships and your role in world affairs.
A related question for both Russia and America is how should we define our relationship today? Clearly, Russia has entered a phase when what it needs most is outside investment, not aid. What Americans must ask is not so much what can we do for Russia, but what can we do with Russia to advance our common interests and lift people in both nations?

As Rate Fears Ebb, Treasury Yields Fall

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Yields on Treasury securities fell to six-week lows yesterday on expectations that the Federal Reserve would not need to raise interest rates as much as forecast to slow the economy and curb inflationary pressure.
"A lot of economic data has suggested the economy is slowing in a broad-based way," said Steven Wood, a senior economist at Banc of America Securities in San Francisco, "and that takes pressure off the Fed to raise rates in June." He added that "the positive tone will be carried over" in the fixed-income markets. 
 The yield on the most-actively-traded 10-year Treasury note fell to 6.12 percent, the lowest level since April 24, from 6.16 percent on Friday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 9/32, or $2.81 for each $1,000 face amount, to 102 23/32. The 30-year bond's yield dropped to 5.92 percent from 5.94 percent. Its price rose 12/32, to 104 21/32.
Some investors bought the higher-yielding debt of government-sponsored agencies like the mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Steve Smith, head of government bond trading at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. The benchmark 10-year Fannie Mae notes currently yield 1.09 percentage points more than 10-year Treasuries.
Treasuries may also be sold this week to hedge against possible losses in a number of expected corporate bond sales, some analysts said. Companies including Ford and International Paper plan to sell investment-grade and high-yield bonds totaling more than $10 billion in the coming days to take advantage of lower rates.
The results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.534	96.946	High Rate	5.80%	6.04%	Investment Rate	5.96%	6.31%	Low Rate	5.74%	5.98%	Median Rate	5.78%	6.02%	Total applied for	$25,946,651	$24,954,676	Accepted	$13,244,651	$11,552,026	Noncompetitive	$1,257,216	$1,090,546

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Wins Praise At U.N. Meeting on Women

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 5

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton took time off from state politics today to come back to feminism and the United Nations, where her audience has always been friendly, to deliver a spirited speech on women's rights.
Mrs. Clinton was not the main event. She spoke at one of many meetings on the margins of a weeklong special General Assembly session to assess the progress of women worldwide, five years after a groundbreaking conference in Beijing. 
 She is not part of the American delegation, as she was then. But the difference was lost on her audience of women from every continent, who greeted her with warmth and enthusiasm. They sang, clapped and grasped for her hand as they stormed the podium -- a display that no other speaker is likely to enjoy.
More than 10,000 women, and some men, from more than 180 countries are in New York for the session and dozens of related events.
Gita Sen, a development expert from India, said that Mrs. Clinton struck a responsive cord because of her unambiguous commitment to women's rights everywhere, a message many people gathered here say they want to hear more often from Americans, who seem to many to have withdrawn from the organization and the world in recent years.
"We are committed to making this journey together," Mrs. Clinton told a cheering audience invited by Unifem, the United Nations development program for women.
Her pledge came on a day when a group of independent organizations issued a call for help to forestall efforts they say the Vatican and some conservative Islamic and Catholic countries are making to reverse gains achieved five years ago at the Fourth International Conference on Women. At that meeting, a watershed event that brought grass-roots women's groups and governments together to form networks that continue to operate, most nations pledged to promote women's rights in areas as diverse as education, family planning and sexual relationships.
Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said Mrs. Clinton had laid out the administration's position forcefully. "It was Hillary saying, do not erode the gains of Beijing," he said.
Ms. Sen, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore and the leader of an organization for women from developing nations, said in an interview that this conference -- like the one in Beijing -- was in danger of sinking into arid debate over definitions and intentions. This meeting is intended to look for ways to move ahead, not to reopen debate on the issues, she said.
Women no longer want to debate the meaning of "family" or parse what "access to health care" means in relation to abortion, said Joana Foster, a Zimbabwean who is a leader of Women in Law and Development in Africa. "Africans think debates over nuances and language are a waste of time."
Ms. Foster represents a new generation of women in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia who have worked hard through international conferences for improvements in women's rights and are determined to maintain the momentum. She said that international agreements like the Beijing "platform for action" have real effects in developing countries.
"Beijing was a catalyst for a whole lot of things," she said. "People are getting into Parliament. Look at somewhere like Namibia, which now has 44 percent women in the local government system. In South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Ghana people are now fighting for affirmative action to become part and parcel of the constitutions in their countries."
"F.G.M. was a big thing in Beijing for all of us," Ms. Foster said, using shorthand for the term female genital mutilation, or the ritual cutting of girls' genitals. "A lot of countries have passed laws against it. There is that sort of progress going on. For us, we don't want a document that future governments can use to stop the progress."
In Beijing five years ago, nations agreed to end laws that discriminate against women and to open more education to girls. They also called for closing income gaps between women and men.
Secretary General Kofi Annan opened the formal assembly session by reminding his audience of goals still to be met. "Most countries have yet to legislate in favor of women's rights to own land," he said. "Violence against women is still increasing -- both in the home and in the newer types of armed conflict which target civilian populations."
Of 110 million children not in school, he said, two-thirds are girls.

Share Prices Mixed as Investors Pause Over Recent Gains

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, as investors paused to reassess their opportunities after last week's big advance.
Traders said they were encouraged by the price action. Yesterday's activity stood in stark contrast to the eruptions seen for much of the recent past. 
 "Back in April and May you would get a 150-point to 200-point rally and give it all back the next day," said Ned Collins, head trader at Daiwa Securities America.
"As far as I am concerned," he added, "it is good that we are treading water. We had such a big move last week that we need to consolidate some."
Led by Hewlett-Packard, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,815.30. But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.63 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,467.63, attributed in part to declines in General Electric, Cisco Systems and Wells Fargo.
The Nasdaq composite index, which rose a record 19 percent last week, rallied during the last hour of trading yesterday and closed at 3,821.76, up 8.38 points, or 0.2 percent.
And the Russell 2000 index of small- company stocks also managed to eke out a small gain, rising 0.27 point, to 513.30.
Stocks jumped last week on reports that showed the economy might be losing some of its momentum, an indication that efforts by the Federal Reserve Board to achieve that end might be working.
Since last June, the Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times to cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures.
The only report of any note this week, however, is the Producer Price Index for May on Friday.
As a consequence, analysts said stock prices were expected to remain in a trading range for this week, and possibly a good deal longer.
"To stay in a trading range is probably the best thing that can happen to the market," said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen.
"It gives the people the chance to get into stocks they want to get into, and to sell others at levels they want," he said. "There is no need to panic one way or the other. That is probably helpful, because the market needs to be a little calmer."
Trading volume was light, but not abnormally so for a Monday in what Wall Street considers the summer season.
Some 838 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was 1.4 billion shares.
Hewlett-Packard was the Dow's biggest gainer, rising 9 3/8, to 120 3/8.
Microsoft and I.B.M. also helped to move the Dow higher.
Microsoft rose 9/16, to 66 7/8, after it said it would spend $2 billion to speed adoption of its new Internet-based software.
I.B.M. rose 4, to 112 7/16, after a Merrill Lynch analyst expressed optimism about its prospects for the second half of the year.
But Intel slumped 1 5/8, to 132 9/16, as investors took some profits after last week's big advance. Intel's shares gained 14 percent last week.
Bank stocks, which have rallied strongly in recent weeks on hopes that an end to interest rate increases by the Fed is near, retreated yesterday.
Wells Fargo, an S.& P. 500 component, lost 2 3/8, to 45 1/8. Bank of America slid 1 3/4, to 59 1/4. Chase Manhattan lost 13/16, to 79 3/8. And Bank of New York shed 1 3/4, to 46 7/8.
Biotechnology stocks, which posted very good gains last week, continued to advance.
Genentech was the biggest winner, rising 19 7/8, to 129, after the drugmaker won approval from the Food and Drug Administration for TNKase, a next-generation version of Activase, a clot-busting drug for heart attack patients.
Human Genome Sciences rose 7 9/16, to 113 1/2. And PE Corp Celera jumped 22 1/2, to 91.
"I was expecting some retrenchment in the biotech sector, and it didn't happen," said Mike Weiner, a managing director at BancOne Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. "The follow-through in those stocks surprised me, and it probably masked some weakness in the Nasdaq."

HEADLINE: Doubts Rise on New Site for Big Board

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Eighteen months after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced plans to build a new trading complex for the New York Stock Exchange, the city has still not signed a formal agreement with the exchange for the heavily subsidized project, which includes a huge office tower in Lower Manhattan.
Nor have city and state officials signed a deal to buy the land for the project, an entire block bounded by Wall Street, Exchange Place, Broad Street and William Street. Even so, the estimated size of the public subsidy has grown to $640 million from $560 million, not including the cost of the land. 
 Despite the lengthy delays, the exchange says it is moving forward, and some public officials are optimistic that the deal to build the complex will ultimately fall into place.
Behind the scenes, however, there is bickering and widespread doubt that the project is necessary, given the advent of electronic networks that could replace the need for traditional trading floors. Although more than 680 million shares a day are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, critics contend that investors in the United States are increasingly buying and selling over the Internet, while the major stock exchanges in London, Frankfurt and elsewhere have already converted to electronic trading.
"There's a big question whether you need trading floors anymore," said Norman S. Poser, a former executive vice president of the American Stock Exchange and a professor of securities law at Brooklyn Law School. "In Europe, you don't have any more trading floors. It's electronic; all the trading's done at your desk."
But Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, has insisted that there will always be a need for the trading floors that have made it the world's premier exchange. Electronic communications networks such as Instinet and Island now account for about 30 percent of the transaction volume on the Nasdaq but have failed to make much of a dent at the exchange, where institutional investors still prefer to trade. Mr. Grasso has said the exchange needs a new complex to grow beyond its cramped historic headquarters on Wall Street.
"We continue to work with the city and the state to move the project forward as expeditiously as possible," said Ray Pellecchia, a spokesman for the Big Board. "We have the same space needs we had earlier. Our plans haven't changed a bit."
Neither Deputy Mayor Robert R. Harding nor Michael Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, returned calls requesting comment.
City and state officials have completed a draft environmental impact statement for the project but have held off certifying the project for public review. Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said that he expected to submit the environmental statement for public review as soon as the exchange signed a letter of intent. "Everyone is still working together," Mr. Gargano said. "It has taken a very long time, but it's a very large project."
But according to several people involved in the negotiations, some public officials contend that the stock exchange has dragged its feet over signing a letter of intent with the city, possibly because of its own uncertainty. The letter was supposed to be signed over a year ago. Exchange executives have played down the importance of the document, countering that they would sign a binding lease for the trading complex if only the city would complete a deal to buy the land for the project.
The land deal is another thicket of recriminations. The city has been negotiating with J.P. Morgan, which controls four of the five buildings on the proposed site, and the Rockrose Development Corporation, which owns the fifth, an apartment house. Yet, Morgan has stopped moving employees out of the buildings and Rockrose is still renting apartments.
According to the officials involved in the negotiations, J.P. Morgan has grown tired of waiting for the city to complete its agreement with the exchange. The company wants the city to buy the land now or allow it to sell the property to a developer. The city, in turn, suspects that Morgan is trying to get a higher price for its property, according to the officials.
City officials expect that it will cost about $350 million to acquire all the property and relocate tenants, but it is loath to do so without a definitive deal with the exchange. The city has said that the projected rent from the trading complex and the office tower should more than offset the cost of buying the land.
The project has evolved since a mayoral news conference in December 1998. Mayor's Giuliani's offer to build a trading complex for the exchange came after Mr. Grasso threatened to move to New Jersey. The city did not want to risk losing the exchange and the possible dissolution of the financial district, although many real estate and financial executives doubted that the exchange would move.
Unlike the city, the state has been more skeptical of threats by the exchange and has tried to limit the state's financial stake in the project. As a result, the city has committed $255 million toward the $480 million cost of the trading complex, while the state has declined to go above $225 million.
In recent months, according to a copy of the draft environmental impact study obtained by The New York Times, the size of the trading complex has been cut 25 percent, to 600,000 square feet. The complex would contain a 50,000-square-foot trading floor, a smaller trading floor and administrative offices. The stock exchange has said it will spend $350 million to outfit the complex.
At the same time, the office tower, which is to sit atop the trading complex, has grown to 1.3 million square feet from 1.2 million.
Some critics said that the project was beginning to look more like a real estate deal than an effort to keep the stock exchange in Lower Manhattan.
"It certainly raises the question of whether the city is providing incentives to keep the stock exchange, or to build another office tower," said Jonathan Bowles, research director of the Center for an Urban Future.

HEADLINE: Putin Travels to Rome to Promote Russian Arms Control Alternative

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, June 5

 BODY:
Leaving President Clinton behind in Moscow, Vladimir V. Putin came to Rome today to sell Europe -- and the Vatican -- on a Russian alternative to the United States missile defense proposal.
The two-day trip was timed to follow his somewhat tense discussions with Mr. Clinton about altering the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. And it was choreographed to put Mr. Putin's heightened sense of Russian power on display. He left for Rome one hour before his American guest flew to Ukraine, kept John Paul II waiting 20 minutes and used his meeting with Italian officials as an opportunity to use Europe as a wedge in Russia's arms control negotiations with the United States. 
 The trip, which was to include meetings with business and energy industry leaders in Milan on Tuesday, is also an effort to attract European investment in Russia's economy. Italy is Russia's leading trade partner in Europe after Germany. Mr. Putin, a somber former K.G.B. officer rarely given to public displays of exuberance, tried to disarm his Mediterranean hosts by saying he came to Rome early in his term "because we love Italy." Soon after his election in April, he also paid a visit to Prime Minister Tony Blair in London.
Mr. Putin's public remarks here, made after a two-hour meeting with the Italian prime minister, Giuliano Amato, were aimed at swaying international opinion on arms control, and in particular at exploiting European fears that the United States is embarked on a risky course to refashion the ABM treaty to create a missile defense system aimed at protecting itself.
"Russia proposed working with Europe and NATO to create an anti-rocket defense system for Europe," Mr. Putin told reporters after meeting with Mr. Amato. "On one hand, it would avoid all the problems linked to the balance of force. On the other, it would permit in an absolute manner a 100 percent guarantee of the security of every European country."
The Russian proposal, which Mr. Putin made public in a NBC News interview last week on the eve of Mr. Clinton's arrival in Moscow, seems to offer the United States and Europe a joint missile defense program using short- and medium-range missiles to destroy rockets on their way up, instead of intercepting warheads on their way down. Mr. Putin's proposal resembles what advocates in the United States call a "boost phase defense." This could in theory ward off attacks from so-called "rogue" states, but would be of little use against the Russian nuclear force.
That would make it more acceptable to the Russian military, which fears that a solely American missile force could be used to gain a strategic advantage. But the United States military believes that the Russian approach cannot work, and wants to amend the ABM treaty to build a battle-management radar in Alaska and put 100 interceptors there to protect the 50 states.
In Italy, Mr. Putin emphasized the advantages of his plan to Europe's defense, seeking to exploit European fears that American efforts to rewrite the ABM treaty could destabilize relations with Russia and leave Europe unprotected.
"We know that many here in Europe and in the world and the United States are worried about whether the 1972 accord would be kept," Mr. Putin said, referring to the treaty. "We share the point of departure of this discussion," he said.
European leaders have warned of the dangers of any unilateral change in the treaty. Italy, current chairman of the Council of Europe, has often argued that Russia cannot be left out of any effort to limit the missile threat.
"There was nothing fundamentally new in what Putin proposed, but it seemed newly tailored to meet European needs," one Italian diplomat said. "Europeans are preoccupied with any decoupling of their own security, on one hand, and any unilateral change in international agreements that could lead to a weakening of security." He added: "But fear of unilateral actions works both ways -- vis-a-vis Russia as well as the United States."
Mr. Putin went to the Vatican for his first encounter with John Paul II. Arriving 20 minutes late, Mr. Putin was greeted warmly by the Polish pope, who told his visitor in Italian, "I am very happy to receive you at the Vatican at the beginning of your presidential mandate."
According to the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, Mr. Putin spent most of the 30-minute meeting describing his vision of how Russia should be integrated into Western Europe and his views of how the Vatican could help the process. Calling Mr. Putin's proposal a "very ambitious approach," Dr. Navarro-Valls said that the Pope "mainly listened, then gave some remarks."
The pope, who turned 80 in May, has long yearned to visit Russia. But the Russian Patriarch, Aleksy II, has never agreed to a meeting with the pope, citing grievances like Roman Catholic proselytizing and its support of Eastern rite Catholic Churches in Ukraine.
 Mr. Putin did not directly renew a longstanding invitation, which Vatican officials noted is still active. But the fact that John Paul II listened attentively to Mr. Putin and refrained, at least publicly, from raising issues like Chechnya that could have embarrassed the president, suggested that the Vatican has some optimism for the future.

HEADLINE: Peace Across the Hudson

 BODY:
The biggest network of airports, train lines, bus terminals and port facilities in the New York region is run by one giant agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Last week, Gov. George Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman reached an important agreement to end a fight over distribution of the authority's subsidies and projects. The accord, which ends 18 months of paralysis, grants Mr. Pataki's request for more resources spent in New York. It was a welcome step, but much more thinking is needed to revitalize the authority as an engine of economic growth.
The authority runs some operations that are profitable and others that lose money. Its stated goal has always been to mix burdens and benefits in a way that is fair to both sides. Since World War II, however, it has made sense for both states to allow shipping terminals to move to New Jersey, where there are better links to the continental United States and more room for container operations. 
 New York still gains from being the site of many businesses that serve the shipping industry.
Mr. Pataki has cried foul, however, as New Jersey also got the benefits of a new airport at Newark. In addition, the authority subsidizes the PATH lines and buses, enabling New Jersey commuters to pay lower fares than their counterparts on New York City's subways and buses.
The accord announced last week will restore some balance. For New Jersey, it approves a 30-year lease at Elizabeth Marine Terminal to the Maersk-Sealand container shipping company, which was threatening to go to Baltimore or Halifax. The authority will spend $575 million over 30 years to deepen the channel and make other improvements. But New Jersey commuters will also have to pay more in bus and subway fares.
New York is to gain by being able to sell or privatize the World Trade Center, sell air rights over the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and embark on several beneficial projects. One could lead to a nonstop transit ride to Kennedy Airport, while another would help build a new Penn Station at the post office building on 34th Street.
New Yorkers should not give up on the Port Authority, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has with his effort to take over operations of Kennedy and La Guardia Airports. Instead of balkanizing the authority, its resources should be spread to benefit everyone. In the years ahead, the authority can do much to help commuters in New York. One positive step would be for the authority to help extend the No. 7 line from Grand Central to Pennsylvania Station and the Hudson River, where it could provide a link from Queens to the New Jersey transit lines and spur economic growth on Manhattan's West Side.
Nearly 80 years ago, the Port Authority's creation was hailed as a landmark in regional cooperation. It is time to look beyond the spoils and get back to a vision as valid today as it was back then.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Rift Revealed States' Competitive Instincts

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
Closing the deal took just a few hours of phone calls between Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York. Making it official took just two minutes' worth of votes by the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
But the agreement that the two states reached last week, unleashing millions of dollars' worth of stalled projects, was the result of a roller coaster ride of negotiations and escalating demands that had stretched out for more than a year. 
 So on Friday, as the agency's 12-member board ratified the deal, which had been clinched the day before by the two governors, many of those involved in the talks could not forget that troubling history amid the governors' tableau of unity.
It is difficult to calculate whether one state got more out of the deal than the other. But it is clear that their jockeying for advantage allowed a dispute over a single issue -- a 30-year lease for the Maersk-Sealand shipping line to expand its operations at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey -- to snowball into an 18-month stalemate in which all of the Port Authority's long-term projects were kept in limbo.
The impasse took on a life of its own, said an adviser to Governor Whitman, until "everything was on the table" -- including otherwise routine expenditures, like the purchase of cranes and barges.
As the board met month after month, unable to agree on much, negotiators talked almost daily.
The turning point in the talks is difficult to identify. Some involved in the negotiations say key steps to compromise were an increase in the pool of money available for New York projects, New Jersey's willingness to consider fare increases on the PATH commuter rail line, and a realization on both sides that basic philosophical differences over the operations of the Port Authority were not going to be reconciled.
In addition, there was growing criticism from newspaper editorial boards and former governors in both states, who said the dispute was embarrassing the agency.
But even as the settlement was being finalized, some people close to the negotiations suggested that the dispute could have been settled earlier but for each state's determination to wring out greater concessions in the allocation of funds.
And even as they detailed the concessions that had made the settlement possible, officials on both sides of the Hudson privately pointed out ways in which their state had "won."
Some New York officials suggested that they had triumphed by negotiating an additional $287 million to cover unexpected increases in the cost of a terminal and rail link between Kennedy International Airport and subway and commuter lines in Queens, as well as $13 million for economic development in the neighborhood. But New Jersey officials pointed out that the Port Authority had already committed $1.6 billion toward the project, and was unlikely to leave it incomplete.
New Jersey, in turn, claimed victory in overcoming New York's objections to the Maersk-Sealand lease, which Mrs. Whitman said would guarantee the region's dominance among East Coast ports. But New York officials suggested that by temporarily withholding their support for a lease that they agree was necessary, they had prevented the Port Authority from handing a "blank check" to the shipping company.
Lewis Eisenberg, chairman of the Port Authority and New Jersey's chief negotiator throughout the stalemate, said last week that such comments on either side amounted to a kind of bean counting.
"It is what someone would say to stir the pot and continue the friction," he said. "But it is contrary to the spirit which I saw in the governors of New York and New Jersey as they worked this out."
Still, Mr. Eisenberg and his New York counterpart, Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, concede that philosophical differences persist between the states on the direction and approach of the agency.
At the heart of the dispute was the Maersk-Sealand lease, which was first proposed in early 1999 and ran aground because New York officials believed that it provided too large a subsidy to the company.
In retaliation, Mrs. Whitman ordered Mr. Eisenberg and other New Jersey representatives on the board to block two projects New York favored: the leasing of air rights over the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and efforts to sell or lease the World Trade Center.
Then, in February 1999, officials close to Mrs. Whitman said privately that the two sides had tentatively agreed to a compromise. It would have provided New York with $120 million in Port Authority funds for projects of the state's choosing, as well as $120 million for New York's plan to renovate the main post office in mid-Manhattan into a transportation and office complex that would include a new Pennsylvania Station.
But hopes of a settlement were dashed, some officials say, when Mr. Pataki was pressed by advisers and Port Authority officials to hold out for more. Mr. Gargano disputes this, saying that in early 1999 the Pataki administration was adamant that the Maersk-Sealand lease would unfairly benefit New Jersey by providing hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to the shipper.
New York said it should receive a pool of money for New York-based projects equal to the amount of that subsidy -- an amount calculated by New York at various times to be as much as $1.6 billion and as little as $250 million over the life of the lease. New York also called for the port agency to support its Manhattan transportation complex as a truly regional project. But New Jersey balked, Mr. Gargano said.
The next opportunity to resolve the dispute came last June, said Michael P. Torpey, Governor Whitman's chief of staff, when the states faced warnings from American Airlines at Kennedy Airport and Continental Airlines at Newark International Airport. The two airlines said their expansion projects at the airports were in jeopardy without Port Authority investments.
That led to an effort to reach a settlement that would include the airport projects, the Maersk-Sealand lease and the World Trade Center and Port Authority Bus Terminal plans. But the broader accord sank even as the airport projects were approved; both states believed that the airport projects were too important to risk, Mr. Torpey said.
Through much of last summer and into the fall, only minor progress was made in settling the dispute.
Meanwhile, the agency had a growing backlog of stalled spending proposals generally supported by the two states -- for new cranes, development of Howland Hook as a container port on Staten Island, and the lease or sale of the Port Authority-owned Newark Legal Center.
New York increasingly framed the dispute as a debate over fairness. New Jersey, it said, was disproportionately benefiting from Port Authority spending -- whether at Newark Airport, which had grown tremendously in the last decade, or in New Jersey's containerized-cargo operations. Easily reached by truck and rail, they had long ago supplanted New York's traffic-clogged port areas as prime berthing areas for the new, larger container ships.
So New York began pushing for an increase in fares on the PATH line, long a sore point. The Port Authority is subsidizing the line to the tune of $181 million this year, and New York sees that as a benefit mainly for New Jersey residents.
In last week's deal, New Jersey agreed to allow a study that is likely to lead to the first increase in the $1 PATH fare since 1987.
In the end, said Mr. Torpey, it was unclear exactly why the feud was resolved when it was. "It had gone on long enough," he said. "Maybe it was time. Maybe it was in the stars."

HEADLINE: Preferring Rochester to Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER

 BODY:
On paper, at least, Christine B. Whitman looks like a slice of old Rochester. She grew up there, works at a company that was once part of Kodak, lives in a local landmark, and serves on the boards of all kinds of civic groups.
But how many members of the old guard long for "a nerd bird" -- nonstop jet service from Rochester to Silicon Valley? 
 And that is just one of the things that makes Chris Whitman a living symbol of the new, high-tech Rochester, many people here say. The company she runs, CVC, makes equipment for the computer industry. It sells these machines to Kodak and Xerox, yes, but also to I.B.M. and Sony and Seagate Technology.
CVC not only sells its products around the world, but it also has offices across the country and overseas. Ms. Whitman spends much of her time on the road, and keeps an apartment in California near her Silicon Valley office.
Why did she not move CVC out there, to where so many of her high-tech customers are? "I considered that," she said. "But my family is here, and we are committed to the Rochester area." Her husband, Steve, teaches advanced placement physics at Brighton High School; her son is in the eighth grade (and her daughter attends the University of Illinois).
"Years ago, Rochester was fairly self-contained, probably not as global and diverse," she said. But as the economy has shifted to smaller, high-tech firms, she added, "more of us are traveling through the world."
Getting potential employees to move to Rochester has been a challenge, Ms. Whitman concedes: "People think this is pretty close to Alaska, not a little bit west of Boston." But she has succeeded in attracting employees by concentrating on people with families who would be attracted to Rochester's cultural and recreational amenities, she said, and the fact that it is "a low-hassle place to live."
She has done things unimagined by most worker bees. After a dozen years at CVC, she raised money and bought out the previous owners in 1990 (the company was started as a division of Kodak in 1934).
In 1999, she took the company public by selling stock through a big Wall Street firm, Lehman Brothers. CVC had gone from about 100 employees and $10 million of sales to 400 employees and $100 million of sales.
And this year, she did a very un-Rochester thing -- she merged CVC with a company from Long Island, Veeco. She became president and chief operating officer of the merged company, and remains based in Rochester.
Not everything has gone smoothly, of course. Veeco CVC has announced the layoff of 180 people, most of them at a plant in Virginia.
In Rochester, "generations of people lived, their children stayed, there wasn't much movement," Ms. Whitman said. That, she said, is no longer true.
Does she expect her own children to stay in Rochester? "I'd say," she replies after a pause, "they're going to go where their careers take them."

F.C.C. Approves Purchase Of Cable Giant by AT&T
The Federal Communications Commission approved AT&T's acquisition of MediaOne after ordering the companies to sell some of their assets, clearing the final obstacle to a merger that will create the nation's largest provider of cable television, long-distance telephone service and high-speed Internet access. 
 The F.C.C. gave the companies a choice of which programming and cable subsidiaries and investments to sell to comply with a rule that forbids a corporation from having interests in more than 30 percent of the nation's cable and satellite television market. Officials estimate that, without any divestitures, AT&T and MediaOne would control more than 40 percent of that market. Page A1.
 
Thomson to Purchase Primark
Thomson, which is selling most of its newspapers to focus on the electronic distribution of legal and financial information, agreed to buy Primark for $842 million. Thomson will pay $38 a share for Primark, a 31 percent premium to Primark's stock price of $29 on Friday. Shares of Primark, based in Waltham, Mass., rose $8.25, to $37.25, while Thomson fell 1.80 Canadian dollars, to 49.20. C4.
 
Merrill in Talks to Buy Market Maker
Merrill Lynch is in discussions to buy Herzog Heine Geduld for nearly $1 billion, according to people close to the companies. The deal, which could be announced as soon as today, would give Merrill a much larger role in trading on the Nasdaq stock market. C2.
 
Stocks Mixed in Lackluster Session
Stock prices were mixed as investors paused after last week's big advance. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.54 points, to 10,815.30, but the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.63 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,467.63. The Nasdaq composite index, which rose a record 19 percent last week, rallied during the last hour of trading and closed at 3,821.76, up 8.38 points, or 0.2 percent. C12.
 
S.E.C. Tackles Variable Annuities
In the midst of a federal examination of the sale of variable annuities, a fast-growing and controversial combination of mutual funds and insurance, a senior Securities and Exchange Commission official issued a stern warning that misleading tactics and incomplete disclosure would not be tolerated. C6.
 
Start-Up Seeks Copyright Ruling
In a case experts say may have broad implications for whether automated Internet search engines can be held liable for linking to pirated material, an Internet start-up, MP3Board.com, has asked a federal judge to find that it is not abetting copyright infringement simply by linking to MP3 music files. C27.
 
I.M.F. Chief Advises Indonesia
The new managing director of the International Monetary Fund said that closing off Indonesian capital markets would hinder the nation's fragile economic recovery. The I.M.F.'s chief, Horst Kohler, left, emerged from a breakfast meeting with President Abdurrahman Wahid and briskly dispelled speculation that the I.M.F. would agree to an Indonesian effort to defend its faltering currency, the rupiah, by placing controls on the currency. C4.
 
Health and Safety Concerns in China
As China applies to join the World Trade Organization, international concern has been directed at the sometimes unpleasant or dangerous working conditions in the country's export industries, especially those owned by foreign companies. But health and safety conditions are generally far worse, Chinese and foreign experts say, in the many smaller factories and mines that have sprung up during the economic reforms of the last two decades, mainly producing goods for the domestic market.

HEADLINE: Cordial Talks Yield Accord On City Budget

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
After unusually amicable negotiations, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, announced a $37.6 billion budget accord yesterday that relies in part on this year's record surplus to cut business and income taxes and still expands government services.
The City Council had the most to boast about, given that the mayor, consistent with his "kinder, gentler" approach to governing in recent weeks, agreed to nearly all of the major bargaining points being pushed by Mr. Vallone and his colleagues. 
 The budget package for the 2001 fiscal year includes money to extend library hours, provide weekend meals for lower-income elderly citizens and to install about 75 of the city's long-planned street-side toilets. The mayor even surprised Council negotiators by accepting a Council plan to restructure the personal income tax rates so that a smaller share is paid by middle- and lower-income residents.
"It is an excellent budget," Mr. Giuliani said, standing amid two dozen Council members, whom he greeted with repeated handshakes, slaps on the back and even hugs. "It is one that achieves the objectives that the administration wants to achieve and the objectives the Council wants to achieve. It was done through compromise and agreement."
But the Council and mayor both warned that the deal could unravel since state legislators were likely to approve a change in the coming weeks in pension benefits for retired city employees that could cost the city as much as $1 billion in the 2001 fiscal year. If that happens, they said, the $414 million tax cut package, which involves nine items including a $329 million reduction in the personal income tax and a $23 million child-care tax credit, is the part of the budget the city is most likely to scale back.
"Forget the politics and just do the right thing," Mr. Vallone said, directing his comments to city legislators in Albany, asking that any new pension burden not be too great. "Don't let the air change that happens when you get to Exit 23" at Albany, he said, joking about the difference a little distance can make. He urged that they not "forget who you represent," adding, "This is still our town."
A $3.2 billion surplus is expected this fiscal year, beating last year's record largely as a result of the still booming city economy. About a third of the surplus would be set aside to help curtail budget deficits already projected to start surfacing in 2002. But Charles Brecher, research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, said the plan called for far too much of the surplus to be used to support basic city expenses in the coming year, a practice that could be dangerous if the economy goes sour.
"It is like getting a bonus in your paycheck and using it to rent a bigger apartment," Mr. Brecher said. "You can afford it at first, but then the money runs out."
The budget also relies in part on a one-time windfall of about $808 million that the city is getting over two years by taking credit for larger than expected profits gained through the investment of city pension funds. In order to get the unions to allow the city to tap those funds, the mayor agreed to sweeten their pension benefits, costing the city nearly $300 million a year, an expense that Mr. Brecher said would never go away.
Giuliani administration officials said the budget would be a prudent one, but added that they would start soon after the fiscal year begins on July 1 to look for ways to limit spending to reduce the possible deficits in later years. Those are projected to be about $2.7 billion by 2002.
The negotiations between the mayor and the Council focused in the last two weeks on competing tax cut plans and proposals for spending for city agencies. The biggest expense, as is always the case, is the school system, which would get $11.1 billion, the mayor said, a gain of 3.7 percent. The figures for other city agencies were not released yesterday, since budget officials were still adjusting the totals to take into account changes the mayor and Council had backed.
The spending adjustments ultimately agreed to as part of the settlement announced yesterday are tiny compared to the entire budget. They add up to $170 million, about $100 million of which restores cuts proposed by the mayor in April and about $70 million that actually increases city spending.
The mayor's more conciliatory approach to the budget this year surfaced in April, when he dropped his traditional push to cut spending for city libraries and cultural institutions. Now he has gone even further, agreeing to a Council request to increase spending in these areas by a total of $25 million. Even the Brooklyn Museum of Art, site of the "Sensation" exhibit the mayor had condemned, would get about 8 percent more city support, Council officials said.
"It was very hostile," the mayor joked yesterday at a news conference in describing this year's negotiations, arousing laughter from the Council members assembled, before one Council member joked about a "kinder, gentler" mayor.
Other new spending added at the Council's request includes $6 million for weekend meals for the elderly and an extra $5.2 million to provide health insurance for more of the city residents who now lack coverage. The mayor yesterday pointed proudly to some of his own initiatives included in the budget: $160 million to build new DNA laboratories to expand the genetic testing of suspects and other money to hire new school safety officers.
The Council and the mayor also agreed to use mostly federal funding to hire about 1,230 new police officers. And $12 million is being set aside for special school system initiatives, like charter schools, although the mayor dropped his insistence that some of it be used to finance a voucher program that would help parents send their children to private or parochial schools. There is also $1.7 million to offer women free breast cancer screening and to support educational programs related to ovarian and prostate cancer, an initiative that the mayor, who himself has prostate cancer, had originally proposed to cut.
The biggest piece of the tax cut package is a reduction in the personal income tax. Instead of just cutting the tax rate consistently across all income levels, the mayor agreed to a Council proposal to restructure the tax system. As a result, taxpayers earning less than $70,000 a year would pay about 12 percent less in city personal income tax, with a smaller reduction for the more affluent, dropping to less than 1 percent for those who earn $1 million or more. A taxpayer earning $60,000 to $70,000 a year would pay about $207 less.
The tax cut package includes a child-care tax credit, which varies depending on a family's income but would be worth $385 a year for a family with two children and an income of about $28,000. There is also a proposal to give a tax break to elderly residents who rent apartments on a moderate income.
The City Council could vote as soon as today to adopt the proposed budget. But the city needs the approval of the State Legislature before it can enact most of the tax cuts. And if the Legislature approves cost-of-living increases for more than 100,000 retired city workers -- increases tied to inflation year after year -- then pieces of the tax cut plan might be abandoned, Mr. Giuliani said.
Officials in Albany said the negotiations on the proposed pension program were still under way, and the city estimates that the program could cost the city $500 million to $1 billion. But Herman D. Farrell Jr., a New York City Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, said the mayor and Council had their priorities wrong.
"The constant harping on tax cuts versus a cost-of-living increase for retirees is obscene," Mr. Farrell said, adding that retired workers need a pension that can allow them to afford basic expenses.
Estimates of overall city spending differed. The mayor said yesterday that city-supported spending would decline by 2.9 percent or $600 million compared with the current fiscal year. But the city's Independent Budget Office said that number did not take into account the city's habit of using the surplus to prepay some of the next year's expenses. Once these measures are considered, actual spending would be up by more than 6 percent, or more than twice the rate of inflation, said Ronnie Lowenstein, deputy director and chief economist at the Independent Budget Office.

HEADLINE: A City, Once Smug, Is Redefined;
Company Town Becomes a Town of Tiny Companies

SERIES: THE OTHER ECONOMY -- Remaking Jobs in Rochester

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER

 BODY:
You might think these are tough times in the city that George Eastman built.
His Eastman Kodak Company, for close to a century the city's reason for being, is now a shadow of its former self, and its future is cloudy. Xerox, which was founded here, is once more laying off thousands of people and struggling to regain some kind of financial footing. Bausch & Lomb, the third pillar of Rochester's economy, has been jettisoning businesses and people. 
 Yet you do not hear the blues much in this green city near Lake Ontario. Because against all odds, small companies have been filling the job gap.
Almost invisibly, in low-slung factories to the west of town and anonymous office parks to the east, tiny companies have been springing up all over Rochester: computer software companies, telecommunications companies, medical equipment companies, high-tech manufacturing companies, Internet companies. And they are hungry for workers.
In Rochester today, almost anyone suddenly unemployed "is getting gobbled up by existing technology businesses," said Brian E. Hickey, executive vice president of the M & T Bank.
The jobless rate in Rochester hovers around 4 percent, roughly where it has been since 1996, and the overall number of jobs just hit 555,000, surpassing the number in Buffalo for the first time. Every year for the last three, state economists have had to revise Rochester's job count upward by thousands of positions; big companies fill out surveys more readily than little ones, which often show up in state records only when they pay their unemployment insurance taxes.
Of course, the shift from a company town to a town full of little companies is by no means complete -- or assured. Total job growth in Rochester remains lower than the statewide average. And the Milken Institute, a high-tech research organization, ranks Rochester just 71st out of 315 metropolitan areas based on the concentration of high-tech business. Silicon Valley is not shaking in its expensive sneakers.
When you want to start a business, "Rochester is not the first place that comes to mind," said Christopher M. Campbell, who left a "comfy cozy corporate position" to found Clean Dry Air in 1998. "Hopefully, that's changing."
The change has not been easy, not for the people involved, not for the city government, not for the self-image of a place once so self-satisfied that it was called Smugtown.
There was, perhaps, a lot to be smug about. Even today, the area around Rochester remains extremely prosperous, full of grand houses and stately trees and glossy shopping centers. In May, every green spot is spangled with lilacs, and the city's suburban schools continue to rank as some of the best in the country.
There is not much need for networking in Rochester -- everyone turns up at Little League games or in line at Wegmans, the local grocery chain. Corpses do sometimes turn up in the Genesee River, to be sure, but they are more likely to be victims of canoe accidents than of criminal activity.
Rochester began to boom with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, but it was Eastman who really put the place on the map. It was not just that he pretty much invented film and brought photography to the masses. Eastman also had a hand in every aspect of Rochester's civic life. He founded the music school and the dental school, endowed the university, created the United Way.
And, of course, there were the Eastman Kodak jobs. The company "essentially guaranteed lifetime employment, not only for yourself but for your family members," said William A. Johnson Jr., Rochester's mayor. Paternalistic in the extreme, Kodak took care of its people with cushy positions, high salaries and great benefits. The work force was and is highly educated, with an emphasis on engineering.
In midcentury, the Haloid Company, soon to be known as Xerox, became the Microsoft of its day. By the early 1980's, "if you figured in the companies servicing Xerox and Kodak, they were responsible for three quarters of the economy, easily," said Kent Gardner, director of economic analysis for the Center for Governmental Research (which was founded by you-know-who).
A handful of business leaders ran the city. When the developer who had started building a Hyatt hotel downtown abandoned it in the late 1980's (he was not, locals note, from Rochester), it was a small group of businessmen who put up the money to finish the job.
In the early 1990's, things began to change. Kodak, facing fierce competition from overseas and suffering from disastrous forays into new businesses, had been maintaining what many called a bloated bureaucracy. George M. C. Fisher, the chief executive appointed in 1993, made it clear that he had to save the company, not run the city.
The company began laying off tens of thousands of people. In the early 1980's, more than 60,000 people worked at Kodak in Rochester; now, the company says, there are fewer than 25,000 workers. At its peak, Kodak accounted for almost a quarter of the city's payroll; today, that figure is just over 10 percent, according to the Center for Governmental Research.
What happened to all those people?
Some have obviously moved away to seek work; the population of metropolitan Rochester has been edging down since 1994 (it is now just over one million, though there has not been an exodus as from Buffalo).
Many others became "consultants," here as elsewhere a code word for "probably retired."
Thomas T. Mooney, president of the Greater Rochester Metro Chamber of Commerce, estimates that 20 percent were "outsourced," meaning that they continued to have almost the same jobs, just not under Kodak's name.
As for the rest, he said, "Our sense is that the majority stayed and found gainful employment."
They found it at places like the Sutherland Group, which was founded in 1986 by a refugee from Xerox. Sutherland, which is hired by other companies to handle their customer relations, now employs 2,400 people, including about 1,200 in Rochester.
They include people like Richard E. Clouser, director of sales operations, who spent 28 years at Kodak, and Ronald B. Knight, chief operating officer, who retired from Xerox after 30 years. Both men said the adjustment to a smaller company has been rewarding -- but not easy.
In his first few weeks at Sutherland, Mr. Knight recalled, he was asked to handle a customer's request. "By the time I figured it out, someone else did the job," he said, with chagrin still in his voice. "We move quickly here."
The adjustment is not always easy on the company side, either. Daniel J. Lang, Sutherland's president, said that not everyone he has brought in from a corporation has worked out. The sticking points, he said, are culture, status and money: like most of the small companies, Sutherland pays far more modest salaries than the big corporations, but offers large performance bonuses.
Chatting with some Sutherland employees in a conference room, it is easy to discover that many of them could easily have moved away, but chose not to. Life in Rochester, they said, is too cheap and too good.
Joseph J. Buggy, originally from Philadelphia, decided to stay in Rochester even after the engineering firm he worked for left, because his family loves the area; it does not hurt that the golf is great. He does allow that sometimes the city still feels a little insular, especially when he watches the evening news. ("Out of 30 minutes, 28 1/2 are about Monroe County.")
Similarly, Johnson Au-Yeung, the chief technology officer, says he sometimes "misses the big-city ambience."
"At 10 p.m. on a Friday night," he said, "there's nowhere to go unless you go to a bar." Nevertheless, he raved about the low cost of real estate and the easy commuting, all so different from his family's home in Jackson Heights, Queens.
Another striking thing about the Sutherland employees is that they appeared uninterested in joining a start-up company, the dream of so many Manhattanites. "I want to go to growth, to learn something new," said Barbara McManus, who until recently worked for Bausch & Lomb. But, she said, "I wanted something that was already started."
In fact, relatively few of the corporate refugees have actually started businesses of their own, said Mr. Gardner of the Center for Governmental Research.
Just ask Paul Wetenhall. Once an employee of Xerox, he runs a software company, and now spends four days a week as "venture coach" at the Lennox Tech Enterprise Center, a business incubator near the Rochester Institute of Technology.
Even if they once worked at a big company, most of his entrepreneurs have experience being on their own and understand what it takes, he said. Like Bruce P. Sidari, who in May was bolting together his own office furniture at the center. Mr. Sidari has worked at Kodak, it is true, but he has worked at a lot of places, including for himself, before starting an Internet employment company, Emp Tek Inc.
Entrepreneurs often find it hard to find time for their families, much less for the civic duties that consumed George Eastman and his heirs, Mr. Wetenhall said. Indeed, until he took the job at the incubator, which is affiliated with the Chamber of Commerce, it did not even occur to him to join that group. Entrepreneurs, he said, "tend not to be too plugged in to the community."
That is hard for Rochester to adjust to. Priding itself on its civic participation, this city is still wrestling with the effects of downsizing.
At the United Way, Kodak's corporate gift has fallen by more than $1 million since 1992, to $2.4 million this year. And as Kodak cuts back, so do other corporations.
Just as difficult are the layoffs of individual workers, often men who pledged $500 a year, said Joseph G. Calabrese, the charity's president. Meanwhile, the charity is lucky if new participants pledge $50 -- and it has to talk to two people for every pledge. So to replace one former donor, the United Way must contact 20 people.
"We have to make more and more calls and visits and presentations to more and more people," Mr. Calabrese said. For the first time, this year, the United Way raffled off cars to lure people to its presentations.
Business and civic leaders also complain of a leadership void -- that no one has stepped in to replace the old corporate chieftains who tackled the city's problems. And there are problems, including serious troubles in schools in poor downtown neighborhoods, high air fares that help isolate the city, and some sections of downtown that could use a lift.
And then, there is what could delicately be called the image problem. Companies are not moving to Rochester; neither, more ominously, are people, even those looking for high-tech jobs. Such people need to feel "that if you get a job in one company and it doesn't work out, you can go down the street and find another one," said Peter Holloran, a marketing executive.
He is helping Rochester to put together its first major sales campaign, long after cities from Atlanta to Cleveland have already done so. Why has it taken so long? "Rochester never sunk far enough," he said. "The Genesee River never went up in flames."
The mayor and other civic leaders are working on some other efforts, too. They hope somehow to encourage more of a night life in downtown Rochester, and also want to develop more housing in the center city for young people who do not long to live in the suburbs.
And they have talked to the presidents of the universities in and around Rochester, asking them to reach out to their alumni who might be willing to move back to Rochester to fill the new jobs that the smaller companies are creating.
"We've never had that in our job description; we never think about bringing them back," said Albert J. Simone, president of Rochester Institute of Technology. But, he says, he will. "If it weren't for downsizing, these employers would be all over me."
 
The Other Economy
Upstate New York, a vast, diverse landscape of old cities, small towns, farms and forests stretching from Buffalo to Albany and north to the Canadian border, was once one of the most populous and prosperous regions of the country. But the national economic boom that swept into New York City and its suburbs passed it by. This is the second in a series of articles examining the region's quest for prosperity. A previous article discussed the population drain in Buffalo.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Stellar Cast of Democrats Raises $3.7 Million in New York

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
High above Midtown Manhattan, Vice President Al Gore said last night that Representative Charles B. Rangel was "in the catbird seat." And the Harlem Democrat, grinning through his mustache, looked as if he was indeed in a position of power.
Mr. Rangel's possible future as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has brought him many friends. 
 Last night, first at a reception at the Supper Club and then over dinner on the 33rd floor of the Service Employees International Union on 42nd Street, they raised $3.7 million for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in the hope that the Democrats will recapture the House in November, an event that would automatically promote Mr. Rangel to the chairmanship of the powerful tax-writing panel.
The size of the cache came as a surprise to everyone. It was $1 million more than the committee had expected, and it was delivered in an envelope at the Supper Club by Dennis Rivera, president of the union local, to David Jones, the fund-raiser for Mr. Rangel.
The evening, built around Mr. Rangel's 70th birthday, which is days away, yielded the largest take for House Democrats since, oh, mid-March, when they raised $7.3 million at an event in Washington.
But tonight drew an all-star cast of Democrats, including Mr. Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton, former Mayor David N. Dinkins, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, chairman of fund-raising for the House Democrats, assorted members of Congress from New York and Andrew M. Cuomo, the housing secretary.
Mr. Gore stood on a folding metal chair at the dinner and lavished praise on Mr. Rangel.
"Charlie Rangel is the heart and the soul of the Democratic caucus," Mr. Gore said. "He is the lion of Lenox Avenue. He is the man with the constant growl. He is the man responsible for the Rangel renaissance. He is part of all the budget policy, the health policy, Social Security, Medicare, education -- the Ways and Means Committee has it all. Let's make Charlie Rangel the next chairman!"
Mr. Gore, in his new mode of refraining from attacks on his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, made mention of only one Republican, Newt Gingrich, but otherwise only broadly referred to "the other side," which, he warned, would lead the nation into ruin.
Mr. Cuomo said later that Mr. Gore's previous "negative message" had been an effective and persuasive critique of the Republicans. "But he's more appealing when he's on the positive," Mr. Cuomo said.
A buoyant Mr. Rangel followed the vice president's lead, climbing up on a chair and assuring his listeners, "When we have the majority, one thing is going to be abundantly clear -- that we are going to move the Congress and the nation forward, that we are not going to pick fights with Republicans."
Mrs. Clinton, who appeared at the Supper Club, where Lionel Hampton led a dozen trumpets and saxophones in unending refrains of "Happy Days Are Here Again," also hailed Mr. Rangel in unusually laudatory language.
"Maybe earlier than many, I began to just do whatever Charlie told me to," she told the crowd. Alluding to the days when her Senate candidacy had seemed just an improbable rumor, she said: "And so when people said, 'Well, you know, gee, are you going to run for the Senate in New York?' I said, 'Well, Charlie told me I should,' so here I am, and I'm very happy I am because I'm having the time of my life."
Mrs. Clinton, like Mr. Gore, gave a nod to Mr. Kennedy and to his uncle, Robert F. Kennedy, who, both noted, was assassinated 32 years ago. Mrs. Clinton said she was honored to be seeking the same Senate seat that he once held, one that her supporters often invoke as having been won by a non-New Yorker.
She also lauded Mr. Gore and her husband, the president, saying that the nation elected them in 1992 on faith but now had the "evidence and results" of a thriving economy and that that was a big reason to elect Mr. Gore president.
At the dinner at the union headquarters, Mr. Gore spoke of the soaring economy but also cautioned, "There are a lot of people who are not yet being carried along."
It was in a similarly populist spirit that he began his day, proposing in a speech in North Carolina to put nearly all services of the federal government on line so that citizens would not have to wait in line or at their mail boxes to do things like receive their Social Security benefits, apply for a home loan with the federal government or report a crime.
Numerous activities are now possible on line, like applying for student loans, making reservations at the national parks and paying taxes. Mr. Gore would expand those services, so that, for example, people could pay their taxes directly over the Internet without having to go through a software intermediary.
Mr. Gore's plan, which aides said would cost $100 million but would quickly pay for itself by cutting paperwork and saving time, would be accomplished by 2003.

HEADLINE: Deprived Ukraine City Finds U.S. Help No Help

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: KHARKIV, Ukraine

 BODY:
There was a brief discussion among American diplomats very brief by all accounts -- about having President Clinton stop here during his visit to Ukraine, in this home of the American-sponsored Kharkiv Initiative.
But because people here are so unhappy with the initiative's results, his visit was limited to Kiev. 
 The initiative is a program to show off this city of heavy industries, power blackouts and high unemployment to American investors. This is being done as compensation for Ukraine's decision to give up multimillion-dollar contracts to help Russia build a nuclear power plant in Iran, which is proceeding anyway on Persian Gulf coast of Iran at Bushehr without Ukraine's participation.
In 1998, the Clinton administration persuaded the Ukrainian government to order Turboatom, a producer of giant steam turbines and one of this city's largest enterprises, to back out of the Iranian project. The move was regarded as a great success of American policy, and it was expected that it would seriously disrupt Russia's ability to complete the Iranian power station.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright traveled to Kiev in March 1998 and praised President Leonid Kuchma for "great statesmanship" in joining the struggle to "halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
But these days construction at the Bushehr power plant is well under way, and Russia's deputy minister for atomic energy, Bulat I. Nigmatulin, says it will be completed in 2002. Russia is expected to earn about $1 billion from the project.
Part of that will go to its largest turbine manufacturer, a St. Petersburg company, which has taken over Ukraine's contract to produce the turbine that will be delivered to Iran in September 2001, said Viktor S. Shevchenko, the factory's executive director.
In the end, the only party that was hurt by American intervention was Ukraine, which the United States has been trying to help become an economically independent nation.
"This was one of our biggest contracts, and losing it has been a very serious blow to the economy of our region," said Anatoly A. Bugaets, Turboatom's general director. "But of course we are law-abiding people, and when a decision is made at the highest level, we have to obey."
Here in Kharkiv, in retrospect, it is difficult to find anyone who thinks that it was a good thing for Turboatom to walk away from tens of millions of dollars in contracts with its industrial partners in Russia for the sake of a weapons-nonproliferation objective that -- here at least -- seems somewhat fuzzy.
The United States and Ukraine may have stood together, however unsuccessfully, to oppose the sale of civilian nuclear technology to Iran, but no one in Ukraine, and especially in this city, is taking a victory lap around the idle factories of Kharkiv.
Nearly a decade after independence, Ukraine's broken deal with Russia over the Iranian plant is emblematic of a lament often expressed here and in the capital, Kiev. It is that Ukraine's agenda for economic development in the post-Soviet era never seems to be as important as the strategic objectives of the United States and its Western allies.
Ukrainian officials point to a series of actions sought by the United States: closing Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident; destroying old missile silos, and putting up high-tech security barriers to keep nuclear physicists who are begging for work from sharing information with the wrong countries. The Ukrainian officials point out that the United States has achieved nearly all of its strategic objectives in this former Soviet republic -- eliminating nuclear weapons, making Ukraine an unofficial partner of NATO and, in the case of Turboatom, using Ukraine in an attempt to destabilize Russia's dealings with Iran.
Ukraine has been one of the leading recipients of American foreign aid in recent years, with about $200 million a year, much of which has gone to nuclear safety needs. But the nation remains mired in a kind of post-Soviet purgatory of economic and social lassitude as well as endemic corruption.
"A nation at risk" is how the Central Intelligence Agency described Ukraine in a mid-1990's report, warning that a seriously depressed economy, corruption and fiscal and monetary chaos were threatening its long-term survival.
Though there are signs that the Ukrainian economy is beginning a recovery after a decade of unceasing contraction, the Kharkiv Initiative, the payback for what Ukraine has sacrificed at Washington's insistence, has failed to generate a single contract for any industry in this city. Indeed, it has taken two years for the State Department to open an office here, which is now staffed by a single contract employee.
"Of course, we are disappointed," said the Kharkiv regional governor, Oleg Dyomin, who will travel as a guest of the State Department to New York, Cleveland and Chicago this summer in his continuing search for American corporations willing to invest in a country with serious corruption problems and an unstable electrical supply. Mr. Dyomin will bring color brochures of the Antonov jet transport produced here, of the Kharkiv tractor plant lineup, of the high-energy physics laboratories and of Turboatom, with its cavernous and nearly empty production lines.
"We haven't had any help yet," said Anatoly Myalitsa, general director of Kharkiv's aircraft plant. "We are not competitors. We only want a tiny piece of your market in the far north, where our aircraft is very capable of making short takeoffs in the snow. Why would America, a big country, not want to help small Ukraine?"
In an interview in May in Kiev, President Kuchma put on a pained expression when the subject of the Kharkiv Initiative came up. "I don't want to offer any comment on this," he said. "It hurts too much, and in fact, it is a strong point of criticism that I get from my opponents."
One Western businessman, who has observed Ukraine's painfully slow emergence as a state, tried to capture the mood here by saying, "Disillusionment is too strong a word, but disappointment may not be strong enough."
Any notion that Mr. Clinton might visit Kharkiv was overruled, Western diplomats say, by concerns that he might be jeered by unemployed workers from Turboatom, where the Iran contract was expected to provide 25 to 30 percent of the factory's total output over five years.
Ever since Russia signed a contract with Iran in 1995 to complete the Bushehr power station, abandoned by German constructors in 1979 with the onset of the Iranian revolution, the Clinton administration has opposed it and Congress has threatened sanctions against Russia. And for the last two years, Congress has reduced by half foreign aid payments to Russia's central government, specifically because of the refusal to abandon Bushehr.
United States intelligence agencies have long believed that Iran has a secret program to develop nuclear weapons, dating back even to the rule of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, which ended with the 1979 revolution. Just the idea that Iran wanted to generate electricity with nuclear power instead of using its abundant oil and gas resources was suspicious, and still is for many experts.
American officials do not regard the Bushehr project as a source of nuclear material that could be diverted to an illicit bomb-making program. But the administration has taken the view that the Bushehr project will train an entire generation of Iranian physicists and engineers in nuclear technologies, and thus enhance Iran's scientific base, including any program to develop nuclear weapons. Israel, whose leaders also see their security threatened by Iran's nuclear program, joined in the diplomatic offensive to kill the project, but to no avail.
Russian and Iranian officials point out that Iran has placed the Bushehr plant under the rigid safeguards and inspection regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
In the last five years, when Boris N. Yeltsin was president of Russia, Dr. Albright and Vice President Al Gore undertook a number of missions to try to persuade him to cancel the Bushehr contract. But Mr. Yeltsin would not relent, promising instead not to expand Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran beyond Bushehr, where as many as four reactor and turbine units are planned.
The project has suffered some setbacks. The original contract envisioned a four-and-a-half-year construction schedule. But Iranian construction companies were not able to repair the German foundation work -- bombed during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88 -- in accordance with Russian specifications. Under a revised contract, Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy has assumed overall management of the project.
"Bushehr is a very interesting and profitable contract for us," said Mr. Nigmatulin, the Russian atomic energy official. "And at the same time it is helping us to restore our industrial capacity."
Having failed to persuade Russia to pull out of Bushehr, Mr. Clinton's senior national security advisers in late 1997 began a campaign to force Ukraine out of the deal. Ukraine's ambassador to Washington at the time, Yuri Shcherbak, was told that the administration would prevent Ukraine from purchasing fuel for its aging nuclear reactors from American companies unless Turboatom gave up the Iran project.
There were carrots as well sticks, the Kharkiv Initiative among the carrots, along with promises of Ukrainian participation in space exploration.
But Turboatom's departure has brought little cheer to Ukraine's industries, which still have connections with Russia's industrial structure. And as a consequence of Turboatom's withdrawal, it seems less likely that Ukraine will be invited to take part in Russian projects to build nuclear power stations in China and India.
"Kharkiv lost a very good order, and that is a shame," said Mr. Nigmatulin, the Russian official. "An order like this represents the revival of the turbine business."
But not for Ukraine.

A picture caption yesterday about a wreath-laying ceremony in Kiev, Ukraine, where President Clinton honored people who died in a famine in 1932 and 1933, understated the number of victims. Western scholars put it at five million to eight million, not thousands.

HEADLINE: $3.5 Billion Africa Pipeline Expected to Pass

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
With American support, the World Bank is expected to approve on Tuesday a $3.5 billion project to develop an oil pipeline in Chad and Cameroon in West Africa, despite widespread concerns about the potential for corruption and environmental damage.
The Clinton administration will vote in favor of World Bank sponsorship after specifying an unusually detailed list of safeguards that officials hope will earmark the oil revenues for development projects and ward off abuse, a senior American official said today. 
 Although the project does not have united European support, the United States, as the major shareholder in World Bank, is confident that there will be enough votes for a loan to pass, the official said. Exxon Mobil is the lead company that is seeking the loan. The World Bank is generally expected to contribute $90 million to $200 million.
The proposed 663-mile pipeline, which would link oil fields in landlocked Chad to the Atlantic Coast of Cameroon, has stirred an outcry among environmentalists and antipoverty crusaders. They say the project will provide a boon to corrupt African officials, dislocate indigenous peoples and harm ecologically sensitive areas.
The senior American official said critics had "very legitimate concerns." But after more than two years working with the oil companies, officials and independent figures in both countries, he said, planners have come "a very long way" in addressing them.
"This is a project with substantial development potential," the official said. "I'm confident that it will be approved."
Environmental groups contend that the companies have failed to set aside adequate money to clean up an oil spill, allocating less than $1 million, despite Dutch researchers' citing a need for $28 million.
The pipeline, the critics add, will threaten the livelihoods of hundreds of Bagueli people, or pygmies, and endanger the habitats of endangered black rhinos, gorillas and chimpanzees.
"Any time you lay a pipeline, you're basically building a road for loggers and poachers," said Alejandro Queral, associate Washington representative of the Sierra Club.
Other critics say the World Bank will effectively be lining the pockets of a corrupt government in Chad that the State Department says brutally persecutes its enemies. Nearly every region of Chad, a nation two and a half times the size of France, has erupted in ethnically based unrest.
Providing oil revenues to the central government is "like adding more fuel to the fire," asserted Korrina Horta, a senior economist at Environmental Defense in Washington.
"It's a very dangerous situation," Ms. Horta added.
Exxon Mobil has insisted on World Bank participation as a hedge against instability, Ms. Horta said. She referred to the bank's role, which represents less than 10 percent of the project, as "political risk insurance" for investors.
"You make the World Bank a shareholder in the project, and no government is ever going to nationalize it," Ms. Horta said.
In addition, the support clears the way for Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Petronas to seek additional financing before investing $3 billion of their own, she said, adding, "It's the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval."
In tandem with its support for the loan, the administration has insisted on a framework to be monitored by the World Bank that would reduce the risk of corruption or mismanagement. That structure would include an escrow account for oil revenues that would set aside most of the income for health, education and development and allow for monitoring by nongovernmental groups in Chad.
The American-backed strictures also require that money be set aside to create national parks, compensate displaced people and respond to oil spills.
The pipeline would be one of the largest that involves direct foreign investment in Africa in decades, officials said. Experts expect it to generate $80 million to $100 million a year for Chad and $20 million in transfer fees for Cameroon.
American officials acknowledged that the project would be something of a test for the World Bank. Last week, the bank released a report in which it faulted itself and the International Monetary Fund for making Africa poorer through failed lending policies over 40 years.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the World Bank's consideration of an oil pipeline in Africa referred incorrectly to a recent report by the bank on African poverty. The study concluded that Africans were poorer than 40 years ago and that a share of the blame belonged to the bank and the International Monetary Fund. But the contention that the two organizations had made the continent poorer through failed lending policies came from recent Washington demonstrators, not from the study.

HEADLINE: UKRAINE CONSENTS TO SHUT CHERNOBYL BEFORE YEAR'S END

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO with MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, June 5

 BODY:
President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine used the occasion of a brief visit by President Clinton today to announce that the Chernobyl nuclear power station, site of the worst radiation accident in history, would be closed by Dec. 15.
Mr. Kuchma made the announcement after the two leaders met in the white-and-gilded splendor of the Mariinsky presidential palace. "This is a hopeful moment," Mr. Clinton said. "It is also a moment when we remember those who suffered as a result of the accident there." 
 For Mr. Clinton, the six-hour visit to Ukraine was the last stop on his last scheduled trip to Europe as president.
He began the day in Moscow with an address to both chambers of the Russian Parliament, in which he acknowledged that "Americans have to overcome the temptation to think that we have all the answers." He then urged the Russians not to reject Washington's proposal for a limited national missile defense and to make the changes needed to achieve full participation in global trade. Excerpts, Page A10.
In earlier conversations with President Vladimir V. Putin, Mr. Clinton failed to shake the Kremlin's staunch opposition to Washington's proposal for a new missile defense plan -- an opposition shared by China and much of Europe on the ground that it could spur a new arms race. The United States argues that it would construct defenses only against the chance of missiles being launched by "rogue states."
Ukraine has been under pressure from the United States and Europe to shut down the last working reactor at the Chernobyl plant, where a fire in 1986 spewed radiation over vast stretches of northeastern Europe and caused untold thousands of deaths and illnesses. Mr. Kuchma had previously said he was prepared to shut down the plant if major industrialized nations would contribute toward the $1.2 billion Ukraine needs to build two new nuclear power plants.
In his announcement today, Mr. Kuchma said Mr. Clinton had agreed to solicit the Group of Seven industrialized nations and Russia for help in shouldering the costs. Mr. Clinton also pledged $78 million in new American aid to help Ukraine repair and strengthen the concrete "sarcophagus" over the damaged reactor, $2 million to improve security at other Ukrainian nuclear plants, and an unspecified amount to assist the tens of thousands whose livelihood comes from Chernobyl.
"The aim of this decision is to reduce nuclear risks in the world," Mr. Kuchma said, adding that it "was not easy."
In addition to the Ukrainians who depend on the plant for jobs, Ukraine faces an energy crisis. The country also needs to spend an estimated $750 million to reconstruct and stabilize the hastily built concrete and steel structure that encases the shattered No. 4 reactor hall and the nearly 200 tons of radioactive fuel inside; the structure is riddled with leaks and threatening to crack open.
Besides his talks with Mr. Kuchma, Mr. Clinton went outdoors to address tens of thousands of people packed into St. Michael's Square.
"Today, the oppressors are gone," he said. "Stalin is gone. The Nazis are gone. But you, the people of Ukraine, you are still here, stronger than ever! You must build a free and prosperous Ukraine. Do not give up. Keep on fighting."
The purpose of the speech, administration officials said, was to give a strong show of support for Ukraine's independence, which came with the collapse of Communism nine years ago after three centuries of rule by Moscow, but has run up against severe economic hardship and rampant corruption. Ukraine is one of the largest recipients of American aid.
It was also a photo opportunity that Mr. Clinton seized to the fullest. He stood atop a dais and waved to the crowd against a backdrop of the gold-domed, Wedgwood-blue Monastery of St. Michael and a city square decked with huge Ukrainian and American flags.
Earlier in the day, concluding his two-day visit to Moscow, Mr. Clinton took a defensive line in the speech to Parliament. "Many Russians still suspect that America does not wish you well," he said. "The United States wants a strong Russia."
The reception, however, was muted. Some deputies skipped the session, partly because they were confused about when it was to start. For many of them, NATO's expansion, the alliance's war with Yugoslavia and the administration's plans to build a limited missile defense have created the impression here that Washington revels in its role as the world's only superpower and is determined to thwart the emergence of new powers, including Russia.
"Russia's future is very important to others because it is among the most important journeys the world will witness in my lifetime," Mr. Clinton declared from the lectern.
On security issues, he insisted that his administration's plan for a limited missile defense was not a drive for military superiority. On the economy, Mr. Clinton backed Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization, a bid that still requires Moscow to change some of its economic policies.
"Russia should not be the only major industrialized country standing outside this global trading system," he said. "We will support you, but you must know the decision to join the W.T.O. requires difficult choices that only you can make."
On the political front, he criticized the Russian prosecution of its war in Chechnya. "My question on Chechnya was an honest one, the question of a friend," he said. "And that is whether any war can be won that requires large numbers of civilian casualties and has no political component bringing about a solution."
More generally, Mr. Clinton insisted that he had not come to Moscow to preach to Russians, saying, "You will choose what your interests clearly demand and what your people democratically embrace."
The reviews after the speech were generally positive.
"It was a clever lecture," said Andrei Kokoshin, a legislator in the Fatherland - All Russia party and a national security adviser when Boris N. Yeltsin was president. "I think Clinton is still important."
"It was not a full hall," said Nikolai Kharitonov, the leader of an agrarian faction that generally supports President Putin. "But it was not a bad speech. Let's hope it is realized constructively."
Communists and nationalists in Parliament were predictably critical. Communists held up signs saying, "Clinton Go Home" and "Defense Missile System Is a Threat to the World." They chanted, "Soviet Union! Soviet Union!" over and over.
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who plays the part of an ardent nationalist but who is seen by many Russians as a kind of clown on the political fringe, created a row during Mr. Clinton's speech, screaming "Shame! Shame!"
"Who is he teaching how to live?" Mr. Zhirinovsky yelled. "It's profane! We are not going to do what America commands!"
After addressing Parliament, Mr. Clinton received the warmer welcome he was more accustomed to during his previous four trips here as president when he called on Mr. Yeltsin at his residence outside Moscow.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin had a sense of camaraderie that is clearly lacking in the president's businesslike meetings with Mr. Putin. And Mr. Clinton seemed to look back on the old meetings wistfully.
"We all just had a nice visit, just like old days," Mr. Clinton said. "He's got a beautiful place."

Valuable, Bush Aide Says
By The New York Times
WASHINGTON, June 5
 Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, said that the Clinton-Putin meeting had been valuable in advancing relations between the United States and Russia. Mr. Bush welcomed agreements on disposal of nuclear materials and establishment of a joint center to monitor missile launchings, he said.
More importantly, Mr. Fleischer said, the two leaders did not sign any binding pledges that would limit action by the next president.
"The governor is pleased the agreements they reached do not tie the hands of President Clinton's successor so that we can have a defense policy that reflects post-cold war thinking," Mr. Fleischer said.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on June 6 about Ukraine's announcement that it will close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by Dec. 15 referred incorrectly to the number of deaths and illnesses caused by the accident there in 1986. The Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report that 31 people died in the first weeks after the accident. Other estimates of deaths ultimately caused by the accident range from dozens to tens of thousands; estimates of illnesses range from hundreds to tens of thousands. It has not been established that the accident caused untold thousands of deaths and illnesses.

HEADLINE: What Conservatives, Liberals, Stores and States Share

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
WHILE e-commerce is remaking how business gets done, it is also remaking traditional alliances on tax policy, creating a deep rift within the Republican Party and building common ground between some antitax Republicans and some Democrats who have opposed the antitax agenda.
The unpredictability of the matter extends much further. Efforts to make the Internet a permanent tax-free zone obviously pose problems for off-line businesses. But the most direct impact might be felt by state and local governments, which now receive almost half their revenue from sales taxes. As more transactions move online, falling revenue would have to be made up either through higher taxes on property, income and off-line sales or through cuts in services. 
 In 1998, at the behest of e-commerce companies seeking a tax break, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which prohibited multiple and discriminatory taxes on the Internet and effectively prohibited sales taxes on e-commerce that crosses state lines until 2001.
Last month, the antitax Republicans in the House leadership pushed for a vote to extend the moratorium for five years, to 2006, even though the current moratorium had 18 months left and even though hearings on the extension were not scheduled until a week after the vote.
The House Republican leadership pushed through the vote in the face of solid opposition by a traditional Republican constituency, the nation's retailers, from mighty Wal-Mart to local federations of mom-and-pop stores. They all want a level playing field in which there would be no distinctions for sales tax purposes among bricks-and-mortar, clicks-and-mortar and pure cyberspace businesses.
The moratorium extension is very likely to face a much tougher time in the Senate as retailers step up their lobbying. President Clinton has not said whether he will sign the bill, but the administration's representatives on the Internet tax commission have opposed extending the moratorium.
The rush to extend the moratorium has brought together Representative Ernest J. Istook Jr. of Oklahoma, one of the most far-right Republicans in Congress, and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, one of the most far-left Democrats. They made similar arguments against the extension. As Steve Pfister, a senior vice president of the National Retail Federation, which represents merchants with more than 1.5 million stores, observed, "Internet tax issues are creating really strange bedfellows."
Both Mr. Istook and Mr. Conyers expressed concern that the moratorium would take power from state and local governments, which provide the bulk of government services, like police protection and education.
Mr. Istook wrote to his colleagues that his fellow antitax Republicans have lost sight of the 10th Amendment, which reserves to the states and the people those powers not expressly authorized or denied to the federal government.
THE argument that opposing an extension of the moratorium means favoring higher taxes, which was promoted by the House leadership, was called bunk by Mr. Istook.
"Washington politicians," he wrote, "are scrambling to show who can be 'friendliest' to the Internet community -- and win their political support -- even if it means turning a deaf ear to other business and ignoring common sense." He also asked whether extending the moratorium was "a federal power grab, a back-door approach to consolidating all power firmly and finally in Washington?"
He urged his colleagues to fight high levels of taxes, rather than give a break to one industry. "Tax justice is not achieved by promoting injustice; tax justice must be based on fairness," Mr. Istook wrote.
Mr. Conyers, while not agreeing that taxes are too high, said the state and local tax system was a mess and that by extending the moratorium to 2006, Congress would remove an incentive for the states to streamline sales taxes.
As much as Americans complain about the complexity of the income tax, the sales tax regimes of 45 states, plus the District of Columbia, are vastly more complex. A can of soda is untaxed as a grocery item in Ohio, for example, but is taxed as a convenience in New York.
The two congressmen, and many retailers, want to use the rise of e-commerce as a cudgel to force the states to simplify the sales tax, creating standard definitions of items and eliminating picayune rules.
Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, a Republican who has signed 31 tax cuts into law, is the political leader of those seeking a level playing field; he thinks the issue is both philosophical and economic.
"The issue is whether local government will be allowed to function independently of the national government and Congress," Governor Leavitt said, adding that blocking the states from applying sales taxes to e-commerce is the most significant issue of federalism since the Civil War.
Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and a leading Republican antitax strategist, sees the same federalism issues from a different perspective.
"The principle is no taxation without representation," Mr. Norquist said. "You cannot allow Alabama politicians to impose taxes on businesses in Maine and New Hampshire because there is no limit to the abuses that can follow. They can go kick your door in and levy sales taxes on things you bought over the Internet."
Governor Leavitt and his allies, however, take strong issue with this view because, they say, they have agreed that collecting sales taxes should not draw a company into other tax, regulatory and litigation issues.
One idea that Mr. Norquist finds palatable would be to tax all items at the point of sale. Under this theory, Washington State would collect taxes on every book sold by Amazon.com, based in Seattle, not just those bought by Washington residents.
Such a policy would encourage e-commerce companies to move to the five states that have no sales tax -- Alaska, Delaware, Oregon, Montana and New Hampshire -- and encourage the other states to reduce sales-tax rates, which Mr. Norquist favors.
Mr. Norquist added: "The cost of government should be radically falling with all the new technologies. That politicians don't reduce the cost of government is a criticism of the politicians."
Mayor Ron Kirk of Dallas, a leader in the level-playing-field camp, said he regarded these comments as nonsense. Computer technologies will reduce many government costs, but Mayor Kirk said: "The Internet can't replace a fire truck. Cities still have to buy pumpers and ladder trucks and hire firefighters and train them, and we have to have the means to pay for all that."
Mr. Kirk also fears that exempting the Internet from sales taxes will mean more power for Washington, the opposite of the devolution arguments put forth by antitax Republicans, who say that they favor state and local governments. "I don't think Grover and his people have thought this through," Mr. Kirk said.
But Mr. Norquist said that he and other antitax Republicans had indeed thought through the consequences of their position. Exempting e-commerce from sales taxes eliminates a potential source of revenue and furthers the underyling cause, Mr. Norquist said, adding, "We want less government."

HEADLINE: SHOPPING;
Creating Ways to Cut the Delivery Time From Mouse to House

BYLINE: By JONATHAN BURTON; Jonathan Burton covers technology and business from San Francisco.

 BODY:
THE ordering may be express, but the delivery often seems Pony Express. That is shaping up as a central issue in the highly competitive world of online shopping, and it is spawning creative solutions for getting the goods to customers more quickly.
 "I can order a book on my lunch break, but if I have to wait a week to get something, it becomes less valuable," said Stacey McCullough, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, in Cambridge, Mass., explaining the frustration that sends many potential online shoppers to the mall. 
 Delivery delays are often attributed to the parcel carrier, but mishaps frequently occur before an order leaves the warehouse. Not that this matters to the customer, who knows only that the order did not arrive on time.
 The cost for such delays can be high. In a recent Boston Consulting Group study 19 percent of online customers said the delivery of their orders either took longer than they expected or never occurred. As a result, many stopped shopping online, while others simply refused to do more business with the offending e-tailer.
Internet merchants hoping to build brand loyalty need to give customers much more than point-and-click ordering convenience, said George Shaheen, the chief executive of the online grocer Webvan, based in Foster City, Calif. "Everybody thought that ordering was the secret sauce," he said. "But if you're going to win over a large group to Internet shopping, you have to provide them a full shopping experience."
 Theresia Gouw Ranzetta, a partner at Accel Partners, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif., added: "We haven't figured out how to beam things, but that's sort of what people expect. The Internet has trained consumers that they should be able to access information anytime, anywhere."
 To cope with customers' expectations in this fiercely competitive climate, many online retailers are redoubling their efforts to assure shoppers that every step is covered, from mouse to house. While they aren't yet zapping books and videos via modem directly to your computer, they are devising ways to deliver goods faster, better and more cheaply.
 Same-day service is already becoming a fixture in large metropolitan areas. For example, Barnesandnoble.com guarantees same-day delivery in Manhattan by 7 p.m. for Internet orders placed by 11 a.m. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, electronic items and toys ordered by 2 p.m. from the aptly named Sameday.com will arrive by 8 p.m. Other couriers with catchy monikers like Kozmo.com, Urbanfetch.com and Pinkdot.com deliver videos, ice cream and other convenience items store-to-door within an hour in large cities.
 Many sites are also providing precise information about when an order will ship and when it will arrive. Amazon.com has a feature on its site called "Where's My Stuff?" that allows customers to follow their orders in transit. Information is a powerful tool, and a customer who feels in charge is frequently a satisfied one. A high degree of personal communication and care seems especially important to shoppers in the cyber world, where orders and service lack face-to-face interaction.
 Behind the scenes, many e-tailers are taking control of crucial inventory and warehouse functions, trying to avoid delays. Filling orders quickly -- using sophisticated technology to get a shipment out of the warehouse and on the road -- has become an imperative for astute Internet merchants.
 "You have to have fresh information and the ability to track that information and keep abreast of the order," said Dennis Spina, the chief executive of SubmitOrder .com in Dublin, Ohio. The company is an online order-fulfillment provider for e-tailers that monitors inventory, processes orders and handles shipping, delivery and customer service.
 Most online merchants contract these back-office operations to independent providers like SubmitOrder, whose clients include BlueLight.com, the nascent Web venture of Kmart, and the toy seller Zany Brainy. Shippers like Federal Express and United Parcel Service are also billing themselves as one-stop e-commerce solutions. "We know how to run a warehouse," said Harvey Rickles, the general manager of e-logistics for U.P.S. "We have inventory management systems and tracking systems already in place."
Still, many of the more popular Internet retailers, including Amazon, Webvan and eToys, handle their own logistics. Webvan, for example, raised $275 million in a private placement of stock last year to build new distribution and fulfillment centers and expand its fleet of delivery trucks. Webvan operates two giant warehouses in or near each of its metropolitan markets -- the San Francisco Bay Area and Atlanta, -- that are stocked with perishables, dry goods, household products, beauty items, clothing, books, portable electronics, music CD's, and even pet supplies. Employees select and pack the orders and load the merchandise onto the company's small, distinctive delivery trucks.
 Many Webvan vehicles use Global Positioning Systems to guide drivers, a high-technology technique that ensures delivery within a 30-minute window of the customer's choosing. By the end of the year, Webvan expects to do business in Chicago, Seattle, Baltimore and Bergen County, N.J. "You have to keep in mind what the consumer wants," Mr. Shaheen said.
 Amazon is trying to enhance its seven merchandise-distribution centers. The company, based in Seattle, has been criticized for building such capital-intensive structures, but Jeff Wilke, the general manager for operations, said that Amazon's size required massive internal controls on inventory and orders. "We could not deliver the same performance if we cobbled together some outsourced partners," he said.
 Amazon also intends to furnish same-day delivery for some top-selling products -- books, CD's and toys -- to customers through a partnership with Kozmo. (Last December, Amazon invested $60 million in Kozmo, which uses bicycle messengers in 10 cities to whisk movies, snacks and other easily carried items to urban dwellers.)
CITY couriers like Kozmo and Urbanfetch store products close to their customers, much as Amazon or Webvan does, but on a reduced scale.
 Urbanfetch, which offers one-hour delivery in New York and will do so soon in London, taps a network of sites that stock its electronics, beauty products, food, movies and CD's. And because couriers arrive at their destinations within minutes, customers do not need to juggle schedules or ask a neighbor for a favor.
 "The ability to schedule a delivery when you know you're going to be home becomes a real asset," said Ross Stevens, the chief executive of Urbanfetch, which is based in New York.
 Same-day delivery, or same hour? That choice will depend increasingly on the customer. And anyone who thinks that only city folk will relish these perks, take heart: Urbanfetch also owns the Internet name Suburbanfetch.com.

Familiar Start-Up Story, With a Romantic Twist

BYLINE: By SALLY McGRANE; Sally McGrane is a technology writer living in San Francisco.

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
TORSTEN SCHMALE and Christian Wessel started Inubit, their Berlin-based business-to-business software and services company, in December after their respective girlfriends decided that they had had enough of listening to them complain about their jobs.
The women, who work together at another company, persuaded Dr. Schmale, who was bored with his job as a software developer for Siemens, and Mr. Wessel, who was sick of his job as a consultant with Roland Berger & Partners, a management consulting firm, to meet. They did, and quickly hit upon an idea for a technology platform that would enable business-to-business marketplaces. In doing so, they joined a wave of business-to-business start-ups in Germany. (After the business idea was hatched, the couples got married.) 
 The beginnings of Germany's Internet start-up revolution can be traced to June 1999, when eBay purchased Alando.de, a German online auction company, for $43 million. Since then, the start-up scene has accelerated, causing investor interest to shift from businesses selling to consumers to those servicing other businesses. The emerging business-to-business climate is healthy and likely to continue growing. Indeed, Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., predicts that by 2004, Germany will lead Europe with 26 percent of all e-commerce activity, followed by Britain, with 18 percent.
The business-to-business landscape in Germany, however, will look different from its early-stage counterpart in the United States. A crucial difference is that in Germany, corporate players are recognizing the importance of the business-to-business market almost in tandem with start-ups. DaimlerChrysler, Bayer, Volkswagen and Siemens are creating e-commerce marketplaces to procure goods or have plans to do so, and both SAP and Intershop Communications are also interested in expanding into such commerce.
"Big companies were faster in realizing the potential of business-to-business e-commerce in Germany than in the U.S.," said Reinhard Edelmann, an investment manager with Technologieholding, a Berlin venture-capital firm. One result, said Thorsten Wichmann, the chief executive of Berlecon Research, a research and analysis firm also in Berlin, is that "niche markets are where start-ups are coming in."
Inubit is focusing on European niche markets, along with other start-ups, including Newtron.de, Surplex.de and Portum.de. (The "de" stands for Deutschland.) Inubit has built a business-to-business technology platform and is planning to join with established companies to create industry-specific marketplaces. So far, Inubit has one partner, the Floramedia Group, a horticulture company with a pan-European presence.
Even if big companies are quicker on the draw in Germany, enough business-to-business start-ups have taken root in the last six months to spawn more than 100 online marketplaces, according to Berlecon's research.
Inubit, as is typical for a German business-to-business company, is fashioning itself as a European company -- one that needs to adapt to multiple countries, cultures and languages from the get-go. "We're looking at the European market, which is like the worldwide market -- from an organizational perspective, it's the same," Mr. Wessel explained. "If you're a B-to-B start-up in Germany, it doesn't make sense to stay in the German market. We programmed our technology so that if someone comes in and says he's from Spain, he gets Spanish content."
This approach, according to Mr. Edelmann, of Technologieholding, is what distinguishes European e-commerce ventures from American ones. "We're used to dealing with other cultures," he said, "and Americans are not." Many American companies add multiple language abilities to their technology only after they stake a claim in the United States market, Mr. Edelmann said, rather than integrating them from the start.
Multiple languages are just the beginning. "The European market is not homogenous like the U.S. market," said Patrick Sheehan, the managing director for the United States division of 3i Group, a venture capital firm in London. "There are quite different market conditions in each country."
European companies have to take into account the different business processes, tax systems, cultures, market structures, labor laws and governments from country to country. "To address your market you have to have a whole different set of business approaches," Mr. Wessel said. Even the level of technological adoption -- which varies widely from southern to northern Europe -- is an issue: a European technology company must have different strategies for, say, wired Sweden and analog Spain.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TO BUSINESS;
Assessing the Online Exchanges: From One Expert, a Mixed Grade

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
THE bull market has not just been on the stock exchange but in exchanges themselves. The frenzy to find business-to-business uses of the Internet is prompting people to create online exchanges where companies will be able to trade everything from sheet steel to hotel sheets.
To Eric K. Clemons, a professor in the Information Strategy, Systems and Economics group at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, this boom is reminiscent of the late 1980's, when a whole crop of online exchanges started to compete with the existing face-to-face stock exchanges and futures markets. Mr. Clemons has studied why as many of these markets failed as succeeded, and he has consulted for many of them, too. 
 Now he's turning his attention to the new industrial markets and says that many of them are doomed to repeat the mistakes of their financial predecessors.
He discussed the lessons from the financial markets in a series of e-mail messages last month.
 
Q. Electronic trading exchanges first began opening in financial markets 15 years ago, amid great skepticism by traditional traders that they would work. Remind us, what happened?
 
A. Many markets moved partially to electronic form faster than people had expected. Back in September of 1986, just before London's Big Bang the deregulation of its financial markets , you will remember, many of the large houses expected the floor to continue to hold a dominant share of equities trading. Five minutes into the first day's trading, the floor was empty.
London still uses intermediaries -- market makers who buy from every seller and sell to every buyer. Like most markets, London has been unwilling to take the next step, in which computers match buyers and sellers directly.
On the other hand, stock and futures markets in France and Germany have moved more completely to fully electronic systems without intermediaries and have been enormously successful.
In the United States, the New York Stock Exchange has continued to rely on an active face-to-face trading floor. And Globex and other electronic futures exchanges have had very little impact.
 
Q. So why did some electronic exchanges work and others not?
 
A. I guess the biggest difference between success and failure continues to be liquidity. When there are enough buyers and sellers to determine an effective price, then online trading can occur. If buyers and sellers are widely separated in time, and if there is little information on "comparables" to help buyers or sellers determine fair prices, then intermediaries will continue to serve an essential function. Thus, I would not expect to see real estate agents disappear anytime soon.
Similarly, exchanges didn't help instruments that no one understands, or no one wants to trade, such as contracts tied to hurricanes in Florida or the cost of cellular air time in August in Midtown Manhattan or other forms of catastrophic risk.
 
Q. But online exchanges also failed in the United States in some very liquid markets like futures.
 
A. It's hard to get market participants to leave a structure that's liquid and working well, even if it is not working perfectly. Thus, online trading has captured markets abroad where there had been no previous exchange or where the existing stock market had been less efficient and more expensive than its U.S. equivalents. Online trading in the U.S. continues principally to provide lower-cost access to existing exchanges, rather than replacing these existing exchanges, in general because they have been doing such a good job.
 
Q. So what sort of industrial markets will be most suited to online exchanges?
 
A. The invisible hand of the marketplace does the best job when buyers and sellers are fragmented and thousands of small orders interact simultaneously. This is true whether I want to buy 1,000 shares of I.B.M. at the current price on a stock exchange or if I want to buy 1,000 standard memory chips in one of the emerging industrial exchanges. The guiding principle here is that the random flow of small orders is sufficient to assure that the market finds the right price.
 
Q. What's an example of an industry that meets the test to find the right price?
 
A. Game fish, like sashimi-grade toro or hamachi. They are not farmed, and production cannot be fully predicted or matched to current demand. Likewise it cannot be stored for long. An exchange that found regional market clearing prices, let buyers throughout Asia bid on fish available in Tokyo or allowed buyers throughout the East Coast to bid on the regional catch would allow supply and demand to determine a market clearing price. Sellers would get a better price, through aggregation of demand. Buyers would have access to greater supply, again through aggregation. There would be less waste.
 
Q. So what about the proposed exchanges in industries like auto parts, where there are a handful of buyers and not all that many sellers of each type of item?
 
A. If the order flow is heavily concentrated in a small number of buyers or a small number of sellers, or if delivery must be carefully coordinated and scheduled between buyer and seller, then an exchange is likely to be less effective.
If I need several million fuel injectors or pistons, an exchange-based market will not be my best alternative. If my pistons arrive too late, my production line will shut down. In business environments such as these, I will want to carefully negotiate order quantities and delivery schedules, quality levels and purchase prices.
 
Q. Even in those industries, proponents say, online exchanges are a great way to unload excess inventory.
 
A. I'm not so sure excess inventory is still such a great idea. I recently studied exchanges in the glass industry. Excess production is indeed sold through exchanges, but at prices only slightly better than the pre-exchange mechanism for liquidating overproduction, which was to grind glass down and remelt and reuse it.
But the new exchange causes a secondary problem: it floods the market with cheap glass, and thus depresses the prices of primary production runs.
Selling overproduction through an exchange is seldom as cost-effective as properly planning production.
 
Q. A lot of people say the real value of the exchanges in the long run won't be the lower transaction costs or even the lower prices, but the efficiencies throughout the production stream that would flow from the instant -- universal, transparent demand information being shared. I take it you don't completely agree.
 
A. That's right. For some industries full transparency will indeed produce allocative efficiency -- by setting the right prices, based on aggregating supply and demand, the product will end up in the hands of the customers who value it most highly. In industries with rapidly evolving products -- personal computers -- this might indeed be a new and optimal design.
In these cases the key issue is not determining the right price, but scheduling delivery of the right quantity at the right time. Ford or G.M. might be more concerned with assuring that spark plugs and fuel injectors arrive in the right-sized batches at precisely the right times to avoid disrupting their assembly lines; getting the right quantity of products at the right time is closer to traditional supply-chain optimization than it is to the design of trading mechanisms.
 
Q. Some people argue that one benefit of these new exchanges is that they open up world markets, allowing a small steel maker in Thailand to find a buyer in Peru. Does that make sense?
 
A. Globalization of markets and exchanges, likewise, will be important only if buyers and sellers have a real need for global access. But when they do, geographical separation appears to be no longer relevant as a barrier to trading, as long as the item's description is clear enough to be described online without too much ambiguity, and its value is sufficient to justify shipping costs. I will admit that the online trading of Beanie Babies through eBay caught me pretty much by surprise.
 
Q. Will we see these industrial exchanges come to resemble the futures pits in Chicago where investors could hedge piston prices or speculate in spark plugs?
 
A. Actually, I am quite convinced that they will. You will see forwards, for physical delivery, tradeable commodity-style physical-settlement futures contracts to lock in supply, and cash-settlement contracts to lock in a price. You will see speculators, regulators and all the infrastructure you currently see in futures markets.

High-Tech Boom Near Santa's House

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: OULU, Finland

 BODY:
SITUATED on the jagged coast of Finland nearly 400 miles north of Helsinki, this remote city must rank as one of the world's most improbable technology boomtowns.
There is no daylight from December through mid-February. Parking lots provide electric warmers to keep car engines from freezing. 
 Except for forests and lakes, there isn't much within 100 miles of Oulu. The most notable town to the north is Rovaniemi, which has built its economy on the assertion that it is the true home of Santa Claus. "It is easy to come to Oulu," wrote Ilpo Okkonen, the author of a picture book about the city. "All you have to do is set out from somewhere else."
Yet as unlikely as it may seem, this town of 100,000 people is home to hundreds of electronics companies. Driven in part by Nokia, the Helsinki company that is the world's biggest manufacturer of mobile telephones, Oulu thrives as a center for research on wireless data communications.
Nokia employs nearly 5,000 people here, most of them working on third-generation mobile services that offer high-speed electronic commerce and even full-color video communications.
But the city has also become a hotbed for start-ups. There are companies here that make wireless networks for underground mines; wireless tickets for buses and ski lifts; wireless automation systems for factories; and wireless encryption systems to protect data sent over the airwaves.
No one is quite sure how all this "mobile commerce" will develop, but the phenomenal success of ordinary mobile phones has attracted a flood of venture capital. Finnair now makes 15 daily round-trip flights between Oulu and Helsinki, and most are packed with business travelers.
The city's half-dozen hotels are routinely booked solid, but rarely with tourists. A handful of American technology companies, like Tellabs and Mentor Graphics, have offices here as well.
"Right now, all of us venture funds are loaded with money," said Juha Mikkola, a partner in Eqvitec Partners, a venture capital firm in Helsinki that has invested in several Oulu companies. "All we need is more good entrepreneurs."
Until about 10 years ago, Oulu was best known as a former trading center for black tar. Those days are long gone: the demand for tar, used in waterproofing, collapsed with the demise of big wooden ships in the 19th century. (Local shops still honor the heritage by selling tar liquor and tar candy, which taste about as good as they sound.)
Much of the city's rebirth stems from its large pool of skilled technical people. The University of Oulu, financed mainly by the Finnish government, draws 13,000 students and has programs in electronics, engineering and information technology. Most of the students come from northern Finland, and about two-thirds stay in the area.
The government also set up the Technical Research Center, which now employs about 2,900 researchers who work on advanced wireless technologies and optical electronics. About half of the center's revenue comes from work for private companies.
In the early 1970's, long before the boom in cellular telephones, Nokia set up a small branch here. Then Nokia was a conglomerate that dabbled in a variety of electronics as it searched for new opportunities. Researchers in Oulu provided some of the company's early work in wireless military equipment for the Finnish government, which gave it a base for jumping into mobile telephones in the late 80's.
Oulu's abundant technical talent has also made it a haven for local entrepreneurs. One was Lauri Kuokkanen, who was posted here by Nokia and then quit in 1976 to start LK Products, a company that made radio-frequency filters.
A self-described "serial entrepreneur," Mr. Kuokkanen went on to start at least three other companies, including a company called Solitra. The man he recruited to run Solitra, Juha Sipila, recently sold it to an American company called ADC, reaping tens of millions of dollars. Today, he is an investor in at least 15 other local start-ups.
"People ask how Oulu suddenly became such a big success," said Mr. Kuokkanen, who is 68. "We just did our daily work and it gradually grew bigger and bigger. It's been happening for the last 25 years."
Much of that work happens at Technopolis, an industrial park that is home to about 130 companies. Researchers and ideas shuttle between business and academia, much as Stanford University fueled the growth of Silicon Valley.
"There is quite a strong internal network of people there who all studied in the same area about 20 years ago," said Vesa Sadeharju, a partner at SFK Finance, a venture capital firm in Helsinki that has invested in about 10 Oulu start-ups. Last month SFK was bought for an undisclosed amount by one of Europe's biggest venture capital firms, 3i Group, which is based in London.
Companies based at Technopolis employ more than 10,000 people, but thousands more work off campus at companies like Sonera, Finland's biggest telephone company, and Polar Electro Oy, which makes electronic heart-measurement products.
MANY are start-ups that rent as little as a single room but obtain access to high-speed phone lines, administrative services and expertise at the university and the Technical Research Center. CCC Oy, for example, a small company started in 1985, developed software under contract for Nokia and then developed its own products. Today, it has about $20 million a year in sales.
Researchers are digging into more exotic areas as well. At the Wireless Internet Laboratory, part of the Technical Research Center, Petri Mahonen is experimenting with virtual-reality glasses that would allow mobile-phone users to browse the Internet in color.
His team has also installed miniature wireless-computer servers into devices like coffeepots and toy race cars. "The main idea is not that people want to run their coffeepots over the Internet," Mr. Mahonen said. "The point here is to think about using the Internet for unusual new purposes and to see how small and how cheap you can produce a wireless Internet server. It turns out they can be quite small and cheap."
Compared with Silicon Valley, Oulu remains a rustic outpost. There are few shopping malls or movie complexes, and the streets are filled with creaky old cars. The city's main attraction is bicycle paths and footbridges, which crisscross the waterways and lakes.
When spring arrives in mid-May, nights gradually disappear into a two-month-long stretch of daylight, and the region becomes a haven for outdoor sports and recreation. One evening early last month, in-line skaters and bicyclists stayed out until 11 while salmon fishermen drifted in the golden rays of the late-night sun. By July, people are playing midnight golf and tennis.
"The other day, I left work at 3 p.m. and drove about 150 kilometers to go fishing," Pertti Huuskanen, the president of Technopolis, said last month.
"I fished for several hours and I used my mobile telephone to read and answer my e-mail," he said. "I got back by about 11:30, before it was completely dark."

HEADLINE: Ratings That Know What You're Looking at, and When

BYLINE: By HILARY APPELMAN; Hilary Appelman is a freelance writer living in Clinton, N.Y.

 BODY:
TELEVISION has its Nielsens. Radio has its Arbitrons. Now the audience ratings business has moved to the Internet. This time, it just about knows when you are in the bathroom.
Billions of dollars in advertising are spent each year on the basis of audience ratings that profess to tell what Americans are watching and when. Yet advertisers have no way of knowing if you are glued to the TV, or if you head for the kitchen every time there is a commercial. 
 Things are different on the Internet.
The computer's ability to track a user's every online move makes it possible to collect far more information about Internet users than has been the case with traditional media audiences. Internet ratings companies can track every link followed by their thousands of volunteer panelists as they surf the Web, recording how long they spend at a given site, when they stop interacting with the computer, even for a moment, and whether they click on banner ads.
"It's not simply that a person is at the other end," said Chris Charron, the director of media and entertainment at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "It's 'Is that person engaged? Are they responding to content? Are they responding to advertising?' All of those things are becoming much more important to measure."
Although the bottom line of audience ratings is commerce, the abundance of data, or metrics, as the audience-tracking numbers are known, should in theory translate into Web sites better tailored to users' interests and needs and even better suited to the capacities of users' computers. It should, again in theory, mean research less crude than divining that Americans like to watch women fight to marry rich strangers. That is, if the numbers are accurate, which remains to be seen.
The battle to become the household name in Internet ratings is being fought by four-year-old Media Metrix Inc. and Nielsen/Net Ratings, a joint venture of Nielsen Media Research, the television-ratings giant, and Net Ratings Inc. of Milpitas, Calif.
Media Metrix and Nielsen/Net Ratings each have about 50,000 American panelists and are rapidly expanding overseas. The panels, made up of randomly selected volunteers, are 10 times the size of the Nielsen television panel; they have to be bigger because the numbers are spread across thousands of Web sites in a constantly changing online universe.
Other players in the market include PC Data of Reston, Va.; the French company NetValue, which entered the United States market in April; and online advertising and marketing networks like DoubleClick and MatchLogic.
Privacy concerns raised by companies like DoubleClick, which collects data without the user's knowing, are not an issue for Media Metrix or Nielsen/Net Ratings, whose panel members have agreed to have their Internet use monitored. Panelists receive small cash incentives -- $25 every six months -- or coffee mugs and beach towels.
Unlike Nielsen television ratings, which rely partly on weekly diaries and are subject to the vagaries of memory and wishful thinking, Internet ratings data is collected by software that tracks panelists' computer activity and automatically sends the collected information.
"We're blessed on the Internet because there's no survey component," said Tim Meadows, a senior vice president for marketing at Net Ratings. "Everything that we track is what actually happens, not what people want to tell you happens."
The numbers are being used not only by advertisers but also by investment companies and venture capitalists to evaluate Web companies' stock prices and potential investment values, in lieu of traditional measures like earnings and profits.
"Online companies use the data to track the competition and appraise potential acquisitions," said Doug McFarland, a senior vice president and general manager at Media Metrix. "It's a combination of media and market research. There are billion-dollar decisions being made with this data."
Despite the high stakes, the ratings numbers have little outside verification.
Bruce MacEvoy, the director of advertising research at the portal site Yahoo.com, said the ratings companies needed to be able to validate their projections by matching them against actual user counts kept by the Web sites.
"It's an evolving art," he said. "We're building an industry here; we're not flying on something that's been around 20 years."
Many large clients are subscribing to more than one ratings service, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, as they wait to see which becomes the industry standard.
The ratings, while similar, do not always match. In March, for example, both companies reported Yahoo.com as the top-visited Web site. Nielsen/Net Ratings said about 39.2 million home-computer users came to the site, while Media Metrix put the number at 40.5 million. The next most popular site, according to Media Metrix, was MSN.com, with 32 million visitors, while Nielsen/Net Ratings said it was AOL.com, with 35.3 million visitors.
The companies are highly critical of each other's panel- and data-selection methods, which they cite for the differences.
Still more vexing are the sometimes large discrepancies between the rating companies' numbers and the logs kept by Web sites. "Because the Internet is so measurable, there's a high expectation on numbers and measurability, but also a lot of different ways to measure simple things," said Mr. Meadows, of Net Ratings.
Both Media Metrix and Net Ratings are working with Internet sites to try to reconcile any discrepancies.
Shane Ankeney, the director of media strategy at the Los Angeles advertising agency TBWA/Chiat/Day, said that advertisers used the panel-based ratings more for strategy and planning and less for actual advertisement pricing.
Pricing itself is based on the number of times an advertisement is seen, which is counted by the site or the advertising network that displays it, Mr. Ankeney said.
"On television, I can't tell you how many people were watching 'E.R.' when my Apple commercial ran," he said. "Nielsen will tell you on average how many people are watching that show, and anyone watching the show at that time probably saw my ad as well." But referring to online exposure, Mr. Ankeney noted: "I don't care about Yahoo over all. I want to know how many people saw my ad."
THE panel-based information is invaluable to advertisers who want to identify which sites can help them reach certain segments of the population, said Mr. MacEvoy of Yahoo. In addition, the ratings provide a consistent measurement standard, making comparisons possible. A Web retailer deciding where to advertise might look at ratings data on sites that were popular with the retailer's own visitors, Mr. Ankeney said. Or the retailer might look for sites frequented by people who matched its demographics but who had not visited the site.
The ability to measure actual responses to online advertisements is changing the Internet business model, said Mr. Charron of Forrester Research.
Sites will no longer attract advertisers simply by pulling in high traffic numbers; they will have to prove that those visitors are looking at the advertisements and acting, he said.
Fifteen percent of Internet advertising is priced on performance criteria already, and Forrester estimated that 50 percent would be by 2004, Mr. Charron noted.
"Advertisers are starting to demand that they pay for advertising on the basis of action," he said. That could spell trouble for some popular sites -- like gaming, news and chat sites -- whose users are less likely to interact with advertising.
"The Internet shows us that reach and frequency, in and of themselves, do not indicate value," Mr. Charron said.
"The media ratings services will have to become much more advertising- and commerce-focused, not just simply traffic-focused," he added.
But Mr. McFarland said that perspective provided a limited view of the advertising and the audience-ratings business.
"It's about more than data," he said, "it's about understanding consumer behavior."

Taking a Warlord's Advice to Shake Up the Marketplace

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOYKO

 BODY:
MORE than 400 years ago, a warlord named Nobunaga Oda revolutionized the Japanese marketplace by taking control of the powerful trade associations and throwing it open to all would-be merchants for a nominal flat fee.
The rules of the open market were so radical and so popular that central Japan, Oda's stronghold, became the dominant center of commerce in Japan for a while, and the name of his revolutionary policy, "rakuichi to rakuza," which means "free markets and free guilds," still resonates with Japanese. 
 Hiroshi Mikitani certainly had Oda-San in mind when he named Rakuten, now Japan's largest e-commerce site. Operating an online bazaar under virtually the same principles that underpinned Oda's marketplace, www.rakuten.co.jp draws about 95 million hits a month as a gateway to about 2,800 merchants around the country selling everything from eggs to kimonos.
"I want Rakuten to be the best place to sell anything," said Mr. Mikitani, who founded the site three years ago. "The marketplace is what we focus on, the exchange between buyers and sellers, while most others focus on being a shop or a collection of shops."
Merchants pay 50,000 yen a month, or about $469, to link their Web sites to Rakuten. In exchange, they receive tips on jazzing up those sites and access to Rakuten's database and software, which contain information about customers and their predilections. Rakuten also offers them low-cost advertising. "We are basically a bricks-and-mortar business because all of our stores are real bricks-and-mortar stores," Mr. Mikitani said, although most of Rakuten's customers never set foot in those shops.
Many of the vendors on Rakuten are established companies looking to pare stale inventory without undercutting sales of their merchandise that is sold at full price. They can put their old inventory online at bargain-basement prices without much risk that the news will reach customers who frequent their stores.
Other Rakuten vendors are merely trying to overcome Japan's notoriously layered distribution system, or to sell their customers the freshest fish and produce.
Rakuten has also created a sense of community among its users, who chat online about the virtues and transgressions of Rakuten vendors and can participate in online auctions. The site's Rakuten's Free Market, a sort of mini-eBay, where sellers list items for sale for a fee of 100 yen, or 94 cents, plus 5 percent of the eventual sale price, is often a lively window onto customer preferences.
The communities that Rakuten creates are important in Japan, where the Internet has taken off largely as a means of social interaction. "E-commerce here has a much greater social component than in the United States," said Jiro Kokuryo, a professor who specializes in the study of information technology and systems at Keio University's business school in Yokohama.
But it is Rakuten's business model that has made it a darling of investors in the six weeks since it went public, smack in the middle of a sharp decline in global demand for Internet-related investments. The stock trades on Jasdaq, Japan's over-the-counter market. The decline for Internet stocks was as sharp here as it was in the United States when Rakuten went public; Japanese markets reflect movements in the American markets.
For one thing, Rakuten has been profitable, earning $1 million on sales of $5.6 million last year. That's an impressive 17.8 percent profit margin, largely unheard of in e-commerce. Mr. Mikitani had the advantage of studying the business models of Amazon.com and eBay, and quickly decided that Rakuten would be much better off as a hybrid, leaning more toward the eBay model than toward Amazon.com.
Not that he is unimpressed with Amazon .com. He just wants to avoid the costs and liabilities of inventory and distribution. And Rakuten has never advertised. "We're not really a retail company," Mr. Mikitani said. "We sell retailers the use of our servers, and there's a big difference." (In addition to the monthly membership fees, which provide 80 percent of Rakuten's revenue, 10 percent of the revenue comes from advertising and the rest comes from auction.)
Mr. Mikitani has limited Rakuten's risk by assuming the least liability possible for the business conducted on the site, but he pays attention to customer service. Shops are carefully monitored, and a few have been asked to leave Rakuten for business practices that were considered shady.
Mr. Mikitani contends that Japan will be a better market for e-commerce than the United States, mostly because of the medium's ability to spark a consumer revolution in a country known for its high prices. In short, the Internet allows merchants to circumvent the many layers of middlemen who clog this country's distribution system, adding costs every time merchandise changes hands.
For example, if you buy an obi, the sash worn with a kimono, at the retailer Kyoto Kimono Ichiba, it will cost 138,000 yen, or about $1,300. Buy it from Kyoto Kimono's shop on Rakuten, and it costs 13,800 yen, or an affordable $130.
Or think of it this way, which is Mr. Mikitani's favorite illustration of the power of the Internet here: Buy a share of Rakuten through a traditional Japanese stockbroker, and pay commissions equal to 3 percent of the share's value, which is about 1,065,000 yen at current prices, or $10,000. Buy it online from Monex, a securities broker here, and pay a $10 commission.
"In the U.S., you use Schwab's online brokerage and you get a price break for sure," Mr. Mikitani said. "But it's not anything like the savings you get in Japan."
As a result, Mr. Mikitani predicted, the Internet "is going to completely rebuild the Japanese economic system, much more so than in the United States."
He also thinks that Japan's more homogeneous population, with its flatter distribution of wealth and stronger sense of community than in the United States, provides the country with e-commerce advantages. "Japanese people like to communicate with each other, and it's much easier to do that on the Net," he said.
After graduating from Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, Mr. Mikitani became a banker at the Industrial Bank of Japan, one of the country's most blue-blooded financial institutions.
He took a break from banking to go to Harvard Business School, returning to the bank in 1993 with a master's of business administration and a newfound respect for entrepreneurship. "Before I went to business school, I thought my choices were to either work my way up Japanese style to become a director of the bank, or to go into investment banking at a Western firm and make a lot of money," Mr. Mikitani said.
But he opted for a third approach, striking out on his own to become a consultant, which led to his foray into e-commerce.
Mr. Mikitani toyed with selling educational services, financial advisory services and other things online but chose Rakuten "because it was scalable," which he defined as requiring lots of technology and relatively little human input. "I knew I could service 2,800 customers with Rakuten," he said. "Giving 2,800 people financial advice would have been impossible."
Rakuten has had no marketing costs so far, although it plans to use some of the $430 million it raised in its stock offering to do advertising. "We were lucky," Mr. Mikitani said. "We got famous fast. The first mover always has an advantage, and we were the first mover."
That is not to say that others are not moving fast. Curio City, another virtual mall that Mitsui & Company started about the same time that Rakuten opened, has said it plans to increase the number of stores affiliated with its site to 10,000 from the current 800 by the end of this year.
But out-Rakutening Rakuten is not easy. WomenJapan.com, which offers a forum in which Japanese women can seek out and exchange information and advice about careers, finance, health, entertainment and family issues, experimented with the online bazaar concept at Christmastime.
The site featured two shops, one selling pashmina wraps and other items, and the other selling wine. Neither vendor was an actual store, and WomenJapan.com found the logistics of distribution and inventory management cumbersome.
The result? "E-commerce in Japan is still a big question mark in my mind," said Grace Fromm, the chief marketing officer at WomenJapan.com. But WomenJapan .com has not given up on e-commerce. Rather, it took a page from Rakuten's book, signing up two vendors for Mother's Day -- Tower Records and Hibiya Kadan, a well-known Tokyo florist -- that could handle orders on their own.
Mr. Mikitani's success has made him something of a celebrity, and government officials and politicians seek his advice about e-commerce, although some people worry that the government is more interested in regulating the Internet than in encouraging it. It is worth remembering that free and unfettered markets have been the exception in Japan, not the rule. Nobunaga Oda, after all, committed ritual suicide under threat of assassination by a vassal turned enemy.
But Mr. Mikitani is not afraid. "What can they do? Shut down a server?" he asked. "All you have to do is move the server to the U.S., and you're back in business."

HEADLINE: The Web's User Profile Undergoes a Broad Transformation

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
FOR a long time, the image of the typical Internet user was a heterosexual white male younger than 40. Although this characterization was mostly true, the Web is now becoming a thriving marketplace for a wider range of people.
As the economic and political influence of Asian-Americans, Hispanics, African-Americans and gay men and lesbians increases, so does their presence on the Web. Technology is also allowing millions of people with disabilities to go online. Not surprisingly, a growing number of sites are serving these communities as they contour the Web to their own needs. 
 The Asian-American community is wired, with a full 69 percent of Asian-American households connected to the Internet. This is reflected in the many sites aimed at this community, including www.aonline.com, a site focusing on culture and lifestyle for Asian-Americans, produced by A Magazine. Another site, www.Click2Asia.com, links to shopping, business and travel in the United States, Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
For the Hispanic market, the site www.zonafinanciera.com provides banking, insurance, auto and real-estate services in English, Spanish and Portuguese in 21 countries. "Many Hispanics are looking for convenient ways to send money home, secure a loan for a family member in Latin America or buy stock or property there," said Greg Keough, a co-founder of the site.
The site www.starmedia.com is a huge portal that includes shopping in Spanish, travel services, news from the Americas, classified advertising and chat rooms.
African-Americans are the fastest-growing group online. "Blacks are always on the tail end of technology, and we need to get on the front end," said Harry Alford, the president and chief executive of the National Black Chamber of Commerce. Its site, www.nationalbcc.com, offers members discounts from major corporations and other benefits. Other sites, like www.blackplanet .com, will soon offer college databases, financial tools and technology classes, said Omar Wasow, the executive director.
For people with disabilities, the Internet offers perhaps the greatest promise. With www.wemedia.com, "for the first time, a homebound individual can visit the grocery store, stop at the bank and pick up a new shirt," said Mikki Lam, a senior vice president of WEmedia Inc. The site also offers health assistance and information about finances, education and sports.
For gay men and lesbians, two large portals, www.gay.com and www.planetout .com, offer chat; personal ads; shopping; information on living with H.I.V.; investment tools; news; and links to gay-owned companies. "Gay commerce takes a different angle online," said Megan Smith, Planetout's chief executive. "We're a large community with specific needs. It's a completely underserved market."

Banks Are Slow to Move Online, but So Are Their Customers

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
IN the early rounds of the online banking competition, the surprising outcome is that the big commercial banks have not been beaten to the punch by nimbler young challengers. 
 Unlike the brokerage titans of Wall Street that steadfastly refused to recognize the threat posed by Internet-based stock trading competitors, commercial banks have been wrestling with the Web for years. But the results of those efforts, many of which were primarily defensive, have ranged from modest success to spectacular failure.
It turns out that, unlike online stock trading, online banking has not, so far, been a killer app. Consumers have been just as slow as the banks to accept the Internet as a medium for managing everyday money matters.
Less than 10 percent of American consumers bank online. Last year, about 8.3 million people shopped the Internet for mortgages and other loans, but only one in eight even started the loan application process online, said Robert Sterling, an analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York.
The real challenge to established banks may just be arriving, in the form of companies that combine banking with other services online. Control of consumers' financial information is so critical to establishing bonds with them that it has attracted a host of competitors, including purely electronic banks, brokerage firms and software companies that operate Internet portals.
For example, E*Trade Group, the electronic brokerage firm, is making a big push for its E*Trade Bank, which was known as Telebank before E*Trade bought it earlier this year. E*Trade also bought a network of more than 8,800 automated teller machines to establish its first physical presence across the country. The company eventually hopes to link those A.T.M.'s with its Web sites so that customers can withdraw cash from bank or brokerage accounts.
Traditional banks take some comfort in E*Trade's moves because they reinforce the belief that Internet-only banks have limited appeal. When it comes to their savings, most people demand that there be some there there, as the saying goes.
"The advent of Net-only banks seems so exciting," said Bruce Zimmerman, a senior vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank. "The reality is, there aren't many customers who want to do everything only over the Net. That's why you've seen that Net-only models haven't been successful."
To build business quickly, most Internet banks have taken advantage of their slim cost structures by paying higher interest rates on checking accounts and certificates of deposit. E*Trade Bank started early this year with a one-year C.D. that yielded 7.27 percent on an investment of as little as $1,000, compared with 5.7 percent at Citibank in New York and 5.15 percent at Chase Manhattan Bank.
But, analysts say, paying above-market rates to attract deposits has never been a path to profits. Indeed, that tactic contributed to the failure of many savings and loans in the 1980's.
"The bad idea of the decade for online bank marketing is competitive C.D. rates online," Mr. Sterling said. The people most likely to shop for the best rates are retirees, and they are unlikely to shop online, he said.
Among Internet banks, the most visible disappointment has been WingspanBank .com, the electronic bank created by the Bank One Corporation. After spending about $35 million on advertising for Wingspan, Bank One put it up for sale.
Citigroup's Citibank has also struggled with its Internet strategy. Even with its latest electronic offering, called Citi f/i, Citibank, the nation's largest bank, trails Wells Fargo and Bank of America in the number of online accounts.
After the initial trials of the all-electronic bank model, Mr. Sterling said, "There's one verdict in, and it ain't the next E*Trade."
There are several reasons for the slower migration online for bank customers compared with investors, according to analysts and industry executives. One of the most important is that electronic discount brokerages opened up a simple, affordable route for millions of people to invest. Another is that investors were not accustomed to visiting brokerage offices with any regularity, while many bank customers still stop at their neighborhood branch at least once a week.
Electronic banks can offer better interest rates on deposits and loans because they have virtually no overhead compared with traditional banks. But banks' costly clusters of branches are still valuable assets, analysts say.
"The fact that a bank has a physical branch in the vicinity of a prospect is an enormous advantage and will remain an enormous advantage," Mr. Sterling said. "A local presence implies solidity, whereas anybody can set up a Web site."
BIG banks are following a trail that was blazed in the brokerage business by Charles Schwab: they are working toward making their services available online, over the phone and in person.
"We believe people will want a choice of how they access the bank," Mr. Zimmerman said. "And we believe customers will value a seamless financial relationship."
Things are not so smooth just yet. Traditional banks are ahead of the game if they have made all account information accessible to customers online, said Matt Cone, senior vice president of marketing for the Corillian Corporation, a provider of Internet banking software in Portland, Ore. "There are a number of financial institutions that still have yet to get to first base," Mr. Cone said. Many banks had put off their Internet ambitions until they had updated their computer systems for the Year 2000, he said.
Mr. Cone said that making account information available electronically was a step toward offering what customers really want: a single, online source of up-to-date information about their finances, including savings and checking accounts, credit cards, mutual funds and other investments.
On that score, banks are facing new challengers: upstarts that want to give people one place on the Web where they can check on accounts scattered among several companies, from savings at a bank to brokerage accounts to frequent-flier mileage.
Several companies, like Yodlee.com and X.com, are offering to gather account information from disparate sources and compile it for a quick survey. The technology that these companies use is known as "screen scraping" because it requires them to use customers' account numbers and passwords to collect confidential data posted by other companies.
Banks are hoping that most consumers will not trust any other company, especially new dot-com ventures, with access to such important personal information.
The buzzwords at Chase Manhattan these days are "real-time," "connected" and "personalized," Mr. Zimmerman said. Chase Manhattan is working toward immediate recognition of deposits, withdrawals and transfers between accounts, he said, because "one of the expectations of the Internet is that everything be real time. The Internet enables, and therefore the customer expects, everything to be connected." But like most banks, even E*Trade Bank, Chase Manhattan still uses batch processing every evening to process the daily transactions and update balances in customer accounts.
The faith that most consumers place in traditional banks is a powerful competitive advantage, Mr. Cone said. "The problem banks have had historically is that they rely on that and so they could take their sweet time to get there."

Ordering Brides on the Web: Old Business, New Source

BYLINE: By JULIE CHECKOWAY; Julie Checkoway is director of the Creative Writing Program at the University of Georgia.

 BODY:
MEN with fantasies and women with hopes have always managed to connect. Now, sites that draw on those dreams have exploded across the Web.
The fastest growth appears to be in sites that promote international marriages, Internet versions of the 19th-century mail-order-bride business. More than 200 such sites are in the United States, with earnings for some estimated as high as $2 million a year, although other operators cite a much lower figure. 
 According to a report by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the number of marriages between American men and foreign women they met through online matchmakers has doubled in the last decade, totaling 4,000 to 6,000 a year.
The international online matchmaking services are thriving largely because of increased Internet access worldwide, low overhead and start-up costs and an abundance of eligible foreign women: 100,000 to 150,000 advertise themselves on e-matchmaking sites each year.
In the mid-1970's, most mail-order brides came from the Philippines, whose economy was in shambles. Today, more than half of the 200 mail-order bride businesses online cater to men seeking mates from Russia and Ukraine, countries in steep economic decline and in which, not coincidentally, women make up more than 80 percent of those unemployed.
Which is why most such sites are heavy on postings like this one, from Nataliya, a 29-year-old divorced nonsmoker from Russia who reports (spelling and grammar intact): "I am tender, caressing dantist with unusual sense of humor. I have daughter with appearance and character of angel. . . . I am looking for man . . . not greedy, tender, not tedious."
Nataliya has been "viewed" 655 times since November on www.cherry-blossoms.com, the site operated by by Cherry Blossoms Inc., in Hawaii, which has been in the mail-order-bride business for 26 years. Cherry Blossoms used to rely solely on regular mail for the delivery of its expensively printed catalogs. Today, said Mike Krosky, the president of Cherry Blossoms, the company owes 50 percent of its business to the Internet, compared with 15 percent to 20 percent in 1997.
Choosing a mate from another culture is not unusual; the United States is home to millions of cross-cultural marriages. What is new are the numbers involved and the increasing sophistication of international e-matchmakers in their delivery of services. Many companies duplicate features found on other e-commerce sites, like electronic shopping carts. Critics of the services contend that this approach underscores the suggestion, always present in the bride business, that the woman is being bought -- a fantasy that they contend contributes to high rates of divorce or abuse after reality sets in.
Whatever lies at the heart of the transaction, the competitive advantages -- and the profits -- for site owners arise from their ability to provide clients with more than just a woman's address. The Cherry Blossoms site, for example, boasts a database of more than 16,000 women, which can be sorted by country of origin, education, age, eye color, race, height, weight, religion, number of children and whether she is a smoker or a drinker. A visitor types in his criteria, and head shots of women who fit that profile appear on the screen. Double-click on a head shot, and a client will see a full-body shot, a biography and vital statistics. But at Cherry Blossoms and other leading sites, the address database is merely a portal to a menu of services that are intended to extract money from a client at nearly every step he takes toward the altar.
Cherry Blossoms, like other established sites, begins charging a client when he requests an address. Starting at $75, Mr. Krosky's company offers a membership fee that provides a client with 15 addresses. At the high end is the "Premier Guaranteed Membership," which, at $595, includes 100 addresses; two "individualized searches" of the database, which Mr. Krosky conducts on the client's behalf; one-to-one coaching with Mr. Krosky -- himself married three times, most recently to a woman from the Philippines he met through his own business; and an online photograph and biography which, Mr. Krosky says, guarantees a client "60-plus letters" from women.
Other innovations include e-mail forwarding. A client can request that his photograph or a love letter be hand delivered in three to five days rather than in two to three weeks by international mail.
One of Mr. Krosky's competitors, Scanna International (www.scanna .com), adds a link to Flower and Gift International (www.smartlink.net /ais/flower). There, the delivery of roses, a box of chocolates and a card costs a customer at least $155 and can also include, at additional cost, a snapshot of the woman receiving her gift. Another rival, Euroladies (www.euroladies.com), offers three-way conference calling with an interpreter. Both Euroladies and Scanna offer the fiancee a visa preparation kit. At the top of the price scale are organized tours to Russia and Ukraine, offered by Euroladies and Scanna. Euroladies guarantees that men will meet more than 800 women in 10 days for $3,000 to $5,000, including hotel and airfare. Scanna offers a referral to Anastasia Tours, which offers tours for the same price as Euroladies. Anastasia's tours include introductions to 600 to 1,000 women and a 10 percent discount "when you bring a friend."
Even if true love does not last, the e-matchmaking sites are ready to help: some men are repeat customers, returning to the same Internet site on which they had found a previous, now-ex, wife.

HEADLINE: What's That Noise on the Internet? The Sound of Alliances Being Forged

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI; Bob Tedeschi writes the E-Commerce Report each Monday.

 BODY:
EVERYONE'S a cousin in e-commerce.
Scan a week's worth of dot-com headlines, and chances are good that you will find at least a dozen, if not scores, of partnership agreements or corporate alliances between Internet companies or traditional companies doing business on the Web. 
 Sometimes the partnerships involve industry behemoths, like Sun Microsystems and Netscape. Most other times, they are more modest, as in the recent alliance between Phone.com, a provider of wireless Internet technology, and MyWay.com, which builds custom business portals.
Taken as a whole, however, e-commerce partnership announcements have come so often recently that they have become the white noise of Internet business, the hum of the industry's hard drive.
Analysts and e-commerce executives say that alliances are far more prevalent in the Internet industry than in the off-line world, for cultural, practical and technical reasons. The opportunity for publicity also plays a role. "Some of these are really good," said Steven Johnson, a partner with Andersen Consulting, "but some are just companies breathing their own exhaust -- more hype than reality."
Consumer sites have been among the most aggressive in their partnership efforts, analysts say, because they are under pressure to broaden the products they offer. Amazon.com, for instance, has joined Drugstore.com, Ashford.com and, more recently, Wineshopper.com to sell as wide a variety of goods on its site as possible.
With these partnerships, sites achieve two critical e-commerce objectives: first, they increase the chances of shoppers' spending more on each order; second, they prevent customers from straying to other retailers. And portal sites join with companies that provide bill payment or group buying technologies to give users more reasons to stay -- "stickiness," in industry terms.
But stickiness is only part of the story. Industry analysts say that 20 years ago, companies were more inclined to build their own divisions or buy other companies. "In the 70's and 80's, people bought into diversification," said William Battino, who heads the e-business division of PricewaterhouseCoopers. "Now they don't want to be the jack-of-all-trades."
That notion is particularly relevant within the context of Internet business, Mr. Battino and others say, because Web start-ups often spring from a shred of technology or involve a marketplace niche that simply cannot serve customers without plugging in pieces of other businesses.
"With partnerships," Mr. Battino said, "it makes your speed to evolve and radically reinvent much higher," he said.
In an industry where an idea can turn into an initial public offering in months, and where first-mover advantage is the holy grail, Internet executives say that stopping to develop expertise in any given area is tantamount to suicide.
"In a crowd of start-ups, no one can do everything," said Cornelius Willis, vice president for marketing at QPass, which allows shoppers to buy lower-priced goods on several Web sites and have the purchases put on one bill. "So companies like mine are trying to string together a value proposition by creating a coalition of value."
Mr. Willis said that QPass recently made an alliance with American Express, whereby American Express customers would be able to redeem their awards points or shop at Web sites that use the QPass payment system. "We don't have that Amex customer list of 27 million people," Mr. Willis said. "And they don't have the partnerships with digital publishers and others that we have. It makes sense for everyone."
While such a loosely woven corporate structure may at first appear too feeble to sustain a business over the long haul, executives predict it will become a mainstay of the new economy.
"This won't slow down," said Warren V. Musser, the chief executive of Safeguard Scientifics Inc., an incubator of Internet companies. "Collaboration makes things work. There's no one group that can have all the perspective, so the trick is to collaborate, to make sure you don't miss anything."
Another reason why partnerships, especially among technology-savvy companies, are so plentiful is that "the new information technologies allow for better coordination between firms," said Charles Conn, the chairman of Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc., which sells tickets and has more than 40 city sites.
Mr. Conn said that in the past, companies like ITT, the conglomerate, "just acquired everything because it was difficult to coordinate partnerships through the phone" or other means. "But now we can communicate fluidly," he said, "even with companies that have a completely different structure."
Small Internet companies, he added, are also much happier to pursue partnerships because that allows them to maintain a small workforce "where people can feel the impact of their labor, and frankly feel their impact on the company's stock price."
Mr. Conn said that Internet companies also choose partnerships over deeper equity relationships because of the uncertain nature of the industry. "When you look at a firm you might want to own, but they have a cash burn rate that's very high," he said, "you might make less than a controlling investment to get a seat on the board, and get some insight from the company without having to consolidate their losses."
For instance, he said, Ticketmaster Online recently formed a partnership with Active.com, which helps users find sporting events they can participate in, rather than buy the company. "They're still losing a significant amount of money, so it wouldn't make sense to own them now," Mr. Conn said. "But this way, we still develop a strong relationship with them."
ONE way to track the Internet's infatuation with alliances is to watch the fad du jour within e-commerce. When business-to-consumer e-commerce held the public's -- and Wall Street's -- attention, the pace of alliances matched the investor frenzy. When the focus shifted to the business-to-business category, partnerships involving online industry marketplaces and software providers proliferated.
Lately, wireless e-commerce, sometimes referred to as "m-commerce" (the m stands for mobile), is emerging as another battlefront; for wireless providers, that means it is time to find partners. Kathy Simpson, the director of developer marketing for Phone.com, said the company had created alliances with about 200 companies who wanted to put their Web content into a format that could be viewed by people with cellular phones and other hand-held devices.
Phone.com earns money by signing up large long-distance carriers like AT&T to offer the service to cellular customers, so it behooves Phone.com to get as many Internet companies as possible to develop wireless versions of their sites. Meanwhile, these companies have little time to devote to wireless technology -- particularly because many are scrambling to remain in business -- so they rely on Phone.com to help.
When asked how Phone.com helps such a vast list of partners develop wireless programs, Ms. Simpson laughed. "We have other partners to help with that," she said. "None of us can exist alone. It's like people are supplying various pieces of the puzzle."
E-commerce executives said that in cobbling together that puzzle, not every piece fit nicely, especially when the partnerships are thrown together for the publicity.
Mr. Conn, of Ticketmaster Online, said that he had seen that happen. "We've been fortunate with our own alliances," he said. "But it's absolutely true that many of the ones you read about are ill-thought-through, and are done for the P.R. value. If there's one great thing about alliances, though, it's that they can be undone quickly."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TO BUSINESS;
It's Just the Beginning

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn.

 BODY:
THINK of the Internet. The imagery that comes to mind is romantic and exciting: dot-com billionaires barely out of school and colorful Web sites offering all sorts of wares and intriguing ways to shop. What definitely does not come to mind are Sherrell Coppedge and Kara Sylvia, seated recently at two ordinary desktop computers in a plain, windowless room at Honeywell Inc.
For eight weeks, four hours a day, Ms. Coppedge and Ms. Sylvia have been trying to trip up the new Internet ordering system that Honeywell's consumer products group, based here, is installing. Soon 2,000 customers -- auto dealers, parts distributors, lube centers, retail chains -- will be logging on to Web sites to place orders for Autolite spark plugs, Fram oil filters and Prestone antifreeze. No more orders by telephone or by fax, and much less paperwork. But first, the speedy new system has to function. 
 Working from thick loose-leaf notebooks, Ms. Coppedge, 34, and Ms. Sylvia, 26, carefully type in complicated, quirky orders, each a probe for shortcomings in the system's software. When a flaw appears, Jon Nehlsen, a 25-year-old Internet specialist, takes charge of the fix. All three are salaried employees earning less than six figures, the two women much less. None of the windfalls from wildly lucrative dot-com stock offerings come their way. And yet they and thousands like them are laboriously making the Internet a backbone of the national economy.
The Internet, with its endless Web sites, is already a miraculous storehouse of information, an instant communicator, a new medium, a vast electronic shopping mall, a link to Wall Street. But for all the excitement over the prospect of an Internet connection in every home, this is not where the big money is. What companies spend buying and selling goods and services to one another dwarfs consumer spending. The score last year was $14 trillion to $3 trillion. Like Honeywell, brick-and-mortar companies are just beginning to shift these intercompany sales to the Internet. Until they make the full transition, the Internet age will not truly have arrived.
And it is slow in coming. A lot more is involved than just logging on. Honeywell's consumer products group, for example, has three disparate, aging computer systems that track 17 factories and more than $1 billion in annual sales. Getting those computers to talk to other companies through the Internet is not easy. When Ms. Coppedge and Ms. Sylvia -- simulating outsiders -- hit a trouble spot, it is often because one of their orders placed through a Web site failed to enter the company's internal computers. Some version of Honeywell's painful progress is popping up everywhere in corporate America.
"The lion's share of American companies are in the throes of this conversion," said Clyde R. Moore, chief executive of the Thomas & Betts Corporation in Memphis, which makes electrical switches and connectors. A multi-million computer investment is just being completed. The more sophisticated system updates the company's inventories more quickly than before, for example, thus reducing the risk of selling a connector over the Internet that is not in stock.
Web sites for consumers are easier to create, and many companies now have them. They put these sites on computers dedicated to the Internet. A car buff, for example, can pull up a Honeywell site and find the filter he needs to change the oil in his car himself. Punch in a ZIP code and the site lists the nearest retail outlets selling the filter -- along with maps and directions on how to get there. The entire database is maintained separately from Honeywell's internal computer system.
The consumer is clearly the hare in this race. Still, the tortoise, even in this difficult early stage, has already moved out front. Intercompany transactions over the Internet totaled $90 billion last year, a drop in the bucket given the potential but nevertheless more than five times the $16.7 billion that consumers spent over the Internet, according to the Gartner Group, a consulting firm that tracks such data. The $16.7 billion included brokerage fees to trade stocks online.
But what route the tortoise will take to the finish line is still unclear. Business-to-business commerce over the Internet means that companies will have access to the data in one another's computers, like access to a stranger's bedroom. "What the Internet does is make the boundaries between companies much more fuzzy," said Paul Osterman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. With boundaries fading, mergers, and challenges to antitrust law, may multiply.
The Internet is also giving fresh impetus to trends already well under way. American companies, for example, find that the Internet gives them easier access to suppliers overseas. Competitive Internet auctions are forcing suppliers, here and abroad, to cut prices more than in the past. And stockpiles of unsold goods -- a burden in hard times -- are likely to shrink; the Internet helps companies place smaller orders more frequently.
There is one unambiguous benefit: labor productivity. The Internet should make possible more output, or at least the same output, from fewer hours of work. The 28 employees in Honeywell's consumer products group who now take orders by fax and phone will eventually be reassigned, their tasks automated as corporate customers shift to ordering online -- 2,000 this year and the remaining 2,000 thereafter. Some of the 28 might be reassigned as traveling sales reps to sign up more customers. Business would then grow without having to hire more workers, another gain in labor output.
"The potential exists for the nation to achieve real productivity gains," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist. The gains are just beginning to kick in, Mr. Blinder noted, as business-to-business commerce over the Internet -- almost nonexistent in 1997 -- finally takes hold and spreads.
More noticeably, the incipient Internet age is breeding a new type of electronic marketplace. Beyond one company selling goods or services to another, companies in the same industry are offering their products jointly on a common Web site, inviting buyers to choose from among their joint offerings. A new marketplace, to sell plywood or chemicals or steel or accounting services, is announced almost weekly. Honeywell's avionics division is participating in one, to sell aircraft parts and repair services. The main customers are airlines and the owners of corporate jets.
Buyers are also setting up joint marketplaces, the best known being one announced earlier this year by General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler. Most of the $240 billion a year in parts and materials that the Big Three purchase to make vehicles are to be listed on common Web sites, and thousands of suppliers will bid online for the business, almost certainly pushing down their prices.
There is a catch, however. Lacking expertise, the brick-and-mortar companies are relying on outside contractors to design and maintain their electronic marketplaces. Often the contractors are young, profitless dot-coms scrambling for a permanent foothold. Whether they will share in the control of these marketplaces, and the revenue they generate, or simply collect fees as technical agents is anyone's guess.
Honeywell, for example, took the lead in setting up the marketplace for aircraft parts and repair services but offered shares to the United Technologies Corporation, another big maker of aircraft parts. "To attract the likes of United Technologies, we had to be willing to share ownership," said Michael R. Bonsignore, Honeywell's chief executive. The necessary expertise in Internet technology -- to set up and run the marketplace -- comes from a start-up, i2 Technology, which also has an ownership stake but not much leverage. It lacks any merchandise to sell on the exchange.
Still, a few dot-coms are trying to mimic the New York Stock Exchange, which owns and runs the principal trading house for corporate stocks. FreeMarkets Inc. in Pittsburgh is in hot pursuit of this goal. Big manufacturers like Emerson Electric, Honeywell and United Technologies now turn regularly to FreeMarkets to round up suppliers, who then bid against one another on auction-style Web sites set up by FreeMarkets.
"Our FreeMarkets is going to be a major node, and we are now a major business-to-business marketplace," said Glen Meakem, the 35-year-old founder and chief executive, whose four-year-old company, for all its success, is losing money. "We are too far along for that to be taken away from us."
 
The Inventory Revolution
Making What's Needed Only When It's Needed
From the early days of the Industrial Revolution, business has struggled with the problem of unwanted inventories, which are the stockpiling of goods that later cannot be sold. Computers have helped to keep inventories in check, and now business-to-business commerce over the Internet offers corporate America, particularly manufacturers, a new and perhaps powerful tool in this struggle. That is because the Internet is turning out to be the least expensive system developed, so far, in which companies can talk to one another through their computers.
But to hold down inventories, the hookup has to go in two directions: to customers at one end, as Honeywell's consumer products group is doing with its new order system, and to suppliers at the other end. Then when one of Honeywell's customers -- the Jiffy Lube chain, for example -- orders a thousand oil filters, the suppliers at the other end will instantly know this and begin to make the metal casings, filter elements and tops, shipping them to Honeywell factories for final assembly.
The broad goal is to manufacture only what is needed, when it is needed. In good economic times, companies everywhere have tended to overproduce and stockpile, fearful -- for lack of timely information -- that they could not meet a flood of orders. These are good times, and Honeywell still has "$3.5 billion in working capital tied up in inventory," Mr. Bonsignore said.
Stockpiles, although smaller than in the past, are still a shadow over the economy. When slowdowns inevitably arrive, production is cut back abruptly, exacerbating the hard times until inventories are reduced. The great hope is that production swings in the Internet age will be less abrupt.
But the Internet hookups that link customers to their suppliers are still in their infancy. Only a few companies have completed the process: I.B.M., for example, and Wal-Mart. A decade ago, before the Internet, Wal-Mart connected the cash registers in its stores to its thousands of suppliers so that a shirt sold in Omaha registered with the company that made it in South Carolina. That pioneering system, however, required a huge investment in special computers and dedicated phone lines. Few other companies matched Wal-Mart's achievement, and in 1998 Wal-Mart itself switched its network entirely to the less expensive, more flexible Internet.
Most American companies are more like Honeywell than Wal-Mart. Honeywell's consumer products group is only now about to go online with its order system for business customers, and its avionics group in Olathe, Kan., only recently hooked into the computers at Cessna, a big customer for the cockpit controls and navigational devices that Honeywell makes.
Far more quickly than in the past, Honeywell is now privy to Cessna's shifting production schedule -- not only how many planes Cessna will make in the months ahead, but also how many of each model and their delivery dates. "Honeywell takes this data, runs it through its computers and explodes it down to parts numbers for its suppliers," said David Oppenheim, Cessna's supply chain manager and chief of its e-business.
Not quite. The explosion down to Honeywell's suppliers has not happened yet. But it will soon, the company promises. Links through the Internet to 12 of its 800 suppliers are about to go live. In a conference room at the avionics group's headquarters in Olathe, Jeffrey C. Small, manager of supply chain infrastructure, recently demonstrated the new system, flashing Web sites from his laptop on to a big white screen.
"Every day when a supplier logs on, he will see his situation with us," Mr. Small said, displaying a dummy supplier Web site filled with hyphenated parts numbers, new and old orders, parts needed quickly, others needed not so quickly. "It has taken 18 months to develop this system and it seems like it has taken forever."
 
The Global Auction Block
From Sealed Bids To Online Competition
More visible is the Internet auction house operated by FreeMarkets. The auctions are a novelty even for a technology full of novelties. Suppliers worldwide bid over Web sites on their laptop computers. Giant mother versions of these Web sites, several feet high, cover most of a wall at FreeMarkets' headquarters in Pittsburgh.
As the bidding proceeds from the laptops, the numbers change on the mother Web sites, which have bluish backgrounds that glow in a slightly darkened room the size and shape of a small college lecture hall. As the auction proceeds, sometimes for three hours, young people (average age 31) counsel the bidders by telephone. They have designed the Web sites to call attention to the big justification for Internet auctions.
One prominent column of numbers tells the big corporate buyer how much money the company is saving from the last time it bought this particular item. More often than not, that last purchase was pre-Internet style, through sealed bids. Opening these envelopes, the buyer then chose the lowest one. In the Internet auction, the competing suppliers see one another's bids. And if the falling numbers are not prod enough to keep shaving bids, separate graphs on the glowing Web sites plot the action downward.
Honeywell's avionics group, in this new world, saved $400,000, or 19.5 percent, in the purchase last month of various parts for $1.7 million. Owens Corning bought $24 million worth of corrugated packaging through an online auction, saving 7 percent. And the Carrier Corporation saved 16 percent on the purchase of air-conditioner motors, mostly from Asian suppliers for the company's Asian factories.
Carrier's parent, United Technologies, has bought a stake in FreeMarkets, which has frequently issued new stock to raise much needed capital. That may help to explain the enthusiasm of Edward Williams, Carrier's vice president for purchasing. "We spend $3 billion a year on suppliers, and we are running $100 million of this through FreeMarkets," he said. "I would like to keep that number growing."
What is less talked about are two changes in American business practices that the Internet auctions encourage. One is the tendency to ignore long-term relationships with suppliers and award the business to the qualified bidder offering the lowest price, or to the long-term supplier if it cuts its bid. Japanese companies had favored long-term relationships with suppliers, without forcing them to discount, and in the 1980's, when corporate Japan seemed so successful, American companies went that way, too. Now the pendulum is swinging back, thanks in part to the Internet.
"Japanese companies tried to partner a lot," Mr. Meakem of FreeMarkets said, "and the Asian crisis proved that noneconomic cozy relationships don't work."
The other change is the new encouragement to seek less expensive suppliers overseas, a trend well under way before the Internet. The Internet makes worldwide bidding feasible and dramatic, although the recruiting of overseas suppliers remains a rather old-fashioned task. Half of FreeMarkets' 497 employees spend their time not running electronic auctions but searching for suppliers in trade-association directories and trips abroad, painstakingly building up a huge database of potential bidders.
In preparation for last month's auction, Honeywell's avionics group received from FreeMarkets a list of 600 possible bidders from this database. By auction day, the list had been trimmed to 22 that met Honeywell's standards, some from as far away as Israel and China. That was still far more than the three or four suppliers that traditionally mailed in sealed bids.
"There was no reason why we could not have recruited many more suppliers in the past if we had made the effort," said Doug McCambridge, e-business project manager at Honeywell's avionics group. "The Internet is now pushing us to make the effort."
 
Small Changes Start to Add Up
THE Internet, with its easy accessibility, is generating various small corporate efficiencies.
The Chubb Corporation, the big insurer, for example, provides workers' compensation insurance to multinational corporations at their sites worldwide. Before the Internet, the executives in charge of workers' compensation at Chubb's client corporations gathered information about accidents by telephone, fax, e-mail, even floppy disks mailed to the home office.
Reports from Chubb's claims adjusters arrived by similar routes. With the data finally entered in a central computer, the executives could pinpoint the most frequent types of accidents, where they occurred most often and other trends that, if reversed, might reduce accidents and thus the company's insurance premiums. Now Web sites set up by Chubb provide all this information more quickly, in greater detail and with new analytical tools for spotting trends.
"What we are doing is leveraging a public infrastructure just as truckers leverage public highways," said Doug Nordstrom, Chubb's manager of business technology planning. "And our customers are demanding that we use the Internet to give them information in real time. If you don't give it, you are at a disadvantage. Someone else will and take away the business."
Johnson Controls Inc. in Milwaukee, which makes temperature controls and other products, uses Web sites to help its field representatives repair controls installed in commercial buildings nationwide.
The field representative logs on to a company Web site and "accesses our huge database until he finds a similar problem and solution," said James H. Keyes, chairman of Johnson Controls. There is much less need for costly experts at the other end of a phone line to answer a representative's questions, Mr. Keyes added, "and the repair job is faster." LOUIS UCHITELLE

HEADLINE: LETTER FROM...PHILACON VALLEY;
Brotherly Love It's Got, and Now There's a Touch of Envy, Too

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE; David J. Wallace, a business and technology writer, has moved to Boston from the Philadelphia area.

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
LIKE a character actor who takes roles as a serial killer after years of playing the kindly uncle, civic boosters here are trying to shed the cardigan sweater and the sensible shoes. There is a palpable desire to be a technology hot spot.
But how? Over the last couple of years, Technophilly, SiliconPhilly, Silicon ValleyForge, @Philly and Philacon Valley have been floated in efforts to raise the region's brand awareness, on the theory that recognition and corporate dollars would follow. Some names have Web sites or printed materials behind them, but not one of the monikers has stuck. 
 As any athlete knows, nicknames are given, not manufactured. Philadelphia is not as complacent and dowdy as its critics say. It has its power lunchers, its venture capitalists who chat casually about jaw-dropping sums. But it is not the technology mecca envisioned by its boosters. And when the city was omitted from a Wall Street Journal list of the top 20 technology areas last November, the slight touched off a quest for attention that would have made the region's Quaker settlers twitch uncomfortably.
Civic leaders want an e-business scene, just as earlier civic efforts tried to recognize the city's movie, restaurant and film notables. The actor Will Smith, Ben Vaughn, a rocker, and the rap group The Roots are hometown heroes, but the enduring reputation is "The Sound of Philadelphia," soul and pop music created by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff two decades ago. Movies recently filmed here include the creepy "Twelve Monkeys" and "The Sixth Sense," hardly the stuff shown by the chamber of commerce to foster corporate relocation.
Philadelphia has long had an identity crisis, flanked on the north by New York's financial and media capital and on the south by the political capital, Washington.
Defining the region is exasperating because of its diversity, said David Thornburgh, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Economy League, a public policy and research organization. The region encompasses some of the former steel towns of Pennsylvania and the shore resorts of New Jersey. Unlike Las Vegas or Detroit, where tourism or automotive industries serve as bellwethers, Philadelphia companies enjoy a strong reputation in credit, finance, insurance, medical education and care, biotechnology and pharmaceutical research, among other industries.
"There's been no image defined in the public psyche since 'Rocky,' " Mr. Thornburgh said. "But we could become the buckle on the East Coast's money belt because of our location. And our strength is in putting things together as an integrator."
Indeed, as in San Francisco or Boston, there is no single technology epicenter in the city. Philadelphia's downtown lofts and 19th-century storefronts now house computer graphics or e-business start-ups and electronic-art galleries.
That streetscape contrasts with acres of suburban office parks where companies vie for room to grow alongside countless consultants, training firms and support service providers. Devon Consulting, in the Main Line borough of Wayne, uses the parking lot for advertising. A Plymouth Prowler sporting the company's logo reminds clients that a successful referral may bring a week's use of the car.
Many argue that the region's reputation as a technology center will grow as more companies migrate to the Internet. There are now companies that excel in particular applications, among them SEI Investments in Oaks, Pa., which provides technology services and asset management for banks and investment companies.
"Unfortunately, we've never been able to birth a megacompany like AOL, Microsoft or Sun Microsystems," said Howard Ross, an adviser to emerging companies since the 1980's and a principal in LLR Equity Partners, a new venture fund. "But this area could wake up and surprise itself."
ONE reason for Mr. Ross's optimism is his argument that Boston and San Jose, Calif., had the first significant concentrations of venture capital, but the capital that creates companies is now flowing into other areas. In just the last three years, more than $50 billion in wealth was created on paper by three local companies. The charge has been led by the Safeguard Scientifics Corporation of Wayne, Pa, a publicly traded venture-capital investor, which backed two of the most successful public offerings in 1999, Internet Capital Group and VerticalNet.
Much of the e-commerce activity is in the business-to-business market, where less glamorous companies make the consumer dot-coms look good by providing the systems and fulfillment processes that power consumer Web sites.
Major corporations based here include QVC Network Inc., the Comcast Corporation, SAP Americas Inc. and Aetna U.S. Healthcare. Yet there are several obstacles to growth, said Stephen Mullin, a former commerce director for the City of Philadelphia who teaches college courses on e-commerce and is a consultant.
He points to a city tax structure that punishes companies by taxing both wages and net profits as one explanation as to why most of the expansion has been in the suburbs instead of downtown.
Looking to distinguish itself, a study found that Philadelphia's cost of living, relative to a technology professional's salary, ranked third lowest, behind Dallas and Chicago, among 15 cities. Robert Hollebeek, a data-mining expert, found the region was in a top spot in the number and density of colleges and universities. The residents of those 88 institutions, however, are transient, with one-quarter of the population coming and going each year, many taking business plans with them.
Innovative start-up ideas are being exported from Temple, Villanova and Drexel universities and the University of Pennsylvania, where the first electronic computer was created, in 1946.
Last month, it was announced that eTechtransfer.com, a business-to-business marketplace for the life-sciences industry, won the 2000 Wharton Business Plan competition. The prize was $15,000 cash and a $10,000 investment from Safeguard Scientifics. The 1999 winner, Paymybills.com, got snapped up by a California incubator, which disappointed local technology leaders.
To help stem the talent flight, the Eastern Technology Council, a regional industry group, has supported a program of scholarships, financing assistance for start-ups and using mentoring efforts to keep students here after graduation.
"Philadelphia's business plans are farther along than other cities', but the ideas that emerge here are going other places," said George Boyajian, a managing director of RoundTable Partners, which advises emerging companies. "As more 'smart money' comes into the area, more deals are getting done. But the traditional Quaker banking, insurance and real estate money is remarkably risk averse."
Still, the buzz of entrepreneurship is growing louder. At a student-entrepreneur forum organized by Mr. Boyajian at the University of Pennsylvania, 40 of the 60 undergraduates there said they had started a company.
Meanwhile, the search for a glamour tag continues. One local entrepreneur has tried out the idea that the area could be billed as being twice as important as Silicon Valley, whose technology companies are clustered around Route 101. Philadelphia's straddle Route 202.

HEADLINE: ONLINE OVERSEAS;
The Net Is Calling Them Home, but Many More Are Needed

BYLINE: By GRACE FAN; Grace Fan writes about business and the Internet in Shanghai.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
WHEN Xin Ye returned to Beijing after a 14-year absence to take a senior position at one of China's most popular Internet portals, Sohu, he left behind his wife, two daughters, a California lifestyle and a job prospect at a Silicon Valley start-up.
"My heart at this point is still in Silicon Valley," said Mr. Ye, 36, a former senior technical manager at Marimba, as he emerged from a meeting on his first day of work early last month. "The ocean was five minutes away. The mountains were half an hour's drive away. But how many times does an opportunity come up to build a leading portal in China? Just once, right?" 
 Mr. Ye is not alone among overseas Chinese who have given up the advantages of life abroad, for the time being, to chase Internet gold in a nation he no longer calls home. In growing numbers, first- and second-generation Chinese from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and the United States are returning to China, many recruited to feed a hunger for bilingual senior managers in the country's infant Internet industry.
"It's like a reverse brain drain," said Jay Kuo, a lawyer who left his job as a marketing manager at BSEM, an agricultural equipment manufacturer, in January to co-found Fudao.net, a finance site for families that is going online next month. "A lot of my friends have come back for the singular opportunity to write the next Internet chapter. Many mainland friends who have the opportunity to go overseas now haven't gone for this reason."
Beijing has tried for years, without much success, to lure natives with technical and managerial skills back to China. But the explosion of the Internet in China is finally "bringing them back in droves," said Charles Zhang, chairman of Sohu.
Still, while Web entrepreneurs like Tang Haisong of Etang, an online portal, and Joseph Chen of Chinaren, a community Web site, are coming back waving their Harvard and Stanford M.B.A.'s -- and flush with millions of dollars in venture capital -- what start-ups really need are senior executives with hands-on management experience and technical talent, analysts said.
Norman Liu, co-founder of 51job.com, a job site, said, "Once companies pass their first three- to six-month periods, human resources inevitably becomes the most important and most difficult problem for them."
They will particularly have to to fill certain upper-echelon spots. "They need key senior people with the vision and capability to lead them to an I.P.O.," Mr. Liu said. "The Chinese are good at execution, but weak on problem-solving, and lack a keen knowledge of the business as well."
Though established multinational companies have lamented that there is a scarcity of executive talent in China, the rash of new dot-com companies is fast turning this shortage into a cross-industry regional drought.
"The Internet industry is a big, sore open wound right now," said Steve Chiu, chief sales officer of Zhaopin, another job site. "We have over 500 companies advertising on our site now, many of them looking for the same people. It's a really really crazy scene."
A chief technical officer, with five to eight years of management experience, tops the wish lists of more than 100 start-up companies. A talented vice president for marketing is another highly coveted yet hard-to-find executive. Longer-established dot-coms, including the popular portal Netease, are beginning to recruit older executives, who can offer a depth of experience that their brash young founders lack.
Though well-known sites like Sohu and Sina have the money and name recognition to lure talent from Silicon Valley, many start-ups without these advantages are settling for employees with less experience, including managers from state-owned enterprises and graduates with master's degree in engineering. Salaries for even less-qualified chief technical officers can be as much as as $100,000, plus stock options.
"It's not the most rational hiring decision," Mr. Liu said, "because they'll hit a wall in six months. But companies nowadays are getting more and more desperate."
With demand up and supply down, it is no surprise that recruiting firms like Wang & Li Asia Resources, which culls talent from greater China and San Francisco, has seen its Net business explode 80 percent over the last six months. About 300 competing job- search dot-coms have also crowded into the recruiting field, Mr. Chiu said, all trying to capitalize on the expanding market.
For example, Sinobit, a site for technology entrepreneurs, prominently features a "Western returnee" center, hoping to lure overseas talent. The site was co-founded in January by Zhang Lei, who hastily packed his bags three months before finishing his M.B.A. from Yale University to return to China and join the Internet rush "before it was too late."
Others scoff at the perception that returnees are a sure-fire bet, saying that some people come back with a superior attitude that offends their staff members, or have been away too long to immediately grasp the complexities of a business environment literally changing by the month.
Still, for now, many smaller start-ups -- from Web development design firms to city guides -- are not worrying about an industry-wide scarcity of senior managers. Competent junior-level and midlevel managers are plentiful, thanks in part to multinational firms that started promoting local employees five years ago.
Though more than a few executives are disappointed by the lack of creative graphic designers or talented and self-motivated editors, which they attribute largely to an education system that does not foster creativity, many have devised innovative ways to deal with the problem.
An American executive at Menkou, a lifestyle and entertainment site, routinely does pull-ups in his hallway or plays his stereo loudly to encourage his employees to do wacky things. Fudao.net has built a jungle gym in its office to give its 27 employees a way to "keep their creative juices flowing," as Mr. Kuo puts it. Other Internet start-ups, unhappy with local programmers and graphic designers, have contracted the work out to people in other countries.
Employees have also realized that they are in demand. With bidding wars and raiding on the rise, salaries have increased in some companies as much as 50 percent for writers and 80 percent for junior-level programmers since a year ago. Across the industry, wages have generally risen a more modest 20 percent to 30 percent, but sudden promotions are also in vogue. One Internet company lured a sales clerk from another start-up by offering her a salary 12 times higher than her previous one, and the position of chief executive.
"We couldn't even find good-quality secretaries at average salaries," Mr. Kuo said. "Some even asked us for stock options. And we gave it to them."

HEADLINE: Matchmakers for Services That Really Mean Business

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
THEY have been designing and building Web sites since 1994, the proverbial dawn of the Internet age. But even though they have more potential business than ever before, work has become more complicated in recent years for the people at Choice One OnLine, Inc. a Buffalo, N.Y., Web host and Web design services company.
"Sure, there are lots of potential customers out there now," said Kyle Kraus, director of sales for Choice One, which was known as Edgenet until it was acquired in February by Choice One Communications of Rochester, N.Y., a local and long-distance phone company. "But in our industry, it's still hard to find a qualified lead -- someone who is willing to attach a budget to the project and who believes that there's going to be a return on his investment."
 Enter IT-Radar (www.it-radar .com, a Minneapolis company that links companies like Choice One with those that want to buy a range of information technology services. A so-called e-marketplace, IT-Radar's New York pages made their Web debut in late January. As Edgenet, Choice One was among the first to sign on; by mid-May, the company had received at least a dozen leads. 
 "What IT-Radar has done is to hook us up to people who are serious about what they're looking for," Mr. Kraus said.
Although business-to-business sales of goods on the Internet are exploding, the selling of business services online is in its infancy and amounted to a relatively meager $22 billion last year, according to Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. That number is expected to rise to $44 billion this year, compared with $406 billion in total business-to-business transactions. Most of those services were sold one-to-one by companies with an established relationship; very few transactions were, in fact, made at e-marketplaces, where service offerings have just begun.
The reasons are obvious. Buying a service often requires a chemistry between buyer and seller, which is especially true of complex and subjective services, like legal advice or creative design. Such services are less than ideal to sell at arm's length, notably between people who share only an Internet connection.
Still, those who use e-marketplaces to buy tangible goods say they like what they find, which is a system that encourages shopping around and finding substantial savings over traditional catalog prices. Given that, are e-marketplaces for services catching up?
Bruce D. Temkin, a Forrester analyst, thinks so. "Over the next three to four years we expect services to take hold," he said. "Even the most complex, human-intensive services will have an Internet component." As a result, Forrester predicts that business-to-business sales of services should rise tenfold over the next few years.
The field is wide open, Mr. Temkin said, "with no industry leader or model having yet emerged." E-marketplaces that are taking a crack at services are doing so in several different ways.
FreeMarkets, which arranges auctions of industrial materials and is one of the oldest business-to-business marketplaces, began offering services in 1997. But they make up less than 5 percent of the company's business -- $123.8 million of the $2.7 billion in sales made through the site, Mr. Meakem said. Services bought and sold included temporary help, corporate car-rental contracts and a $3.1 million contract for telecommunications services recently fulfilled for the state of Pennsylvania. Mr. Meakem thinks that these impersonal services will continue to dominate e-marketplaces.
"To make an auction market, a buyer has to be able to specify exactly what he or she needs and be willing to take it from any supplier," Mr. Meakem said. "You can't do that with corporate legal advice, but you can do it with services that are conducive to the bidding process."
Must an e-marketplace relegate customers to formal auction bidding in their service transactions? No, said Alexander Straub, the United States chief executive of Mondus (www.mondus.com), an e-marketplace that operates in the United States, Britain, Germany and France. Instead, the site offers goods and services to small and midsize companies through a system in which bids are presented to prospective buyers who can make their decisions at leisure. The process lets buyers make purchases using considerations other than price, and buyers often negotiate directly with sellers after receiving their bids. Sellers pay Mondus.com a commission if a sale is made.
That means that a buyer can get to know a seller before making a purchase. "With services, you often want to talk to the vendor, and with our system you can do that," Mr. Straub said.
According to Mr. Straub, customers who originally came to Mondus for products are beginning to use it to shop for services as well, mostly standardized ones like courier services and translation. More personalized things like human resources, legal services and public relations remain a harder sell.
And that is precisely the kind of resistance that IT-Radar is determined to overcome. Unlike most e-marketplaces, where the sale of services has a secondary role, IT-Radar deals in nothing else.
"In this market -- information technology services -- there is a lot of subjectivity on both sides," said Don Peterson, the chairman. Providers and buyers are selective, he said, adding, "Like a law firm, they decide whether to take a client." Moreover, although buyers and sellers of goods and raw materials often benefit from the national or international scope of an e-marketplace, the market for services is far more fragmented, with a "unique mix in each town," Mr. Peterson said.
So IT-Radar operates locally, with businesses in 11 markets thus far, including Denver, Atlanta, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Although the places differ, the process is the same. Service providers prepare profiles of themselves that the company keeps on file. Then, as prospective purchasers require services, they prepare lists of their needs, which are sent to providers, who file their responses. The process continues, often with negotiations and direct contact, until the client makes a selection. Meanwhile, service providers pay IT-Radar a fee depending on how many leads they accept.
Mr. Kraus, of Choice One OnLine, is pleased with the service so far. "We've closed a couple of deals already," he said.

HEADLINE: LIFE'S WORK;
It's a Whole New Lexicon

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN; This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. Lisa Belkin's e-mail address is Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A FORMER professor of mine called the other day and asked if I'd speak to a group of graduating students about juggling life and work. It's been nearly 20 years since I was a graduating senior myself, and I certainly don't remember anyone talking to me then about life in the same sentence as work.
Back when I was their age (back when I swore I would never say things like "back when I was their age"), a job search was all about whom we could persuade to hire us, not whom we would deign to work for. I have vague memories of my mother suggesting that "international law requires a lot of time away from home, dear," but I wasn't really listening, and I did not for a moment consider choosing a career because it would provide something as complex as flextime-in-preparation-for-the-day-when-I-had-children. Back then the vocabulary with which to articulate that idea didn't even exist. 
 Today's students, I'm learning, are fluent in this new language. They have watched their parents (gulp, my peers) try to give 100 percent of themselves twice over, and, because this is a mathematical impossibility, they have watched them fail. "They have mothers and fathers who were never around," says Dan Golden, a dean at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., where students are counseled, beginning as freshmen, about the "triangle" of life-work, significant relationships and community service. "They saw their parents get sliced apart trying to balance everything," he says, "and they are determined to do things differently."
Schools, in turn, are determined to help them. Just look at the name of Mr. Golden's department. No longer "career services," his office of "Work and Service Learning" holds seminars throughout the year, with recent graduates returning to tell students about the real world. "We don't want them to come back in 20 years," he explains, "and say, 'Why didn't you tell us how hard it was going to be?' "
Instead, armed with knowledge and bouyed by a microscopic unemployment rate, they march into today's job interviews and ask for what they want. "Dress code is a big one," says Dr. Larry Salters, director of the University of South Carolina's Career Center. "They want to know, 'What are the dress expectations? How flexible is my schedule? Can I set my own hours? Can I do some of my work from home or in my car? How involved will I be in making the important decisions?' "
Some of them do their asking on the Web, at job-search sites like Careercreations .com. Founded by 22-year-old Todd Gitlin, who is barely one year out of California State University at Chico, the site proclaims: "Forget about searching for job openings. Search for employers by the things that matter to you -- signing bonus, car allowance, stock options, on-site massages, flexible schedules and more."
One afternoon a few weeks ago I did just that. I logged on as the me I was my senior year, a confused Ivy League political science major who thought she might want to go to law school but figured journalism might be fun, too. Under "fields of interest" I entered advertising, publishing, consulting and the Internet. That last one didn't exist when I graduated, but if it had I don't imagine I could have resisted that which lures this whole generation.
Then I scrolled through Mr. Gitlin's ingredients for a balanced life. I clicked "yes" to all the insurance benefits, to the stock-option plan, to paid personal days, paid sick days, paid vacation days, paid holidays. I clicked 'not essential" to the commuting allowance and auto allowance because my 22-year-old self expected to live in the middle of a city. My only "no" was to paternity leave, for obvious biological reasons.
I said I needed a flexible schedule and a smoke-free environment, but I could live without a casual dress code and the right to bring my (nonexistent) dog. On-site food facilities were on my list of requirements and, as a result, so was an on-site gym. Wanting to appear reasonable, I said that an on-site hairdresser, dry cleaner, car wash and massage therapist were "nonessential." I was, I admit, sorely tempted to check "yes" to the massage.
After agreeing to move anywhere in the country, I hit the send button. A list of more than a dozen companies appeared, and most were technology-related. Not one had all the features I had checked, but a few had most.
Would I have been happy with a life spent writing banner ads for Internet sites? Perhaps. Would all this advance warning really have prepared my 22-year-old self for the cataclysmic changes brought to that life by adding children? Probably not. No class nor Web site can prepare you for that. But I would have been well served to have paid some attention. The biggest change since I was "their age" is not that they have all the answers, but that they know enough to ask the questions.

DATELINE: FORT KNOX, Ky.

 BODY:
Staff Sgt. Harry Feyer was parking cars and looking glum when the four platoons of Bravo Company, including his own, came marching toward him up a long grassy hill on their way to the winter graduation.
They stepped smartly, 214 strong, their brass buttons gleaming on dress greens, their black shoes buffed to a high sheen. They displayed all the discipline and dash that Sergeant Feyer, a leader of Fourth Platoon, had helped pound into them in nine weeks of basic training. 
 Striding beside them were his fellow drill sergeants, shoulders back, chests out, their full-dress uniforms a deep green backdrop for clusters of glinting medals and rainbows of ribbons, their brown Smokey Bear hats cocked aggressively low on their foreheads. Sergeant Feyer, six feet tall and lanky, might have been among them.
Instead he stood apart in his mottled fatigues and dusty combat boots, directing traffic outside the dingy yellow gymnasium where the ceremony was to be held. It was a duty he had volunteered for. It was his one-man protest.
Sergeant Feyer was angry that he had been denied an award given to the top-performing drill sergeant at the end of each basic-training cycle, an award he felt he deserved. True, it didn't look like much -- just a cheap bronze-plated statue, a generic eight-inch-tall figure of a sergeant. But in the pressure cooker that is the United States Army, winning even a small award could help make the difference between promotion and stagnation, between a better life for his family and just scraping by.
And he knew why he had lost out, or believed he knew: because he is white. No white drill sergeant had won the award since the company was founded in April 1998. Of the five given out, three had gone to blacks and one to a Hispanic. The one time a white sergeant was selected, he gave the trophy back when a group of black sergeants kicked up a fuss, saying he didn't deserve it.
That Sergeant Feyer had lost out this time came as no surprise in Bravo Company, particularly to the white sergeants. Everyone knew that in Bravo, a clique of black sergeants ran things.
Sergeant Feyer said he didn't like to think that way. People make too much of race, he said. But there were times when it did matter to him. "When it's a matter of something that I deserve because of my position," he said, "if I outrank a person and he gets a job because of his color, then there's something wrong."
As Sergeant Feyer stewed in the parking lot, Staff Sgt. Earnest Williams stood erect in front of Fourth Platoon, his square, muscled frame pushing at the seams of his uniform. Sergeant Williams was part of that black coterie that ran the company, and ran it smoothly. The white sergeants might grumble, but they acknowledged that the blacks got things done. Yet Sergeant Williams was not feeling particularly powerful this morning. This was his last day with the company. He was being transferred to another unit, away from his buddies, away from his position of influence.
It seemed unfair to him. He was a good soldier, a good leader. His superiors -- his white superiors -- had said there were too many drill sergeants in Bravo Company and not enough in others. He did not believe them. He was convinced he was being shipped out because he is black. As far as he could see, the powers that be didn't like it when the brothers were in control.
"We had it for a little while," said one of his black compatriots. "But then they said, 'Oh no, we can't let this be.' "
So on a chill December morning, two soldiers -- one black, one white, both part of an institution portrayed as a model of race relations -- stood only yards apart in the middle of this sprawling base, each believing himself the victim of racism.
Just then a gray Honda Accord glided into a parking space and out popped Sgt. First Class Henry Reed, resplendent in his dress greens. "Good morning!" he bellowed, a broad smile splitting his dark, soft-featured face. "It's a wonderful day!"
Sergeant Reed was going to receive the award that Sergeant Feyer saw as rightfully his; Sergeant Reed would get the glory even though it was Sergeant Feyer who had worked the late nights, who had pitched in to help other platoons when they were short-handed, who had made sure the washers and dryers got fixed.
Sergeant Reed was limited by a back injury suffered in a car crash, and it had not escaped Sergeant Feyer's notice that Sergeant Reed had skipped the long days on the rifle range, that he hadn't humped a 40-pound rucksack up and down steep, chest-busting hills on 15-kilometer marches.
"We all know that Reed is broke," one white drill sergeant said. "He can't do the work anymore."
Sergeant Reed was also nearing retirement; at 39 he was the oldest drill sergeant in the company. This was probably his last chance to win the company's drill-sergeant award. So his fellow black sergeants had decided to select him, they said, on the basis of what he had done in the past.
As Sergeant Feyer watched his colleague stride jauntily into the field house, he had another reason to fume. Sergeant Reed had parked his car off by itself, leaving a devil-may-care gap in the row of vehicles that Sergeant Feyer -- who finds satisfaction in rote, mechanical tasks -- had meticulously arranged.
"He ruined my parking," Sergeant Feyer said. "Not only did he screw me out of my award, but he ruined my parking."
 
Ideal? Get Real
The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment anymore. Integrated since 1948, it is now marbled with blacks, Hispanics and other minority members of all ranks. It is one of the few institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around whites, and to hear the Army brass tell it, no one gives it a second thought.
But that is an idealized image. The Pentagon itself discovered as much last year, when it found that two-thirds of the men and women in the armed forces had experienced a racially offensive encounter in the previous 12 months. Those findings more or less mirrored the view from Bravo Company, First Battalion, 46th Infantry, in the summer and fall of last year. Racial tensions abounded, but seldom were they out in the open. Even less often did they rise to high drama. Race-related fights were rare; the angry spitting out of a slur was uncommon.
The 16 sergeants in Bravo Company appeared to get along, too, eating together in the mess hall, joshing one another about cultural differences in food, music and sports. In part they were helping to fulfill the Army's goal of not so much changing racial attitudes as altering behavior; to some extent they were carrying out orders -- to treat one another with respect regardless of race.
"It's like wearing seat belts," said Sgt. First Class Thomas Ballard, a white drill sergeant from Aberdeen, Miss. "When I was growing up I never wore a seat belt. But the Army says you've got to wear them."
On the surface, at least, Sergeants Williams and Feyer seemed good candidates for getting beyond race. Both were 34 years old and married. Their children -- Sergeant Williams has three, Sergeant Feyer two -- are of similar ages. Both men had been in the Army 12 years and had been "on the trail," as drill-sergeant duty is called, since the company was formed. Both had spotty academic records and both had been worrying about their careers.
They were also partners -- "battle buddies," in military parlance -- in running Fourth Platoon, though Sergeant Williams, as platoon sergeant, was technically Sergeant Feyer's supervisor. Their metal desks sat three feet apart. They even lived on the same street, less than 200 yards from each other.
But neither had ever set foot in the other's house. Sergeant Williams had a simple explanation: "We don't have anything in common. We're just different."
They were certainly different in background. Earnest Williams grew up poor in a fatherless household in Waco, Tex. Harry Feyer (pronounced Fire) led a sheltered, stable life in tidy, middle-class, lily-white Sheboygan, Wis.
They also came to be drill sergeants by very different military paths. On the wall next to Sergeant Feyer's desk was a pen-and-ink drawing of a Cobra helicopter, a memento of his days as a copter mechanic.
Sergeant Williams, by contrast, was pure infantryman. Hanging next to his desk was a framed pencil drawing of a soldier carrying a rucksack and an M-16. After he bought the sketch, in Hawaii, he had an artist erase the white soldier's face and draw one with black features. It kind of looked like him.
Of the two, Sergeant Williams was far more comfortable with the racial structure of Bravo Company. Though a white captain and white lieutenant oversaw the unit, the four black drill sergeants were unofficially in charge. Alongside Sergeant Williams, Staff Sgt. Otis Thomas ran the Third Platoon, Sergeant Reed the Second and Staff Sgt. Robert Boler the First.
Then there was First Sgt. Anthony Boles, a black man who was in charge of day-to-day matters for the entire company. The four black sergeants held great sway with him -- or so it appeared to some white and Hispanic drill sergeants.
"If I complained about something, I would get shot down quicker than Reed or Williams would," said Sgt. First Class Rogelio Gomez, a Hispanic drill sergeant who left Bravo Company last August. "That was the first sergeant's fault, because he was more comfortable dealing with his homies."
Sergeant Boles scoffed at the notion that he played favorites. But he and the other black sergeants, including Sergeant Williams, acknowledged that having a company in which African-Americans were in control was a source of racial pride. They considered it unusual, and they feared it would not last.
 
To Climb, Compete
 Race wasn't the whole story in Bravo Company. Career and financial pressures exist in Army life with or without racial tensions. When race does come into play, though, it only aggravates the stress.
While the Army proclaims itself to be about teamwork, its soldiers, including its sergeants, compete against one another. The sergeants push their troops to be named honor platoon, to win marching and marksmanship citations, to score the highest on the P.T., or physical training, test. That means doing the most push-ups and situps, and running the fastest two miles.
Winning is not just a matter of satisfying testosterone-fueled egos. Any award, any citation, goes into a soldier's personnel file and can help lift him or her to the next rank. Promotions are everything. The raises they bring may be small, but they are the only means of easing the financial strain.
Like other sergeants, Harry Feyer and Earnest Williams each made about $2,000 a month before taxes. With that they had to buy their own uniforms, knapsacks, sleeping bags, helmets and even the stripes they sewed on their sleeves. Meals in the company mess hall were charged to them.
Housing is free if soldiers live on the post. But that means families must make do with cramped row houses.
"I'd like to have more than five bucks in my back pocket or, sometimes, no dollars in my back pocket," Sergeant Feyer said. "I want to be able to go to the A.T.M. and not worry, 'Should I do this?' " He said he would love to move into one of those bigger, duplex houses with attached garages. But houses like that are set aside for sergeants first class, a rank above him.
In such an environment there can be gnawing suspicions about why you're not moving up, or not moving up faster. Maybe it's your shortcomings. Maybe someone is holding you back. Or maybe, you think, you're not getting ahead because of your race. It's hard to tell.
It was hard to tell with Sergeants Williams and Feyer. Sergeant Williams confided that he thought little of Sergeant Feyer as a soldier and even less of him as a leader. He felt his colleague let too many things fall through the cracks and didn't push the privates enough. As Sergeant Boler said one day, using Sergeant Williams's nickname, "In that platoon, Will's the daddy and Harry's the mommy." In the macho world of the Army, "mommy" is not a compliment.
There was a Monday in July when Sergeant Williams returned from the weekend to find the barracks a mess. Sergeant Feyer had had weekend duty. Sergeant Williams was worried that the first sergeant would see the scuff marks on the floor and the scum in the showers and blame him, as platoon sergeant. That would have stained his record at a delicate time; his name was before the promotion board again.
Apparently unaware of Sergeant Williams's disrespect, Sergeant Feyer wondered aloud why his partner didn't share more responsibility with him, why he didn't trust him more. Why was it that Sergeant Williams tended to confer with Sergeants Reed, Thomas and Boler on matters involving Fourth Platoon?
"I'm his battle buddy," Sergeant Feyer said. "I feel he should be discussing things with me."
 
Showing Who's Boss
 Basic training had entered the hot, suffocating days of a Kentucky August, and Sergeant Feyer was angry and hurt. Sergeant Williams had undermined his authority, he said -- again.
A few days before, as Bravo Company was finishing up on the hand-grenade range, the sergeants had put the recruits in formation for a "shakedown," frisking them to make sure they were not smuggling dummy grenades, a favorite souvenir, back to the barracks. Sergeant Feyer called on Pvt. David Kellar, a tough-looking black recruit from Chicago, and got a scornful look in return.
Private Kellar had been a problem from the start. He was big and intimidating. He liked to bully the other privates. Once, he got into a fight and broke another recruit's jaw. He was rebellious. When given an order, he would often suck his teeth or cast a baleful gaze.
Private Kellar's behavior unnerved Sergeant Feyer. "It wasn't like I was afraid of him," he said. "I'm sure I could take him if I had to. But it was like he wasn't giving me any respect." He had never seen the private treat Sergeant Williams that way, he said.
So when Private Kellar gave him the look this time, the sergeant decided to show him who was boss. After patting him down, Sergeant Feyer picked up the recruit's canteen and casually tossed it into an open field. "Go get the canteen, private," he told him.
But Private Kellar wasn't about to fetch anything. He turned to another recruit and gruffly ordered him to retrieve his canteen.
Sergeant Feyer only got angrier. He and Staff Sgt. David Hanson, a white Californian, grabbed the rest of the recruit's gear -- helmet, equipment belt, rucksack -- and heaved it into the field as well. "Get your gear yourself," Sergeant Feyer said.
Private Kellar obeyed this time but then complained that his helmet was missing an identification holder. It held not only his Army ID, he said, but also $50. He implied the loss was the sergeants' fault.
One black drill sergeant wasn't buying it. "Better check him," he said. But before anyone could touch him, Private Kellar patted his chest himself. Oh, he said, it had been around his neck the whole time.
Now Sergeant Feyer wanted the private punished for lying. Back at the barracks, he typed out papers that could have led to a fine or an outright discharge. But to Sergeant Williams that was overkill. A number of black drill sergeants thought the white sergeants were too harsh with black recruits, he said, and he agreed. He recalled his days in basic training when he was a tough-talking hardhead and black drill sergeants had cut him some slack. So Sergeant Williams and the first sergeant pressed Sergeant Feyer to withdraw the charges.
Sergeant Feyer relented, but the episode did not sit well. He saw it as part of a pattern in which Sergeant Williams would contradict him, criticize him, ridicule him or bypass him altogether. Sometimes when they were shooting the breeze, Sergeant Williams would regale the others with a tale of the latest Feyer screwup. He said he knew this bothered Sergeant Feyer but hoped it would prompt him to shape up.
"It's easy to make him feel insufficient or not good enough," Sergeant Williams said. "I didn't enjoy it, but I did it to put pressure on him to do better."
Sergeant Feyer would laugh at himself along with the rest. But inside, he said, he seethed. He hated the way his partner embarrassed him.
 
Steamroller From Waco
On a bright summer afternoon Sergeant Williams was marching Fourth Platoon along one of Fort Knox's wooded back roads. Each drill sergeant has his favorite cadence -- the rhythmic call-and-response chant used to keep the privates in step. Sergeant Williams was calling out one of his.
"I'm a steamroller, baby," he sang in a strong tenor, "and I'm rolling all over you."
The words fit well, physically and temperamentally. At 5 feet 10 inches and 210 pounds, Sergeant Williams was a model of muscle and power. When he had free time, he was usually pumping iron in the company's weight room. He was careful with his diet and didn't smoke, though he did occasionally like a beer. His desk drawer rattled with bottles of pills labeled "Ripped Fuel -- Metabolic Enhancer" and "Metaform."
He also had a bright, boyish smile that went well with his impish sense of humor. But in an institution that puts a premium on physical fitness, it was important to Sergeant Williams to camouflage his charm with sternness and to impress the privates with prowess.
One evening they challenged him to do 50 push-ups in a minute. He accepted but, not wanting to embarrass himself, first retreated to his office to see if he could pull off such a feat. There he dropped to the floor and did 50. Naturally the effort tired him. But he would not let himself show weakness, so he swaggered out into the sleeping bay, slapped a stopwatch into a private's hand and knocked out another quick 50. The men were wide-eyed.
"In the Army you're either a stud or a slug," the sergeant said. "You can be really intelligent. But if you can't run three miles or hump a rucksack, then you're a slug."
Sergeant Williams learned the necessity of toughness long before he got to Bravo. He grew up in the central Texas flatlands, bouncing among housing projects and running through the weeds around shacks in a neighborhood of drugs and poverty.
Earnest Williams was the sixth of 14 children born to Shirley Ann Hunter. Abandoned by her first and second husbands, she had little choice other than welfare. But with so many mouths to feed, it was never enough. Clothes came from the Salvation Army. The family was constantly being evicted for failure to pay the rent.
Relatives offered to take in some of the children, but she refused. "The one thing our mother showed us was endurance," said another son, Robert Bell. "Because we had it so hard, we would have these family group sessions. She would call all my brothers and sisters together and tell us that the only thing we had was each other, and the only thing we could do was endure."
Not all the children did. The oldest brother, Greg, became a crack addict, and a younger brother, James, was killed during a drug deal. But Earnest stayed out of trouble, channeling into sports the determination his mother had taught him. In high school he became a football and track star. Or, more precisely, he willed himself to become a star; he could not abide the word "can't." One summer he watched people in the deep end of a public pool. Not content at the shallow end, he watched them and mimicked them until he had taught himself to swim.
But he was never much of a student. "I went all the way through high school and I don't think I cracked a book once," he said one day, looking wistfully off in the distance from a bleacher seat at Fort Knox.
In some ways he is the perfect soldier: strong, driven and unquestioning.
After enlisting he was steered into the infantry, and with his physical abilities he found it easy. "I felt like I'm at home here," he said. He was considered a first-rate infantryman. Once, during the Persian Gulf war, he walked point for an entire battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division as it moved to attack the Iraqis. That was as close as he came to combat; the Iraqis surrendered at the Americans' approach.
But he never gave much thought to where his career was going. He dutifully took the elite infantry jobs his superiors recommended -- paratrooper, Ranger -- and succeeded at whatever was asked of him, to the extent that he got his sergeant's stripes. He was a natural leader as a drill sergeant, fast-talking, quick-moving and impatient with those who were not.
Yet his career hit a wall after the gulf war. He was promoted to staff sergeant in 1992. Seven years later, he had yet to make it to the next level, sergeant first class. Four times his name went before promotion boards, and four times he was rejected.
He and his wife, Ruth, a Puerto Rican whom he met in 1987, suspected that his academic deficiences were behind his stagnation. He had never taken any college courses in the Army, even though he had had the opportunity. During a stint at Fort Benning, Ga., for example, he had enough time on his hands to become a part-time security guard.
"He talks about going back to school lots of times," Mrs. Williams said one afternoon in their living room, between running one child to dance and another to basketball. "A big obstacle for him is being afraid to go back. He feels he was never really prepared in high school to do college work."
But as they watched other sergeants move up -- mainly white ones, whose credentials were no better than his -- the Williamses also began to suspect race.
"It makes you wonder," Mrs. Williams said. "Is he being passed over because he's a black male?"
Sergeant Williams was getting older and going nowhere. He decided that if he didn't get a promotion by this summer, he would quit. His two years as a drill sergeant were up in April. His wife was already typing out his application to the Secret Service. He toyed with the idea of running an R.O.T.C. program at a black college somewhere and taking courses at the same time. He even considered volunteering to serve a year in Korea, figuring that if he put in 12 months there, he had a chance for an R.O.T.C. slot when he rotated back to the States.
But Korea is considered a war zone, meaning soldiers cannot take their families with them, and his wife made it clear that she would not stand for that. "It would not be good for my kids not to see their father for a year, especially my son," she said. "So that's not going to happen."
 
Tinkerer From Sheboygan
Sergeant Feyer liked to show off Bravo's cavernous classroom. He had spent hours refurbishing it, pasting blue sisal halfway up the white walls to relieve the drabness and deaden the echoes. He had even designed the floor, using royal blue tiles against white to make a large "146," Bravo's battalion and brigade.
It was his kind of work. "I've always loved working with my hands," he said. "I guess I got that from my dad."
His father, Gerrit, was a Dutch immigrant, a woodcarver who helped make molds for machine parts. Harry was the youngest of seven children whom Gerrit and Cornelia Feyer reared in Sheboygan, a manufacturing town on Lake Michigan north of Milwaukee and south of Green Bay.
The Feyers had moved there for the work and for their faith. Sheboygan offered a school run by the Christian Reformed Church, an offshoot of the Dutch Reformed Church, and the Feyers wanted their children educated in the Reform tradition. Sheboygan was a safe setting in which to raise children, but it was isolated.
"Because he was going to a Christian school and hung around with Dutch people, he was kind of sheltered," his father said.
There were hardly any blacks in Sheboygan. A local joke has it that if you see a black man on the street, he must play for the Packers. Sergeant Feyer remembers knowing one black family. The father was a police officer. The son was a thief.
While Earnest Williams was a football hero in high school, Harry Feyer faded into the crowd at his school. He didn't play sports, he didn't participate in extracurricular activities, he didn't do well in his studies.
"He was kind of a laid-back kid, not a natural leader," recalled Art DeJong, his high school English teacher. "I wouldn't say Harry was the most highly disciplined guy I've ever met. He was friendly and likable, the type of kid who sometimes gets lost."
Where he usually got lost was under the hood of a car. He would spend hours in a neighbor's garage, breaking down and rebuilding engines. Mechanical tasks absorbed him, just as they would in the Army, to the point where they distracted from the rest of his life.
After finishing school, he married his high school sweetheart, Laurel Cluk, a strong-willed, outspoken woman. He got a job in a plant that made wall paneling and shortly concluded that it was a dead end. That was when he decided to enlist.
In the Army he gained recognition as a first-rate mechanic and was given the job maintaining Cobras. He wound up doing little more than that; it took him almost eight years to become a sergeant. In part he blames a supervisor, in part himself.
It was 1991, and the Army was phasing out the Cobra, so promotions for people who worked on it were becoming rare. He was supposed to be notified of a special program permitting Cobra mechanics to switch to other specialties. But he was a good mechanic and his supervisor didn't want to lose him, so, the sergeant said, the supervisor hid the notification papers.
Sergeant Feyer learned of the ruse the next year, but by then it was too late for the retraining. "I should have gone straight to the I.G., the inspector general, and say this guy just screwed me," he said. But the supervisor "was somewhat of a friend of mine," he said, "and I didn't want to get him in trouble."
"So I didn't say anything."
He does say something when his assertiveness is questioned, however. He'll smile, bob his head and, like some goofy cartoon character, sing, "Doh-dee-doh-dee-doh."
That sort of passivity drives his wife crazy. At dinner one night at home, he was complaining about being cheated out of the top drill sergeant award that went to Sergeant Reed. Without missing a beat he began describing the work he was going to do during the break between cycles to improve the company's classroom.
But why put yourself to all that trouble after what has happened? he was asked.
"Because he's stupid," Laurel Feyer interjected.
Sergeant Feyer smiled sheepishly. "Doh-dee-doh-dee-doh," he sang.
 
Promotion Blues
The promotion board was meeting during the summer and Sergeant Feyer was eager for a shot at platoon sergeant. But he wondered what chance he had when all the platoon sergeant slots in Bravo Company were held by blacks.
Sergeant Feyer had been in an almost identical situation in South Korea. There a white sergeant, a talented helicopter mechanic, was bypassed for platoon sergeant because all the platoon sergeants were black and a black first sergeant looked out for them. Or so most people, especially whites, suspected. As far as Sergeant Feyer knew, no one bothered to find out the truth.
Now he saw history repeating itself. "I hated thinking like that," he said. "But I just didn't want to get screwed."
Not again. Besides, he saw himself as a new man now.
His transformation began, he said, the day in 1994 when the Army told him that it was kicking him out. It had been three years since his supervisor had sandbagged him into remaining a Cobra mechanic, and he still had not made sergeant. The Army was pruning itself of dead wood, and he, stuck at corporal, was on the list.
Laurel Feyer was pregnant at the time, and the couple had a 5-year-old son; they needed the Army's medical benefits. One night Sergeant Feyer lay awake, his chest so constricted he could hardly breathe. "I was really scared," he said. "I didn't know what I was going to do."
Fear galvanized him. He pleaded with the Army not to discharge him and volunteered to work in nuclear, biological and chemical warfare. Not many soldiers choose that specialty. Most are scared off by it, imagining themselves in stifling chemical-warfare suits, never mind the poisons. Promotion possibilities there are wide open.
"I took it because I didn't want to throw away eight years of being in the Army," Sergeant Feyer said.
He made sergeant a few months later.
The promotion brought another surprise. Attending mandatory classes for noncommissioned officers, he graduated with honors. Buoyed by his success, he signed up for courses at a community college in Colorado Springs, where the family was living. He got A's, B's and an associate's degree. He was stunned.
"I went all through high school thinking I'm a failure, that I'm nothing but a D-minus student," he said.
In short order he became staff sergeant, then drill sergeant, finishing near the top of his class. Now, at Fort Knox, he had a chance for platoon sergeant, and he wasn't going to be denied by a group of blacks just because he wasn't one of them.
He talked over the situation with the company's executive officer, Lt. Paul Bergson, a chubby, college-educated white officer with a mordant sense of humor. Lieutenant Bergson warned him that before raising a stink he should determine whether the blacks promoted to platoon sergeant had more seniority. He checked, and they had.
But the black sergeants got wind that whites were questioning the platoon leadership's racial makeup and resented it.
"They never want to see a black man get ahead," Sergeant Reed said as he sat with a group of black sergeants in the mess hall one night. Sergeant Williams agreed. As soon as whites feel even a little threatened, he said, "they all stick together."
 
A Truce, or Maybe Not
By the autumn of last year Sergeants Williams and Feyer had reached a kind of accommodation. It might have had something to do with Sergeant Williams's promotion; in September he received word that on his fifth try he was being made sergeant first class. The pressure, for the moment, was off. His wife could put away the application for the Secret Service.
A few days before the fall graduation, Sergeant Feyer gingerly approached Sergeant Williams and mentioned that his parents would be visiting from Sheboygan and that they had never seen their son at work. Sergeant Williams picked up on the hint and gave Sergeant Feyer his place at the ceremony marching in front of Fourth Platoon.
"This stuff don't mean nothing to me, anyway," Sergeant Williams said.
For his part, Sergeant Feyer began trying to work more effectively with Sergeant Williams. He tried to anticipate what was wanted of him. He felt Sergeant Williams tried to talk with him more. "We're clicking now," he said. "We don't even have to say anything. We each know what to do."
Sergeant Williams had a different view: his partner still wasn't pulling his weight. "He wants his own platoon," Sergeant Williams said. "I feel he should get it and then fall on his face. The reason he doesn't fall on his face now is because I don't let him."
But Sergeant Williams soon had something else on his mind. Near the end of the fall cycle he was told that he was being transferred to Echo Company, across the parade ground.
The orders outraged him. He had achieved a position of power in Bravo Company. The transfer would mean he would have to start over again. And it messed up his plans. Bravo was not participating in basic training for the January cycle, meaning that its drill sergeants would essentially have nine weeks off. Sergeant Williams had enrolled in a college course for the break. Now he would have to withdraw and work another basic training cycle with Echo.
Why the transfer? Sergeant Williams saw the reason, again, as racial. To him and his black colleagues, the battalion's white hierarchy could not tolerate one of its four companies' being run by black sergeants. One had to go.
Sergeant Williams and the other black sergeants say they had a premonition of this during a ceremony in November to replace the company commander. As the battalion commander and the battalion command sergeant major looked out on the parade ground and saw a black sergeant standing in front of each platoon and a black first sergeant in front of the entire company, you could see the shock in the officers' eyes, the sergeants said.
Not so, said Col. Mark Armstrong, the battalion commander, and Sgt. Maj. Franklin Ashe. They had barely taken notice of the company's racial makeup, they said.
"This blows me away that they would have these perceptions, because the thought never crossed my mind," Sergeant Major Ashe said.
Two days before the December graduation, Sergeants Feyer and Williams sat brooding in their office along with Sgt. First Class Mike Martin, the replacement, who is white. Sergeant Williams was angry about his impending transfer. Sergeant Feyer was still upset about having been denied the drill sergeant's award. He was speculating about who might or might not have voted for him. Sergeant Williams, who had voted against his partner, sat in silence.
 
'It's Too Late'
The winter graduation, minus Sergeant Feyer, was over. Friends and relatives were mingling in the barracks, congratulating the recruits. Several parents dropped by Sergeant Williams's office to shake his hand for molding their strapping young men into soldiers. But as the minutes ticked by, Sergeant Williams grew impatient. He wanted to hurry up and move his things into Echo. He was supposed to meet Sergeants Boler and Reed for beers. Sergeant Feyer was going golfing with Sergeant Hanson.
Walking outside the barracks, Sergeant Williams mentioned an overture he had received that morning. "Harry said to me at breakfast: 'You live only 200 yards away, and you've never been over my house and I've never been over your house. Why don't we try to get together?' "
He said he would consider it. "But I kind of feel like, what's the point? It's too late.
"It's like, 'Let's patch things up.' But there's really nothing to patch up."
He enlisted a number of privates to help him take his gear over to Echo. They loaded up a truck, drove it across the parade ground and lugged the stuff up two flights of stairs. Sergeant Williams hung his fatigues in a locker and tossed some equipment onto an unmade bunk.
From down the hall he could hear music drifting out of the office he would share with his new partner. It was gospel music, the sound of a choir. Sergeant Williams didn't care for gospel; he was a rhythm-and-blues man. But it didn't seem to bother him. He had met his new battle buddy, Mordecial Hale, who was 35, 6 feet 5 and black.
So will it be better, Sergeant Williams was asked, having a brother as a partner?
"Without a doubt," he replied. "Without a doubt."

Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race still ignites political debates -- over Civil War flags, for example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of race relations seems muted by a full-employment economy and by a sense, particularly among many whites, that the time of large social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports arenas, in pop culture and at worship, and especially in the workplace. These encounters -- race relations in the most literal, everyday sense -- make up this series of reports, the outcome of a yearlong examination by a team of Times reporters.
 
The articles in this series can also be read at The New York Times on the Web. The site offers forums in which visitors can discuss the articles and the racial issues in their own lives and respond to a questionnaire. Photo essays, video and audio presentations -- including comments by people from around the nation -- and lesson plans from The Learning Network are also available:

HEADLINE: NATIONAL ORIGINS: SOUTH FLORIDA;
The Backyard to the World

BYLINE: By STEVEN RAICHLEN 

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., June 6

 BODY:
Florida mango season begins right now, and for mango lovers, even with the descent of inescapable heat and thick humidity, these are times of happy anticipation. Each month brings a new variety: the peach-flavored Van Dyke in mid-June; the luscious Kent in July; the huge, creamy Keitt in August.
It used to be the best time of year for Frank Mitchell, too. He comes from a family that farmed 350 acres of mangoes during the 1970's, the glory days of the Florida mango. The Mitchell empire stretched over 20 miles, from the outskirts of Miami to the heart of Homestead. There were groves next to suburban subdivisions, and groves planted right beside the wilds of the Everglades. 
 But today, all that remains is a single five-acre orchard. We clambered into Mr. Mitchell's pickup truck and drove to his last grove to understand why growing mangoes has become such a difficult proposition in the place that gave the industry its birth. Ninety-nine percent of the mangoes in American supermarkets are imported from South America and the Caribbean -- but they are all varieties developed here in South Florida.
The groves left -- eight acres here, 20 acres there -- provide the mangoes I buy two for a dollar at roadside stands and farmers markets. Occasionally, Florida mangoes will be shipped up the East Coast as far as New York. If you can find them, they're well worth purchasing; Florida mangoes will be immediately recognizable by their sheer heft and uncommon succulence.
The groves have been quietly disappearing for 10 years. Foreign competition made the crop less profitable, and growers began selling their land to developers. Then Hurricane Andrew decimated the groves in 1992, and almost no one replanted mangoes.
"Florida growers just can't afford to compete with the growers from Latin American," said Eddie Caram, the director of purchased fruit for Florida's largest exotic fruit purveyor, Brooks Tropicals, in Homestead.
"You do the math," Mr. Mitchell said. "Mexican mangoes sell for $2.50 a flat. We have to get $3.50 to $4 just to break even."
Mr. Mitchell's father, Edward, started planting mangoes in this farming community near Miami in the early 1950's. At an annual meeting of the Mango Forum, where amateur horticulturists could show off prize mangos from their backyards, he took a liking to a juicy, bright red mango grown by a man named Tommy Atkins. He bought the tree and rights to the name and set about commercializing it. Today, the Tommy Atkins is the best-selling variety in the Western Hemisphere.
Homestead is the center of the Florida tropical fruit industry. It is 45 minutes south of Miami, but it could be another country. Roads as straight as a rifle shot lead past endless miles of lime and avocado groves, palm trees, and landscaping nurseries, the backbone of the local economy. The land is as flat as an ironing board, and the sun burns down like a blowtorch.
By all rights, there shouldn't be farming here at all, because just beneath the soil is a hard shelf of limestone. To plant trees, growers must first plow the limestone or grind it up, using fertilizers to provide the nutrients. One grower I know likens farming here to hydroponic growing. Mr. Mitchell says he doesn't mind the poverty of the soil.
"It lets us control the mango's diet," he said. He also appreciates the hot sun and the abundant rainfall. What he doesn't like is the humidity. Mangoes grown in South Florida are susceptible to a spotty black mold called anthracnose. "Half of the expense of growing mangoes goes into the fungicides sprayed weekly to keep this pest under control," Mr. Mitchell said.
The mango is a handsome tree with long, slender leaves that droop with dapper elegance. The trees flower from January through March and set fruit about a month after. A baby mango looks like a tiny green kidney bean and grows from a long stem called a panicle that hangs vertically from the branch. It takes about five years for a mango tree to fruit, and eight to 10 years for it to become productive enough to pay for the cost of growing it. Each year, a tree produces five or six bushels (50 to 60 fruits a bushel), although some produce as many as 20 bushels. Mr. Mitchell's little grove will yield 1,500 bushels.
In the 1970's, the Mitchells employed 150 workers -- 100 in the fields and 50 in the packing house. Trucks loaded with mangoes would rumble in hourly to a packing plant south of Miami. They shipped 120,000 pounds of fruit a day across the United States and Canada. The company exported mangoes to Europe and as far as Australia.
JUST about everything has changed since then. Now, the pickers are contract workers. The men who arrived for work at Mitchell's grove at about 7:30 one morning last week came from Mexico and Honduras, Guatemala and Haiti. Armed with bright plastic baskets and pole pickers (blue aluminum pool poles crowned with an inverted V-shaped cutter and a nylon bag), they invaded the grove, gathering the low lying fruit by hand, and used the poles to reach higher branches.
To use a picker pole, you position the cutter above the fruit and gently pull down: the blade severs the panicle, and the mango falls into the bag. When the bag is full, you lower the pole and transfer the mangoes to the bucket. It looks easy, but your shoulders will ache after 20 minutes. You can only imagine what it feels like to pick mangoes for 10 hours straight.
It doesn't take long for the men to fill the 30-pound buckets -- 30 seconds, maybe a minute for hand-picked fruit, five minutes using the pole. The buckets are dumped into 20-bushel wooden bins arranged on the back of a flatbed truck. When the bins are full, they're driven to Mitchell's processing center, where they'll be washed with a high pressure water hose, then sold in bulk.
The pickers are paid $2.50 a bushel (55 pounds), and a good picker can pick 2,000 to 3,000 pounds a day. It's hard work, lasting until 4:30 or 5 p.m., and when it's over, a picker will walk away with about $100.
Mr. Mitchell's seasoned hand can tell how many days a particular fruit has until it's ready for harvest. "You don't go by color; you look at this," he said, pointing to a sort of dimple in the back of the mango. "When it's filled out, the mango is ready."
The harvest lasts only three months, but growing mangoes is a year-round endeavor. After the harvest, the trees must be topped, using a device that looks like a giant whirligig, and pruned, with what appears to be large mechanized hedge shears. Next come fertilizing, nutritional sprays and weed killing. Special care is taken to eliminate the live-forevers, a vigorous vine that can strangle a tree.
Mangoes have been cultivated in Asia for thousands of years. But Florida has proved an extraordinary breeding ground. The Asian and Indian varieties brought here by early horticulturists like David Fairchild and Captain Haden cross-pollinated and flourished in the area between the Atlantic and the Everglades. Hundreds of new cultivars developed here that were far superior to their Asian and Indian parents.
From the 1950's to the 1970's, Florida provided the rest of the country -- especially New York -- with the bulk of its mangoes. But the very success of the Florida mango led to its demise.
Demand for mangoes exploded in the 1980's, as Americans developed a passion for the fruit. In 1988, 92 million pounds were sold in the United States. Ten years later, the number had skyrocketed to 412 million pounds, said Kelly Barton, the marketing director for The Packer, an industry newsletter. To meet the demand, growers from Mexico and Central America started coming to South Florida to learn how to grow mangoes more efficiently and to purchase the popular Florida trees.
It turned out the mangoes thrive in the warm climate of western Mexico, Central America, Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. What's more, these regions are less humid than South Florida, so the mangoes need less of the costly fungicide. And labor is a fraction of the cost.
The industry was already shrinking when Hurricane Andrew roared through in 1992, destroying half the area's mango groves. But the real death knell, Mr. Mitchell and other growers say, was sounded by the passing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, which removed tariffs on imported fruit. Florida growers simply couldn't compete.
SOUTH FLORIDA is one of the few places in the United States where you can grow mangoes -- a fact appreciated by David Fairchild, who founded the United States Agriculture Department's Office of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction in 1898. Mr. Fairchild traveled the world looking for new tropical fruits for the United States, introducing thousands of plant varieties, including hundreds of mangoes.
Today, Fairchild Tropical Garden has the most diverse mango collection in the world, with more than 180 varieties. Strolling the garden's genetic bank, a rolling three-and-a-half-acre orchard in southern Miami, you'll find Turpentine mangoes from the Caribbean, Naomi mangoes from Israel, Cambodiana mangoes from the Philippines and Ivory mangoes from Thailand. When growers from Florida, Mexico or South Africa need information on mangoes or cuttings, this is where they come.
Presiding over these remarkable holdings is Dr. Richard Campbell, a young horticulturist with an endless enthusiasm for mangoes. He wrote one of the definitive guides to mango varieties, "Mangos: A Guide to Mangos in Florida," published in 1992 and available by mail from Fairchild Tropical Garden (10901 Old Cutler Road, Miami, Fla. 33156), when he was only 28. Today, he spends eight weeks a year roaming the world to collect exotic fruit trees. He probably knows more about mangoes than anyone else in the world. One of Dr. Campbell's missions is to collect information on the world's mangoes -- how they grow, look and taste and how to improve them. His 120-item mango evaluation sheet looks like something at a wine tasting.
Dr. Campbell also works on new varieties. He is developing a dwarf mango tree that will bear almost as much fruit as a full-size adult.
"This is the future of the mango in Florida," he said, pointing proudly to a tree that's about as tall as I am, its branches pendulous with large purple fruit. "They're small enough to fit in your backyard."
 Back at Mr. Mitchell's office, he pulled out a pocketknife and sliced into some mangoes he had arranged on a table for me to taste. There were sweet, creamy Glenns, aromatic Hadens and pungent Tommy Atkins. The first thing that struck me was just how explosively flavorful these mangoes were. More flavorful than ripe Georgia peaches or golden pineapples. More flavorful than just about any fruit I had tasted.
Next, it struck me how sad it is that people outside my home state won't be able to taste this extraordinary fruit. I'm not worried that the Florida mango will disappear in my lifetime -- we Floridians love our mangoes too much for that. But it is a shame that it will be a wonder confined to my own backyard.

HEADLINE: When Companies Leave Manhattan

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Chase Manhattan Bank's announced move from lower Manhattan to the New Jersey waterfront (news article, June 2) is another dismaying example of the Giuliani administration's failure to keep valuable corporate jobs in New York City.
You accurately note that alternative, and less expensive, corporate space is still available in Brooklyn and the other boroughs, yet the mayor and his Economic Development Corporation have consistently failed to support and promote these alternatives. 
 Instead, the administration has chosen to spend more than $150 million to construct minor league baseball stadiums that will generate a handful of low-wage, part-time jobs. Had the administration chosen to spend this money on targeted corporate retention efforts, Chase, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch might now be moving their high-wage jobs to a reinvigorated Brooklyn rather than across the river.

HEADLINE: Surge in Worker Productivity Is Recordedfor First Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
Worker productivity grew in the first quarter at the fastest pace in seven years, helping businesses contain labor costs and keeping inflation in check, government figures showed today.
Productivity, a measure of how much workers produce for every hour on the job, was 3.7 percent higher in the first quarter compared with figures in the corresponding period a year earlier, the Labor Department said. That was the largest year-over-year increase since a 4.2 percent gain in the final three months of 1992. 
 "One of the key reasons the economy has been able to grow so vigorously with relatively low inflation for the last few years is the remarkable surge in productivity," Robert Parry, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, said in a speech today.
Gains in productivity let companies hold down their labor expenses -- which account for two-thirds the cost of doing business -- and avoid raising prices for goods and services. Labor costs in the first quarter grew at the slowest pace in almost four years, the report showed.
Unit labor costs rose 0.6 percent from those in the quarter a year earlier. That matched the fourth-quarter's year-over-year pace and was the smallest since a gain of 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 1996. When compared with figures in the fourth quarter of last year, labor costs increased at a 1.6 percent annual rate.
Compared with the fourth quarter, productivity increased at a 2.4 percent rate in the first three months of the year. That came after quarterly increases of 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 5 percent in the third, the best three-quarter performance since the end of 1983. Productivity has been accelerating since mid-1997, when it was growing at a 1.2 percent rate year over year.
The smaller quarterly productivity gain in the first quarter resulted from companies' increasing production at a slower pace and asking their employees to work longer hours than in the final three months of last year, the government said.
Federal Reserve policy makers have repeatedly cited gains in productivity for allowing the economy to expand more rapidly than once thought possible without touching off increases in inflation. Central bankers may take solace in the productivity report and other recent statistics that show the economy is starting to cool, analysts said.
A separate report today showed sales at wholesalers slowed in April, while inventories grew. Wholesale sales rose 0.3 percent in April after a 1 percent increase in March, the Commerce Department said. Inventories grew 0.8 percent in April, faster than the 0.6 percent rise in March. Together, the numbers suggest that demand at the wholesale level has started to slow.

HEADLINE: Women's Global Views Examined by Survey

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 6

 BODY:
American women are more likely than men to frame their foreign policy concerns around global social issues like health, poverty and human rights, a new poll has found. The independent survey was released this week to coincide with a special General Assembly session on the progress of the world's women.
These interests, the survey found, make women marginally stronger supporters of diplomacy and cooperation in international organizations, while men are more likely to favor military solutions or put a higher priority on trade. 
 "What this poll tells us is that American women understand that the well-being of themselves, their families and communities are increasingly intimately connected with the well-being and stability of other countries," said Joan Dunlop, a fellow at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and director of the Women's Lens on Global Issues project at the Aspen Institute, the policy research group that commissioned the survey.
The poll, conducted by Belden Russonello & Stewart, surveyed 1,500 women and 701 men and has an overall margin of error of 2.2 percentage points.
The world has come closer to home, Ms. Dunlop said in an interview today, and that is reflected in women's attitudes.
"You sit down and eat food from other countries," she said. "Your kid at school gets inoculated for TB because a refugee from Kosovo is infected. Your husband comes home and worries about his job being moved to Mexico."
A debate over whether women have different attitudes toward issues of war, peace and economic development has been going on for years in women's organizations, whose leaders have often been reluctant to characterize any set of ideas as a woman's view.
Women in government and foreign-policy making have very mixed records that fit no pattern, they say.
Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi of India and Margaret Thatcher of Britain have waged successful wars, for example. Meanwhile, Ms. Dunlop says she is often asked why the many women who have served as political leaders in South Asia have not alleviated the region's poverty or raised the status of its women.
"I don't believe feminism is gender-specific," said Ms. Dunlop, the founder and past president of the International Women's Health Coalition, which supports medical services for women in developing countries. "We're talking about a set of values."
As new threats to American life have replaced cold war fears about nuclear war, many issues once considered "women's issues" have moved to the center of national security, and men often line up with women in giving them emphasis.
Epidemic disease ranks high on this list, said Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, who has been leading the United States delegation here at the special Assembly session, called to measure progress on women's rights since the Fourth International Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995.
"Foreign policy requires a new conceptualization," Ms. Shalala said in an interview today. "It is no longer as narrow as defined by the literature as well as by the foreign policy professionals -- and they're resisting. When we said that AIDS was an international security issue, they went crazy. And it's not just AIDS. It's malaria, it's tuberculosis.
"Infectious diseases destabilize economies. They shift resources. They take the public health infrastructure apart. The world has changed out there. If we look at markets, there's not going to be a market if you knock down a generation between 25 and 35."
Ms. Shalala said that she now had a senior public health official attached to the National Security Council, and that another is a high-ranking aide in the State Department.
In the Aspen poll, 69 percent of the women sampled said global problems made it necessary for the United States to work closely with international organizations like the United Nations. Thirty-nine percent of the women said they wanted greater attention to foreign affairs by the government.
Women consistently put a higher priority than the men questioned in the survey on international programs to prevent childhood diseases, promote equal education for girls, make birth control available and promote fair labor practices.
When asked what kind of countries should get the most United States support, 35 percent of the women said poor countries, followed by nations important to American security next, at 34 percent, and trading partners third, at 26 percent. The men gave first ranking to nations important to security (37 percent) and those that are trading partners (34 percent), with poor poor countries trailing at 25 percent.
Sixty-seven percent of the women, compared with 56 percent of the men, said the most important reason for international involvement was responsibility to future generations. Protecting the world's environment was considered important to women.
But men and women shared some very similar views on America's role in the world: just over half of each group polled said the United States should be a "good neighbor" to other nations. Only 4 percent of women and 5 percent of men want to see Americans be global policemen.
Ms. Dunlop said results like these would indicate that foreign policy views held by men may not be as fundamentally at variance with those of women as other questions or other polls generally indicate.
"Women and men share the same vision of what they want the U.S. to be as a global citizen," she said. "The differences between women and men are not significant. What is different is the level of intensity."

A Rent Affair

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Economists who have ventured into the alleged real world often quote Princeton's Alan Blinder, who has formulated what he calls "Murphy's Law of economic policy": "Economists have the least influence on policy where they know the most and are most agreed; they have the most influence on policy where they know the least and disagree most vehemently." It's flip and cynical, but it's true.
Consider, on one side, really tough issues -- where there are plausible arguments on both sides, where nobody really knows how to measure the tradeoffs. Should Microsoft be broken up and, if so, how? Should Britain adopt the euro? Let's ask the economists! And those economists who are prepared to express strong opinions on such inherently ambiguous questions command rapt attention. 
 On the other side, consider an article that appeared in yesterday's New York Times, "In San Francisco, Renters Are Supplicants." It was an interesting piece, with its tales of would-be renters spending months pounding the pavements, of dozens of desperate applicants arriving at a newly offered apartment, trying to impress the landlord with their credentials. And yet there was something crucial missing -- specifically, two words I knew had to be part of the story.
Not that I have any special knowledge about San Francisco's housing market -- in fact, as of yesterday morning I didn't know a thing about it. But it was immediately obvious from the story what was going on. To an economist, or for that matter a freshman who has taken Economics 101, everything about that story fairly screamed those two words -- which are, of course, "rent control."
After all, the sort of landlord behavior described in the article -- demanding that prospective tenants supply resumes and credit reports, that they dress nicely and act enthusiastic -- doesn't happen in uncontrolled housing markets. Landlords don't want groveling -- they would rather have money. In uncontrolled markets the question of who gets an apartment is settled quickly by the question of who is able and willing to pay the most. And so I had no doubts about what I would find after a bit of checking -- namely, that San Francisco is a city where a technology-fueled housing boom has collided with a draconian rent-control law.
The analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and -- among economists, anyway -- one of the least controversial. In 1992 a poll of the American Economic Association found 93 percent of its members agreeing that "a ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing." Almost every freshman-level textbook contains a case study on rent control, using its known adverse side effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand. Sky-high rents on uncontrolled apartments, because desperate renters have nowhere to go -- and the absence of new apartment construction, despite those high rents, because landlords fear that controls will be extended? Predictable. Bitter relations between tenants and landlords, with an arms race between ever-more ingenious strategies to force tenants out -- what yesterday's article oddly described as "free-market horror stories" -- and constantly proliferating regulations designed to block those strategies? Predictable.
And as for the way rent control sets people against one another -- the executive director of San Francisco's Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Board has remarked that "there doesn't seem to be anyone in this town who can trust anyone else in this town, including their own grandparents" -- that's predictable, too.
None of this says that ending rent control is an easy decision. Still, surely it is worth knowing that the pathologies of San Francisco's housing market are right out of the textbook, that they are exactly what supply-and-demand analysis predicts.
But people literally don't want to know. A few months ago, when a San Francisco official proposed a study of the city's housing crisis, there was a firestorm of opposition from tenant-advocacy groups. They argued that even to study the situation was a step on the road to ending rent control -- and they may well have been right, because studying the issue might lead to a recognition of the obvious.
So now you know why economists are useless: when they actually do understand something, people don't want to hear about it.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Share Prices Fall, Pausing After Last Week's Big Spurt

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks closed mostly lower yesterday as investors took some profits after three consecutive strong sessions. Banking and retail issues fell as investors realized that an economic slowdown may keep inflation at bay, but will also hurt certain business sectors.
Many stocks drifted between gains and losses as investors remained sidelined, awaiting a new catalyst. 
 "I don't know that you can make a whole lot out of the market's activity until the next time we have some concrete news to trade off of," said Charles White, president and portfolio manager at Avatar Associates in New York. "There's nothing definitive or compelling right now that's going to give the market direction."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 79.73 points, or 0.74 percent, to 10,735.57. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.79 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,457.84, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 65.39 points, or 1.71 percent, to 3,756.37.
Stocks had risen in the last three sessions on investors' hopes that the economy had slowed enough to keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates any further. But yesterday, investors changed strategy, selling stocks that are seen as vulnerable to economic slowdowns.
J. P. Morgan contributed most to the Dow's decline. A Merrill Lynch analyst, Judah Kraushaar, told clients that periods of rising interest rates had typically been bad for investment banking revenue.
Also, shares of many prominent retailers fell as investors reasoned that signs of a slowdown in consumer spending could mean retailers will see revenue and profits slide. Circuit City shares plunged after the company said that sales were flat in May.
Analysts said Circuit City's warning convinced investors that other retailers would also struggle in coming months. Wal-Mart was among the decliners.
For the most part, analysts said investors appeared to be regrouping after sharp gains last week. The Nasdaq, which had been battered in March and April, soared a record-breaking 19 percent last week as investors flocked back to the technology stocks that dominate its ranks. The Dow, which had not suffered as badly, rose 4.8 percent last week.
"The market's doing extremely well after last week's screamer, which set us up for a little profit-taking," said Ralph Bloch, chief market analyst at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
Yet while some investors were cashing in stocks to capture gains, more stocks rose than fell over all for much of the session.
"There's some good underlying strength," Mr. Bloch said. "That's the sign of a market engaging in a healthy pause."
Stocks that fell prey to profit takers included Sun Microsystems, which declined 4 5/16 , to 83 7/8.
But a broad range of technology stocks advanced. Microsoft rose 2 3/4, to 69 5/8; Qualcomm jumped 1 5/8, to 68 7/8; and Healtheon/Web MD increased 15/16 , to 20 1/16 .
Trading volume remained fairly low as investors opted to wait for more information on the strength of the economy before taking significant new positions. The next potentially market-moving report will reach traders on Friday, when the Labor Department releases the Producer Price Index.
A benign report could propel the market higher, Mr. White said.
"There's a boatload of cash on the sidelines," he said. "More evidence of a slowdown could be material for a very strong summer rally."

Treasury Prices Stable
 By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond yields held near six-week lows as some investors questioned whether the economy had slowed enough to justify the last month's rally, and opted instead for nongovernment debt.
"There is concern yields cannot fall much lower," now that they are at or below the 6.5 percent level of the Fed's overnight lending target, said Kenneth Hackel, chief United States fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "The next move is to buy" non-Treasury securities, which offer more value, he said.
The yield on the 10-year note was unchanged at 6.12 percent. The note's price barely rose, gaining 1/32 , to 102 24/32 .
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 6/32 , to 104 27/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.90 percent from 5.92 percent on Monday.

As Term Winds Down, Nostalgia Envelops Clinton

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
When President Clinton greeted the staff of the American Embassy in Lisbon last Thursday evening, he confessed that he had fallen in love with fado, the melancholic Portuguese music with words that yearn for a past that never was and may never be again.
"I'm going to promote fado music all over the world!" Mr. Clinton exclaimed, adding, "I think fado now has become my major passion in life." 
 Like the music he has warmly embraced, Mr. Clinton's eight-day trip to Europe was filled with a sense of a what was and what might have been.
He has nearly eight months left in his presidency, but the trip had a decidedly nostalgic air, as if much unfinished business will be left that way and as if parts of his presidency were already over.
Mr. Clinton has begun to talk in the past tense. "I thought it was important for me to travel the world and for us to try to make a better future out of the post-Communist, post-cold-war world," he told the embassy staff. "So I've had the opportunity to see many things."
By contrast, when Ronald Reagan was at the same point of his presidency, he took a different tack. Asked at his last economic summit meeting in June 1988 whether he had received a "farewell hug" at his final meeting with his colleagues, Mr. Reagan replied, "I'm not saying farewell. I'm going to lunch."
Mr. Clinton went out of his way to visit two "formers" with whom he had close relations: former Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and former President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. Even more telling, he has begun to have fun.
"Something is happening," he said. "As I move toward the end of my term, my staff has relaxed its requirement that I actually suffer a physical breakdown on every trip from work. I actually got time to play golf." (Five hours of it, to be precise.)
But he drew the line one evening after dinner with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder at an Alsatian restaurant in East Berlin.
"I am holding one of Fidel's cigars in my hand that I would like to give to you," Mr. Schroder said naughtily, handing Mr. Clinton a Cuban cigar. Mr. Clinton politely declined.
 
Every Party Has a Pooper
In Moscow, Mr. Clinton succeeded in getting President Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. colonel, to open up -- but only ever so slightly. After the working dinner at the Russian president's residence on the first evening, Mr. Clinton asked to see the Russian equivalent of the Oval Office. The office was too far away, so Mr. Putin showed Mr. Clinton his private study, his exercise room (complete with a massage table) and his small chapel.
As for gifts, Mr. Putin gave Mr. Clinton an antique silver samovar, and Mr. Putin got a millennium medallion from Tiffany's and a Smithsonian book on aviation.
During their intense series of talks, Mr. Putin was determined not to let Mr. Clinton dominate the conversation and spoke more than Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Putin also went on the offensive. When Mr. Clinton raised the structural reforms Russia needed to make to attract investment, for example, Mr. Putin said that his side had some demands too, raising much smaller issues like the need to amend a bilateral investment treaty.
"A very serious interlocutor," is how Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright described him in a phone conversation from Jerusalem.
A fourth administration official said that the talks were so serious, blunt and humorless that Mr. Clinton felt compelled to carry that mood forward in his news conference.
"The president is a naturally warm guy," said the official. "There were no warm feelings to project."
Mr. Putin is so serious that when a jazz combo of pre-teenagers played during a performance in Mr. Clinton's honor, a delighted Mr. Clinton moved to the music; Mr. Putin sat ramrod straight in his chair.
 
Pointed Fashion Statement
There is much talk in Washington these days that the State Department has ceded control of a number of foreign policy issues to Samuel R. Berger, the president's national security adviser.
But the summit in Moscow illustrated that, when it comes to Russia, the State Department is in command. For the first two working meetings between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin each president brought along only one aide.
Mr. Putin brought Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to the working dinner on Saturday evening and Sergey Prikhodko, Mr. Putin's chief foreign policy adviser, to the first meeting on Sunday. Mr. Clinton brought Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, a Russia expert and Mr. Clinton's housemate from his Oxford days, to both. As has happened in the past, Mr. Berger and Dr. Albright and other senior officials were not invited.
But Dr. Albright used a fashion statement to make her own policy point with the Russians. As Mr. Putin shook Dr. Albright's hand before a meeting on Sunday, Mr. Clinton tried to explain the meaning of the three brown pins depicting monkeys on the lapel of her jacket. They represent, "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil," Mr. Clinton said. "That's Madeleine's entire foreign policy."
Mr. Putin replied, "I always see what kind of a brooch she's wearing." Dr. Albright often uses her jewelry to reflect her policy priorities.
But it is unclear whether the Russians got her real message, and Dr. Albright said that she wore the pins not to characterize American foreign policy but Russia's prosecution of the war in Chechnya. "I've been telling the Russians since it started that they have been in denial about what is going on in Chechnya, that they need to solve this politically, not militarily," Dr. Albright said in the telephone conversation. "They're not seeing what is going on. I wore those pins because it is the epitome of the way they are in denial."
A White House official called Mr. Clinton's remark about the pin "a joke."

Separating Fact and Theory

BYLINE: By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
INCREASINGLY, believers in biblical literalism say schools should teach both evolution and creation. As the Tangipahoa (Louisiana) school board said in its "creation science" policy (overturned last year in federal court), students should "exercise critical thinking and gather all information possible and closely examine each alternative toward forming an opinion."
John Walker, a pastor sponsoring a charter school soon to open in Rochester, says, "Like with all theories, we say, 'Examine the evidence and decide.' " 
 And the Oklahoma textbook commission proposed placing a note in texts, "No one was present when life first appeared. . . . Therefore, any statement about life's origins should be considered as a theory, not fact."
This is reasonable. We should adopt the creationists' approach. If we dismiss claims that evolution is only theory, it shows how poorly we learned science in school.
In science, facts are only what we observe. Laws describe patterns of facts, theories explain the patterns. There can always be alternative explanations, but the best laws unify available facts in the simplest ways, leave the fewest possible facts unaccounted for and do not require assumptions of unobserved phenomena.
Many common "facts" are actually theories. Is it fact that the earth is nearly a sphere? Until astronauts saw the globe, it was only theory, the simplest explanation for facts like the ability of world travelers to arrive where they began, without reversing course.
There could be other theories -- the earth could be flat, with invisible forces transporting travelers backward. But this would not be the simplest explanation. It requires facts not observable (invisible forces) and does not account for other facts (like tides) that we can see.
Yet children might usefully be taught to make up their own minds if the earth is flat. Students could list facts needing explanation, and explore alternative theories to organize them.
In science, laws and theories are revised when new facts become known. Evidence was recently reported challenging an accepted theory (popularly thought of as fact) that high-fiber diets protect against colon cancer. If data continue to support this challenge, the theory will be discarded because, like evolution, it was "only a theory" in the first place.
Evolution is science's simplest explanation for observations of fossils and genetic structure. It can accommodate new facts -- like the recent find of a dinosaur heart that may lead scientists to revise their understanding of bird evolution. The revision should be the simplest explanation for newly discovered facts.
Adults do not need to know details about evolution, like whether Australopithecus preceded Homo habilis. But with good science education, all would appreciate that evolutionary theory is based on gathering evidence, recording, categorizing and summarizing data.
Good science teachers emphasize empirical investigation. Sophisticated lessons are those in which, for example, teachers guide fourth graders who try to figure out why some toys float better in salt water, or bicycles rust in the rain. These teachers show children how to record observations, develop hypotheses, test them and revise them as new data are added.
This differs from typical teaching, in which students do (or watch) "experiments" that yield expected results. In truth, these are not really experiments which, by definition, manipulate phenomena when results are unknown in advance.
Of course, science study must include memorization of many theories for which children cannot gather much data. Classrooms cannot reproduce all of Isaac Newton's observations that led to theories of motion, or of Copernicus's observations that suggested a sun-centered planetary system. But a danger is that in learning settled theories, children leave school believing them to be facts.
Older students should learn that, like religion, scientific rationalism is also a belief system -- a belief that testable and simpler explanations are always preferable. Otherwise, graduates will fail to appreciate how scientific method depends on empirical observation.
Paradoxically, fundamentalists opposed to having children make up their own minds about history, math and literature issues have seemingly endorsed a scientific spirit of inquiry for the origins of species. Schools should take them up on it, and endorse teaching students to form opinions about which creation theory more economically organizes data.
There may be an unexpected benefit from creationists' attempts to bring Bible stories into classrooms. If religious conservatives become converts to teaching critical thinking, examining evidence and entertaining alternative perspectives, they will have lessons to teach us all.

HEADLINE: Chartered Wings: Less Time Going, More Time There;
Growing Numbers of Travelers Bypass the Scheduled Airlines

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
Americans are flying more in this booming economy, but also griping more: about longer lines at airports, longer takeoff delays and tighter limits on carry-on bags. Not to mention the perennial beef about how long it takes just to get to the airport.
But growing numbers of travelers, particularly in the New York region, are doing more than complaining about tiring business flights or arduous vacation travel. They are bypassing regularly scheduled airlines altogether and finding alternative wings on charter flights or in part ownership of small jets. 
 For companies that do not own their own planes, charter flights and so-called fractional ownership of aircraft permit executives to make more efficient use of their traveling time, conducting in-flight meetings and often traveling to small, less-crowded airports much closer to their destinations.
The appeal is particularly great at a time when travel budgets are fat and a charter seat, in some cases, costs only marginally more than a first-class or business-class ticket on a scheduled airline.
And while figures vary on the increase in chartering, estimates from industry specialists and individual charter companies suggest a growth range in the last year from 7 percent over all to several times that for some individual operators. This growth comes even as scheduled carriers have reported a 37 percent rise in passengers over the last decade.
"We're at the epicenter of the charter world," said Carole Helms, vice president for marketing at TAG Aviation, a major charter company whose half-dozen bases in the region include Westchester County Airport in Harrison, N.Y., and Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, not far from Manhattan.
New York's investment banking houses and companies making initial public stock offerings are "great users of charter," she said, adding that business is also brisk in California's Silicon Valley, where software and dot-com denizens are also big on buzzing about in "air taxis," as charters are called in the airline industry.
Ms. Helms and others in the business say that while most charter flights and partial plane ownerships involve business travel, a growing number are for personal travel.
One such traveler is James W. Kinnear, the retired president and chief executive of Texaco and now the chairman of the Metropolitan Opera.
When he and his wife journey once or twice a month from their home in Connecticut to their farm in southern Virginia, they do not drive for an hour to La Guardia Airport, check in themselves, their baggage and their three dogs an hour before the 90-minute flight and arrive at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, the nearest to their farm that the airliners from New York land.
Instead, they drive just 20 minutes to the Westchester County Airport and immediately board a sleek, seven-passenger Cessna Citation light jet that carries them to an airfield closer to the farm.
"It adds up to three hours door to door," Mr. Kinnear said in a recent interview, two hours less than the trip by scheduled carrier, and without the worry about the dogs' riding in a cargo hold. Harnessed securely and sleeping on the floor, they, too, ride in the cabin of the Cessna, in which Mr. Kinnear has a one-eighth share, or fractional ownership.
Such arrangements were pioneered in the 1980's by the company that sold him his share, Executive Jet Inc., of Woodbridge, N.J., but most of the growth in such ownership has come in the last three or four years.
Then there is Bill Rosenthal, the president of KaplanCollege.com, an online school that offers courses for career advancement. He flies two or three times a week on business, using scheduled airlines, usually riding in coach class. But recently, he had his first chew of charter flying, and the taste was great, he said of the single-day trip between his New York base and Atlanta.
He said it emphasized for him two big advantages of chartering: more time for work in the city he was visiting and less time getting there and back.
"I knew I could be with my customer till the last minute," Mr. Rosenthal said, noting that he did not have to arrive at the airport 45 minutes before his flight's departure and had a quicker drive to the charter plane's field. No less satisfying was the fact that the time saved in ground travel and airport waiting totaled three hours round trip.
But Mr. Rosenthal also said that despite these advantages, he did not know whether charter flying could be more than a rarity in his regimen. He did it on the Atlanta trip, he said, because he found a bargain $998 round trip being offered at the time by a new company that is seeking to build an Internet business arranging individual seats on charter flights.
The fare, which was being offered by flightserv.com to attract customers, brought the cost close to that for a business-class ticket on a trip arranged on short notice on an airline, Mr. Rosenthal said.
He said that in working for a business on a tight budget, he would fly charter again "in a heartbeat" if the price were within 10 or 15 percent of an airline's fare for the same trip, but "above 15 percent, I'd have to give it a a lot of thought, and over 25, 30 percent, I can't justify it."
While hard-and-fast figures on charter flying are difficult to come by -- the Federal Aviation Administration lumps charter flights with commuter airline flights -- charter operators and those who follow the business say chartering in the United States has been on the upswing in the last few years.
"It's grown about 7 percent in revenues and flights in the last year or so," said Fred Gevalt, publisher of the Air Charter Guide, a listing of charter operators and their planes and prices. He said charter flying in the country had shown no growth for years before that.
Susan Bopp, the owner of Air Charters Inc., a six-plane fleet based at Teterboro Airport, said that after being down earlier in the 1990's, her business was "about 20 percent up over two years ago."
Ms. Helms of TAG Aviation, whose Geneva-based international operations include nearly 150 planes in the United States, said that the company's business in this country had not been caught in any downdrafts over the last decade, its charter hours flown having steadily risen.
Clifton Stroud, a spokesman for the National Air Transportation Association, which represents hundreds of the approximately 3,000 charter companies that he estimates exist in the country, said that many manufacturing companies with plants far from big airports found it "more direct and efficient" to charter flights for visiting executives than to have them connect to commuter flights or drive from the big airfields.
Mr. Gevalt said that while chartering "has been typically 80 to 85 percent business trips," personal-travel charters were becoming more visible. "It's a lot easier to see people get off with golf clubs, skis and a couple of kids and the family dog, more so than in the past," he said.
Ms. Helms said that personal travel had gone from 10 to 25 percent of TAG Aviation's charters in the last decade.
Generalizing about the comparative costs of chartering and using airlines is difficult because of a number of variables: the differing aircraft and prices charter companies offer, the size of charter groups, which affect the cost per person, and the airlines' intricate fare schedules.
Mr. Gevalt, for example, said a typical business trip -- "out and back in a day, two and a half hours flying each way" -- could cost $1,200 to $1,500 an hour for craft and crew, or $6,000 to $7,500 for the day.
With a group of five, that would be $1,200 to $1,500 a person, which he said was not far from what they might pay on a scheduled line in first or business class, or even in coach "if it's a last-minute trip."
Delta Airlines, asked recently for the round-trip fare for a roughly comparable single-day trip that would be made the next day -- New York to Atlanta, about four and a half hours in the air round trip -- quoted a $1,499 first-class fare and a $931 coach cost, though a return later at night dropped the round-trip coach ticket to $569.
In some examples, a large enough charter group brought the cost per traveler below an airline's first-class price.
Clearly, however, many who charter are not concerned with comparison shopping.
"The average we charter costs $2,600 to $3,000 an hour," said Ms. Helms of TAG Aviation. At $3,000, the cost of a five-and-half-hour round trip on a one-day journey to Miami would total about $18,000, with taxes and fees, or $3,600 a person for a group of five.
If they returned the next day, there would be a total of $500 more to put up the crew for the night, and a more extended stay would add much heftier minimum daily fees -- indicating, Ms. Helms said, that charters are most economical for short trips.
The May 21 crash of a charter plane near Wilkes-Barre, Pa., in which 19 people died, has focused attention on the safety of charter flights. The accident rate for such flights has consistently been higher than that for flights on scheduled airlines, according to National Transportation Safety Board records going back to 1982. Accidents that year involving charters totaled 4.39 per 100,000 flight hours, compared with 0.22 for the airlines; in 1999, the rate was 2.71 for the charters and 0.29 for the airlines.
Charter business groups said the higher charter rates were mainly attributable to crashes involving piston-powered propeller planes, whose engines they said were probably less reliable than the turbine engines that power jets and turboprops. They held this to be true even though the plane in the Pennsylvania crash, operated by Executive Airlines of Farmingdale, N.Y., was a turboprop.
According to David Almy, a vice president of the National Business Aviation Association, there are more than 2,700 fractional-share owners in the country. Executive Jet, whose chairman, Richard T. Santulli, came up with the concept, says nearly 1,800 of them are in its program.
It currently costs $835,000 under the Executive Jet program to buy a one-eighth share in a seven-passenger Cessna Citation V Ultra, the kind of jet in which Mr. Kinnear, the retired Texaco chief, has a share. That plus $7,900 a month in management fees and $1,275 for each hour the owner flies buys 100 hours a year in the air, said Kevin Russell, an Executive Jet spokesman.
But there really is no need for jaw-dropping, Mr. Russell said. An owner can always sell the share and recoup as much of the purchase cost as the market affords, he said. Of the other costs, he said, "We tell people that if you fly less than 50 hours a year but want access to a private jet, you should probably charter, but if you fly more than 50 hours a year and your trips are extended beyond two or three days, you should investigate fractional ownership."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
With a Torch and a People's Pride

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY 

DATELINE: MELBOURNE, Australia

 BODY:
Walk through the modest front door of Nova Peris-Kneebone's Victorian home and you soon come face to frame with a picture of Muhammad Ali standing on a stage next to Peris-Kneebone's young daughter Jessica.
"Melbourne 1998 just after the Commonwealth Games," Peris-Kneebone explains proudly. "He was in a boxing ring here for an appearance, and the people who brought him here, they introduced us to Muhammad and brought Jessie up on stage, and you know he has this affiliation with children. So he went straight up to Jessie and held her hand and would not let it go. It was unbelievable, a very special moment." 
 But there is more linking Ali and Peris-Kneebone than a small child's grasp. In 1996, when the Summer Olympics were last held, Ali was the last person to carry the torch. Trembling from disease, he lit the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony in Atlanta, sending goose bumps down Peris-Kneebone's and a lot of other spines.
Now, nearly four years later, it is her turn to play a leading role, and on June 8 in Australia, when the flame arrives at the sacred Aboriginal site of Uluru to begin a 100-day tour of the sprawling continent before reaching Sydney, Peris-Kneebone will be the first Australian to carry it when it is unloaded from the plane.
She will do so with the massive and magnificent red monolith -- dubbed Ayers Rock by the white European settlers but long called Uluru by the Aboriginals -- looming telegenically in the background. She will do so because Sydney Olympic organizers, eager to project an inclusive and updated vision of Australia, found her multifaceted, multicultural background irresistible even though other Australian athletes have accomplished more.
Peris-Kneebone is confident that this moment, her moment, will have resonance. "To have an Aboriginal person carrying that flame is going to make a hell of a lot of people very proud," Peris-Kneebone said earlier this year.
But there is more to it than her rich brown skin; there is the content of her character and of her resume. At 29, Peris-Kneebone is a mother, an artist and a world-class sportswoman in the midst of a career change. In 1996 in Atlanta, she became the first athlete of Aboriginal descent (she also has Filipino and European ancestors) to win an Olympic gold medal, as a member of the Australian women's field hockey team. Several months later, she retired from hockey and decided to train to become an elite sprinter.
"If I was to show you my scrapbook as a kid, track and field was my first love," she said. "And that's what I'm going after this year: my first childhood love."
After surprising the field and herself to win the gold medal in the 200 meters at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, she is now focusing her energies on the 200 and the 400 in the lead-up to the much more competitive races in Sydney. Though her chances of an individual gold medal are extremely slim -- her goal is to reach a final -- she and an even more prominent Aboriginal runner, Cathy Freeman, could win a medal together if Peris-Kneebone manages to qualify for the 4 x 400 relay.
"I think she can do it," said Freeman, who won a silver medal in the 400 in Atlanta and has won the last two world titles over the distance. "No matter what happens, I have a lot of respect for Nova, because she's very courageous. She chases her dreams."
The chase has sometimes resembled an obstacle course. Born in 1971, Peris- Kneebone and her younger sister were raised by their mother, a single parent, in a two-bedroom house in Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory. When Peris-Kneebone was 10, her mother remarried and, according to Peris-Kneebone, the atmosphere changed dramatically.
"My stepfather was a policeman, a very hard, strict man," she said. "I was really stubborn as a kid and him coming into our lives at such a late stage, he was stubborn and I was stubborn and he had to sort of chase me down to grab hold of me. There was none of that sit in the corner and face the wall kind of thing. I was always being chased across the road with a strap. But he was fair. He hated lying, so as a kid, if you ever told a fib, you got the belt. If you told the truth, it was fine."
At 13, largely because of a dearth of track and field programs in Darwin, Peris-Kneebone focused her energies on field hockey, a popular sport throughout Australia, and was soon one of the best prospects in the country. But at 19, she gave birth to Jessica in 1990.
"The whole 12 months after Jessie was born, I was just happy being a mum," she said. "It wasn't until 1991 that I thought, 'The dream is still there: if you want, you can go after it.' "
The following year, she moved with Jessica to the western city of Perth, where the national hockey team trains. She took a job with the Australian telephone company and juggled day care, practice and part-time employment while Jessica's father and Peris-Kneebone's future husband, Sean Kneebone, remained in Darwin attempting to build a career of his own in case her hockey career foundered.
"I'd put Jessie up in the stands with her coloring books or dolls and a little lunch box and drinks," Peris-Kneebone said. "There were times on Tuesday evenings, I'd have psychology meetings and she'd come and sit underneath the table with a coloring book and the other girls in the room wouldn't even know she was there. She was just so quiet and did her own thing. She'll be one of those people when she gets older who will love sport or hate it, because she's seen the hard work that goes into me achieving, seen all the highs and lows."
For now, the Kneebones divide their time between their rented house full of photographs in Melbourne and their family and spiritual base in Darwin. Aboriginal people represent approximately 2 percent of Australia's population of about 19 million but they make up approximately 20 percent of the population in the Northern Territory and own about one-fourth of the property because of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act passed in 1976.
Aboriginal landowners are called "traditional owners" in Australia, and Peris-Kneebone is a traditional owner in Kakadu National Park, where she often fishes, camps and hunts with her family. As a custodian of the land, Peris-Kneebone is in regular contact with tribal elders, including her biological father, with whom she had virtually no contact until he went to visit her after Jessica's birth. Her father lives a traditional, seminomadic aboriginal life style.
"It's funny, I spent 18 years apart from him and yet we are so much alike in so many ways," she said. "I never see him with a watch on his wrist because time doesn't matter. He's lived out in really harsh places on the Coburg Peninsula, living off the land for eight months at a time."
It is on her people's land and with her father that Peris-Kneebone has worked through her problems in the last two years. First came her post-Commonwealth Games depression in late 1998, when she quickly grew weary of the interest in her private life that accompanied her increased celebrity. It was all very petty to Peris-Kneebone -- complaints that she wore too much gold jewelry or that she had grown too arrogant for a society that values egalitarianism. Irritated, she considered returning to the more anonymous existence of a hockey team member.
"I have no problem getting criticized for my performances, but when they start to get into my personal life, I have a problem," she said. "I have a daughter who goes to school and has to face the music and people saying, 'Is this true about your mum?' And she gets really upset about it, and I'd had a gut-full, an absolute gut-full of the stuff."
"She was all ready to go back to hockey," Sean said. "It was all done and then about a week before it was announced, she was watching video of the Commonwealth Games final and just turned around and said, 'I can't do this. I'd be quitting, leaving the sport for the wrong reasons.' "
There have been calls from many Aboriginal leaders to use the Games as a platform for increasing international awareness of the intense discrimination Aboriginals faced after European settlement in the 18th and 19th centuries. Aboriginals were only granted full citizenship in 1967, and even now, their life spans are nearly 20 years lower on average than the rest of the Australian population, while unemployment, child mortality and criminality rates are significantly higher.
Australia's attitudes and policies toward Aboriginals have evolved considerably, but Peris-Kneebone knows there is more progress to be made. Yet she often feels divided: eager to capitalize on a unique opportunity and spread the word; worried about spreading herself thin and missing out on her athletic goal.
"There has been some discussion of a boycott, but the grass roots people tell us to run, tell us, 'You're the one that inspires our children and gives hope to our race.' " Peris-Kneebone said.
Nonetheless, there will certainly be Aboriginal protests of some type at the Games in September, and there could also be some form of protest at Uluru when Peris-Kneebone becomes the first of 10,000 Australians, including the golfer Greg Norman, to run with the torch. Peris-Kneebone understands there is anger out there, but for now she is more interested in carrying flames than fanning them. And when she's asked what message she wants to convey to the world 100 days before the Olympics begin, she harkens back to a conversation she and Sean had not long ago with one of the grizzled elders from Kakadu known as Old Man Bill. The conversation started out being about Peris-Kneebone's gold medals but it ended up being about something more universal.
"All of the sudden he sort of looked at Sean and said, 'Do you want to learn?' " Peris-Kneebone said. "And Sean told him, 'Yeah I want to learn, and Old Man Bill told him, 'No matter what color skin you got, we all got the same color blood.' "

More Than a Bit Player

BYLINE: By Terry Pristin 

 BODY:
New York may be second banana to Los Angeles when it comes to the film and television industry, but the city's supporting role is larger than New York officials had realized, according to a study released yesterday.
Feature film, commercials and television production contributes about $5 billion a year to the city's economy -- twice as much as previous estimates -- and provides about 70,000 jobs, said the report, which was commissioned by the city comptroller's office and the New York City Investment Fund, a private company whose investors include several media companies. 
 The Boston Consulting Group, which prepared the study, said that the industry's economic value had been underestimated because earlier figures were based solely on permits and did not include pre- and post-production. (But, of course, New York does not come close to Los Angeles County, where film and television are a $31.7 billion industry employing 250,000 people.)
The study also noted that in New York, there is often overlap between the traditional media and the Internet industry, which generates another $5 billion a year. A study released earlier this year by the New York New Media Association showed that about 100,000 people in New York have Internet-related jobs.
The comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said the report showed that more soundstages are needed to accommodate the explosive growth in film and television work. But Arnon A. Mishkin, a vice president of the Boston Consulting Group, said the question of whether there is demand for additional sound stages -- like those proposed for the Brooklyn Navy Yard -- was not specifically addressed in the study.

HEADLINE: Council Adopts Budget Package Cutting Taxes $400 Million and Raising Spending

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
The City Council moved quickly yesterday to adopt a $37.6 billion budget package that would cut city taxes by more than $400 million, while increasing city spending at a rate that far exceeds inflation.
The 2001 fiscal year plan, endorsed Monday by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, included a companion capital budget that authorizes $7.59 billion in spending on new or renovated schools, bridges and other projects, a nearly 15 percent jump. It is the largest capital budget in at least a decade, city officials said. 
 The flurry of votes came with almost no dissent: the final package passed 48 to 0 with three members absent. The only delay occurred while city aides feverishly printed copies of the just compiled budget resolutions, and then Council members, including some of the most fiscally conservative Republicans, took turns to praise the budget staff and one another for their work.
"This is a budget I am proud of and that the city should be proud of," said Stephen J. Fiala, a conservative Republican from Staten Island.
But as the details of the agreement filtered out yesterday, former city officials and leaders of independent budget groups expressed growing concern that the budget package might leave the city vulnerable to future changes in the economy, even if it merely slows down.
"Spending is growing faster than revenues," said Ronnie Lowenstein, deputy director and chief economist at the city's Independent Budget Office. "It is simply not sustainable."
Defining just how much spending would grow in the coming year remains difficult because of the multiple ways that the city counts its spending.
The Council finance staff reported late yesterday that the $27.7 billion portion of the budget that is paid for directly with city taxpayer funds would be up about 9 percent over the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. But that percentage increase may decline, the Council staff added, if more federal and state financing surfaces.
Council officials and analysts from the Independent Budget Office said that even if there are adjustments for extra federal and state funds, increases in city spending in 2001 would far exceed inflation, which has been about 2 percent.
The surge in spending is possible in part because of the record surpluses the supercharged city economy has generated in the last two years; the fiscal year is expected to end with an extra $3.2 billion. About $1 billion of that money is being set aside to help balance the budget in 2002 and 2003, but the rest is being spent to support programs in the coming year, city officials said.
The problem, fiscal watchdogs said yesterday, is that if tax revenue dips or even does not continue to grow at the same rate, the programs the city is creating would have to be cut back, or taxes would have to be increased to sustain them.
"It is hard to be prudent in good times," said Eugene J. Keilin, chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission and former chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the state agency that helped rescue the city during its financial crisis of the 1970's. "But that is the only time you can put aside money for a rainy day, and they are plainly spending too much of the surplus and saving too little."
Adam L. Barsky, the director of the Giuliani administration's Office of Management and Budget, said the city's approach was prudent. "We are not spending our surplus on unnecessary expenses," he said. "And we will have adequate resources to react to any changes in the economy or other fiscal uncertainties."
The mayor has yet to sign the budget plan, and approval by the State Legislature is needed before the tax cuts can go into effect, the largest piece of which would be a reduction in the personal income tax. The changes vary, but the average tax cut for a taxpayer earning $60,000 to $70,000 a year would be $207, or 11.7 percent.
The Council and mayor have warned that the tax cut plan may need to be scaled back if the State Legislature approves changes in pension benefits for more than 100,000 retired city employees, which could cost the city an extra $500 million to $1 billion that is not now included in the budget.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 8, 2000, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the City Council's adoption of a budget misstated the amount of money the city plans to spend in the 2001 fiscal year that would come from city tax revenue. It is $25.4 billion, a 3 percent decline in spending from the current fiscal year, not $27.7 billion. That figure, provided by the City Council staff, was higher because it includes payments the city will make before the end of this fiscal year on June 30, to cover debt service costs that come due in the next fiscal year.

HEADLINE: 10 Months, 10 Minutes, $10 Million

BYLINE: By COURTNEY BARRY; Courtney Barry, a writer in Austin, Tex., has just finished her first novel.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
EIGHT a.m. Thursday, May 4. Nervous, bleary-eyed, already highly caffeinated, 21 finalists in the Texas Venture Capitalist Conference wait for the lineup at the Four Seasons Hotel. Today they will pitch their business plans, each in a span of 10 minutes, each hoping to secure the start-up money to become an overnight Internet success, complete with initial public offering and a listing on Nasdaq.
The partners in WebTaggers.com -- Rudy Rouhana, 24, Sean McCullough, 25, and his twin brother, Craig -- have been working nonstop toward this moment since last July, when Mr. Rouhana and Sean McCullough, graduates of New Mexico Tech University, ran into each other in Austin, had a beer and tossed around ideas for a new company. 
 The original idea had to do with posting messages on Web pages, but that has evolved. Now the company's business plan describes WebTaggers as "an application service provider that delivers highly targeted content for e-merchants," enabling retailers from Barnes & Noble way down to Bob's Books to learn the preferences of potential customers who surf their Web sites.
WebTaggers had to clear high hurdles to get here. Two-hundred twenty companies across the nation applied for a place at this morning's conference, according to David Gerhardt, the president of Capital Network, the nonprofit economic development firm in Austin that organized it. Capital Network's team of early-stage investors winnowed that number to 21.
On this warm and humid May morning, WebTaggers' three principals, along with David Chevalier, their 45-year-old chief executive, are putting the finishing touches on Mr. Chevalier's 10-minute pitch. For the last 18 hours they have allowed me to observe their last-minute preparations, and between cups of lukewarm coffee and frantic phone calls, they have been filling me in on their short, eventful history.
The three young partners made their first official move last August, hiring a law firm -- Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich of San Diego -- and working on patent issues. By fall, they had raised their first million dollars in venture capital, from an Austin company called AVLabs. From that experience, Mr. Rouhana said, he and his partners learned an interesting business principle: "Once you have a venture capitalist, everyone wants to start dating you."
AVLabs took the partners through a "think and drink" conference, at which potential investors and chief executives meet entrepreneurs over a cocktail to see whether they are a good match. (As Sean McCullough later noted, "We were asked if we were old enough to drink.")
At that meeting, they met Mr. Chevalier. They needed a leader, said Rob Adams, the founder of AVLabs, adding, "They were optimistically naive -- they didn't know what they didn't know."
Mr. Chevalier, a tall, dapper former vice president at Dell Computers who has led six other start-ups to success, stepped on board Dec. 1. His job was to develop the company's structure, hire people and, most important, get financing. "At certain stages," he said, "C.E.O.'s of dot-coms spend 90 percent of their time raising money." And that is his job today, at what he calls the "beauty pageant."
"In that 10-minute pitch I've got to give the whole story," Mr. Chevalier said. "And ask for $10 million."
4 P.M. WEDNESDAY, MAY 3 -- Seventeen hours to go. Craig McCullough, tired, head in hands, sits in WebTaggers' office in north Austin in front of a computer, barely keeping his eyes open. Computers are everywhere; desks are strewn with papers.
Sean McCullough, slim, quiet, with a goatee and a nose stud, is reviewing resumes for the six positions they must fill. Mr. Rouhana, tall, confident, eager and sharp-witted, is on the phone talking to potential investors who are not part of the venture capital conference.
8 P.M. -- Craig McCullough takes the business plan to a printing shop downtown to make copies. Mr. Chevalier is rehearsing his pitch on his trip back to Austin from San Francisco, where he has just met with another start-up company. Sean McCullough and Joe Gorman, the company's marketing director, are writing final code and planning screen shots for the company demos.
9:30 P.M. -- Tomorrow's audience, the venture capitalists, are in the lounge of the Four Seasons. They are well groomed and prosperous looking: casually dressed but exuding confidence. They are here to have a good time, drinking in the lounge, but are restless, as though ready and eager for the hunt.
Mr. Rouhana is here, working the venture capitalists. He talks shop with Bryan Steffen, of the Berthel Fisher Company. A round of drinks arrives. Nobody seems daunted by Mr. Rouhana's clothing, which is pure grunge: T-shirt and baggy, faded olive-drab military pants. (At the pitch the next morning, he will be wearing the same outfit.)
11 P.M. -- Throughout the night, phone calls have been flying back and forth. At 11, Mr. Rouhana learns there is a problem with the printing job for the business plan: the shop, backlogged, does not have the right binders. Craig McCullough and WebTaggers' network administrator, Vance Shtraikh, roll up their sleeves and head over to help with the print job. Back at the hotel suite, Sean McCullough is trying to open a port on WebTaggers' server: they must be able to connect from the hotel to show the demos. Sometime after midnight, Sean succeeds.
2 A.M. THURSDAY -- The partners have connected with Mr. Chevalier, whose flight from Dallas was delayed and who has just made the four-hour drive to Austin in a rental car. He had been told by the event's sponsors that on the night before the pitch, there would be a dress rehearsal of sorts.
"They said, 'No problem, you guys come in any time -- we'll be there,' " Mr. Chevalier said. "Well, with all my flight delays and having to drive from Dallas, I ended up at the Four Seasons at midnight or 1 in the morning, and nobody was there in the hotel ballroom. Basically it was just me and all the hotel employees, setting up the chairs and tables. And so I said the hell with it. I just got up and rehearsed my pitch on my own to the hotel employees."
At 3, after debating whether to try to get some sleep, the partners and Mr. Chevalier decide to get breakfast at an all-night diner.
7 A.M. -- The conference kicks off with a buffet breakfast. A Nasdaq representative, Chris Santiago, tells the audience how the exchange has added 228 companies just since January. Impressive, but is anyone paying attention? People look up, acknowledge that he is talking, turn back to their tablemates and sip their coffee. Eyes skirt the room; the venture capitalists seem to be wondering, "Who should I be talking to here?"
The room is awash in business cards floating from hand to hand. In the lobby during the presentations, there is a friendly competition among the service providers, and perhaps a biting envy lurking beneath. Lawyers and accountants have booths with slick slogans ("Winning Matters"). They smell money and are dying to land these new companies as clients. At one law firm booth, representatives, friendly at first, offer me a book on Silicon Valley; when they realize I am not a presenter, they dismiss me with a curt "Enjoy your book."
8:01 A.M. -- One hour until showtime. Craig McCullough calls Mr. Rouhana from the print shop. The business- plan copies are done at last. Mr. Chevalier is suited up and ready for the pitch, so ready that he sits in on the four other company pitches before his.
9:18 A.M. -- Mr. Chevalier speaks before an audience of more than 600 investors, developers, service providers, lawyers, accountants and others. He opens with a joke about an incident involving his family, but it is his delivery that is crucial. Unlike some of the presenters, who cling to the lectern, he uses the front of the room as a stage, walking confidently around as he speaks. He seems to know intuitively what the venture capitalists want to hear. "Very smooth," one says.
Was it a success? The WebTaggers guys say they will not know until the wire transfer date, Aug. 15, when WebTaggers anticipates that funds from investors will have traded hands. After that? Jan. 1, 2001, the "fume date," which no one really wants to think about -- the point at which, if no venture capital is coming in, the partners must admit defeat.
"But that's not going to happen," Mr. Chevalier said, and there was reason to hope that he was right. Though the recent skid in technology stocks has made venture capitalists want to "look for deals only with bulletproof economic models," as he put it in an interview in late May, the company is showing a profit. And any day now, it is expecting to receive its first formal proposals from a short list of potential investors.

Wising Up, Though He Ain't No Bigger Than a Poot

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:

JIM THE BOY
By Tony Earley
227 pages. Little, Brown. $23.95.
Accurate as it would be to call Tony Earley's first novel a radiant, knowing, pitch-perfect parable of childhood, it seems wrong to say things that would make his characters blush. Mr. Earley's book is set during the Depression in the modest, folksy North Carolina town of Aliceville, where "Shoot!" and "Daggummit" and "You knothead" are the cuss words in common parlance and a ghostly story still resonates about the little girl for whom the place was named. In this simple setting, which Mr. Earley renders with a wonderful blend of nostalgia and sophistication, the verities discovered by 10-year-old Jim have a way of seeming particularly eternal. 
 The expert and irony-free minimalism of "Jim the Boy" gives it the plain, wholehearted sound of a book for young readers. But the forthright and sweetly humorous way in which Jim's story unfolds is anything but naive. This book's rural characters seem as carefully chosen as figures in a Greek myth, like the widowed mother who sounds as if she stepped out of a folk song ("Mama was tall and pale and handsome; her neck was long and white") to watch over her son. The other deities in Jim's universe are the three uncles who during the course of this quick and unexpectedly elegant fable teach Jim everything he needs to know.
"Y'all know who I am," Jim insists on the morning of his 10th birthday when Uncles Al, Coran and Zeno teasingly pretend not to recognize him. "Can't say that we do," Uncle Coran remarks, in a book that, while not without seriousness, seldom sounds any less good-natured than that. It turns out that the twins Al and Coran and their older brother ("His age was considerable, up in the 40's somewhere," Jim thinks about Zeno), mean to surprise Jim with a baseball glove and bat, which they present with the characteristically wry understatement that serves as local color.
"Never seen them before," says Uncle Coran, when the glove and Louisville slugger turn up in the middle of the dining room table. "What are they?"
Jim's Mama urges the uncles to quit kidding. ("Oh, stop it. Sometimes I could just strangle y'all.") In the end, it is Zeno, the book's foremost source of wisdom, who ends the birthday celebration on a suitably sweeping note. "He ain't no bigger than a poot," says Zeno, "but I guess we'll keep him." It wouldn't take many poots to tip a book this slender into the realm of sugary down-home charm. But Mr. Earley, whose first book was a collection of short stories, retains the economy and purposefulness that that form demands, as he leads Jim through a series of exploratory ventures beyond the loving shelter of his Aliceville home. The book's landscape and cast of characters are so selectively delineated that each of these forays has the mythic quality of a major undertaking, even on the journey about which "Uncle Al would say only that they were going to see a man about a dog."
This is the trip on which Jim visits a town big enough to have a courthouse, a place that affords a tempting sight. ("Jim could no longer imagine sitting inside a soda shop than in the house of a king, and did not ask Uncle Al to stop."). It's the time he first sets foot in another state. ("South Carolina," said Uncle Al. "Not much to it, huh?") And provides Jim with his first experience of the Atlantic Ocean, where he steps into the water ("A fish no bigger than a thought swam by his feet") and tries to imagine where else that water has been. The beauty of "Jim the Boy" lies in its graceful way of describing a boy who is in every way thus poised on the verge of discovery, thrilled and fearful to find new wisdom flooding into his familiar world.
The course of the book leads Jim to make peace with thoughts of his father, who fell dead in a cotton field the week before Jim was born. It leads him to understand his mother's loneliness, especially when a genial traveling feed salesman named Whitey Whiteside begins to court her. (Wondering about Whitey's presence around his mother made other questions begin "pulling into his head like trains into a station.")
It brings Jim into friendly rivalry with a schoolmate named Penn who fights with him about baseball and makes him see the contrast between Penn's life on a nearby mountain and Jim's life in town. It seems no coincidence that Penn's mother, glimpsed briefly at home, is in a sky-blue dress and a white apron, as if this symbolic setting were indeed part of the clouds. The whole book has the sharp, clean, inviting hyperreality of a detail like that.
The most daunting figure in Jim's world is the grandfather who will have nothing to do with him and who can also be found somewhere up the mountain. And while it's true that Jim comes to know about pride, competition, racial tension and disabling illness during the course of the story, nothing looms larger for him than the terrifying specter of that mean old man. It is some measure of Mr. Earley's storytelling mettle that he uses Jim's grandfather to generate the book's closing epiphany without remotely reaching for the literary equivalent of a big grandfatherly hug.
The novel's matter-of-fact-looking cover illustration ably conveys the meaning of this last episode. Yet this picture, like the story itself, has the stealth aspect of something intended for young readers in an innocent, less cynical time. In fact, "Jim the Boy" is anything but quaint. Mr. Earley may not have invented the coming-of-age novel, but he streamlines and reawakens the genre with this swift, lovely book.

HEADLINE: Growth Rate Of Borrowing Fell in April, Fed Reports

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Americans increased their borrowing at a less feverish pace in April, ringing up the smallest rise in consumer credit in six months, the Federal Reserve said today.
Total consumer credit rose a seasonally adjusted $9.3 billion in April for an annual growth rate of 7.8 percent. That was the smallest gain since October, when Americans increased their borrowing by $5.3 billion. 
 Still, the increase in borrowing was larger than the $8 billion many analysts were expecting.
Consumer credit in March grew by $10.7 billion, stronger than the Fed estimated one month ago. That translates into an annual growth rate of 9 percent.
In April, demand for revolving credit, like that of credit cards, rose $5.9 billion, an 11.4 percent annual rate. That was down from $7 billion and an 13.8 percent rate in March.
The total amount of nonrevolving credit, like loans for new cars, vacations and other big-ticket items, advanced by $3.4 billion at an annual rate of 5 percent in April. That also was down from $3.7 billion and a 5.5 percent rate in March.
The Fed has raised interest rates six times since June 1999, including a more aggressive half-point increase in May to slow the economy and keep inflation from becoming a problem.
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity and has been the engine behind the supercharged economy.
Last month, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in April fell for the first time since August 1998.
Since then, some economic data -- including home sales, factory orders and the unemployment report, which showed that the jobless rate rose to 4.1 percent in May and that employers had cut jobs -- offered signs that the economy might be slowing.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The trade deficit may seem harmless, but it could be what trips up growth.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick; This column appears here every Thursday. Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and adjunct professor of social sciences at Cooper Union. Four economic analysts -- Mr. Madrick, Virginia Postrel, Alan B. Krueger and Hal R. Varian -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
IT has become one of the most familiar refrains in economic circles. Every time the trade deficit reaches yet another record, as it did again this March, economists generally assure us that there is little, perhaps nothing, to worry about.
We've dealt with high trade deficits for 20 years, the argument goes, and we're still the leading economy in the world. But in recent years, the deficit has actually been growing considerably faster than has the economy itself. And when Americans buy more from abroad than at home, someone in the United States must borrow those dollars from foreigners. As a result, the nation's foreign debt is rising faster than its income. And as the economy begins to slow at last, the question becomes more urgent because slower growth may persuade global investors to put their money elsewhere. The rising level of debt is not sustainable indefinitely. 
 Why are we so complacent? One reason is that a couple of misleading half-truths have become conventional wisdom.
The first of these is that, contrary to what you may have thought, the trade deficit really reflects America's economic strength, not any inability to compete on the part of companies in the United States. This year, Americans are buying in excess of $300 billion more from foreigners than they will buy from the United States, so the argument goes, because this nation is so much better off than the rest of the world. If only foreign economies were as strong as America's. Then their companies and consumers would buy more American goods.
But, in truth, if foreign consumers and investors suddenly bought another $300 billion from the United States, Americans companies could not handle it. Labor markets are tight and business is already running full out, so an increase in production of roughly 3 percent of the nation's economic output would be inflationary.
"People often seem to forget that because we are approaching the limits to capacity," says Wynne Godley, senior economist at the Jerome Levy Institute at Bard College, "an increase in foreign demand would have to be matched by a comparable decrease in consumption by Americans."
Secondly, we are invariably told that the trade deficit merely reflects America's record low savings rate. This is true as far as it goes. When Americans save so little, the nation must attract enormous sums of capital from overseas to fuel investment.
Fortunately, right now foreigners are willing to lend a lot of money to the United States, as well as buy American stocks. This helps keep the value of the dollar high, which stimulates imports by pushing prices down and restrains exports by driving their prices up. According to this reasoning, the trade deficit is simply a trivial side effect.
But it does not follow from this that all the United States needs to do is to raise its savings rate and everything would be fine. If the savings rates were to sharply improve, consumers would spend much less. The lower spending, in turn, would substantially reduce output and employment in the economy, running the risk of outright recession.
Unfortunately, these half-truths drown out more useful discussions about ways to improve America's ability to produce what Americans themselves want to buy. Low savings rate or high, Americans like to buy imports more than foreigners like to buy American products. So the trade deficit does to some extent reflect how internationally competitive American companies are.
In her comprehensive book "Is the U.S. Trade Deficit Sustainable?" Catherine L. Mann of the Institute for International Economics shows clearly that as Americans make more money, a higher proportion of their purchases is from abroad.
How to correct this? An unusually high dollar, which the Clinton administration has favored because it simultaneously restrains inflation and attracts foreign investment, only makes these matters worse. It reduces incentives to invest in export-producing companies by keeping prices for these goods unduly high to foreigners. It also reduces incentives to invest in American companies that compete with imports by keeping those prices low.
America's inherent competitive advantages would also be better served, especially in the new economy, if the nation invested more effectively in its human capital, in research and development and in infrastructure. At least in part, this will require the efforts of government.
But those who believe that trade deficits merely reflect the low savings rate insist that any budget surpluses be used to pay down Treasury debt. In the short run, this would raise the nation's total savings, they argue, but what they ignore is that it would also forgo the best opportunity in decades to improve the nation's competitive potential through needed public investment.
Because Americans have lived for so long with a high trade deficit, many seem to believe we have plenty of time to correct the problem. Aside from a new commission established by Congress to review the trade deficit, there is little serious policy discussion of the issue among Democrats or Republicans, or even among prominent economists.
The current hope -- and it is no more than that -- is for a soft landing. Foreign economies will grow a little faster and gradually increase America's exports. The American economy will slow down moderately, and American consumers will buy fewer imports. The dollar may also fall slightly, thus stimulating more exports.
In sum, the trade deficit will not be eliminated, but at least it will be dented. America's relentless borrowing from abroad will be tempered, and, well, the problem will be postponed if not solved.
But the situation is more delicate than that. The debt Americans now owe overseas investors, Mr. Godley figures, has risen to more than 20 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, easily a record. Even Ms. Mann, a gradualist, believes America may have only a few years to reverse the current trends.
If the economy does indeed begin to slow even moderately, Ms. Mann and Mr. Godley -- no ideological bedfellows -- both agree that foreign investors may want to rebalance their portfolios (as might domestic investors) in favor of the securities of other countries. This would place downward pressure on the dollar and stock prices, and there is no telling when a small outflow of funds could turn into a run, especially given the stock market's anxious condition.
The complacent attitude among economists about the trade deficit was originally a response to exaggerated fears in the past when America was a creditor. But now that it is a debtor, the nation no longer enjoys such a luxury.

HEADLINE: Software Makers Ask for Protection From Internet Piracy

BYLINE: By JERI CLAUSING 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
If copyright laws are not more broadly and aggressively enforced on the Internet, software developers will be forced to resort to cumbersome technological protections that consumers will not like, an industry leader warned today.
"You're going to have a piece of music that will only play on one Walkman," said John E. Warnock, the chairman and chief executive of Adobe Systems, during a panel discussion on Capitol Hill involving 10 key software executives. "You're going to have a piece of software that will only work on one machine. It will provide enormous inconvenience." 
 The industry officials were in Washington as part of an annual lobbying trip organized by the Business Software Alliance. They said they were not asking for new copyright laws, just better prosecution of the fast-growing number of digital piracy cases.
"We need more cases brought to the court system," said Carol Bartz, chairman and chief executive of Autodesk Inc.
Mr. Warnock also urged the government to educate young people who think piracy and computer intrusions are no big deal.
"We would like government to set an example, to send a message that this is breaking the law and the law will be enforced," he said.
In a survey released by the alliance in conjunction with the visit, software executives estimated that by 2005, 66 percent of software will be distributed over the Internet, compared with 12 percent today.
"The increase in Internet distribution and the growing number of users raises the possibility of even greater losses due to piracy in the coming years," said the study, which cited an estimate that 36 percent of software in use last year had been pirated.
Ms. Bartz said she would urge that Congress become involved in encouraging more copyright enforcement efforts by federal authorities.
In addition to meeting with administration officials and Congressional leaders over the last two days, the executives sent letters to the presidential candidates asking for their dedication to three top policy goals outlined in the survey.
In addition to broader copyright enforcement, they are urging continued adoption of free trade policies. The House recently voted to establish free trade with China and a vote is pending in the Senate.
The executives are also pushing for more visas for skilled foreign workers, saying that without the visas, 9 percent of America's high-skill, high-wage jobs will go unfilled.
"How you respond to these issues will have a vital impact on the next phase of the Internet economy, with tremendous consequences for American jobs, standard of living and competitiveness," the executives wrote. "We ask for your full support and your commitment to make these an integral part of your policy agenda."
Among the other software executives in Washington on Wednesday were Andrew S. Grove of Intel, Eric E. Schmidt of Novell and Stephen M. Bennett of Intuit. William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, was in Washington on Tuesday for meetings and a Congressional hearing, but returned to Seattle on Tuesday night.

HEADLINE: C. D. Atkins, 86, Inventor of Orange Juice Process

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE 

 BODY:
C. D. Atkins, an inventor of frozen concentrated orange juice, which revolutionized the Florida citrus industry, died last Saturday at his home in Winter Haven, Fla. He was 86.
Mr. Atkins, Edwin L. Moore and L. G. MacDowell, who died in July 1986, were the research team that the Florida Citrus Commission asked in the 1940's to improve the quality of processed orange products. The purpose was to provide better juice for the armed forces and make more efficient use of Florida's orange crop. The work was done at a laboratory provided by the United States Department of Agriculture in Lakeland, Fla., and began in 1942. 
 The concentration process, which involves heating the juice so that the water evaporates, was already well known. But the three invented the process in which the flavor of orange juice could be retained by adding a bit of fresh juice to the concentrate and then freezing it. Called the cutback process, it led to the expansion of the Florida citrus economy as well as surrounding industries for transporting and warehousing the juice.
The cutback process also created a more nutritious product by restoring some of the Vitamin C that was lost in heating.
Cedric Donald Atkins was born on Sept. 7, 1913, in Winter Haven. He was the only child of James H. Atkins, a railroad telegraph operator, and his wife, Christina, an elementary-school teacher. The Atkinses had inherited a couple of hundred acres of land in 1887, and they planted orange groves, from which they earned a second income, according to Mr. Atkins's son, Robert.
C. D. Atkins attended the University of Florida for three years, planning to be a doctor. But when his parents ran out of money, he transferred to Florida Southern College near his parents' home in Lakeland, where he could help finance his tuition by teaching chemistry, biology and physics at the college. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1937.
After college, he taught high school and coached football in the Florida towns of Plant City, Fort Meade and Winter Haven. In 1942, he became a research scientist with the federal Department of Agriculture.
Mr. Atkins had seven patents in all, including one for a sports drink containing orange juice, a pulp-free syrup for carbonated beverages and a process for extracting the aroma from fresh juice, then adding it to concentrate, which enhances its flavor.
The process for frozen orange juice was patented in 1946 under an agreement in which the patent belonged to the federal government.
"He never mentioned regretting it," Mr. Atkins's son said. "He always had enough money to be comfortable."
Mr. Atkins is survived by his wife, the former Martha Kathryn Marsh; a daughter, Barbara Atkins Smith, and his son, Robert, both of Winter Haven; nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: With Only Their Wits, Part II

BYLINE: By David Martin; David Martin is a lawyer.

DATELINE: OTTAWA

 BODY:
With the success of CBS's series "Survivor," we can expect the other networks to play catch-up with copycat versions like these:
 
Big Apple Survivor (Fox)
Two eight-member teams of Midwestern tourists are dropped off in Bensonhurst with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Over the next 39 days, relying on their wits, they compete to see which player will be first to reach Midtown and claim the million-dollar prize. Every three nights, the teams are pitted in competitions like ticket scalping and taxicab hailing in hopes of winning precious prizes like subway tokens. The losing team must vote to remove a member, who is left in the new Times Square to wander alone. 

Silicon Valley Survivor (ABC)
Ten technophobes, deposited in Silicon Valley, use their rudimentary skills to see who will be first to contact family and be taken home. Watch as they tackle coinless pay phones, cashless supermarkets and Palm Pilot banking. Each week, the survivors are given a new device, like an e-mail pager or Global Positioning System receiver, with just an instruction manual to guide them.
 
White House Survivor (NBC)
Fifteen males and one female are split into teams, the Democrats and the Republicans. Using only their natural gifts to raise soft money, each team slowly narrows itself down to one presidential candidate. The two finalists compete in a late fall 900-number telephone contest for a four-year term.
 
E.U. Survivor (CNN)
Each week, representatives of the 15 countries of the European Union compete to see which will emerge as the economic ruler of Europe. Contestants can artificially inflate or deflate their currencies to undermine the euro. Smaller countries can band together to reinstate tariff barriers. The show will end when Germany wins.
 
Solar System Survivor (PBS)
Nine planets, nine orbits. Watch as each of the planets tries to avoid the effects of climatic change, deteriorating orbits and random asteroids. See who survives into the next millennium and who ends up as a sunspot.

HEADLINE: Jobs With Links To Internet Soar

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
The Internet accounted for one job in 50 in the American economy last year as the number of workers who depend on the Internet for their jobs surged, according to a study released this week.
The study, commissioned by Cisco Systems Inc., the maker of network equipment, reported that nearly 2.5 million people made a living directly from the Internet in 1999. 
 That was a jump of 36 percent from 1998, up from about 1.8 million, according to the report by the Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the University of Texas in Austin.
Figures on Internet employment are not available from the government. Its Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles detailed data on various occupations but lacks a special category for the Internet.
The Texas study showed the inroads being made by the Internet are broad.
"It is important to point out that the Internet economy is not just a collection of high-tech companies," said the report. "It includes any company that generates revenue from the Internet." But even in the most intensive Internet companies, not all employees may be counted as Internet workers, the report said.
Although workers were spread throughout industry, the biggest rate of growth was among people who make and service the basic infrastructure of the Web -- the fiber backbones, routers, software and Internet Service providers.

HEADLINE: PRIMARY IN NEW JERSEY: THE OVERVIEW;
Campaigns Quickly Stake Their Ground

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 7

 BODY:
Robert D. Franks was not halfway through his victory speech early this morning when he began ripping into Jon S. Corzine, his opponent in the New Jersey Senate race, as a dangerously out-of-touch spendthrift.
The race to control the wide middle of New Jersey politics began even before all the votes were counted in Tuesday's primary, which left Mr. Franks as the apparent Republican nominee. And Mr. Franks's swift attack raised a question that he clearly hoped would define the race: Can he succeed in turning the liberal proposals and record-setting spending that won Mr. Corzine the Democratic nomination into liabilities big enough to keep Mr. Corzine from winning the general election? 
 "What's dangerous about Jon Corzine isn't the fact that he has spent tens of millions of his own money," Mr. Franks said. "What's really dangerous is the prospect of Jon Corzine sitting in the United States Senate where he will have the power to spend your money."
In giving his own acceptance speech, Mr. Corzine, emotional and exhausted after his overwhelming but hard-won victory over former Gov. Jim Florio, seemed to be thinking more about how soon he would be able to take a vacation than about his next opponent. But his advisers suggested today that Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, would soon begin pointing to his Wall Street background as evidence that, for all his expansive ideas, he would understand as well as any lawmaker the importance of fiscal moderation.
"Jon Corzine is a can-do, pro-jobs Democrat who understands the new economy," said Steven Goldstein, a top official in the Corzine campaign. "He's running against a lifelong politician who's never had any real- world experience. And New Jersey, whether it's Frank Lautenberg or Bill Bradley, likes real-world experience in its leaders."
Moreover, aides to Mr. Corzine outlined a plan to depict Mr. Franks, who was elected to Congress in 1992, as an ideological soul mate of former Speaker Newt Gingrich, a strategy used most successfully by President Clinton in his 1996 campaign against Senator Bob Dole, and by Senator Robert G. Torricelli in his race the same year against Representative Richard A. Zimmer.
"The Franks-Gingrich agenda is hopelessly out of touch with New Jersey," Mr. Goldstein said. "Bob Franks can't possibly be moderate when he voted for the Contract With America."
Mr. Corzine is by no means the only candidate still using this ploy. In the Senate race in New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton has also tried to link her Republican rival, Representative Rick A. Lazio, to Mr. Gingrich. But it remains unclear how potent a weapon that will be more than a year after Mr. Gingrich's exit from the political stage.
Charlie Smith, an aide to Mr. Franks, made clear that he would not be intimidated by Mr. Corzine's stated willingness to spend whatever it takes to win the Senate race, which he demonstrated by spending close to $35 million in the primary.
"We believe we'll have the financial wherewithal to compete, with a message that's much more in tune with New Jersey's voters than Jon Corzine is with his immense wealth," Mr. Smith said. "And others, around New Jersey and in Washington, will come to the same conclusion."
He added that $10 million was a decent rule-of-thumb estimate for what an effective fall campaign could cost.
Indeed, Republican officials in Washington, whose help Mr. Franks will sorely need, expressed glee today at the prospect of helping him take on Mr. Corzine, whose advocacy for ambitious government programs, against the death penalty, and for affirmative action, gun control and gay rights made his campaign as left-leaning as any successful Senate primary bid in memory.
"Congressman Franks is an accomplished legislator and an outstanding candidate, while all Corzine has is rich liberal guilt," said Steven Law, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. "We believe in this race because Bob Franks has New Jersey common-sense values, while on the other hand, if Corzine goes any more to the left, he'll be in Pennsylvania."
Just how much more Mr. Corzine will spend in the fall campaign was the subject of much speculation today. His advisers have said they long believed that a primary campaign against Mr. Florio would be much more difficult and costly than a general election. And after an unprecedented 12-week saturation of the New York and Philadelphia television stations with Mr. Corzine's image in gauzy commercials, he enters the race with Mr. Franks, who is little known outside of his district except among Republican stalwarts, holding an incumbent's name-recognition advantage.
But Mr. Franks's decision to focus on Mr. Corzine's spending was striking not only because he picked right up where Mr. Florio left off, vowing to make campaign finance reform a central issue, but because Mr. Florio's efforts in that regard had won him newspaper endorsements but failed to sway most Democratic voters. Mr. Goldstein also said that Mr. Franks was vulnerable to attack for his own acceptance of special-interest contributions.
The demand among Democrats for Mr. Corzine to add to his spending record was sure to heighten with his victory Tuesday, however. After donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to county party organizations in the months leading up to the primary, Democratic officials said, Mr. Corzine now may be pressed similarly to help bankroll the party's coordinated campaign -- the grass-roots organizing efforts in which the party's presidential, Senate and Congressional candidates pool their resources and avoid putting out conflicting messages.
Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore, who has called New Jersey a must-win state for his presidential campaign, is expected to visit Trenton on Monday for a town hall meeting-type television show. And an official in Mr. Gore's New Jersey campaign said today that Mr. Gore also hoped to meet during his trip with Mr. Florio, Mr. Corzine and other Democratic leaders in an effort to halt the divisive infighting between Mr. Florio's followers in South Jersey and Mr. Corzine's backers in the north.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: POLITICS;
Muted Comments Avoid Criticizing the Defendant

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive presidential nominees, declined to comment today on the court order to break Microsoft into two companies, but Congressional Republicans condemned the ruling.
Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, who in February had expressed concerns that a breakup would threaten economic growth, said tonight that "Governor Bush has said all along that it would not be appropriate for him to discuss the specifics of the case while it is still before the courts and Microsoft has indicated that they intend to appeal." 
 Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said that "since it's an ongoing legal matter, it would be inappropriate to comment." Mr. Hattaway declined to explain why silence was indicated in this case when Mr. Gore freely commented last month on the case involving political asylum for Elian Gonzalez, as has Mr. Bush.
Their reluctance to comment reflected a sense among political professionals that the decision was unlikely to have much impact on the presidential election, except perhaps in Microsoft's home state, Washington, where it could hurt Mr. Gore.
Moreover, both supporters and foes of Microsoft have contributed heavily to all sorts of candidates this year. As one Washington lobbyist put it, "It's obvious why no one is getting too far out front -- there's too much money to be raised from both sides."
But that did not stop Republicans on Capitol Hill.
Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader, said the decision marked "a sad day for the American consumer." Mr. Nickles said the Clinton administration apparently wanted a "federal department of software regulation," but said Congress should decide "whether we need federal bureaucrats and federal judges writing our computer software and deciding how we surf the Internet."
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, denounced the decision even before it was issued. In a statement released at 3:56 p.m., 34 minutes before the ruling was made public, Mr. Armey said: "Judge Jackson's ruling will divert innovative companies from creating better products. Worse, it will send the message to innovators around the world that in America we punish success."
Democrats were more hesitant in their comments. Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said the implications of the ruling "are anything but clear right now." Mr. Leahy urged the government and Microsoft to "invest new urgency" in trying to reach a settlement.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said the penalty was too severe. "Obviously," Mr. Schumer said, "if Microsoft broke the law, they should be punished, But not all legal roads lead to a breakup," which he said should be used only as a "last resort."
Lawmakers from Washington State were vehement in their complaints, regardless of party. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, called the decision disappointing, saying it would "hobble Microsoft at a critical time in the development of our information-based economy" and "cripple a major technology innovator."
That was mild compared with the comments of Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican running for re-election. Calling the result a sham, Mr. Gorton said: "Today is truly a sad day in our nation's history. Never before has our government so viciously pursued a company that has done so much good for not only Americans, but for people worldwide. Microsoft, the driving force behind the booming U.S. economy, has revolutionized how we communicate, how we educate our children and how we live."
The absence of any immediate denunciation of Microsoft, even from members of Congress who have been critical of its activities, reflected not only a desire to study the decision by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson and weigh the politics of attacking a generally popular company, but perhaps also represented a bow to the corporation's increasing role as a campaign contributor.
A study by the Center for Responsive Politics showed that while Microsoft, and individuals and political action committees connected to it, gave candidates and parties about $1.8 million from 1993 to 1998, in just the first 17 months of the current election cycle they gave $2.2 million.
And while almost three-fifths of the earlier giving went to Republicans, the donations between Jan. 1, 1999, and June 1 of this year were divided with almost surgically exactness. Democrats received 50.2 percent, or $1,118,014; Republicans took in 49.8 percent, or $1,083,723.
Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, has made strenuous efforts to cater to Democrats as well as Republicans. During his visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, he met at length with the all-Democratic Congressional Black Caucus and the heavily Democratic Hispanic Caucus.
Still, many Microsoft officials are known to hope that if Mr. Bush is elected, his administration might be willing to settle the case on terms more generous to the company than the Clinton administration.
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Mr. McClellan, avoided that issue, saying, "As president, Governor Bush will fully enforce our antitrust laws to foster competition and innovation and protect consumers," but he declined to say whether that meant Mr. Bush would have supported government action against Microsoft.
In the meantime, the case seems to have little national political impact. Last month, an NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll did find the public opposed to a breakup, by 52 percent to 35 percent. And many polls have found the company and Mr. Gates popular with the public.
But there was no indication either in those surveys or elsewhere that the subject was one that could change votes. Charles Cook, editor of a highly regarded political survey, The Cook Political Report, said he had seen no impact anywhere.

HEADLINE: Ellery Chun, 91, Popularizer Of the Shirt That Won Hawaii

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Ellery J. Chun, who might not have exactly invented the Hawaiian shirt but who surely gave it a powerful push toward prominence, died in Honolulu on May 16. He was 91.
Once there were no shirts in Hawaii, much less pink ones with ukuleles, but shocked missionaries hastened to introduce a plain, solid-color work shirt called a palaka to men. Women got long, shapeless dresses called muumuus. These early garments were made of native tapa, or bark cloth. Soon patterns were added. 
 As American tourists began to arrive on cruise ships in the 1920's, small tailor shops began making custom prints on the shirts for the visitors. Hawaiians, in turn, started using them for weddings and other special occasions.
Enter Mr. Chun, a native Hawaiian who graduated from Yale as an economics major in 1931. He turned a Chinese dry goods shop, King-Smith Clothiers at 36 North King Street, into the first mass producer of Hawaiian shirts. Most important, he gave them the name by which they are called on the Hawaiian Islands, aloha shirts.
His wife, Mildred, said the shirts were a way to keep his clothing business going during the Depression. She told The Honolulu Star-Bulletin that he started with a few dozen bright printed Hawaiian patterns with palm trees, hula girls and pineapples. She said his tailor sewed three or four dozen at a time.
By 1933, he was producing ready-to-wear models from cloth imported from the United States mainland, Japan and Tahiti. Surfers and beach boys snapped them up, and before long the shirts had become symbolic of easy, casual masculinity. To be sure, the cheap imitations, particularly those featuring pink flamingos, became gaudy badges for tourists.
Aiming higher, marketers let it be known that each color on the more expensive styles carried ancient significance: Yellow meant victor, red valor and white holiness. Montgomery Clift wore the Diamond Head pattern in "From Here to Eternity"; Elvis Presley wore the Blue Hawaii pattern in the 1963 movie of the same name, and Tom Selleck's Bird Airbrush shirt from his "Magnum P.I." television series ended up in the Smithsonian Institution.
Frank Sinatra, Arthur Godfrey and Bing Crosby wore aloha shirts. Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower equated them with weekends.
In Hawaii, at least on Fridays, the shirts became acceptable as business garb. And the older shirts became collector's items. The most expensive command prices of up to $5,000. In 1997, the Honolulu Academy of the Arts mounted an exhibition of the most iconic aloha shirts.
To Mr. Chun, the shirts were good business. His store embellished its easygoing reputation by sponsoring a radio talent show in the late 1930's, which originated from the stretch of Waikiki Beach fronting the Moana Hotel.
In 1945, Mr. Chun became a director of American Security Bank. He closed his clothing outlet and remained with the bank until retiring in 1966. In 1991, the Hawaii Senate honored him for his shirt-making achievement.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Colleen Hirano and Christine Chung; a son, Damon; a sister, Wai-Chee Yee; and four grandchildren.
"It turned out well," his wife said.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE LAW;
If Microsoft Is Sawed in Half

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
"Possession of unchallenged economic power deadens initiative, discourages thrift and depresses energy."
"Immunity from competition is a narcotic, and rivalry a stimulant, to industrial progress." 
 Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in June 2000 ordering the breakup of Microsoft? No, Judge Learned Hand declaring in 1945 that the Aluminum Company of America had illegally monopolized the market for a type of aluminum ingot.
A lot has changed since 1945, the exact midpoint between the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 and the Microsoft ruling today.
An economy based on heavy industry and capital investment has transformed itself into one based more and more on human capital and information technology where "it's pretty hard to figure out what the markets are and what really competes with what," as Thomas E. Kauper, a former government antitrust chief who now teaches antitrust law at the University of Michigan, noted today.
Nonetheless, as today's ruling demonstrates, the old factories may be obsolete, but the legal principles that led to the breakup of the Standard Oil trust in 1911 and the American Telephone & Telegraph Company in 1984 are not.
Perceptions and priorities have changed, naturally enough. When oil and tobacco trusts loomed over the economic landscape, the perceived enemy was price-fixing, while in the government's theory of Microsoft, adopted by Judge Jackson, the enemy is the ability of a predatory monopolist to strangle innovation.
But from a broader perspective, these are just different ways to measure a monopolist's threat to consumers, the protection of whom was the ultimate goal of antitrust enforcement in the old economy and remains so in the new. There is no reason the old rules should not apply in the software-driven economy, Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, has insisted throughout the case.
Simply attaining monopoly status in a given market, by being quicker out of the starting gate, or more creative or diligent than the competition, does not itself violate antitrust law. As Judge Hand said in the Alcoa case, "The successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins."
Microsoft, portraying itself as a victim of antitrust policy run amok, has long argued that the government was turning on it in exactly that way. Judge Jackson disagreed. Microsoft's offense, he held, lay not in the fact that its Windows operating system runs 90 percent of the world's personal computers, but in the methods the company used to maintain and try to extend its monopoly.
"Judge Jackson found that Microsoft mounted a campaign of dirty tricks, and the dirty tricks are old tricks," said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution who served in the Justice Department's antitrust division earlier in the Clinton administration. In an interview, he continued: "John D. Rockefeller used them all: exclusive contracting, throwing your weight around, scaring off the competition."
Antitrust cases have two dimensions: liability and, if liability is found, a remedy. While on the liability side, there is a straight line leading from the earliest antitrust cases to today's ruling, Judge Jackson's approved remedy -- breaking Microsoft in two -- arguably moves the case toward uncharted territory.
Monopolies have been broken up before, of course, either by court order, as in the Standard Oil case, or by negotiated settlement, as with AT&T. But the earlier breakups were along fairly obvious lines.
AT&T's own corporate structure reflected the division between long-distance service, which it kept in the breakup, and local telephone service, which was spun off. Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, repeated today, as he has in the past, that there was no precedent for breaking up a "unitary" company such as his.
To assess the wisdom of the remedy in the Microsoft case, which the government sought and which Microsoft strenuously resisted, requires a set of subtle judgments and just plain guesses about the environment for Internet-based information and a technology market that even during the two years of the Microsoft trial has evolved with surprising speed away from the desktop and toward wireless hand-held devices.
It also involves, to a degree that no other antitrust case has, questions about maintaining the country's leadership in the global economy. Of all the earlier antitrust cases, only the AT&T case came close to having such global implications. "If we had left AT&T where it was, we'd have a stodgy, nondynamic telecommunications world today, and we'd never even know what we were missing," said Harvey J. Goldschmid, an antitrust professor at Columbia Law School, in an interview.
Nearly 20 years further into the information revolution, the implications of a wrong bet on the Microsoft remedy are even greater, given the dominance that Microsoft's success has meant for the United States. While the government's economic experts have dismissed the warnings of Mr. Gates, that efficiency and synergy will be lost by cleaving the Windows operating system from the software applications, the fact is nobody knows for sure.
Indeed, Charles D. Weller, an antitrust specialist at the Cleveland law firm of Baker & Hostetler, commented today that under the Supreme Court's current skeptical view of expert testimony -- a view the justices have applied in negligence cases but not yet directly to antitrust cases -- the economists who testified on both sides should have been disqualified.
Breaking up Microsoft "is not like breaking up two factories," Professor Goldschmid said. "A breakup may well be the appropriate remedy," he said, "but the tough part is that there is a heavy investment in human capital, and breaking up Microsoft means changing things for a lot of people."

Chart: "Landmarks in Antitrust History"
The Microsoft case marks the latest major test of antitrust law. Here are some of the biggest and most important earlier battles.
 
Defendant (Decided)
Standard Oil of New Jersey (1911)
 
Complaint
Monopolizing oil business by buying rivals, forcing railroads to discriminate against other rivals and buying up pipelines so competitors could not use them.
 
Outcome
Found in violation
 
Result
Standard Oil was split into 34 companies, many of which are now among the world's largest oil companies, including Exxon, Mobil, Chevron and Amoco.
 
Defendant (Decided)
American Tobacco (1911)
 
Complaint
Monopolizing the cigarette trade through practices like predatory pricing and excluding rivals from access to wholesalers.
 
Outcome
Found in violation
 
Result
Split into 16 pieces, including American Tobacco, Reynolds, Liggett & Myers and P. Lorillard.
 
Defendant (Decided)
U.S. Steel (1920)
 
Complaint
Monopolizing the steel business by its sheer size. The company controlled about two-thirds of the market and met regularly with rivals to set prices.
 
Outcome
Cleared
 
Result
The Supreme Court ruled that sheer size alone did not constitute a monopoly. The decision brought a halt to big antitrust cases for almost 20 years.
 
Defendant (Decided)
Alcoa (1945)
 
Complaint
Monopolizing aluminum production by its sheer size and by its ability to anticipate and satisfy demand for aluminum faster and at a lower cost than rivals could.
 
Outcome
Found in violation
 
Result
An appeals court found that the company was anticompetitive. To remedy this, the government auctioned off some wartime plants operated by Alcoa to smaller aluminum companies.
 
Defendant (Decided)
AT&T (1982)
 
Complaint
Using its monopoly of local phone service to keep competitors out of the long-distance and telephone equipment markets.
 
Outcome
Settled
 
Result
AT&T agreed to spin off its local phone companies.
 
Defendant (Decided)
Aspen Skiing (1985)
 
Complaint
Exerting monopoly power, the owner of three of the four major ski runs in Aspen, Colo., ended a joint program with the owner of Aspen Highlands under which they both sold tickets allowing skiers on any of the mountains.
 
Outcome
Found in violation
 
Result
The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had discontinued the program solely to injure its competitor. The company was ordered to pay damages. Later, it resumed its partnership with Aspen Highlands.

No Level Field For Athletes In Schools

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
IT'S not that Martin Jacobson is a patient man. He is not. But Mr. Jacobson, the soccer coach at Martin Luther King High School, is a realist: "Come on. This is New York. You put up with it."
What he and his team tolerate is hard to believe, even in New York. Changing clothes on the subway because of inadequate locker rooms in the school on Manhattan's West Side. Spending 90 minutes taking two trains and a bus to a playing field on Randalls Island. Lugging 40 pounds of nets to practice. Raising money to buy uniforms. 
 All of this when New York City has a budget surplus and is committing generous capital dollars to building two minor-league baseball stadiums: for the Yankees in the St. George section of Staten Island and for the Mets in Coney Island.
"Let them have their stadiums, that's O.K.," Mr. Jacobson said. "But they are neglecting teenagers in high school. We need more cooperation." And more money.
It's not school athletic facilities vs. professional sports stadiums. There can be both. There are both. But look at the relative numbers:
For public school ball fields, in the new city operating budget: $10 million.
For minor-league stadiums, in the new city capital budget: $142 million. That's $71 million for the Yankees complex on Staten Island (which includes local improvements like a new esplanade); $61 million for the Mets ballpark, including $30 million to spruce up the boardwalk area; and $10 million for temporary ballparks. Plus plans down the road to contribute $30 million to an amateur sports complex for southern Brooklyn, subject to future budget votes.
All this spending, while Mr. Jacobson and his team -- ranked among the top five in the country -- have to finagle just to get playing time at Randalls Island or at Riverbank State Park. And they are hardly the only ones with such problems.
Only a third of the city's high schools have their own playing fields, and many are in bad shape. Finding playing space anywhere is a challenge. Not only are athletic fields in this vertical city scarce, but public schools have to compete with private schools and adult teams that can pay higher users' fees.
The Board of Education has a new physical fitness initiative, but the city is still spending almost a third less on sports equipment and supplies than it did on the eve of its fiscal crisis in 1974.
This has to make one wonder about priorities. Especially since none of this is new. The problems were documented in a series of New York Times articles last year, portrayed on "60 Minutes," and cited just last week by Mark Green, the public advocate.
The bad publicity did get attention. A new private group, Take the Field, was begun in February and is raising money; it is already adding about $3 million to the city's $10 million for athletic fields -- enough to build at least one major track and field facility in each borough.
BUT school officials estimate that they need $300 million to upgrade fields and playgrounds, not to mention pools and gyms.
"It's hard to justify spending over $100 million on minor-league stadiums when not even 40 percent of our high schools have outdoor playing fields," Mr. Green said, adding that the Staten Island project "seems more like patronage than investment," because the borough has been such a stronghold for Mr. Giuliani, until recently a Senate candidate in pursuit of votes.
The mayor says that economic development, not politics, was his motive, and contends that the stadiums will act as catalysts. Michael G. Carey, president of his Economic Development Corporation, expressed confidence yesterday that "improving barren areas will bring private investments."
But many an economist disputes that theory. Building a stadium "doesn't create development, doesn't generate jobs, raise per capita income -- it does just about nothing," said Andrew S. Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who consults with governments about sports facilities. "Just take a drive up to Yankee Stadium and see all the activity it's spawned. There isn't any."
But City Hall is betting that investing in St. George and Coney Island will be different. And the City Council did what legislatures generally do when voting on spending money in their own communities: approve.
So the Yankees and the Mets will have their farm teams, if litigation does not get in the way. And Mr. Jacobson and his players will continue to scramble. "Nothing's changed," he said. "I've learned to accept deplorable conditions. Hey. This is New York."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
At Meeting of Tribal Leaders, Gore Taps a New Font of Cash

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif., June 7

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore, ever on the prowl for money, has found a new source: American Indians.
Beginning a three-day West Coast campaign swing, Mr. Gore raised nearly $1 million at three events today, including $400,000 from a group of Indians at a luncheon in Palm Springs at the Hilton Hotel. 
 Edward G. Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, which organized the events, said that although many Indians had attended fund-raisers for the party in the past, these were the first events held exclusively with Indians. Representatives of 16 tribes from the region -- there are more than 400 tribes across the country -- were in Palm Springs attending a tribal council meeting, and about 40 of them ate lunch with Mr. Gore.
Mr. Rendell, who noted the emerging economic power among Indians from casinos and shopping malls, said that at least 80 percent of those Indians who voted traditionally voted Democratic, and there seemed to be considerable support for the vice president among this group.
"Al Gore has made a commitment to who we are as a people," Mary Ann Martin Andreas, chairwoman of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians from Banning, Calif., said in introducing the vice president.
Barbara Gonzales Lyons of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahulla Indians, and vice chairwoman of the council, said, "Vice President Al Gore has taken the time to meet and speak with us and candidate Bush has not," referring to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Gore's Republican rival.
Other officials said that Indians looked more favorably on Mr. Gore than on Mr. Bush because Mr. Bush had suggested that states be allowed to determine whether gambling could occur on Indian reservations. Without directly endorsing gambling, Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, said of the Indians, "We support their right to do what they want to do on their land."
In a brief and solemn speech, Mr. Gore said that he recognized that the tribes' agenda -- including better health care and more economic opportunities -- had received too little attention. "I don't wear rose-colored glasses," he said, "but I think that it's important to take stock of the fact that we have made success in the direction of progress."
He cited his support for tribal sovereignty, tribal hunting and fishing rights and economic empowerment zones, but said more needed to be done to attract investments and jobs to Indian reservations.
"I know -- I say that I know, but I don't know in the same way that you know -- the burden of history on Indian people," Mr. Gore said. He said he understood how "travails as well as opportunities can cascade down through the generations, parents to children to grandchildren and on and on, to the seventh generation and then beyond." Indians traditionally refer to the seventh generation as a symbol of the future. But, he said, "we have the ability to interrupt the cycle."
Although Mr. Gore was collecting money from this group, he lamented doing so. "I accept that there's a great irony in this process," he said, adding that he was determined to overhaul the campaign finance system. "We need sweeping reforms to end the money chase," he said.
Mr. Gore then flew here to a fund-raising reception at the home of Brad Krevoy, chief executive officer of the Motion Picture Corporation of America, where 100 people gave $1,000 each to the Democratic Party.
He then had a date at the Conga Room in Los Angeles, where 65 people were paying $5,000 each to have dinner with him.

HEADLINE: Budget Offers Perks to Boroughs Other Than Manhattan

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and City Council leaders joked this week about what to call them: the "outer boroughs" or the "other boroughs"? But the reason for the bantering was no joke: the $37.6 billion budget approved this week includes an unusually large share of money and other perks for sections of the city outside Manhattan.
The 2001 budget package includes $30 million in extra money to renovate or expand parks and cultural institutions in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. It also sweetens incentives for businesses to relocate to certain parts of the boroughs in an effort to broaden the city's recent economic boom. 
 "The Manhattan economic renaissance has become somewhat self- sustaining," said Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher, a Brooklyn Democrat whose district would benefit from the economic development program. "We have the opportunity and obligation to open up the winner's circle so other parts of the city can participate."
The borough-based extras are among the handful of special initiatives included in next year's budget, along with other items like the first significant increase in many years in funds for cultural institutions and an intensified pitch to stimulate biomedical research at teaching hospitals.
The economic development program would, among other things, offer a tax credit to companies that relocate businesses from central Manhattan or from outside the city to Long Island City in Queens, Red Hook and parts of downtown Brooklyn, St. George in Staten Island and the Fordham Road section of the Bronx. The tax credit would be worth $3,000 a year for 12 years for each new employee.
Even if the companies make no profits -- and therefore pay no business taxes -- they would get a $3,000 payment from the city for each relocated employee in the first two years. The city would also offer grants to help companies demolish buildings to prepare sites for new construction. And the relocating companies would be offered abatements on part of their property tax bill, all part of an effort to make it more affordable to move to the other boroughs, instead of, perhaps, New Jersey, city officials said.
Some of the incentives already exist, but the new program offers enhancements, and it is intended to bring high-technology jobs to the other boroughs and prevent manufacturing jobs from leaving the city.
"We need this; the city needs this," said Paul Bader, the owner of City Imprint Inc., a Manhattan-based printing company, who said he had seen too many other printing companies move out of the city because of rising costs in Manhattan and too few alternatives for relocation within the city. "It is vital to the maintenance of manufacturing businesses."
The extra money for construction projects at parks and cultural institutions in the other boroughs -- the term that Mr. Giuliani told the Council members he preferred -- was added to the budget shortly before it was adopted this week.
It includes $3 million to build soccer fields at Flushing Meadows in Queens, $3 million to renovate the fountain at Grand Army Plaza and Litchfield Villa in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and $1 million to renovate tennis courts at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, all in the coming year. These projects are in addition to other major capital projects in the other boroughs like a new courthouse on Jay Street in Brooklyn and a new Willis Avenue Bridge.
Among other initiatives in the new budget is an increase of $7 million, amounting to $10 million, in grants that the city intends to offer hospitals and universities to further biomedical research. Another $2 million would be invested over the next two years to help build a biology research center at the City University of New York in upper Manhattan.
Dr. Jeremiah A. Barondess, the president of the New York Academy of Medicine, said that the city's share of federal biomedical research funds had dropped in recent years, making it harder for universities and hospitals to attract top researchers. The city grant fund, which he said he thought would be the only one of its kind in the country, should help reverse that trend.
The budget also contains good news for cultural groups. An extra $7 million was put into the budget for institutions like the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Natural History, the Queens Botanical Garden, Wave Hill in the Bronx and Snug Harbor Cultural Center in Staten Island.
"This is a much needed increase and the first substantive increase in more than a decade," said Arnold L. Lehman, director of the Brooklyn Museum. In 1990, the museum closed its doors for a second day each week. Officials would not say if they were considering returning to a six-day-a-week schedule.
The budget also has $176,000 for each Council member to spend on programs for youths, senior citizens and other purposes. The amount is $20,000 more than what was allotted in the current fiscal year.. That money is going to dozens of groups, among them the Alzheimer's Association of Staten Island and the Astoria Youth League.
City officials said they could accommodate the new initiatives in the 2001 budget while cutting taxes by more than $400 million and reducing overall city-taxpayer-financed spending by about 3 percent.
But officials in the Independent Budget Office said yesterday that Mr. Giuliani's accounting method understated the actual increase in city spending, which they put at 8 percent.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investment in U.S. Climbs to Record

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Foreign investment in the United States climbed to a record $282.9 billion in 1999, the government said today. It was the second consecutive year that heavy merger activity pushed foreign purchases of American companies to record levels.
The Commerce Department said today that last year's total represented a 31.4 percent increase from the record of $215.3 billion set in 1998. 
 Foreign investment in both years was far above any previous year. The 1998 figure was triple the $69.7 billion in foreign investment recorded in 1997.
Much of the activity over the last two years represents a boom in telecommunications takeovers as global giants jockey for position in the emerging technologies of wireless telephone and Internet services.
Of the $282.9 billion spent by foreign companies or their United States subsidiaries to purchase or start United States companies, $93.5 billion, the single largest amount, came in information concerns. That category includes telecommunications and broadcasting companies, which accounted for $80.1 billion of the total. Movie, record and publishing companies are also included in the information category.
By country, Britain outranked all other nations with $110.1 billion in spending last year in the United States, over half of the $205.2 billion in purchases that came from companies based in Europe.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE COMPANY;
Gates Says the Court Fight Has Just Begun

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash., June 7

 BODY:
From the perspective of the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest software company, the fat lady hasn't sung.
Arguing that his legal battle with the federal government is far from over, William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief software architect, said today that he was looking forward to the next round of the antitrust trial, which will soon move to a higher court. 
 "I'm reminded of the old saying that, 'Today is the first day of the rest of your life,' " Mr. Gates said during a news conference here on the sprawling campus of his company. "I believe very strongly that today is the first day of the rest of this case."
Mr. Gates appeared calm today, briefly stumbling over his words at the outset of his prepared remarks but then warming to his theme that during the appeals, Microsoft would continue to do what he believed the company does best: design software.
He reiterated his belief that Microsoft had done nothing wrong. And when asked if he felt he might have done anything differently, he responded that his only regret was not articulating Microsoft's story earlier and more clearly to the American public.
"Microsoft and the whole story of the PC was missed here," he said. "I should have taken the opportunity to go and talk about this industry and what it has meant in terms of empowering people."
Although Mr. Gates did not go so far as to assert that what was good for Microsoft was good for America, he generally outlined a view that his company has been an engine of progress, which is now in peril.
"Today's ruling represents an unwarranted intrusion into the software marketplace that has been an engine of growth for the economy," he said.
Mr. Gates argued that the company's principal contribution was in transforming what was once a low-volume and high-cost computer industry into a fast-paced, mass market business, in which Microsoft's Windows operating system allowed consumers to benefit from new features that enhanced the power of desktop computing.
Speaking in front of seven of his top executives -- including Robert J. Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer; William H. Neukom, its chief lawyer; Jeff Raikes, a veteran marketing executive; and Mitch Matthews, the current marketing chief -- Mr. Gates said that his most important challenge today was to pursue developments in technologies like speech recognition and computing on tablets.
He also sought to define the substance of the antitrust case narrowly, saying that at its heart the case was about nothing more than whether his company had the right to add Internet browsing capabilities to its operating systems.
At one point, while a cluster of more than 30 reporters and television cameramen gathered in front of a large-screen television in the lobby of the Microsoft television studio, glued to a CNN news report on the judge's ruling, Mr. Gates, clad in a sweater and khakis, strolled past the press corps and was virtually unnoticed.
At today's news conference, Mr. Gates answered questions for several minutes before he then turned the meeting over to Microsoft's chief counsel, Mr. Neukom, who proceeded to give a preview of the company's strategy for its appeal, which he said would be filed in a matter of days.
"I think both the substance of the case and the lack of any process during the remedy phases make a compelling case for our appeal," Mr. Neukom said.
Mr. Neukom, who led the company's defense before federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in the 20-month-long trial, also pointedly attacked the many state attorneys general -- without mentioning them by name -- for foiling the company's attempts to reach a negotiated settlement with the Justice Department during a mediation attempt by Judge Richard A. Posner of the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago several months ago.
The feelings Mr. Gates expressed today about how his company has been treated unfairly by government prosecutors are echoed among Microsoft's 34,000 employees.
On the Redmond campus, there has been a palpable sense in recent months of a closing of ranks, according to a number of Microsoft employees.
The view here is that Microsoft is the victim of a small Silicon Valley cabal. This group of industry chieftains were fairly vanquished in the market, Microsoft employees often say, but decided to carry on their war in the courts.
Moreover, there is a sense in Redmond that the situation was exacerbated by what many here view as the media circus that surrounded the antitrust trial.
"We've become the designated whipping boy for corporate misbehavior," said one of the company's top executives. "It leaves other companies free to merge and engage in all kinds of behaviors without being noticed."
Other employees said that there were no surprises for them in today's ruling, even as they insisted that Judge Jackson's decision to endorse the government's proposed breakup was clearly wrongheaded.
"Given all the media coverage of this, I'm not surprised," said George Bullock, a programmer who works for the company's MSDN group, which creates tools for software developers. "But I wholeheartedly disagree with the government's case."
But while there was widespread disappointment over the outcome so far of the case, many employees took issue with Microsoft's contention, made in its last court filing in the case on Tuesday, that a breakup could lead to mass defections among the company's work force.
"I still believe in Microsoft and I still like what I do here," said Franc Camara, a program manager in the company's Windows Division. "As long as I'm doing something interesting, I don't care if it is broken into two, or three, or four companies."
Mr. Gates clearly remains a revered figure in the Seattle area. The case has been closely watched by many of the region's residents, who can discuss the detailed legal turns and twists in the case with little trouble.
At the Seattle airport today, Mr. Gates had many fans on his side. "I think that if the company is split up, it will harm consumers and raise costs," said an employee at a rental car counter. "Tell Bill Gates that Jenny at Avis said 'Hi' and is supporting him."
She noted that she owned a small amount of Microsoft stock. When asked about its recent performance, she frowned slightly and turned her thumb down.

HEADLINE: Albright Tells Syrians an Accord for Palestinians Is First Goal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: CAIRO, June 7

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright told Syrian and Egyptian officials today that the Clinton administration was willing to push once more for peace talks between Damascus and Israel, but that its main goal in its remaining months in office was a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
"There is no higher foreign policy priority for the Clinton administration than an Israeli-Palestinian peace," Dr. Albright said between meetings with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Foreign Minister Farouk Shara of Syria. 
 Capping a hastily scheduled three-day swing through the Middle East, Dr. Albright appeared to be trying to clear the rubble off both tracks of the peace effort. Arriving this morning from Israel, where she secured an agreement to resume talks with the Palestinians next week in Washington, Dr. Albright reiterated President Clinton's hopes for conclusive negotiations there this summer with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the president of the Palestinian Authority, Yasir Arafat.
Asked whether the troubles of Mr. Barak's coalition might disrupt the plans, Dr. Albright said Washington was sticking to "its own timetable" for a peace pact.
"This is a rare opportunity to reach an accord, and we cannot let it slip away," she said.
In an hourlong meeting with Mr. Shara, she stressed that "the door is still open" to a renewal of American-sponsored talks between Syria and Israel, a senior American official said. This was the first high-level Syrian-American encounter since Mr. Clinton's meeting with President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva in March, when the Syrians effectively ended the talks by insisting that Israel would have to surrender not just the entire Golan Heights, but also the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.
"We are beyond Geneva," a senior American official said after the meeting. "We are looking forward. We are not looking backward."
Dr. Albright made it clear that the administration was aiming for a comprehensive pact between Israel and the Palestinians, not Syria. She said she believed that Israel and the Palestinian Authority could negotiate compromises on core issues like refugees and the status of Jerusalem before Sept. 13, the date that Mr. Arafat has pledged to move toward the establishment of an independent state with or without an agreement.
"Sometimes deadlines focus the mind," Dr. Albright said. "I would just like to announce, for those who care, we are not having a summer vacation."
Washington is also keeping a wary eye on the still volatile situation in southern Lebanon. Dr. Albright said she expected the United Nations to certify soon that Israel has fully withdrawn, following the terms of United Nations resolutions adopted after Israel occupied the zone 22 years ago. But Lebanon and Israel continue to wrangle over fragments of territory along the hilly border line, which has never been definitively negotiated or even surveyed.
Israel pulled back today from two small outposts north of a provisional boundary newly demarcated by United Nations cartographers. But the United Nations mission that is supervising the pullout contends that Israel continues to violate withdrawal requirements in another pocket, of pastures, near a border kibbutz. The disagreement, though minor, may further delay official certification of the withdrawal, which is required before United nations forces can be deployed in the region.
Dr. Albright's discussions with Mr. Shara dealt as much with the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as with prospects for new bilateral talks, United States officials said. American and Israeli officials have voiced concern that violence in southern Lebanon could disrupt talks with the Palestinians, because of its political effects in Israel and the fear that it could spark outbreaks by dissidents in the West Bank and Gaza.
Syria has more than 30,000 troops in Lebanon and maintains effective political and economic control over the country. Dr. Albright urged Beirut and Damascus to do more to pacify the frontier zone, Hezbollah guerrillas now largely govern.
In her talks with Mr. Shara, Dr. Albright did not reiterate the demand for a Syrian withdrawal, concentrating on Syrian acceptance of the United Nations verification of Israel's withdrawal, United States officials said. Damascus and Washington are now "pretty much in agreement" about the certification terms, an American official said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: AROUND THE NATION;
Montana Voters Pick Candidates for Governor and Senate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER, June 7

 BODY:
With Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term, his lieutenant governor, Judy Martz, and State Auditor Mark O'Keefe had little trouble winning their gubernatorial primaries on Tuesday to face each other in the November general election.
Democrats regard Montana as one of their best hopes for picking up a governorship, as well as seats in Congress. 
 In the Democratic primary, Mr. O'Keefe won 48 percent of the vote to defeat two other state officials, Attorney General Joseph P. Mazurek, with 36 percent, and Secretary of State Mike Cooney, with 16 percent.
Ms. Martz, a Republican who has served with Mr. Racicot since 1996, had 57 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Rob Natelson, a law professor who fared better this time than four years ago, when he won only 24 percent in a challenge to Mr. Racicot.
Montana was also one of several states that held Congressional primaries on Tuesday. In winning the state's Democratic Senate primary, Brian Schweitzer, a farmer who made the high cost of prescription drugs a campaign focus, easily defeated John Driscoll, a former state public service commissioner. He now faces Senator Conrad Burns, the two-term Republican incumbent, who had no primary opponent.
Ms. Martz and Mr. O'Keefe both said they would make economic development a priority. Montana ranks lowest among the states in average wages, 47th in per capita income and, Mr. O'Keefe said, first in the percentage of families in which the chief wage earner holds at least two jobs.
Mr. O'Keefe said those rankings reflected how poorly the Racicot administration had performed, but Ms. Martz said the situation had been far worse when Mr. Racicot took office in 1993, when the state was $200 million in debt.
In New Mexico, Democrats held primaries in all three of the state's Congressional districts. Seeking the right to oppose Representative Joe Skeen, a 10-term Republican from the Second Congressional District, State Treasurer Michael A. Montoya narrowly defeated Mike Runnels, a district attorney, despite a recent investigation by the New Mexico state police into accusations that Mr. Montoya's brother, Orlando Montoya, diverted money from his construction business into the campaign.
Michael Montoya won 52 percent of the vote to 48 percent for Mr. Runnels, a showing that Mr. Montoya said might have been helped by a sympathetic backlash against the police investigation, which, so far, has produced no charges.
In the First Congressional District, John J. Kelly, a former United States attorney, won 43 percent of the vote in a three-way race to face Representative Heather A. Wilson, a first-term Republican whom Democrats view as one of the most vulnerable members of the House majority. Mr. Kelly defeated Sam Bregman, a former Albuquerque City Council member, who won 33 percent of the vote, and John V. Wertheim, the party's nominee four years ago, who had 24 percent.
Both Mr. Skeen and Ms. Wilson ran unopposed, but not so New Mexico's other incumbent representative, Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat, who soundly defeated Francesca Lobato, a tax lawyer from Santa Fe, with 83 percent of the vote.
Lisa L. Lutz, a state representative, ran unopposed to win the Republican nomination.
In the Republican Senate primary, former Representative Bill Redmond breezed to victory in a three-way race, with 60 percent of the vote, to oppose Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat seeking his fourth term. State Representative Stevan E. Pearce had 22 percent and State Senator William F. Davis had 18 percent.
In South Dakota, Curt Hohn, general manager of the Water Development Association, beat two other Democrats for the right to oppose Representative John Thune, a two-term Republican who was expected to win in November no matter who prevailed among the Democrats. With the turnout extremely light, Mr. Hohn won 56 percent of the vote, to 36 percent for Steve Sandven and 7 percent for Raymond Osloond .
In Iowa, each party had two primaries. In the First Congressional District, Democrats chose Bob Simpson over Gregory Guy by almost 2 to 1, although Mr. Simpson is given only a slim chance against Representative Jim Leach, the 12-term Republican incumbent. In the Third Congressional District, Jay Marcus narrowly defeated Phil Ferren to oppose Iowa's only Democratic House member, Leonard L. Boswell, who is seeking a third term.
Both parties held primaries in the Fifth Congressional District. Mike Palecek defeated Conrad Lawlor for the Democratic nomination, and Representative Tom Latham, a Republican seeking a fourth term, easily turned back Thomas Hall.
In the only Alabama Congressional contest, Representative Earl F. Hilliard, a four-term Democrat from a solidly Democratic district, the Seventh, won 58 percent of the vote to defeat two challengers, Arthur Davis and Wayne Sowell. Ed Martin won the right to oppose him for the Republicans.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MIRCROSOFT: THE OVERVIEW;
MICROSOFT BREAKUP IS ORDERED FOR ANTITRUST LAW VIOLATIONS

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
A federal judge ordered the breakup of the Microsoft Corporation today, saying the severe remedy was necessary because Microsoft "has proved untrustworthy in the past" and did not appear to have accepted his ruling that it had broadly violated the nation's antitrust laws.
"There is credible evidence in the record to suggest that Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as it has in the past and may yet do to other markets what it has already done" to dominate operating systems and Internet software, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said in his final ruling in the long-running trial. Text, Page C12. 
 Under his order, Microsoft would be broken into separate and competing companies, one for its Windows operating system and one for its other computer programs and Internet businesses. It would also be forced to comply with a long list of restrictions on its conduct lasting three years if the breakup order withstands appeal, and 10 years if it does not.
Microsoft said it would appeal the case to the Court of Appeals, filing the papers within a few days, while the government said this evening that it would try to bypass that court and ask immediate review by the Supreme Court.
While an appeal proceeds, Judge Jackson's order stays the breakup plan, but not the restrictions on the company's conduct. Microsoft intends, however, to ask that the entire order be stayed.
The government charged, and the judge agreed, that Microsoft had used its monopoly in operating systems to put competitors at a disadvantage and stifle innovation.
In surprisingly assertive language, Judge Jackson accepted the government's remedy proposal in its entirety, attaching it to his ruling -- utterly rejecting Microsoft's repeated assertions that the breakup plan was "Draconian," "unwarranted" and "bad for consumers, the high-tech industry and our economy."
William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, called the judge's ruling "an unwarranted and unjustified intrusion into the software marketplace, a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for America."
"The idea that someone would say that a breakup is a reasonable thing comes as quite a surprise to us," Mr. Gates added. "We have a very strong case on appeal, and we look forward to resolving these issues through the appeals process and putting this case behind us once and for all."
Mr. Gates was in Washington on Tuesday, planning to meet with lawmakers today. Anticipating the ruling, though, he canceled the meetings and hurriedly flew back to Seattle overnight.
Attorney General Janet Reno, smiling broadly, said this afternoon that the ruling "will have a profound impact, not only by promoting competition in the software industry, but also by reaffirming the importance of antitrust law enforcement in the 21st century." And Joel I. Klein, head of the department's antitrust division, said, "Microsoft itself is responsible for where things stand today."
If the judge's order withstands appeal and Microsoft is eventually broken up, it would join a handful of major national monopolies that have been taken apart over the last 90 years as a result of antitrust violations, including Standard Oil, American Tobacco and the Aluminum Company of America.
Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, speaking on behalf of the 19 states that are partners with the Justice Department in the Microsoft case, said the ruling "sends a strong message that no company is above the law." (Two of the 19 states, Illinois and Ohio, declined to support the breakup plan.)
If Microsoft's request for a stay of Judge Jackson's order is rejected, the company must begin complying with the conduct restrictions by Sept. 7 and submit a detailed plan for dividing the company by Oct. 7.
With Judge Jackson's encouragement, the Justice Department announced that it would take the case directly to the Supreme Court, under a 1974 revision to the federal antitrust laws allowing fast-track consideration of significant antitrust cases.
Microsoft opposes the direct appeal to the Supreme Court, preferring to take its case first to the Court of Appeals, which ruled in its favor in a related lawsuit two years ago and reversed a decision by Judge Jackson.
Whether the Supreme Court would even take the case is at best uncertain. Microsoft argued this evening that the suit filed by the states would not be eligible for expedited appeal because the states have no similar law. In that case, the states' appeal would be taken to the Court of Appeals. But state and federal officials said that because the cases were joined for trial, it would make no sense to separate them for differing legal appeals.
The officials acknowledged that the point of law was ambiguous. But Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of Connecticut, said, "Today's victory vindicates and soundly validates our decisions as state law enforcement officers to join this historic action."
If the conduct restrictions are allowed to take effect, computer manufacturers will be allowed to offer customized versions of Windows on their computers in ways they never could before. And future versions of Windows will be offered in a form that allows buyers to accept certain new software features Microsoft chooses to offer -- or to decide they do not want them and use a competing product.
It was Microsoft's decision four years ago to tie a Web browser to Windows that prompted the investigation and lawsuits that led to the breakup order today.
Years from now, if the government's remedy plan works as intended, consumers might also begin to see alternate operating systems on sale that are competitive with Windows. If that occurs, the broad compatibility among personal computers that exists today might begin to erode.
Judge Jackson issued his ruling at 4:30 this afternoon, just after the stock markets had closed. His decision had been widely expected, and investors appeared to have already taken the breakup plan into account. Microsoft stock was up 87.5 cents today, to close at $70.50.
Asked at a news conference today if he had any regrets, Mr. Gates said: "If I look back at anything, I think, perhaps I should have taken the opportunity to go in person and talk about this industry."
Whether Mr. Gates might be called as a witness was a continuing question during the antitrust trial. His halting, obdurate performance in a videotaped deposition proved to be a powerful tool for the government in court.
Though Judge Jackson accepted the remedy plan put together by the federal and state governments, his endorsement was not unequivocal.
He noted that the plan was the collective work of senior state and federal officials "in conjunction with multiple consultants." And, he said, the remedy "appears to the court to address the principal objectives of relief in such cases, namely to terminate the unlawful conduct, to prevent its repetition in the future and to revive competition in the relevant markets."
But even though several experts provided "some insight as to how the provisions" of the remedy might work, "for the most part they are merely the predictions of purportedly knowledgeable people as to effects which may or may not ensue if the proposed final judgment is entered," he added. "In its experience, the court has found testimonial predictions of future events generally less reliable even than testimony as to historical fact."
Microsoft severely criticized the judge this evening for his decision to hold no substantive hearings on the government's remedy proposal. Microsoft said it had been surprised by the scope of the plan and had been unable to respond to it adequately in the six weeks since it was offered.
But in his order today, Judge Jackson retorted: "Microsoft's profession of surprise is not credible. From the inception of this case Microsoft knew, from well-established Supreme Court precedents dating from the beginning of the last century, that a mandated divestiture was a possibility, if not a probability, in the event of an adverse result at trial."
In fact, the government first made plain to Microsoft during settlement negotiations a year ago that it planned to ask for a so-called structural remedy. That was repeated during mediation efforts by a federal judge early this year, though the government offered terms short of a breakup after Microsoft said it would not discuss structural remedies.
The judge also explained why he moved through the remedy phase so quickly, saying that he wanted to pass the case to a higher court as soon as possible for validation, revision or rejection of his decision, "to abort any remedial measures before they become irreversible as a practical matter."
If necessary, the judge said he could hold hearings later or "modify the judgment as necessary in accordance with instructions from an appellate court."
Judge Jackson noted, with some apparent irritation, that after he ruled on April 3 that Microsoft was in wide violation of the nation's antitrust laws, Microsoft's leaders continued to assert that "the company has done 'nothing wrong' and that it will be vindicated on appeal."
"The court is well aware," he added, "that there is a substantial body of public opinion, some of it rational, that holds a similar view. If true, then an appellate tribunal should be given an opportunity to confirm it as promptly as possible."
Microsoft's continued assertions of innocence were one reason for his ruling, he said. Another was that "Microsoft has shown no disposition to voluntarily alter its business protocols in any significant respect."
A third reason, he said, was that Microsoft "has proved untrustworthy in the past." As an example, he referred to the precedent case he tried in late 1997, after the government accused Microsoft of illegally tying a Web browser to Windows.
In December 1997, Judge Jackson issued a preliminary injunction ordering Microsoft to separate the two products. That was the ruling later overturned by the Court of Appeals.
But "Microsoft's purported compliance while it was on appeal," the judge said today, "was illusory and its explanation disingenuous."
