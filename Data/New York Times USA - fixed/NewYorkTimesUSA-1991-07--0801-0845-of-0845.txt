HEADLINE: Business Scene;
The Soaring Cost Of Cigarettes

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
WHEN the Labor Department releases its monthly reports on inflation, they often include this sort of sentence: "Tobacco products (mainly cigarettes) were among the items that rose most sharply in price." Fewer and fewer Americans smoke. And the danger to health is a huge disincentive. But in the last decade, no other single item in the Consumer Price Index has gone up as much as cigarettes.
Clearly the cigarette industry, despite the endless anti-smoking campaigns, is achieving price increases that many other industries can only dream of. Even health care did not keep up with the 154.3 percent rise in cigarette prices between 1980 and 1990, although the cost of hospital rooms and prescription drugs ran a very close second and third, respectively. 
 What has made cigarette prices go up so much? Rising Federal, state and local sales taxes have contributed smartly to cigarette inflation. But the biggest contribution has come from the nation's six major cigarette manufacturers, the Labor Department says. Their factory markups are passed along at the retail level, where cigarettes today average $1.67 a pack, up from 63 cents in 1980.
"Like clockwork, the industry raises prices twice a year, in the November-December period and in May-June," said Patrick Jackman, chief of the Consumer Price Division at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The impact of these uniform increases goes beyond the nation's smokers. Even in the recession, cigarette prices (and also the cost of chewing and pipe tobacco, cigars and snuff) rose 12.9 percent, at an annual rate, from January through June. That jump, when many other costs barely rose, gave cigarettes a disproportionate influence on the over-all inflation rate. Of the 2.7 percent rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index in the first six months, cigarette inflation contributed two-tenths of a percent, Mr. Jackman said.
Cigarette manufacturers decline to discuss pricing. But interviews with industry analysts, trade association officials, economists and one representative of a manufacturing company (off the record) offer a lesson in the economics of cigarette pricing.
First, the cigarette industry concedes that consumption will continue to decline at the present rate of 2 percent a year or so, because cigarettes are so widely viewed as unhealthy. Lower prices simply cannot reverse this trend. "If you have a shrinking market and you want to make money, you have no choice but to raise prices," said Emanuel Goldman, a tobacco analyst at Paine Webber Inc.
Helping the industry achieve that goal are the smokers themselves. They accept price increases more than people who buy cereal or neckties. The smoking habit -- many say addiction -- is not easily given up, particularly when the price increases come in small doses: 5 or 6 cents a pack every few months.
There is some level at which sticker price shock does act as an incentive to quit smoking, "but we don't know what it is," said John C. Maxwell Jr., a tobacco analyst at Wheat First Securities. Probably it is well over $2 a pack and less than $4.50. The latter is roughly what cigarettes cost in Canada, where sharply higher sales taxes and a vociferous anti-smoking campaign have been accompanied by a steep drop in smoking.
The American cigarette industry, in fact, is sensitive to price resistance. Five years ago, the manufacturers offered only premium brand cigarettes, such as Marlboro (Philip Morris). These sold, and still sell, at a generally uniform price, which averages $1.75 a pack today. But two less expensive categories were introduced in the late 1980's: generics, such as Doral (R. J. Reynolds), and sub-generics, such as Montclair (American Brands). Each uses different quality tobacco.
As prices have risen, 20 percent of all smokers have dropped down to these lower-priced brands, testimony that even smokers run short of pocket money. But lately the manufacturers have been increasing the prices of the generics much more than those of the premiums. So the spread between the most and least costly categories of cigarettes is narrowing, to about 50 cents a pack.
The constant price increases are a huge source of profits for the manufacturers. Phillip Morris, for example, gets 64 percent of its operating income from cigarettes, more than twice the profit margin of its food and beer lines. The other companies -- Reynolds, American Brands, Liggett, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard -- report similar results.
How long can this cash machine function? American cigarette manufacturers are enjoying strong export growth. They have cracked Japan and other overseas markets in recent years, and exports are expanding faster than domestic consumption is shrinking. So total production is rising, which facilitates price increases at home and helps to hold down the cost of producing each cigarette.
More important, in a world of smokers partial to American low-tar cigarettes, exports could rise for years. "Cigarette production in the United States does not have to drop in our lifetime," Mr. Maxwell declares. Unless the price gets to $4.50 a pack.

HEADLINE: Judges' Panel, Seeing Court Crisis, Combines 26,000 Asbestos Cases

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
In an attempt to reduce the delays and exploding costs of asbestos litigation, a panel of Federal judges issued a ruling today that consolidates more than 26,000 cases and transfers them to a single court.
The ruling, which shifts most Federal asbestos cases from around the nation to the Federal District Court in Philadelphia, reverses five previous rulings by the panel over 14 years. 
 The immediate effect is to halt all asbestos personal-injury cases that have not yet reached trial in Federal courts. The victims, defendants and lawyers must now await a proposed solution from Federal District Judge Charles R. Weiner of Philadelphia, to whom the panel assigned the cases.
 
Recognizing a Court Crisis
 Cases that have already been decided are not affected. These include hundreds of cases arising from shipbuilding at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and thousands affected by the recent reorganization of the Manville Personal Injury Trust by Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn.
The ruling provides official recognition of a growing view among judges and lawyers that many Federal courts are facing a crisis in asbestos litigation. Many plaintiffs must spend years in the courts -- and may even die -- before they or their families receive even a penny of compensation. The ruling also comes in response to arguments by some judges and experts that lawyers' fees and other expenses are rapidly depleting the resources available to compensate victims, and that many asbestos manufacturers and other defendants now face virtually limitless liability, clouding their future.
Asbestos, used for decades in insulation and construction, has been found to cause a variety of afflictions and cancers, ranging from relatively minor problems to fatal conditions like mesothelioma, a tumor of the lungs. Experts predict that by the end of the century as many as 200,000 American deaths will have been caused by asbestos-related diseases. The number is expected to rise to 265,000 by the year 2015.
Asbestos now accounts for the largest number of civil cases in the Federal courts, and asbestos cases are also plaguing many state courts. A growing number of asbestos makers have sought Federal bankruptcy protection in response to the tide of personal-injury lawsuits by employees and others who inhaled asbestos fibers.
The ruling today was handed down in Washington by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, the arm of the Federal judiciary that handles complex cases. The panel found that although it first rejected consolidation of asbestos personal-injury cases 14 years ago, and followed that precedent four more times, it was now "persuaded that this litigation has reached a magnitude, not contemplated in the record before us in 1977, that threatens the administration of justice and that requires a new, streamlined approach."
"The picture is not a pretty one," the panel noted, quoting from a 1985 study by the Rand Corporation. "Decisions concerning thousands of deaths, millions of injuries and billions of dollars are entangled in a litigation system whose strengths have increasingly been overshadowed by its weaknesses."
But the panel also found that while its decision had become necessary, it might not make a quick difference for most plaintiffs and defendants. The judges said they were "under no illusion that centralization will, of itself, markedly relieve the critical asbestos situation." They added, "It offers no panacea."
 
Legal Costs Consume Resources
 They said true progress toward resolving the crisis would also require "the combined and determined efforts of the transferee judge and his judicial colleages," as well as the lawyers and parties involved in the cases. By some estimates, nearly two-thirds of defendants' available resources are being consumed by legal costs.
In reaching its conclusions on what it called "the asbestos mess," the panel quoted a March report by a group of Federal judges appointed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist that found "the situation has reached critical dimensions and is getting worse." That report continued, "What has been a frustrating problem is becoming a disaster of major proportions to both the victims and the producers of asbestos products."
That committee of judges had found that nearly two cases were being filed for every one that had been resolved and that at the current rate more than 48,000 cases would be pending in the Federal courts in three years, with substantially more in the state courts.
The panel's ruling does not instruct Judge Weiner on how to proceed but gives him broad latitude to set up procedures to coordinate all aspects of the cases, from pretrial fact-finding to settlement and trial. There has been considerable speculation among lawyers that he will rely on other judges to handle the enormously complex and intensely fact-specific aspects of the thousands of cases in the courts. In the past, Federal courts have generally rejected consolidation of asbestos cases through techniques like class actions, finding there were too few common issues in either a legal or factual sense.
Judge Weiner is highly regarded by both his colleagues on the bench and by lawyers who have appeared before him. He did not return a telephone call seeking comment, and said through an assistant that he has a policy of not talking to reporters. Before being appointed to the bench in 1967 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, he was an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia and a Pennsylvania State Senator.
Lawyers' comments about the judge in the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, published by Prentice Hall, described him as "still political," "street wise" and "a genius of human behavior." Another lawyer's description in the almanac, which could have particular relevance to his new assignment, said the judge "understands the economics of litigation" and "keeps the parties in mind over and above lawyers' interests."
 
Selection of Judge Weiner
 The panel said it had selected Judge Weiner because his Federal court district now has more asbestos injury and wrongful-death actions than any other. The panel also said he had extensive experience in complex cases and "a track record of accomplishment and successful innovation in asbestos cases." Through 1990, he and his colleagues had disposed of more than 2,000 such cases.
In addition, the judge's Federal district was the one either expressly favored or not objected to in the greatest number of arguments made to the multi-district litigation panel at a hearing in Manhattan in May.
The panel said its order would affect 26,639 actions in 87 Federal districts.
The decision today was delivered by District Judge John F. Nangle of St. Louis and was joined by District Judges Louis H. Pollak of Philadelphia, Halbert O. Woodward of Lubbock, Tex., Robert R. Merhige Jr. of Richmond, and William B. Enright of San Diego. Two other Federal District judges on the panel, S. Hugh Dillin of Indianapolis and Milton Pollack of Manhattan, did not participate in the decision.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
A City Brimming With Peace But Not Many Pots and Pans

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 29

 BODY:
Pots and pans, please, and never mind the plowshares, was the sum of Tatyana Pobirezhnaya's advice to the summit principals today as they gathered to sign a treaty to begin sheathing the world's long-range nuclear swords.
"I can only dream with envy of those pots and pans," the woman said, her back to the Kremlin as she stared longingly at a GUM department store window display of the latest nonstick saucepans and frying pans dangling like sugarplums well beyond her pocketbook. 
"Of course we all pray for peace," she said as a television crew set up across the cobblestoned heart of Red Square to exploit the peerless summit backdrop of the striped towers and domes of St. Basil's Cathedral. "But I can also yearn for a single saucepan from that collection." Hope seemed just that humble among Muscovites as they went about life on a brilliant sun-drenched day most notable for the lack of civic hyperbole over the summit visit of President Bush.
 
New York on the Moskva
 Three years ago, when President Ronald Reagan made his summit visit and kissed babies in Red Square, Moscow was spruced and buttoned up like one big Potemkin Village.
This time, the Government has skipped the Pecksniffian dragnets of 1988 and left the drunks alone with their dreams in the city's darker doorways. The city's many potholes go unfilled except in the direct path of the summit participants.
Traffic police officers can be seen lounging in the sun and hardly bottlenecking the roads with searches for who knows what suspicious element. The city's gay and lesbian residents have emerged from the cellars and attics of the old totalitarianism to hold their first-ever open conference as the new Society of Sexual Minorities -- free, thus far, of nattering intrusions from K.G.B. agents.
This great enduring city, for all its problems, has a casual semblance of the very thing rumored to be fully breaking out in the summit treaty, peace.
 
Windshield on the World
 For some of the American visitors, the only vaguely hostile emotion occurs within their own hearts at the wheel of a car, when, stopped at a traffic light, the latest entrepreneurial youths emerge with rags and cleansers, smearing the windshield as if this were New York, not Moscow.
The new phenomenon is the protiralshchik, the windshield hustler who is cropping up at Moscow's fledgling street markets. He is already appearing without benefit of the Group of Seven technical advice promised this nation at the economic summit meeting this month. He hasn't read the Yavlinsky-Harvard recovery plan. Yet there he is, wielding rag and cunning.
"I turned on my wipers and shouted 'Nyet! Nyet!' as if I were going through the Bronx on my way to Yankee Stadium," a native New Yorker said, confessing to a defensive urban reflex at an intersection encounter. "And then I drove on a bit and thought, 'Oh my God, here I am discouraging free enterprise.' "
 
Reinventing the Weal
 The sense of the city shifting languidly from the cold war can be sensed in the way the old language of suspicion and denunciation is re-adapted for these new times. Now that the missile silos are being better secured under the terms of the new missile treaty, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has shifted the phrase "verification procedures" from the global to the domestic arena.
He has begun calling on his new adversaries -- the sovereignty-seeking Soviet republics -- to agree to "verification procedures" on the now critical issue of precisely how much taxes are collected and how fairly they will be shared among the levels of government. At issue is the relative throw-weight of the tax coffers.
 
The Rabbi Wore Shock
 Of all the language shocks of the opening day none may have matched that of Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky out at the airport as he led in a delegation of rabbis of the Lubavitcher movement from Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn.
"This is the year of great wonders, for the airport public address was welcoming us!" said one of the leaders of a religious movement once driven to ground in pogroms. "And not only in Russian and English, but in Hebrew."
The Lubavitcher rabbis lately attend every summit meeting. They were there in London this month at the Group of Seven gathering. Their goal is not on the open agenda: they want the return, from the libraries of Communism, of the sacred books of the movement's founders. They lobby relentlessly for their holy writ and say President Gorbachev is a mere gesture away from a great mitzvah.
"I'm freaked out of my mind," Rabbi Kotlarsky said, telling how authorities also accorded the rabbis a meeting hall in the local Communist Party executive headquarters. "The year of great wonders, I tell you."
 
Protocol Free-for-All
 Lithuanian officials say it is only a coincidence that in the opening glare of the summit's media spotlight, the President of their breakaway Soviet republic, Vytautas Landsbergis, was in town today meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federation and signing bilateral treaties of sovereign recognition and economic cooperation.
In the 15 months since the republic declared flat-out independence from the Soviet Union, Mr. Landsbergis has been a study in consistency in calmly talking of that other nation, the Soviet Union, and how it continues to ignore his nation's independence.
Today, he had the satisfaction of sharing stage with Mr. Yeltsin. But even more than the ruffles and flourishes involved in that, Mr. Landsbergis drove around Moscow in a caravan that was accorded what might have easily been mistaken as some Soviet recognition of his status. The police took care to stop traffic for him at each intersection and respectfully wave his car on by, as if it had superpower written all over it.
 
Retracting His Claws
 For Jack F. Matlock Jr., the American Ambassador to Moscow, the summit meeting is his final bit of work before he leaves the Foreign Service, and he is enjoying it to the hilt.
The Russians have been expressing their regrets at his leaving, noting that few ambassadors in recent times have spoken a better grade of Russian nor traveled the country as widely and enthusiastically.
He is crafting his closing with a touch of Fellini. Mr. Matlock has taken care to invite to the state dinner this week one of his more exotic Soviet friends, Yevgeny Nazdratenko, a genuine Siberian tiger hunter whom he met in his travels.
 
Setting Is Everything
 The Kremlin beckons as ever with its golden domes and spiky towers, but the place to be lately is at Novo-Ogaryevo, a well-guarded dacha in the suburbs northwest of the city where Mr. and Mrs. Gorbachev will give a luncheon for Mr. and Mrs. Bush.
Very little is known about the place other than that it has been the site lately for the "nine plus one" talks between Mr. Gorbachev and leaders of the nine republics who have been negotiating a new union treaty. One person who has been there described it as a decidedly official place built for talking more than resting. Furniture is described as "late apparatchik."

HEADLINE: Ex-Shoo-In, Bill Bradley Fights Aloof Image

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

 BODY:
He is the same lanky, loose-limbed intellectual who even admirers said would spend three and a half hours on Kremlin politics, four hours on third-world debt and 30 seconds on flood control for Camden; the same politician who nearly lost an election by refusing to talk about anything anybody cared about.
But a chastened Bill Bradley is now trying hard to change all that. 
 It cannot be said that there is a "new" Bill Bradley, but he is taking a radically different approach to things. Interviews and public appearances suggest that New Jersey's senior Senator meant what he said when he insisted after voters vented their anger at the polls last November: "I got the message, I got the message."
 
Backyard Chats in Suburbs
 He has replaced the top echelon of his Washington staff, gone toe-to-toe with a very popular President on the volatile issue of race, and held backyard chats with suburbanites about mundane things like auto insurance and sending the children to college.
"I don't have a particular agenda and I'm not here to make any speeches," he says at visit after visit in backyards and living rooms. "I'm just here to listen to your concerns so I can do a better job."
Is he running for President?
"No," he says for the thousandth time -- at least not at the moment. "And this time," he concedes with what does not seem to be a particularly rueful chuckle, "everybody believes me."
But he takes pains to point out that all this activity is for a purpose, that there is a legislative goal in mind: tax rebates to help rear the children, a tuition-grant plan for college, some method to help with health insurance on the way to a national health plan, which he says is inevitable.
"One thing that came out of the election was my determination to address the economic issues that affect the lives of the people of New Jersey," he said. "Another is my determination to speak out on the issues that affect our daily lives."
 
Anger at Bush on 'Politics of Race'
 Chief among them, he says, is race. He has given two major speeches in which he accused President Bush of inciting racial division, saying it was unconscionable that the President would "play the politics of race while economic inequality increases" -- a theme that he reiterated Sunday on the NBC news program "Meet the Press."
The tough criticism generated headlines across the country and Mr. Bush labeled it "grossly unfair." Mr. Bradley said in a recent interview that he had spoken out of personal anger and intended to "call Bush out" any time he finds him "playing racial politics."
The campaign, Mr. Bradley said, freed him from some of his customary circumspection.
"Life is short," he said in an interview between stops last week. "Coming out of the election I realized that it might be over tomorrow. And the question was, what have you ever said or done while you were there, today? Forget about next year or five years or 10 years -- what are you doing today?
 
Republicans 'Have to Pay a Price'
 "Part of that is trusting your intuition and your values and feelings. Yield to those impuses and channel what was, and is, a deep anger" at Mr. Bush's tactics.
"The Republicans have paid no price for divisive racial politics," he said. "They should have to pay a price."
But even the post-election Bill Bradley has not cast caution entirely to the winds. Does he support President Bush's nomination of Clarence Thomas, a black conservative, to the Supreme Court, for example?
"I regard him the same as every other nominee," he said in answer to an interview question. "Let's let the hearing process work, then make your call."
Even a measured opinion gives the electorate a chance to get reacquainted -- or acquainted -- with Bill Bradley. While the Senator still evokes memories of the "dream-team" Knicks, new voters who were only 4 years old when he left basketball in 1977 know him only as a politician, and a rather distant one at that.
 
Referendum on Bradley's Silence
 William J. Palatucci, chief media consultant for Christine Todd Whitman, the unknown Republican who lost to Mr. Bradley last November by a margin of 49 to 51 percent, says that Mr. Bradley indeed got the message in the election. It became a referendum on the Senator's silence on critical issues like the $2.8 billion tax increase pushed through by Gov. Jim Florio and its impact in New Jersey.
"He's not the same guy sent to the Senate 12 years ago, the dashing professional athlete destined to be a national leader," said Mr. Palatucci. "He was the American dream. Now you see people shrug their shoulders and say, 'Ah, just another politician.' "
As a result, says Mr. Palatucci, "He has woken up. It's the first time in 12 years he has been taken to double overtime."
A tangible sign of change has been the extensive shakeup of the Senator's Washington staff. Gone is Marcia Aronoff, his chief of staff since 1978; and other top aides, including his communications director and his director of state operations. Mr. Bradley maintains his customary caution in discussing the departures, saying that most resulted because "people want to move on after 12 years." But he also conceded that "after the election I tended to look at things differently, so you set out to do things differently."
His new chief of staff, Peter Stamos, like Mr. Bradley a Rhodes Scholar, spends at least one day a week in New Jersey, but is from California. Among the critics, Mr. Palatucci groused that he "couldn't find his way down the New Jersey Turnpike without a map."
The 33-year-old Mr. Stamos is a former management consultant with a doctorate in political economy from Oxford. His doctoral dissertation was titled "The Performance of the Swedish Health Care System During the Economic Crises of the 1970's." He graduated from Stanford and has a law degree from Harvard.
While he concedes that his academic background and California upbringing may at first blush seem ill suited to reconstruct Mr. Bradley's image as the quintessential New Jerseyan, Mr. Stamos notes that he is the grandson of Greek immigrants and has numerous relatives in the state.
 
Accused of Ignoring Constituents
 In the past, Mr. Bradley and his staff have drawn fire for failure to bring Federal money to the state -- New Jersey ranks near rock bottom in return on its tax dollars -- and in attention to constituent services.
"He has too many people in his office that look at constituent work as the lowest form of service, as an irritant, bothersome and inconvenient," said an aide to another Democratic Senator who says he likes Mr. Bradley and works closely with his staff. "To deign to get your hands dirty and deliver taxpayer money to New Jersey is beneath their dignity. They see Washington as a political science seminar."
Mr. Stamos declines to discuss the performance of the previous Bradley staff, but says: "My objective is to create the best constituent and client services in Washington."
But Mr. Stamos also said that "by serving New Jersey, we will also serve the nation," because the concerns of New Jersey's middle class mirror those of the country at large.
"What's wonderful about New Jersey is that its problems are the problems of the nation: health care, education, inner city crime and drugs. New Jersey is where we learn."
As Mr. Bradley journeyed across the state last week, for example, he unveiled a new college aid system he introduced in the Senate last Thursday. The plan would provide grants to students who promise to pay back a percentage of their future income.
A student who borrowed $10,000 would agree to pay back 1.5 percent of his or her income for 25 years. Someone who borrowed $33,000 would repay 5 percent for 25 years.
Mr. Bradley also pushed a plan to provide tax credits of $350 for each child in a family, an amount he notes is more manageable than the $1,000 per child credit being advanced by his Senate colleague Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia.
"I still tell people no as well as yes," he said.
 
'Recognize the Stress'
 Indeed, a group of New Jersey builders meeting on a backyard deck overlooking a lake in Rockaway Township grew restive when the Senator began an involved explanation of why neither tax incentives nor nor any other relief for the battered building industry were likely soon.
Noting the silence, Mr. Bradley said: "When I get into that explanation, I see faces drop, a combination of anger, disbelief, incredulity -- bad news."
The mood brightened, and Mr. Bradley acknowledged later that his near loss last November had taught him another thing: "Even if I can't do anything, I try to explain and to share their anger or their concern, to identify, recognize the stress."
It is something of a new buzz phrase with Mr. Bradley, who heretofore was not given to political buzzing -- "economic stress."
"In the last election, people didn't feel that I understood their economic stress," he said. "I did, but I think I didn't let them know it. Now I tell them I understand."

With a slight gain late in the day yesterday, stock prices recovered some of last week's losses. But analysts said the market remained stalled by concerns that the pace of the nation's economic recovery might be slow.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell more than 40 points last week, gained 12.74 for the day, closing at 2,985.24. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 820 up, 708 down and 527 unchanged. 
 Volume on the Big Board totaled 136 million shares, compared with 127.8 million at the end of trading on Friday.
Analysts said a late afternoon gain for pharmaceutical stocks contributed to the rise. The Dow, which was down most of the morning, to as low as 2,957, began rising after 2 P.M.
 
'Focusing on Earnings'
 Generally, the stock market has struggled in recent sessions, primarily because of fears of a slow economic recovery. "There are questions about how far we are going to come out of the recession and how robust the recovery might be," said Richard E. Meyer, head of equity trading with Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. "Also, people are focusing on earnings and that has contributed to their concerns."
The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.66, to 493.35. Meanwhile, the American Stock Exchange's composite index was up 0.68, to 365.19. The Standard & Poor's 500 was up 2.22, closing at 383.15.
Mr. Meyer cited pharmaceutical stocks as helping the late afternoon rise in stocks. Indeed, Johnson & Johnson rose 1 7/8, to 89 3/4, while Pfizer was up 1 5/8, to 61 3/4, Merck rose 1 1/2, to 124 3/4, and Bristol-Myers Squibb was up 1 3/8, to 83 1/4.
Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said that about three-fourths of the rise in the Dow resulted from computer-driven selling. "That's not to say that every movement in the Dow was program-related," said James K. Collins, an analyst with Birinyi. "It's just to say that, at the end of the day, programs caused the Dow to go up. We haven't seen three or more buy programs since the 18th of July." The firm also said that it spotted 40 minutes of program activity yesterday, which it decribed as being average.
Among the gainers yesterday was Dillard Department Stores, which rose 2 5/8, to 125 3/8. The chain of department stores recently announced plans to acquire seven stores in Florida. Air Products and Chemicals rose 2 1/4, to 65 1/4. The company, a producer of industrial gasses and chemicals, posted higher earnings last week.
Among the declining stocks on the Big Board yesterday was Computer Science, which dropped 6 5/8, to 61 1/2. The company released disappointing first-quarter results, analysts said, adding that the outlook for the current quarter was similar.
Capital Cities/ABC, the television broadcasting and publishing concern, was second in declining stocks on the Big Board, falling 6, to 469. The company has reported lower earnings and has announced cuts in its news staff.

HEADLINE: Some Signs of Hope Glint From New York's Clouds

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
In 1859, the diarist George Templeton Strong toured the muddy excavations of what was to be Central Park, and wondered whether New York City would succumb to the burdens of crime, filth, poverty and politics before the park's saplings would ever mature.
"Perhaps the city itself will perish before then," he mused, "by growing too big to live under faulty institutions, corruptly administered." 
 Well over a century later, the park and the city still stand, but the death of New York is still being predicted daily.
Yet even in the gloom of the city's latest fiscal crisis, there are signs of hope. Some of the city's most intractable problems, from poor schools to crime to poverty, have apparently stopped getting worse, and others have even begun to turn around.
 
Wave of Immigrants
 School attendance and test scores in reading and math are up. The crime rate is stable across the city, down in midtown. And many social indicators, from infant mortality to child-abuse complaints, cocaine use and homelessness, show signs of improvement.
Instead of withering away, New York is gaining population as a wave of new immigrants -- from the Caribbean, Latin America and Asia -- rebuilds neighborhoods, invigorates schools and recharges the city's economic engine.
In one little noticed change, the number of abused and neglected children placed in the city's huge foster-care system has dropped by a third since last July, easing the desperate scramble for ever more beds. City officials tentatively attribute the change to the waning influence of crack.
Other crises that loomed large on the city's horizons only a year or two ago have faded. Systematic overcrowding in psychiatric wards and hospital emergency rooms has eased. While the number of people with AIDS continues to rise, the disease is no longer thought to be on the verge of swamping the health-care system: the number of AIDS patients in city hospitals has been stable or declined slightly over the last year or so.
These trends surfaced over the last few months, as city budget analysts began preparing what became known as Mayor David N. Dinkins's "doomsday budget," with deep cuts in city services that many worried might finally push the city over the edge.
Such cuts could still threaten any progress in resolving the city's problems, and leave New Yorkers facing more crises down the road. And many serious problems remain, from a murder rate that rose while crime on the whole declined a bit, to a listless local economy.
But taken together, the positive trends suggest a glimmer of hope that New York City can once again transform itself, and confound its critics, as it has done many times since its founding in 1625.
In a memo titled "Re: The Good News," which has been circulating in city government since April, Stephen Anderson, a budget analyst, suggested that improvement in nine social indicators, from child-abuse reports to complaints of aggravated assault, was significant.
 
'Bit of Good News'
 "Many of these problems, which have been growing for years, appear to be leveling off and in some cases declining," he wrote, noting that if the pattern continued it would be a "welcome bit of good news for the city."
Some people, particularly those in government, attribute the improvements to actions by city government: more attention to math in the schools, better policing methods. Others say that deeper shifts in society may have reached down to troubled neighborhoods: drugs are out, family is in.
"The pendulum is starting to swing the other way," said Karla Damus, a director of research and epidemiology in the Health Department. "The whole family unit is again taking a higher priority than it has in the last decade."
Still others see the trends as more or less random, cyclical changes that defy easy explanations: at some point a forest fire burns out, and a line on a graph just cannot keep going down.
"At some point you do reach a situation where more people don't commit crimes, and more people don't take drugs," said William Grinker, a former Commissioner of the Human Resources Administration. "If you are in the social-policy business you like to think that some of the programs that are under way have some impact, but it's hard to show."
 
Fewer at Shelters
 He noted that in the late 1980's, the city's projections of ever increasing homelessness eventually reached a point where everyone in the city would be homeless. Instead, the number of homeless single men and women using city shelters on the worst winter days has declined by about 2,000 from the peak of 11,091 in March 1989.
While advocates for the homeless say this is more a measure of the quality of shelters than of homelessness, they agree that the number of homeless people on the streets is not increasing. Douglas Lasdon, director of the Legal Action Center for the Homeless, said, "It is at an unacceptably unpleasant level, but I see no evidence that it is getting worse."
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the trends suggest that "some of the gloom-and-doom scenarios" about the city have been exaggerated.
Even in the troubled local economy, he said, there are signs of a "thin silver lining." The city is still losing jobs, but at a slower rate, and reduced inflation and smaller wage increases are making the city more competitive.
"This is not an economy or a society that is going over the cliff," he said.
The sense of perpetual crisis in New York stems, perhaps, from a tendency of many New Yorkers -- including the press and advocates for more city socialspending -- to emphasize the bad news at the expense of the good. When problems are solved, or solve themselves, they disappear from view, replaced by more pressing issues.
 
Subway as Symbol
 In the late 1970's, the decline of the subway system was widely seen as an emblem of the decline of New York City itself. Since then, $12 billion has been spent to rebuild tracks and buy new cars. Subway cars now run an average of 35,941 miles between breakdowns, compared with 6,823 miles in 1981. But this has done little to change the way New Yorkers see their city.
Richard P. Nathan, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York in Albany, said he and other social scientists had contributed to a sense of perpetual crisis, by focusing attention on the city's worst problems and neighborhoods.
At the same time, he said, positive developments in the city have been ignored -- especially the growth of new, stable neighborhoods of working people, many of them new immigrants or black or Hispanic residents who have fled from deteriorating neighborhoods.
"We have to be careful of over-stereotyping New York as just neighborhoods that are the pits, where Uzi machine guns and the dangerous deviants are the salient characteristics," he said. "There is hidden strength in the city."
This is not to say that the city's troubles are over.
If a drop in the number of drug users has meant fewer social problems, the decline was unforeseen, and may not continue.
And even if some problems stabilize at current levels, the rates remain high. The infant mortality rate in 1990 was 11.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in the city -- nearly 25 percent higher than the national rate -- and in some neighborhoods it is much higher.
Though there are fewer children entering foster care, there are already 52,000 children in the system -- a total that is likely to rise further, since the average length of stay in the foster-care system is rising.
If the number of homeless people begging on the streets and living in shelters stays the same, the problem will remain severe for the foreseeable future.
"The city isn't going to die," said David R. Jones, the executive director of the Community Service Society, a research and advocacy group. "The question is how many people are going to suffer before things get better."
 
'Nobody Can Take Credit'
 He warned that any upswing in indicators might be swept away as the recession takes its toll on families across the city. "It is going to be an increasingly difficult city to live in," he said.
For Paul Dickstein, a former city budget director, the signs of improvements in the city show how tenuous the links can be between public policy and social change. During the late 1980's, when the city was adding jobs and stepping up spending on the poor, the problems worsened. With spending now falling, some things may be getting better.
"In the late 1970's, after police layoffs and continuous attrition, the crime rate declined," he said. "If anyone now wants to take credit for the decline of drug abuse, let them try. Nobody can take credit. It just happened."
This view might have suited George Templeton Strong, a Brahmin lawyer who chronicled goings-on in the city over four decades with a jaded eye -- recording crime waves real and imagined, teen-age prostitution, gang riots and filthy streets, deeply skeptical about the ability of the mayor or the governor to make a difference. "The whole city's one huge pigsty, only it would have to be cleaned before a prudent farmer would let his pigs into it for fear of catching the plague," he observed in 1839.
Richard Sheola, a senior assistant vice president in the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, reflected the uncertain mood of the city when, after months of close cooperation between the city and state, a huge backlog of psychiatric patients in search of beds all but disappeared. "When things started going right, nobody wanted to take credit for it," he said. "Nobody is certain we can sustain this, and everyone is afraid of turning a corner and being hit with a freight train."

HEADLINE: King Hussein Requests Flexibility From P.L.O.

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, July 29

 BODY:
King Hussein of Jordan appealed today to the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization to refrain from raising unnecessary problems over Palestinian representation that might delay the convening of the proposed Middle East peace conference.
The King's remarks, in an interview in his office at the Royal Palace here, were his first on the critical issue of Palestinian representation and were apparently meant as a signal to the P.L.O.'s executive committee to take a pragmatic approach at its meeting in Tunis. The P.L.O. leaders must decide whether to accept Israel's demand that a Palestinian delegation for the proposed talks exclude P.L.O. members. 
 It is for Palestinians still living under Israeli occupation -- "the ultranationalists who stood their ground and suffered," as the Jordanian ruler described them -- to decide whether they want a settlement with Israel that could secure a homeland for them.
The Israelis have said they will not take part in a peace conference unless they are assured that no P.L.O. members or Palestinians from East Jerusalem are present.
 
The Question of Jerusalem
 While some Palestinians oppose sitting down with Israel at all on these terms, others say that the United States should rescue the P.L.O. from a total loss of face by formally asking it to choose the Palestinian delegation.
Many are also pressing for a Palestinian delegation to include representatives from East Jerusalem, something that Israel wants to prevent because it regards Jerusalem, which it unified after capturing the eastern part from Jordan in the 1967 war, to remain as its capital, and to avoid any appearance that this is negotiable.
Western diplomats here say that the Tunis meeting is critical for the Middle East initiative because no Palestinians are likely to agree to take part in any talks without the permission of the P.L.O., even though they are not members of the organization.
King Hussein, during the interview today, expressed strong support for the American initiative, which has won the backing of all the Arab countries in the region, but no formal endorsement from Israel. "If peace is to be scuttled, I hope it won't be the result of our fault," he said.
He repeatedly described the American initiative as "a last chance" for a just and comprehensive settlement that "future generations can live with."
Without such a settlement, the Jordanian warned that continued large-scale Jewish settlement in the occupied territories might soon result in the territories' being effectively merged into Israel.
This conference is, he said, the last chance to secure "an agreement on something that can last, that can make the difference between chaos, anarchy and destruction, and open peace."
Yet the King also said he wants to avoid saying anything in public about sensitive aspects of the forthcoming negotiations -- such as the future of the Israeli settlements -- because doing so could stir up political passions and abort talks before they start.
"I am a strong advocate of common sense," he said, "I believe that speaking too much at this stage might create difficulties and obstacles to progress."
 
P.L.O Flexibility Urged
 The King appeared sympathetic to the inclusion of an East Jerusalem representative in the Palestinian delegation, arguing that much of the world regards the Arab sector of Jerusalem as part of the Israeli-occupied territories and thus entitled to be represented at a conference. "East Jerusalem as far as we are concerned and I believe as far as the world community is concerned, is occupied territory," he said.
But he also seemed to be urging the P.L.O.'s leadership to be flexible and give priority to the interests that Palestinians in the occupied areas have in achieving a settlement.
"It is not for people outside of the suffering that has gone on for all these years to pontificate on what should or should not be done," King Hussein said. Instead, he argued that "the people in the occupied territories have the right for us to be concerned about their conditions and see what can be done."
The King also described the P.L.O., which was founded in 1964, as being "by definition a temporary body" whose purpose is to "recover Palestinians' rights." Once that has been achieved, he said, it will be up to the Palestinian people to decide the organization's future.
 
Jordanian Umbrella
 King Hussein said he expects the Palestinians to form a joint delegation with Jordan for the talks rather than seek separate representation, although he said they have not asked to come under "our umbrella."
The King said a "process of education" would be needed on both sides to secure an understanding. "Israelis, he said, must be educated about the possibilities of living outside the fortress they have built." But Palestinians have to "understand what peace would mean to them if their rights are secure," the Jordanian added.
Western diplomats here describe the King's approach to the peace initiative as being fundamentally similar to that of the Bush Administration, which also wants to put the emphasis on getting the process moving and leave sensitive issues to be dealt with once the negotiations are under way.
Although President Bush suspended all American aid to Jordan after the gulf war because of the sympathy King Hussein showed for Iraq, he has now ordered a resumption of economic assistance, diplomats say. Military aid remains frozen.
 
No Names Mentioned
 The King refused to be drawn into discussing the names of prominent Palestinians who might make up a delegation to the talks and also be acceptable to the Israelis.
He said that Palestinian members of the Jordanian delegation would negotiate directly with Israel on Palestinian questions, while the Jordanians would deal with matters concerning Jordan. But both would be involved in "regional issues" like the problem of coping with the hundreds of thousands of refugees displaced by the gulf crisis.
King Hussein also said he hoped that the start of peace talks would thaw his country's frosty relations with Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations, caused by Jordan's refusal to join the coalition allied against Iraq.
Although Jordan has established some links with Egypt since the gulf war, Western diplomats say Saudi Arabia and other countries still refuse all contact with Jordan and have suspended financial aid. But Jordan's isolation would presumably be reduced once Mideast talks begin because the Arab participants would need to coordinate their positions.
 
Future of Old City
 The King emphasized today that he felt strongly about the future of the Old City of Jerusalem -- East Jerusalem -- which Israel has annexed. He said it should become "an international city that would serve as "a symbol of the unity of the followers of the three great monotheistic religions" -- Judiasm, Christianity and Islam.
He pointed out that in 1950 when the Kingdom of Trans-Jordan, as his country was then called, formed a union with the West Bank, East Jerusalem became a Jordanian city.
But only Britain and Pakistan ever recognized this. "The Muslim world, the world as a whole, they all called for an international Jerusalem," he said. His implication was that if most countries rejected a Jordanian Jerusalem in 1950, there was no case for an Israeli Jerusalem today.

The Bush Administration urged Congress today to wait until after Labor Day before trying to extend unemployment benefits for people who have been out of work at least half a year.
But some Senate Republicans, anxious to avoid voting against a politically attractive measure, are seeking to find room for compromise. The bill that Democratic leaders want to pass before going on vacation this weekend will cost $5.8 billion. 
 Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, and Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the effort was being led by Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader. Senator Dole would not comment.
Tonight only one Republican, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, voted to delay Senate consideration of the bill, and a vote to limit debate was scheduled for Wednesday morning. The vote on whether to delay consideration was 96 to 1.
Mr. Darman met with Senate and House Republican leaders and told reporters afterward that he expected unemployment to start declining soon from its current level of 7 percent. Therefore, he said, a "better time to make the judgment is after the Congress returns from its August recess."
 
A Plea for U.S. Workers
 Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee and is the chief sponsor of the bill extending unemployment benefits, today called for passage of his measure. "What we're asking now is that the Administration go along with us in looking after the unemployed in this country," he said.
Under current law, the basic 26 weeks of unemployment benefits can be extended for 13 weeks when unemployment among insured workers in a state reaches 6 percent or when it exceeds average levels in that state over the previous two years by one-fifth. In only three states -- Alaska, Maine and Rhode Island -- and Puerto Rico are the unemployed now eligible for extended benefits.
The Bentsen bill, which was supported by all 11 Democrats and by 5 of the 9 Republicans on the Finance Committee, would make workers eligible for 20 more weeks of benefits when total unemployment in their state averaged at least 8 percent. Thirteen weeks would be authorized if unemployment averaged 7 percent, seven weeks when it averaged 6 percent, and four additional weeks in all other states.
 
Worry About Budget Agreement
 Mr. Darman complained that the bill would "tend to make a mockery of the budget agreement." It would allow financing by declaring the unemployment situation an emergency, as last year's budget act allows. He contended that it would serve as a precedent and that similar demands would follow.
The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to vote on Tuesday to recommend a bill with benefits similar to those in the Bentsen bill. But it would give Mr. Bush the choice of paying for the bill through an emergency declaration or by imposing higher payroll taxes on employers.

HEADLINE: An Advocate of Plants To Clean Air Indoors Welcomes a New Test

 BODY:
W .C. WOLVERTON says he has a solution to indoor air pollution: houseplants.
To prove it, he built an addition to his house in Picayune, Miss., in which he pumps sewage from the bathroom and fumes from the kitchen through planters of ferns, ficuses and philodendrons in the living room. "It's like a little earth," he says. 
 Some people are skeptical. But Dr. Wolverton, a former researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who owns a private research company, says studies have shown that common houseplants are adept at absorbing potentially harmful gases and chemical compounds in houses and offices.
 
Support in Unlikely Places
 As awareness of the extent and danger of these ubiquitous pollutants has increased, Dr. Wolverton's ideas have gained momentum, winning tentative support in likely and unlikely places: from architects and developers as well as florists and gardeners.
Now, in a project that could vindicate or debunk the theory, a community college in Mississippi has decided to incorporate a houseplant filter system designed by Dr. Wolverton into a $3 million classroom building.
"I'm not saying plants are immediately a cure-all," Dr. Wolverton said. "But I think they are our only affordable solution to the indoor air pollution problem."
Others are less optimistic.
"This is very preliminary, interesting and, I think because of the seductiveness of plants, titillating research," said Hal Levin, a research architect in Santa Cruz, Calif., and editor of The Indoor Air Bulletin. "But the notion that plants remove pollutants from indoor air has not been adequately proven. To build a building using this technology, given the state of knowledge, is just not justified."
The threat of indoor air pollution has only recently become recognized, but awareness of it is increasing, propelled by the highly publicized cases of radon contamination and of "sick building syndrome."
"As we have tightened up our buildings and homes to conserve energy, we've developed contained environments that allow pollutants to build up, where they would have leaked out before," said Michael A. Berry, who heads the Environmental Protection Agency's indoor pollution research program. "We've created toxic chemical environments for ourselves."
The culprits are pervasive: Furniture, carpet, building materials, foam insulation, paints, cleaning fluids and even such innocuous items as felt-tip markers emit trace amounts of chemicals, many of which are carcinogens.
The E.P.A., as well as scientists and health experts, has warned that indoor air pollution constitutes as serious a public health threat as outdoor pollution, causing perhaps thousands of cancer deaths or other illnesses each year.
The search for answers to this earthly threat actually began in space. After discovering that synthetic materials used in Skylab emitted more than 100 chemicals, the space agency began searching for ways to purify the air in confined space stations. Inspired by the use of plants, like the bullrush, in waste-water treatment, researchers at the John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi turned to what gardeners and plant enthusiasts had long believed.
In a two-year study, the researchers, led by Dr. Wolverton, determined that a number of houseplants, from English ivy and peace lilies to golden pothos and mother-in-law's tongues, removed significant amounts of benzene, trichloroethylene and formaldehyde over 24-hour periods from chambers.
Early on, Dr. Wolverton assumed that the plants absorbed the pollutants in photosynthesis and touted the results as a surprisingly simple way to purify air. But further studies showed that the plants, in some cases, removed more pollutants if they had fewer leaves. The researchers now believe that absorption depends on a complex relationship between the plant's leaves, its roots and microorganisms in the soil.
 
Taking Nature Along
 "Man's existence on Earth depends upon a life-support system involving an intricate relationship with plants and their associated organisms," their report, released in 1989, concluded. "If man is to move into closed environments, on Earth or in space, he must take along nature's life-support system."
NASA's research continues, as scientists try to uproot the exact mechanism of the absorption process, as well as test other plants. But Dr. Wolverton, convinced by the results and frustrated that "NASA was not moving fast enough," left the agency last year. He has now formed a research company to market houseplants as an unequivocal, inexpensive way to fight indoor air pollution.
"It's basic biology," the 58-year-old Dr. Wolverton said. "What we're doing is optimizing the biological system on earth."
Dr. Wolverton's company has continued identifying plants that remove pollutants, devising ways to enhance the process and pitching it to developers and architects in the United States and abroad. The Alliance Research and Manufacturing Corporation in Picayune has begun selling his first product, "Nature's Filter," an individual plant filter system that uses a fan to draw air through the plant's roots. It costs $130.
In his Mississippi home, Dr. Wolverton has built what he calls a "self-contained bioregeneration system." One of the first skeptics he faced was his wife, whom he said he had to persuade to allow him to divert sewage through the new 1,800-square-foot addition.
In the system, sewage and fumes from the kitchen and bathroom are pumped through perforated pipes in planter boxes along two walls. He says that clay pebbles, with carbon filters, trap pollutants, which microorganisms around the plants' roots break down. The plants feed on the sewage, cleansing it, and also devour absorb chemical compounds from the air, he says, so that cleanwater is discharged into a fish aquarium.
"There is no doubt in my mind this works," Dr. Wolverton said. "It's just a matter of getting enough people interested to look at it seriously. This community college is going to be a milestone."
 
An Innovative Plan
 The college, Northeast Mississippi Community College in Booneville, expects to begin construction in August on a three-story math and science complex. The building, funded primarily by a $2.9 million grant from the state's Department for Economic and Community Development, is to include photovoltaic lighting, an energy-efficient heating and cooling system and Dr. Wolverton's plant filtration system -- all powered, in part, by solar energy.
Plans call for the building's ventilation to be routed through a two-story atrium in its mid-section, which is to be equipped with the filters. The plants, in special boxes filled with clay and charcoal, will also cleanse sewage from bathrooms adjacent to the atrium, recycling the water for use on campus gardens.
Though plants have never before been tried on so large a scale, a college spokesman, James Williams, said he is "confident that what Dr. Wolverton has told us will work." Researchers will monitor the building for five years, studying energy efficiency and air quality.
"There's a certain amount of uncertainty and risk in everything you do," Mr. Williams said, adding that the design makes it relatively easy to replace the filter system if it does not work. "But if we don't take risks, we won't make breakthroughs. If we can prove this works, we could revolutionize building technology."
Scientists and architects remain skeptical. They say Dr. Wolverton has moved a potentially promising idea too far too fast, especially given that Dr. Wolverton's studies in the private sector have not yet had to stand up to peer review in scientific journals.
Mr. Levin, the research architect, said that the plants "have not been tested on the most basic levels" and that because how plants remove pollutants remains a mystery, advocating them as a method of fighting pollution problems is premature.
 
An Unfinished Recipe?
 "It's like giving somebody a recipe with the ingredients, but not the proportions," he said.
Mr. Levin, like several others, said efforts to control indoor air pollution should not be devoted to removing chemicals from the air but rather to preventing their presence, using building materials that emit fewer pollutants and designing better ventillation systems in modern buildings. That view is shared by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Dr. Anthony V. Nero Jr., a leading researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., said: "From a practical point of view, you have to be a little cautious about this. On the other hand, having a lot of plants around is nice from an esthetic or even a psychological point of view."

Plants can remove pollutants like benzene, trichloroethylene and fomaldehyde from the air, but how they do it remains a mystery. Researchers once thought the process involved photosynthesis but now susptect that it depends on a complex relationship involving the plant's leaves, its roots and micro-organisms in the soil. A commercial system uses a fan to draw air through a plant's roots. (Sources: W.C. Wolverton; Alliance Research and Manufacturing)

HEADLINE: Administration to Fight House Panel's Subpoena

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has decided not to comply with a House subcommittee subpoena for a Justice Department legal document and is preparing to assert executive privilege in support of its stand, Government officials said today.
The document at issue is a 1989 legal opinion by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which concluded that agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation may legally arrest fugitives overseas without the permission of the country involved. 
 House members said they wanted the document to explore the legal ramifications of overseas arrests, including whether legislation is needed to restrict the practice or to protect F.B.I. agents who might themselves be subject to arrest while apprehending a fugitive in a foreign country or subjected to extradition requests if they took part in such an operation.
Justice Department officials have said that turning over the legal opinion would compromise private legal communications between the department's lawyers and their clients throughout the executive branch and discourage Federal agencies from seeking advice on sensitive topics.
In addition, some Adminstration officials said the disclosure of the opinion, which discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the Government's legal position, could undermine the criminal prosecution of four high-profile defendants, including Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the deposed Panamanian leader, who was arrested in January 1990 after the United States' invasion of Panama.
Representative Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and its subcommitte on Economic and Commercial Law, said in a statement last week that the panel's request for the opinion would not jeopardize any criminal prosecution. "This committee's request will in no way expose sensitive information to the public nor will it in any way deter or slow criminal prosecutions in these matters."
The assertion of executive privilege requires a Presidential directive that is expected to be issued by Wednesday, the date when the subpoenaed records must be turned over to the subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law, officials said.
The Bush Administration's action raises the stakes of a long-brewing dispute between the Justice Department and the House Judiciary Committee over what lawmakers have said is the Attorney General's lack of cooperation and refusal to provide the panel with documents it needs to oversee the department's activities.
The issue erupted again last Thursday when the Judiciary subcommittee voted to serve Attorney General Dick Thornburgh with two subpoenas.
One subpoena issued by the subcommittee seeks hundreds of documents from the Justice Department relating to its activities regarding INSLAW Inc., a computer software company that has accused the department of stealing the company's computer programs that are used to keep track of civil and criminal cases. The department has said it would seek to provide the documents to the committee, but some Congressional aides said today that it remained unclear whether the department would turn over all of the requested material.
The other subpoena seeks the legal opinion on overseas arrests that has been a subject of a dispute between Mr. Thornburgh and some House members who have sporadically sought access to the document without success since its existence became known in the fall of 1989.
If he refuses to comply with the subpoenas, Mr. Thornburgh runs the risk that the House will adopt a resolution finding him in contempt of Congress. But it is unlikely that lawmakers will act until September after they return from the August recess. Passage of such a resolution could lead to criminal charges against the Attorney General.
But some Government lawyers closely following the dispute said that the prospect of legal action against Mr. Thornburgh is remote given the history of such constitutional confrontations, which have previously been settled by compromise.
In 1982, the House voted to hold Anne McGill Burford, the top official at the Environmental Protection Agency, in contempt after she refused to turn over documents that she said contained confidential information about the agency's enforcement actions. But faced with a clash with Congress, President Ronald Reagan agreed to turn over a sanitized version of the documents and the contempt effort against Mrs. Burford died.
The doctrine of executive privilege has been used by some recent Presidents as a rationale for the historic practice of withholding information from Congress and the courts in special cases. Under the broadest interpretation of the doctrine, disputed by some legal scholars, a few Presidents have contended they can withhold anything they feel necessary to protect national security, guard confidentiality or insure the efficient operation of the executive branch.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Cone Keeps His Poise And Goes the Distance

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 29

 BODY:
David Cone wasn't perfect. Among the things he was, though, were these: sharp, sensational, confounding, efficient, relentless. And so in the end, Cone was not surprisingly triumphant.
Cone, who had been rocked early and mercilessly in his last two starts, allowed one hit through seven innings and three over all in earning his second complete game with a 5-1 victory over the Dodgers tonight. The triumph came as a great emotional lift for the Mets and helped complete an encouraging vault toward the Pirates in the National League East.
 
Wicked Stretch
 Cone, who struck out seven and walked one, yielded a bunt base hit to Brett Butler to start the game and then demolished or fooled 20 of the next 21 Dodgers before Mike Scioscia singled in the eighth. He lost his shutout when Chris Gwynn homered to begin the ninth, but he didn't let go of his composure, and he recovered to close out the Dodgers. 
 For the Dodgers, who were victimized for a perfect game by Montreal's Dennis Martinez on Sunday, Cone's mastery compounded their offensive incompetence. Gwynn's meaningless homer ended a string of 18 scoreless innings and represented just their fourth hit in their last 60 times at bat.
And so the Mets, who hadn't gained ground on the Pirates by virtue of a victory of their own making in 12 days, wound up slicing one and a half games off their deficit with the triumph and Pittsburgh's failure in a doubleheader against the Braves. They are now five and a half games back.
The Mets, who hadn't scored more than a single run in 47 straight innings, and who hadn't scored more than two runs in the prior 66, blasted open the game in the eighth against Tim Belcher, a terribly tired pitcher.
Vince Coleman ignited the outbreak with his third single of the night and he later scored on Gregg Jefferies's double down the left-field line. Then, after Howard Johnson had been intentionally walked, Kevin McReynolds, one of the team's big guns who'd gone silent of late, jettisoned Belcher's first offering to the seats in left field for a three-run homer that sealed the verdict.
After having repeatedly fallen behind in games early and then often out of them shortly thereafter, the Mets scored a run in the first, a lead they would nurse for what seemed like forever to the Dodgers.
Vince Coleman slipped a single inside the line in left field to start the game and initiate the first of several standoffs at first base with Tim Belcher. Coleman bluffed a steal, and then later took off on a hit-and-run play that worked perfectly when Dave Magadan curled a base hit through the opened right side of the infield to send Coleman to third.
Belcher, who had been crushed under waves of runs in two of his three previous starts this season against the Mets, ultimately limited the damage he incurred, but the Mets finessed a run across when Gregg Jefferies ground to shortstop and Coleman sprinted in easily from third on the fielder's choice.
 
Belcher Survives Scare
 Belcher, throwing an exhausting supply of pitches in what amounted to an eternal effort not to be blown out of the game, gave up a run in the first and then survived a great scare in the third.
Magadan and Jefferies stroked consecutive singles with one out and the heart of the order waiting with bats in their hands. But Belcher retired Howard Johnson on a flyout to shortstop and then endured the long flight of Kevin McReynolds's hard-hit shot to left that at last landed in Kal Daniels's glove.
For Belcher, the out was achieved with his 71st pitch of the night, a staggering total for three innings of work, and all of 26 pitches shy of the 97 Montreal's Dennis Martinez required to complete his perfect game against the Dodgers Sunday afternoon.
 
To No Avail
 The Mets kept at it against Belcher, but to no avail through six innings. Hubie Brooks singled to start the fourth, but Blecher set aside the next three Mets on flyouts. In the fifth, Vince Coleman singled to lead off. But with Magadan and Jefferies in the wings, the center fielder for the Mets was thrown out trying to steal second and the inning fizzled.
Meanwhile, Cone was far more economical on the mound and marginally more successful on the scoreboard against the Dodgers. The right-hander leveled 12 straight Dodgers after Butler's leadoff bunt base hit, slicing his way through three straight innings without allowing a base runner.

HEADLINE: Air Bags for All Cars

BYLINE: By Joan Claybrook and Benjamin Kelley; Joan Claybrook, Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the Carter Administration, is president of Public Citizen. Benjamin Kelley is president of the Institute for Injury Reduction.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A chance to make public safe ty history public health, really -- comes to few people. Now it has come to Jerry Curry in the form of the air bag, which a few years ago the auto industry scorned.
Mr. Curry, Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can ultimately prevent at least 7,000 deaths and 80,000 crippling injuries each year by ordering that front-seat air bags become available as standard equipment in all new passenger vehicles. He is flinching, because the Administration wants to let the industry to decide who does and doesn't get safe cars. 
 The agency administers the automatic crash protection rule, which requires manufacturers to install front-seat air bags or automatic belts in cars, and, under a rule change in March, in vans, light trucks and small buses beginning in late 1994.
For years, auto makers opposed air bags as ineffective, dangerous, expensive and needless. During the early Reagan years, the highway administration rescinded the rule. At the behest of insurers and safety groups, the Supreme Court in 1983 ordered an end to "the regulatory equivalent of war against the air bag," and forced the agency to reissue the rule. The rule, phased in for 1987 to 1990 car models (vans and light trucks will be phased in between 1995 and 1998 models), gives each company the choice of providing air bags or a user-unfriendly -- often unsafe -- alternative, the automatic seat belt.
Despite the air bag's vastly superior performance, most new cars made and sold under the rule since 1987 have been equipped with automatic belts. Now, with five million cars equipped with bags on the road, it is clear the bags provide unique protection in frontal crashes. Not even auto industry officials dispute this; witness Lee Iacocca's turn-around from opponent to head cheerleader for the air bag, which Chrysler is promoting in most of its new cars.
Since Mr. Curry has not acted on a Congressional request to order air bags in new passenger vehicles, the Congress is poised to do so. The Senate recently passed the highway bill, which mandates front-seat air bags for the driver and passengers. Tomorrow, a House bill is to be introduced by Gerry Sikorski, Democrat of Minnesota, that contains vehicle safety requirements similar to those in the Senate highway measure.
Requiring air bags for all new vehicles would lead to important economies for the industry and motorists, for the greater and more predictable the volume of production, the lower the unit cost. Also, requiring them would heighten competition between manufacturers to produce superior systems. It has been known for years that air bags can provide incredible protection even in 40 to 50 mile per hour crashes -- far above the current 30 m.p.h. standard -- and can be designed to provide protection in side impact crashes.
Car companies, particularly Japan's, which have mostly resisted air bags, might oppose a Federal mandate. But Mr. Curry can rally a groundswell of consumer and insurance industry support for it. In a 1990 speech to the Society of Automotive Engineers, he stressed that his agency "alone is accountable" for making correct decisions about life and death in car crashes. If so, this boast leaves him no choice but to issue an all-air-bag rule. If he doesn't, Congress should act.

HEADLINE: Why Single Out Small-Store Owners for Fines?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I love New York. This has been my attitude for more than 35 years. Let me tell you, it ain't easy.
The streets of New York City are filthy. Most store owners are not the problem. The administration is trying to destroy small merchants. 
 I believe in a cleaner city; my sweeping the sidewalks and the street in front of my store at Astor Place and Broadway will testify to that. But let's get realistic.
The economy is such that my staff is at a minimum. The regulations require sweeping three times a day. Oftentimes this leaves only one employee on our premises.
Have you seen Astor Place and Broadway? Our frontage includes two sewers, five or six vendors, one litter basket and endless cigarette butts, tissues, straws, cups, cans. We are responsible for cleaning up the mess created by all of these people.
A small merchant cannot afford to be outside the premises a disproportionate amount of time.
"No Excuse for Times Square Trash" (Topics of The Times, July 16) states that the Police Department could enforce sanitation laws.
What about all the laws that are not being enforced? For instance:
* Vendors must be 20 feet from a doorway of a storefront or a building entrance.
* Vendors must be 20 feet from one another.
* The littering laws.
I do not consider the fines for violating the sidewalk sweeping law an acceptable cost of doing business. They are a hardship.
Why is the store owner the only one being fined?
My frustration level is at its peak. I want someone to listen. Who? That is the question.

HEADLINE: Tear Down Barriers To Export of Services

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 15 editorial on the London economic summit starts on a strong, clear note about the critical importance of finishing the Uruguay Round trade negotiations, but loses its way on the trade in services.
Services are a particular United States concern. Industries such as banking, accounting, securities, telecommunications and transport now account for 78 percent of United States employment, 67 percent of United States gross national product and 24 percent of United States exports. If we don't tear down some barriers to service exports, one of our most efficient sectors will continue to face protectionist walls abroad. 
 I was disappointed to see you advocate the lowest common denominator in the services negotiations. A mere statement of principles, instead of liberalization, is not progress.
An unfavorable services agreement would legally lock in services protectionism abroad. The United States can get at some of the barriers with United States trade law. But an agreement such as you suggest could freeze the United States market open, while leaving many foreign markets closed. Such a deal would make it more difficult to pry open services markets abroad.
Barriers would not fall in isolated services negotiations. Services liberalization requires comprehensive negotiations like the Uruguay Round.
While it is true there must be compromise in any negotiations, your proposal on services would be closer to capitulation.

HEADLINE: Mill Town Pensioners Pay for Wall Street Sins

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANNAPOLIS, N.C., July 29

 BODY:
For most of the century, few places have been as isolated from the economic mainstream as this venerable mill town where generations worked in the Cannon family mills, lived in the Cannon family rental cottages and shopped in Cannon family-owned buildings.
But when about 400 grim-faced retirees gathered at a high school auditorium today, the angry talk was of leveraged buyouts and California bankruptcy law and the way their pension payments, already meager, were slashed by 30 percent after a California financier bought and sold their company and reinvested their pension plan's holdings in an insurer dependent on junk bonds. 
 State regulators are scrambling to try to restore the pensions to their original level for 12,900 retirees from the Cannon Mills here. But in the meantime the town is a dreary indicator of the way that Wall Street's excesses of the 1980's are playing out on Main Street in the 1990's.
"People shouldn't have to work all their life for their retirement and then have some greedy person come in and steal it," Leonard C. Wright, who retired last spring after 43 years in the mills but has yet to receive any pension payments, said just before a hearing held here today by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. "It's hard work in the mills. It's dangerous. Lots of people retired because they just can't work anymore. This just shouldn't happen."
For many, often couples both on Cannon pensions, the payments are a modest supplement to Social Security that can mean food on the table or the ability to pay their bills. For some, like Willie Little, who retired with lungs full of cotton dust in 1983 after 37 years, the pension was as small as $23.10 a month before California regulators ordered the reduction.
"You can say it's not much, but you have to have money to be able to say that," she said. "I don't have much and every little bit counts."
For others, like Louis Jenkins, a former Cannon controller, the reduction meant his check fell from to $400.89 to $572.70 a month.
The retirees here are believed to be the single largest group in one community to suffer from the collapse of Executive Life Insurance Company, which was seized by California regulators in April in the largest insurance failure in United States history.
But the Cannon Mills story is much more complicated than the troubles of Executive Life. The company, owned by the Cannon family here from the beginning of the century until 1982, was sold twice in the 1980's, first to the California financier, David H. Murdock, and then to Fieldcrest Mills, a Massachusetts company. It is now known as Fieldcrest Cannon Mills.
Norman P. Stein, an expert on pension law who testified before the hearing, called by Senator Terry Sanford, Democrat of North Carolina, said what happened here was not unique. Instead, he said, it is only a particularly extravagant variation on a theme that was played throughout the 80's as corporate raiders made reckless investments with workers' pension money while defanged Federal regulators looked the other way.
"In the movie 'Wall Street,' Charlie Sheen was able to rescue his dad's pension plan from the avarice of Michael Douglas, but as we are seeing today in Kannapolis and a hundred other communities across the nation, things don't work out so neatly in real life," Mr. Stein, a professor of tax, labor and pension law at the University of Alabama Law School, told the room full of retirees wearing buttons reading "100 Percent Pensions Now." "In real life, dependence on slow-on-the-draw government bureaucrats to regulate grab-as-grab-can David Murdocks has tragic consequence."
 
'Mr. Charlie' and His Town
 For 70 years, this was the ultimate company town, an unincorporated manufacturing kingdom north of Charlotte owned by the Cannon family, most notably "Mr. Charlie" Cannon, who ran the mill as a low-wage, paternalistic fief from 1921 until his death in 1971.
That world changed forever in 1982, when his heirs sold the company, including 1,000 acres of land, to Mr. Murdock for $414 million in a highly leveraged transaction. Mr. Murdock cut the work force, slashed wages, enforced mandatory retirement and then turned around and sold the heart of the mill operations to Fieldcrest Mills Inc. of Massachusetts for $250 million while keeping most of the real estate.
But before he did that he received Federal approval to terminate Cannon's pension plan, which had assets of $102.7 million. He kept around $30 million in "surplus" assets and reinsured the pension plan under a $67 million Executive Life Insurance Company annuity.
On April 11, California regulators seized Executive Life. Officials said the company, acting in tandem with Michael R. Milken, the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond financier who was convicted of securities fraud, was overly dependent on unstable junk bonds. Since then payments to Cannon pension holders have been cut by 30 percent.
 
Bitterness and Betrayal
 Neither Mr. Murdock nor Fieldcrest, whose purchase price was reduced by the jettisoning of the pension plan, are legally responsible for the solvency of the plan. Neither has offered to make the employees whole.
Bitter employees like Mr. Wright say their life's toil in the mill has been used as a piece of corporate asset shuffling and that Fieldcrest and Mr. Murdock are equally to blame.
"Mr. Cannon didn't give the workers no benefits or anything, but when he told them something it was the truth," he said. "If Fieldcrest or Murdock tell you anything, if it ain't in writing, you can forget about it. They'll lie to you through their teeth."
Osborne Raines, a spokesman for Fieldcrest, appeared at the hearing today and said the problems with Executive Life were "disgraceful." But he said the shift was made before the sale to Fieldcrest and that the company had no legal role in the pension debacle.
When calls were made to Mr. Murdock's offices here and in Los Angeles, employees said his spokeswoman on the subject was out of town and unavailable for comment.
 
Hope a Few Months Off
 Mr. Stein, the pension law expert, said Federal regulators neither adequately regulate pension fund trustees, whose interests often diverge from those covered by the plans they manage, nor provide sufficient remedies to those harmed like the Cannon retirees.
"In Mr. Murdock's case, there was a clear conflict of interest," he said. "Every dollar the plan saved in the purchase of an annuity contract was a dollar in the pocket of Mr. Murdock and his affiliates."
James Long, commissioner of the North Carolina Department of Insurance, has called hearings for September to move to activate the state's insurance guaranty association. The program, financed by insurance companies in the state, could reimburse pensioners with the cost likely passed on to other ratepayers.
But a few months could be a long time for pensioners, who feel a sense of betrayal over a life's work at the mercy of corporate gamesmanship.
"I was angry but what can one angry man do?" said Morris Johnson, who retired three years ago after 45 years with Cannon. "I'd wind up in jail if I tried to take my gun and go get it."

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the effects of the failure of the Executive Life Insurance Company on a group of pensioners in North Carolina referred to the precedent incorrectly in some copies. The collapse of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, not of Executive Life, was the largest insurance failure in United States history.

HEADLINE: Confidence Remains Weak

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Consumers remained uncertain about the economy in July, an indication that the economic recovery will be slow, the Conference Board said yesterday.
The research group, which is sponsored by the nation's business community, said its consumer confidence index registered 77.7 in July, down slightly from 78.0 the previous month. The index has narrowly fluctuated since March as Americans have remained pessimistic about economic conditions. 
 "There have been only faint signs that an economic recovery is in progress," said Fabian Linden, the head of the Conference Board's consumer research center.
The monthly report on consumer confidence is considered an economic indicator because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product, the measurement of the nation's output of goods and services. The economy cannot rebound unless consumers spend more.
The report, based on a survey of 5,000 households, found consumers slightly more pessimistic about business conditions for the next six months. Compared with June, fewer respondents said they expected conditions to improve.
Many consumers are putting plans for large purchases on hold, although there was a small increase in the number who said they planned to buy a major appliance.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Tuition Aid Without Tears

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
COLLEGE tuition bills loom like a mountain above the finances of every middle-income parent. And Washington, hard pressed to pay for urgently needed programs like extended unemployment benefits, is obviously in no position to trim them down to size.
But Representative Thomas E. Petri, known for his innovative efforts to coax a bigger bang from the Federal buck, is not giving up. The Wisconsin Republican thinks he has found a relatively painless way to help middle-class students pay their own bills -- and in the process save Uncle Sam $1 billion a year. 
 The core of his proposal, generous unsubsidized loans with repayment terms linked to students' future incomes, has been kicking around Capitol Hill for a decade. But Mr. Petri's version, co-sponsored by 50 members of the House, seems the most practical. And in light of new accounting rules for Federal credit programs, the timing could hardly be better. Indeed, the real puzzle is why the Bush Administration, which lacks a domestic agenda with pizazz, has yet to co-opt the plan as its own.
Washington has long offered a smorgasbord of programs to help pay college bills -- everything from cash grants to work-study incentives to guaranteed student loans. But tuition increases have far outpaced Congressional generosity, and subsidies in Government loans still available without means tests have been whittled to a nubbin. Many families now find it cheaper to borrow against the value of their homes and deduct the interest.
Mr. Petri is not proposing to turn back the clock. Like many fiscal conservatives, he sees little virtue in raising everyone's taxes to cover the college costs of the soon-to-be affluent. But he does want to give students a chance to borrow at what amounts to wholesale rates. And he wants the repayment terms to be affordable, even for graduates who end up with modest incomes.
He would permit any student to borrow up to $70,000 -- $29,000 for four years of college, plus $41,000 for four years of graduate school. Medical students would be eligible for far more. Loans would accumulate interest charges from day one, at rates that would more than cover the Treasury's own costs. But repayment would not begin until the borrower had taxable earnings, and would then rise progressively with a cap of about 19 percent of income for the most affluent.
A graduate making $40,000 would pay about $2,700 a year to service a $20,000 education debt, with the money deducted from his or her paycheck along with income and Social Security taxes. If the Treasury's own borrowing rate averaged 8 percent, the $20,000 debt would be cleared in 12 years. No one would be asked to pay beyond 25 years.
In the early years the Treasury would, of course, lay out far more cash than it collected. But under the new budget rules, these net outlays would not add to the deficit as long as the loan repayment terms were calibrated to make the program self-financing in the long run. Joe Fader, an aide to Representative Petri, thinks the program would actually free $1 billion a year for other uses because it would attract borrowers who would otherwise use existing subsidized-loan programs.
The idea of a generous new loan program that actually saves the Government money sounds like a contradiction, but probably it is not. Default and collection costs would be trivial, unlike those of traditional student loans. To beat the system, borrowers would have to cheat on their income taxes. Indeed, Mr. Flader wants the plan to serve double duty as loan collector of last resort: those in default on other sorts of student loans could automatically be folded into the program.
Moreover, much of the appeal of the system lies in the flexibility of the repayment terms, a feature that would add nothing to the Government's costs. Financially successful graduates would end up subsidizing borrowers who took low-paying jobs or were unemployed. But even borrowers contemplating careers in the executive stratosphere would find the terms more attractive than those of the Government-guaranteed loans now available through banks.
If the Petri plan is indeed the greatest gift to political incumbents since the invention of the franking privilege, why haven't Washington's movers and shakers rushed to embrace it as their own? One reason is that it is complicated, and few public officials are about to take seriously any plan committing billions of Federal dollars unless it carries the imprimatur of the White House.
In the end, then, the mystery is why an Administration so eager to make the rest of the world safe for democracy has ignored an apparently costless way to help preserve the dream of social mobility back home.
Perhaps the education President simply has not gotten the message.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Surged Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
Sales of new homes surged by 7.4 percent in June, according to a Government report today that showed sales in previous months to be even stronger than first thought.
"Housing's back," said John A. Tuccillo, an economist at the National Association of Realtors, echoing the views of other analysts that the housing industry continues to recover modestly from the recession. 
 Although sales dipped slightly in the South, they rose everywhere else. Sales shot ahead 24.5 percent, to a 66,000 annual rate, in the Northeast, the highest level since a 68,000 rate last November.
 
May Rate Revised Upward
 Nationally, the Commerce and Housing and Urban Development Departments said sales of single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 525,000 in June, up from a revised 489,000 rate in May.
Even though May sales were down 3.2 percent from April, the only drop since January, they still were above the 474,000 rate estimated just a month ago. And April's sales, reported last month to have fallen two-tenths of a percent, were revised today to show a 2 percent gain.
Still, sales for the first six months of 1991 were 13.2 percent below those for the same period last year.
In a second report, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said real estate markets improved since April in all areas except for the West. And in the West, the mid-July poll of nearly 500 F.D.I.C. real estate experts showed that only commercial markets posted a decline while residential markets held steady.
L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C.'s chairman, said the data indicate that the West might be in for a slump, although perhaps not as severe as the downturn that earlier hit the Southwest and New England.
Markets in Southern California show "considerable stress," but conditions are better in the northern half of the state, Mr. Seidman said. Elsewhere in the nation, the Northeast appears to have bottomed out while the South, which many in the agency feared would slump, also was improving, he added.
David Berson, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, said the Commerce Department report "brings the new-home sales number more in line with existing-home sales," which have posted strong advances since hitting bottom in January.
 
Lowest Since July 1983
 Housing starts also have risen each month since January, except for March. And, perhaps signaling even more construction ahead, the report said the seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of June was 295,000. That was the lowest since 288,000 in July 1983 and represented a 6.9-month supply at the current sales rate, the lowest since a 6.6-month supply in November 1989.
"This suggests that inventories are drawn down and that building activity will pick up in future months," said Kathleen Stephansen, an economist with the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation of New York.
But David F. Seiders, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said the pace of new construction would be modest. "Our builder surveys don't give any feeling that the market is on any major surge," he added.
Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, said, "It's unlikely it will be as strong as some recoveries in the past."
 
Rise in Median Price
 The median price of a new home in June was $120,000, up 2.5 percent from May. At the same time, the median price of an existing home was $101,900, according to the National Association of Realtors. The median price means half of the homes cost more and half less.
Regionally, the Commerce Department said sales in the South slipped five-tenths of a percent, to an annual rate of 199,000, the second straight fall after three consecutive monthly rises.

Dollar Advances in the U.S. After Strong Housing Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday in domestic dealings after the Government released a strong report on the state of the housing market.
The dollar slipped in overseas dealings early in the day. But dealers said they bought dollars after the Government reported that sales of new homes surged 7.4 percent in June, with increases in every region except the South. 
 The departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development also revised upward their figures for April and May, indicating that the housing market this spring was stronger than suspected earlier.
The optimistic numbers were further bolstered by a national survey of real estate experts. The report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said the experts saw improvements since April in every area except the West.
 
Bolstering Recovery Hopes
 The reports bolstered perceptions that the recession is over and the economy expanding, which would make the dollar more valuable.
"You want to have something that confirms the recovery is well under way," said Peter Iversen, a currency trader at Shawmut Bank of Boston.
But traders said activity was slow, with the market awaiting more economic indicators later in the week. Those reports include factory orders and construction spending for June and the unemployment rate for July.
In New York, the pound settled at $1.6770, down from late Monday's $1.6815. But in London, it strengthened to $1.6810, from Monday's $1.6745.
The dollar gained 0.05 Japanese yen in New York, to a closing 137.90 yen. Earlier in Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar fell to a closing 137.83 yen, down 0.27 yen. Later, in London the dollar finished at 137.85 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's, included: 1.7535 German marks, up from 1.74735; 1.53075 Swiss francs, up from 1.5265; 5.9640 French francs, up from 5.9435; 1,310.00 Italian lire, up from 1,305.50, and 1.15225 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14925.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday included: 1.7503 German marks, down from 1.7530; 1.5275 Swiss francs, down from 1.5325; 5.9525 French francs, down from 5.9585; 1.9730 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9760; 1,308.00 Italian lire, down from 1,309.75, and 1.1513 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1490.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Platinum Falls Below Gold For First Time Since 1985

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Platinum became cheaper than gold yesterday as Japanese selling and signs of enormous Soviet market influence put pressure on platinum futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Platinum last traded at a significant discount to gold in the fall of 1985. 
 Platinum futures settled $4.60 to $4.70 lower in New York, with the contract for delivery in October at $362.90 an ounce.
Gold futures ended $1 to $1.10 lower on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with the October contract at $366.10 an ounce, off $1. August deliveries settled at $362.30, off $1.10.
Silver futures settled 1.9 cents to 2.3 cents lower on the Commodity Exchange, with August at $4.041 a troy ounce.
 
Heavy Selling by Japanese
 Platinum opened more than $7 below Monday's close, mainly reflecting heavy selling overnight by Japanese investors, analysts said.
Selling was linked to a report late Monday that in the first six months of the year the Soviet Union had shipped about 22 metric tons of platinum to Zurich, compared with less than 2 metric tons in the corresponding period of last year.
Analysts said most of the Soviet platinum had not been sold on the market but was being used as collateral in the Soviet leadership's struggle to shore up the country's economy.
Nevertheless, the news served as a reminder that the Soviet Union has vast platinum reserves and is capable of dumping huge amounts of the metal onto the market if it needs to raise money.
James Steel, metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New York, said the Soviet Union has been selling more platinum to compensate for a decline in energy exports.
The market partly recovered from the opening plunge but it was hampered by perceptions that the United States economy is recovering more slowly than expected.
Energy futures prices advanced in light trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange on technical factors and rumors of refinery fires that proved to be unfounded.
After the close, the American Petroleum Institute released its weekly tallies of fuel stockpiles, which included lower-than-expected figures for crude oil and gasoline.
Crude-oil futures finished 7 cents to 25 cents higher, with September at $21.42 a barrel; heating oil was 0.08 cent to 0.23 cent higher, with August at 58.96 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.75 cent to 1.55 cents higher, with August at 66.38 cents a gallon; natural gas was 0.5 cent lower to 1.3 cents higher, with September at $1.238 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Checking and Savings Bill Clears Committee in House

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
Legislation intended to make it easier for bank customers to shop for savings and checking accounts was adopted today by the House Banking Committee.
The bill, known as the Truth in Savings Act, requires clear and uniform disclosure of the interest rate, terms, fees and other conditions on deposit accounts. 
 It passed by voice vote and was sent to the full House, where action is expected in the fall. Similar provisions are included in a broader banking overhaul bill being considered by the Senate Banking Committee.
The bill's sponsor, Representative Esteban E. Torres, Democrat of California and chairman of the panel's subcommittee on consumer affairs, said, "Consumers must be given the information necessary to intelligently determine where to invest: how yields are calculated, what fees will be incurred and how minimum balance requirements affect their interest."
 
Requirements for Advertising
 The legislation requires banks and other deposit-taking institutions to disclose the information in advertisements and solicitation material. Regulators, however, could exempt billboards and broadcast advertisements from the requirement.
Banks would be banned from advertising checking accounts as free if a fee were applied on accounts with balances below a minimum. They would also be required to pay any interest rate on the full balance in an account.
Institutions that violated the law would be subject to lawsuits from individual customers and to class-action suits from customer groups.
Committee leaders today also reached a compromise on separate legislation imposing tighter Federal regulation on the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac.
 
Delay in the Vote
 A vote was delayed until Wednesday, however, to give aides time to put the compromise into legislative language.
The bill creates an office in the Housing and Urban Development Department to oversee the two stockholder-owned but congressionally chartered agencies, which purchase home mortgages from lenders.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not explicitly guaranteed by the Government, but because they are so crucial to the housing market, most investors assume the Government would bail them out if they got into trouble.
The Bush Administration, committee leaders, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and housing advocacy groups have agreed on a compromise amendment that would impose capital standards on the two enterprises. It would also set a goal for them of purchasing in 1992 and 1993 some $3.5 billion worth of mortgages made to poor people.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW;
U.S. Largesse Sticks in Soviet Craw

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 30

 BODY:
In lifting trade restrictions against the Soviet Union today, President Bush dismantled one of the major cold-war tank-traps still littering the East-West divide and released the Soviet Union from its long consignment to the status of an undesirable.
But neither the benefits of the measure nor all the gilded hoopla of the summit meeting could conceal the disappointment of Soviet officials that be it in trade or in arms, Washington and the West were still holding back, clearing away the debris of the cold war but not yet plunging to Moscow's side. 
 Whether they were complaining of continued restrictions on high-technology imports, or applying for full membership in the International Monetary Fund immediately after they were offered associate membership, or writing about the need to go further in arms cuts, Soviet officials have signaled their pique over the reserve of the West in dispensing favors to Moscow.
Mr. Bush was equally clear in signaling that he was awaiting more action from Moscow. In his speech to the Institute for International Relations, he coupled enthusiastic reviews of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's achievements with an explicit catalogue of unfinished business: the fate of the Baltic republics, the islands dispute with Japan, military aid to Cuba, military spending and "real reform."
 
Demanding Evidence First
 The debate, played out against the background of Mr. Bush's first summit meeting in Moscow, reflected the approach that the West first made evident in London earlier this month: that it is ready to dismantle cold-war barriers and to welcome the Soviet Union into the fold of favored nations, but will require more evidence of tangible Soviet reform before coming actively to Moscow's support.
In this context, Mr. Bush's announcement that he would propose that Congress grant the Soviet Union "most favored nation" trading status removed one of the most notorious stigmas on the Communist regime. The status effectively reduces trade tariffs to the lowest levels possible and thus encourages investment in industries that could trade with the United States.
The Soviet Union has made gaining most-favored-nation treatment a point of honor through the years. In the initial years of President Nixon's detente with Leonid I. Brezhnev, a trade accord was worked out that was to grant this status to the Soviets. But when negotiations over allowing a set number of Jews to emigrate collapsed, so did the trade accord and favorable trade status.
In 1974, the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment linked favored-trading status for Moscow to Jewish emigration, as did other laws curbing credits to the Soviets.
Even after Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev signed a new trade law last year incorporating "most favored nation" status for the Soviet Union, Washington made approval contingent on the removal of Moscow's emigration restrictions. That was accomplished when the Soviet Parliament passed a new emigration law in May.
 
Lumped With Vietnam
 Even if Mr. Bush's action was largely a technicality in the end, it represents one of the last major steps in returning Moscow to a normal slot in the world community. Only a handful of international miscreants still remain outside the "most-favored" club, including Vietnam, North Korea and Romania, which once had the status and hopes to regain it soon.
The action was not purely symbolic. In addition to urging "most favored nation" status for Moscow, Mr. Bush said he would ask Congress to repeal the Byrd and Stevenson amendments, which have limited American credits to the Soviet Union to a total of $300 million unless the credits apply to agricultural commodities. Together, the measures stand to increase the interest of private investors.
After the summit meeting, Mr. Gorbachev is certain to tout the trade package as evidence of the importance and effectiveness of his international connections. But coupled with Mr. Bush's tacit reprimands, the measure is not without an element of humiliation for the Soviet Union and for Mr. Gorbachev.
Before he traveled to London earlier this month to meet with Western leaders, the Soviet President had come under considerable criticism from Communist hard-liners for "holding his hat out" to the West. Now he is effectively being told by Mr. Bush that he can come out of the corner -- but that he is still being watched.
 
Bush Still Dominant
 Mr. Gorbachev also reportedly complained to Mr. Bush about continuing restrictions on high-technology exports under the "Cocom" list, which bars exports that can be used for the Soviet military. The list has been considerably shortened in recent years, but still exists.
The hard fact for Mr. Gorbachev, however, was that he was not in the position of strength at the summit meeting. For all the talk of a new "partnership" in Soviet-American relations, not only was it manifestly Mr. Bush who was the dominant partner, but Mr. Gorbachev was in open competition with new political forces at home.
That was most succinctly demonstrated when Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic, failed to show up at a session with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, arguing that he did not want to be part of the background that was a fixture of the "time of stagnation."
The summit ceremonies, it seemed, were still dedicated to the demolition of the old order. The inauguration of the new was yet to come.

HEADLINE: Harlem Battles Over Development Project

BYLINE: By E. R. SHIPP

 BODY:
One day next spring, ground breaking should begin on an effort to restore boarded-up buildings and bottomed-out lives in one of the most devastated areas of New York City: an urban wasteland that spans nearly 40 blocks in Harlem.
But as that day approaches -- a day that many have worked toward since the mid-1970's -- a consortium of Harlem's religious, civic and business leaders is locked in a fierce battle over who will control the project, known as Bradhurst. 
 Already, the Dinkins administration has set aside $18.4 million in its capital budget to start the first phase of the program, which consists of renovating 18 buildings to provide 320 apartments for homeless, low- and moderate-income families. That amount, if far short of the hundreds of millions that supporters would like, represents funds that could be difficult to come by in a time of growing fiscal uncertainties. Yet such a start and the strong support of Mayor David N. Dinkins has created hope and the impression that something finally will happen.
All this has intensified competition on several fronts: from sizable fees for providing "technical assistance" for the project to the right to brag about playing a major role in redeveloping a part of Harlem.
 
Left Out of Development
 "Because Harlem has been so left out of economic development in the city, everyone is looking to Bradhurst as the be-all and end-all," said the Rev. Dr. Preston R. Washington Sr., who is chairman of the Consortium for Central Harlem Development, the local organization designated by the city to help design and initiate the project. "But every minority contractor is not going to get a piece of Bradhurst. Every vendor is not going to be involved in Phase 1."
Everyone connected with the project recognizes that raising the money for the entire development will be difficult. Even so, they continue to dream big.
As envisioned, Bradhurst would represent social engineering on a scale never before tried by a municipal government. In fact, the Mayor, who has made it a keystone of his administration, touts it as a beacon to other cities struggling to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods.
The project would create 2,200 new apartments and single-family homes and 300,000 square feet of commercial space over a decade. It would also provide a variety of social services, job-training programs and recreational and cultural activities. And because one of its goals is community empowerment, officials hope it can be a stepping-off point for a new generation of political and business leaders.
The cost, which is to be paid by the city and private sources, is expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, with the price tag on the housing alone estimated at about $160 million.
 
'A Spiritual Mandate'
 "This has to be a cohesive and holistic plan with the people's development and strengthening in mind," Dr. Washington said. "That is why the churches are involved. For us this is not an economic development plan. For us it's a spiritual mandate."
The area in the project, stretching from 139th Street to 155th Street and from Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard to Bradhurst, Edgecombe and St. Nicholas Avenues, has been neglected for more than two decades.
Since 1970, an exodus of residents has left behind the poor, the uneducated, the unemployed. Nearly two-thirds of the households have incomes below $10,000 a year. In a community with one of the highest crime rates in the city, garbage-strewn vacant lots and tumbledown tenements, many of them abandoned and sealed, contribute to the sense of danger and desolation that pervades much of the area.
But there are pockets of middle-class stability, where questions are being raised by residents who wonder if their neighborhoods will be inundated with low-income families from Bradhurst, as well as a housing development for 900 families planned east of Bradhurst.
 
'More Work to Do'
 Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields, whose district includes the project area, said she worried that the city could be creating a "ghetto within a ghetto."
"We still have more work to do with planning for city services in general and social services especially," she said. "More people need to be brought into the fold at this point to plan and not just have things happen by chance."
City officials and consortium members are now trying to persuade foundations and corporations to help finance the economic development, educational and cultural aspects of the Bradhurst project. Many of the consortium's members, some of whom fear that the city's currently friendly administration might not be around for another term, hope they can obtain the financing soon.
Even if the private sector fails to make a firm commitment to the project, consortium members are hoping to begin construction next spring.
"You just can't start everything at once, but it does make sense to begin to talk about it and to identify resources," said Denise Notice-Scott, the deputy director of the Mayor's Office of Housing Coordination.
"In terms of the bigger picture, obviously we don't want to get too far ahead, where you have half the site built without developing the other components," she said. "But it takes time."
Taking the lead in insisting that the project provide more than bricks and mortar are churches, including about 60 congregations belonging to Harlem Churches for Community Improvement, which is among 11 groups in the Consortium for Central Harlem Development.
In fact, it was ministers who helped breathe new life into a dormant Bradhurst project in the early 1980's. Many of the ministers had felt that the Harlem Urban Development Corporation had lost sight of what Harlem needed: affordable housing and jobs. According to the ministers, the development corporation had spent too much time on projects like the international trade center planned for 125th Street and the Harlem-on-the-Hudson waterfront development, which would include luxury housing, restaurants, an amphitheater and nightclubs.
And when the development corporation found itself battling plans by the Koch administration that would have saturated the area with housing for the poor, homeless shelters, drug-treatment centers and municipal bus garages, the ministers entered the fray. They made their support contingent on a commitment by the development corporation to help with Bradhurst.
Mayor Edward I. Koch's administration, which questioned the expertise of the consortium's members, agreed to let the group develop 58 apartments, something many of the consortium's members, including the Rev. Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker, considered an insult.
"So we kept on grinding away, grinding away," Dr. Walker said. The Koch administration eventually agreed to 1,800 housing units. Under Mayor Dinkins, the project has grown to its present dimensions.
Within the consortium, whose members represent a variety of community interests, there are sharp disagreements over who should control the project. "We've got God fighting God," said Lloyd Williams, president of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce, a consortium member. "Preachers acting under the guise of God are fighting for their own agendas."
The ministers are not the only ones in conflict. The project has also pitted two prominent community development agencies, the Harlem Urban Development Corporation and the New York Urban Coalition, against each other.
The debate has made public a feeling kept quiet in Harlem for years: the sense that the development corporation, a state agency, has too little to show for its 20 years of stewardship.
But there are also concerns about the New York Urban Coalition, a private multiracial organization formed 24 years ago in the wake of the urban riots of the 1960's. Much of its efforts have centered on housing and education. But because it has its offices downtown in SoHo on Hudson Street and is not considered a "black" organization, it is viewed with some suspicion uptown.
The two organizations are, however, the most experienced development groups in the consortium.
 
'A Fundamental Question'
 Arthur H. Barnes, president of the Urban Coalition, acknowledged that "there's a fundamental question as to whether the implementation of Bradhurst is going to be a shared responsibility or whether one institution is going to dominate." The coalition, unlike the Harlem Development Corporation, stands to earn consulting and management fees for its involvement in the project.
The Rev. William M. James, chairman of the Harlem development corporation, said: "We have been against people who were not of the community coming in and controlling. That's H.U.D.C.'s stance. If that is a battleline, so be it."
Many in the consortium, including Mr. Williams of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce, suggested that the development corporation was afraid of competition from other groups, particularly since some state legislators have asserted that the state could save several million dollars a year by eliminating it. The Harlem agency is a subsidiary of the State Urban Development Corporation.
 
Need for Independence
 "If this, the single largest urban development project in the country, is launched and they are not the big cheese, it may lead to greater questions about the need for the independence" of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, Mr. Williams said.
But, he added, "you cannot build a community around one institution."
"There's been one institution building this community for 20-odd years and the community is in shambles," he said. "That is not a putdown of H.U.D.C. It is a reflection of the size of the problem."
After an impasse that lasted several months, the consortium recently agreed on how to divide the first phase of the project.
Under the agreement, which requires approval by the city, the development corporation would take responsibility for 74 percent of the apartments, and the Urban Coalition, 26 percent. The consortium members also agreed that in the next phase those percentages would be reversed. But the development corporation is balking.
Because the Bradhurst project has had so many false starts, everyone is now cautious but optimistic. Making it happen, Dr. Washington said, "is God's business and ours."

HEADLINE: USX Net Falls 88.2%; LTV Off 82.5%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The USX Corporation said today that its earnings plunged 88.2 percent in the second quarter with declines in both oil refining and steel making.
The Pittsburgh-based company, which is the nation's largest steelmaker and 12th largest energy company, said profits fell to $25 million in the 1991 quarter from $212 million in the corresponding year-earlier period. Earnings per share were not reported because shareholders in May approved a plan to split USX stock into separate classes for energy and steel. 
 The company posted a $212 million loss in the first six months of the year, in contrast to a profit of $388 million in the first half of 1990.
For the first time, the company reported separate earnings for its Marathon and U.S. Steel groups.
Earnings for the Marathon Group fell 50 percent in the latest quarter, to $64 million, or 25 cents a share, from $128 million, or 49 cents a share, despite a 13 percent sales rise, to $3.5 billion, from $3.1 billion.
Income from refining, marketing and transportation operations fell 50 percent, to $131 million in the quarter, from $263 million in the year-ago period. Higher crude-oil costs and competitive pricing for petroleum products narrowed profit margins for refined products, USX's chairman, Charles A. Corry, said.
Second-quarter operating income from exploration and production more than tripled. Mr. Corry attributed the growth to higher worldwide liquids prices and production levels.
The U.S. Steel group, which includes the company's sizable diversified businesses, reported a $39 million loss in contrast to earnings of $84 million, or $1.62 a share, a year earlier.
The group's sales fell 25 percent, to $1.2 billion from $1.6 billion.
"They're on an improving trend," said Charles A. Bradford, an analyst with the Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. He predicted the steel business would improve in the fourth quarter as the economy strengthens.
Mr. Corry said: "While steel order and production levels improved from the depressed levels of the first part of the year, the steel industry was still in the throes of recession in the second quarter. Steel prices continued under pressure as competition remained severe for the fewer tons required by the marketplace."
 
LTV
 The LTV Corporation said today its second-quarter earnings skidded 82.5 percent from a year ago, which it attributed to weak demand for steel products.
The company, based in Dallas, earned $13.4 million, or 5 cents a share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $76.6 million, or 53 cents a share, a year ago. Second-quarter sales slipped to $1.56 billion, from $1.59 billion in 1990.
"LTV's results continued to reflect a weak market for steel among automotive and construction industry customers," said David Hoag, the chairman and chief executive.
LTV's steel operations lost $23.4 million in the quarter in contrast to operating income of $38.8 million in the 1990 period. Sales fell more than 10 percent, to $883 million from $1.02 billion.
The company's aerospace and military division had operating income of $37.4 million on sales of $603 million, in contrast to a loss of $5.4 million on sales of $495 million in the 1990 period.
LTV is trying to sell the aerospace and military division to raise cash for pension fund and other costs related to its long-running bankruptcy reorganization.
LTV filed a reorganization plan during the quarter and reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a Federal agency, to pay for $3 billion in disputed pension funds.
LTV's smallest division, energy products, lost $2.5 million on sales of $75 million, in contrast to earnings of $3.2 million on sales of $75 million during the comparable period last year.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Fuel Efficiency: New Japan Coup?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 30

 BODY:
In a challenge to American auto makers, two of Japan's leading auto manufacturers say they will equip some of their compact cars with redesigned engines this fall that burn far less gasoline with virtually no loss of power.
The new engines improve mileage by achieving more complete combustion of gasoline. But some industry experts and Big Three executives disputed the mileage claims and doubted the new engines could be used in any but the smallest and lightest cars without increasing engine emissions. 
 The announcements have come in the last two days from the Honda Motor Company, which over the last two decades has developed some of the industry's most important engine technology, and from Mitsubishi Motors. Analysts say the new engines, which improve gasoline efficiency by 10 to 25 percent, may compound the problems Detroit is facing during one of the most severe sales downturns in decades. While Japanese makers have also been hit by the recession, they have gained market share from their American rivals.
 
A New Civic
 Only Honda's engine will appear in the United States this year, powering a new version of the popular Honda Civic that is expected in September. Mitsubishi said its new engine would be marketed first in Japan, though industry officials say the company already plans to bring it to the United States.
At a news conference at Honda's headquarters here today the company's president, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, said that tests by Japan's Ministry of Transport showed that the new Civic, with a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine, traveled more than 48 miles on a gallon of gas in the city, and more than 86 miles a gallon at a constant speed of about 37 miles an hour.
Mr. Kawamoto and Honda engineers said the engine's new combustion system had solved the emissions problem. But the company warned that the Japanese mileage tests were not directly comparable to tests in the United States, and did not include the high-speed highway driving common in the United States.
"This technology allows us to achieve quite better fuel economy without sacrificing performance," Mr. Kawamoto said. "But I don't know how it will sell in Japan or the United States. Consumers these days are not so concerned with saving gasoline."
 
Test Questioned
 David E. Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Automotive Transporation Program, said he doubted that Honda and Mitsubishi would achieve such large increases in fuel economy if the new engines were tested according to Environmental Protection Administration procedures.
The highest-mileage car currently sold in the United States is the Chevrolet Geo Metro, made by the Suzuki Motor Company of Japan for General Motors. The Metro gets 53 miles a gallon in city driving and 58 miles a gallon on the highway.
The General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation all said they had experimented with engines similar to those announced by Honda and Mitsubishi. But problems with high amounts of nitrogen oxide in tailpipe exhausts, especially in larger engines, have led the Big Three to focus their main efforts on other technologies for improving fuel efficiency.
"If Honda would introduce in the mid-sized Accord an engine that showed an improvement of 6 miles per gallon, or about 20 percent, in E.P.A. tests, that would really get my attention as an engineer," Mr. Cole said. "But that's tough."
 
More Air in the Cylinders
 Still, the Japanese announcements appeared to put some industry spokesmen on the defensive. "The three domestic car companies spend enormous sums to increase fuel efficiency," said Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association in Detroit. "It's not necessary to infer from this one instance that everyone else is a laggard."
The two new engines use redesigned cylinders and computer controls to allow far more air into the engine cylinders, burning fuel more quickly and completely.
For now, the technology appears practical only on relatively small engines powering compact cars. The new Honda engine is rated at 94 horsepower; it will be several years, Honda engineers said, before they can transfer the technology to larger, less efficient engines.
While the Japanese car makers are taking pains to describe the improvements in merely technological terms, they also have a significant political dimension. American car makers are arguing in Washington that any move in Congress to set significantly higher standards for fuel efficiency would force them to reduce the weight -- and thus the safety -- of American cars.
Although the Japanese makers have also fought against higher mileage requirements in the United States, some Japanese auto executives said they could readily adapt. "We know that we can meet whatever standards Congress sets," a senior executive of Nissan said recently. "But we already have enough troubles in America, and we don't need to make things worse." Both Nissan and Toyota are expected to announce similar new engine technologies in the near future.
Japanese makers broke into the American market by promoting the fuel efficiency of their cars, achieved in part because Japan levied a heavy tax in their home market on automobiles with gas-guzzling engines. That tax has since been eliminated. Now, the new engine technologies are arising from a different incentive: In the last two years, the efficiency of Japanese cars has declined, as all of the manufacturers moved to bigger, more profitable luxury cars. So the need for more efficient engines has become more urgent.
 
A Large Investment
 All the Japanese car makers have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing new engines, sensing an area where their technology can excel and where Detroit is falling farther behind.
"These engines are quite exciting," Richard Ko, an automobile analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, said today. "Ford and General Motors are working on the same technologies, I am sure, but the speed with which Japan is bringing these to market will open the gap even further."
Honda's introduction is likely to attract the most attention because of the fame the company gained in the 1970's for its CVCC engine, which was also introduced in the Civic. It surprised the industry when it met United States emission requirements without a catalytic converter or additional engine hardware. Last year Honda surpassed the Chrysler Corporation as the No. 3 auto seller in the United States. But fuel efficiency is hardly a sure seller: the Honda CRX, a small car made for city driving and fuel efficiency, is not selling well.
 
The 'Swirl Effect'
 Honda's new engine, called the VTEC-E, is based on technology first developed in 1988. Its key feature is the creation of what auto engineers term a "swirl effect" in the mixture of air and fuel that enters the engine's cylinders and heads into its combustion chambers.
The "swirl" is a downward spiral of fuel that distributes air and fuel toward the central axis of the cylinder. The new engine attempts to direct the swirl with great precision so that the fuel is ignited close to the center of the combustion chamber, the hottest part, shortening the combustion time and assuring that the burning is more nearly complete.
Meanwhile, a special sensor constantly adjusts the mixture of air and fuel, so that the fuel is far more highly diluted by air than in a conventional engine. Honda said that the number of intake valves that open also depends on the speed that the engine is turning; when speeds are low, one intake valve shuts down to reduce friction.
The new engine, Mr. Kawamoto said, would be at least 10 percent more efficient than its predecessors. But the new Civic, he said, would be at least 20 percent more efficient than existing models because of other changes in the car.
 
Mitsubishi's Advance
 Mitsubishi Motors' new engine, called the MVV for Mitsubishi Vertical Vortex, uses similar technology. It creates two vortexes that flow into the cyclinder, one of air and the other a mixture of air and fuel. That also allows a much higher ratio of air to fuel. Mitsubishi says that in the laboratory it has achieved improvements of 20 percent in fuel consumption.
To aid combustion, the MVV uses three valves a cylinder, one more than in a conventional engine. The multi-valve technology was invented in America but commercialized in Japan in the early 1980's and skillfully exploited in recent years.

Diagrams: "Innovations in Engine Technology"
 Mitsubishi and Honda have announced advances in engine technology. The designs of the new engines are similar in that they provide for greater control of combustion. The Mitsubish Vertical Vortex engine will be introduced in Japan late this year.
 
Standard Engine
 In a normal engine, the air and gas are mixed before they enter the cylinder. Combustion occurs when the mixture enters the cylinder and is ignited by the spark plug.
 
Mitsubishi Engine
 In this engine, an additional mixture of air and gasoline occurs in the cylinder, much closer to the area of combustion. The use of an extra air-intake valve allows for greater precision in the mixture, which is controlled and fine-tuned by an on-board computer. With this type of control, a much higher ratio of air to fuel can be used to achieve higher fuel efficiency, without significant loss of horsepower (Source: Mitsubishi Motors) (Pg. D7)

HEADLINE: Short-Term Yields Fall A Bit More

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on short-term certificates of deposit continued the downtrend of the previous week. In fact, the Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., noted that the drop this week was a little more pronounced than it was a week ago.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of the Monitor, said yesterday: "Deposit rates continue to decline even though they touched what we might call a theoretical 'bottom' of a down cycle three weeks ago. This reflects a further softening of the economy and indicates a longer period of recovery than many economists originally anticipated." 
 Analysts at the Monitor said they believed that the decline in yields would continue.
The yields on three-month Treasury bills at the auction on Monday, however, were not much changed from the previous week.
 
Largest Gains in Yields
 The largest change in the return on money market accounts among the banks in the New York area was registered by the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company. The yield dropped 26 basis points to 4.85 percent.
The largest gain for six-month certificates of deposit was by First Nationwide, where yields rose 20 basis points, to 5.90 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Hudson City Savings and four other area institutions reduced their three-month certificate yield by 10 basis points.
Among major New York commercial banks the average six-month certificate of deposit lost 6 basis points, to 5.59 percent. The average money market account at these banks dropped 2 basis points, to 5.12 percent.
The same banks reduced the average yield on three-month certificates of deposit by 4 basis points, to 5.41 percent.
Depositors nationwide saw their three-month certificate yield decline by a basis point, to 5.72, while the six-month certificate rose a basis point, to 6.00 percent.
 


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, July 31, 1991.

HEADLINE: Paychecks Outpace Inflation For Second Quarter in Row

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
American wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent over the last three months as paychecks grew faster than inflation for the second straight quarter, the Government said today.
It was the first time since 1986 that Americans enjoyed such consecutive wage gains outpacing increases in the cost of living, the Labor Department reported. 
 Analysts said the improved buying power could help buoy an economic recovery.
The Labor Department's employment cost index showed that wages and salaries paid by private industry in the April-June quarter grew by 1 percent, or at an annual rate of 4.1 percent.
 
Inflation at 2.8%
 That means workers' wages rose faster than the cost of living, because inflation during those three months ran at an annual rate of 2.8 percent.
Likewise, in the first quarter of 1991, workers' wages were ahead of inflation.
"If wages can stay ahead of inflation, that could help sustain our expansion," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. It would give workers more money to spend, he said, without their having to borrow or dip into savings.
The overall employment cost index, which measures both wages and benefits, rose 4.6 percent for the 12 months that ended in June, a slower advance than the 5.4 percent increase for the year ending in June 1990. The overall index counts workers in government and private industry.
Benefit costs, which include soaring health-care premiums, jumped 6 percent for the year ending in June while wages and salaries rose 4 percent, the Government said.
 
Watched Closely by Fed
 Some analysts were worried about the overall 4.6 percent increase in employment costs, noting that the index is considered a key gauge of inflationary wage pressures and is watched closely by the Federal Reserve.
The Bush Administration has kept up pressure on the central bank to stimulate economic demand by lowering interest rates.
"It's bad news for the economy, because that benefit cost gets embedded in that core rate of inflation, and there's no doubt the Fed worries about that number," said Jack Albertine, who heads an economic forecasting firm in Washington.
A separate Labor Department report today showed that workers covered by collective bargaining contracts settled from April through June provided for annual wage gains averaging 3.4 percent over the life of the pact. That was an increase over the 2.5 percent annual gains in the settlements that the new contracts replaced.

HEADLINE: USAir Sets New East Coast Service

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
USAir said yesterday that it would begin hourly service next month between Logan International Airport in Boston and National Airport in Washington.
The move is intended to position the airline for an upturn in the economy, and perhaps to discourage rival carriers from increasing their presence on that route. 
 The service, beginning Sept. 4, will operate on the hour from 7 A.M. to 8 P.M. on weekdays, adding 4 flights to USAir's existing 10 daily nonstops between the two cities.
"Business travelers like a consistent schedule," said David Shipley, an assistant vice president of USAir. He said that departure times currently vary for USAir's existing flights between Washington and Boston, but in September they will depart on the hour.
In strict financial terms, it would seem to be premature to add flights in the Northeast, a region in which airline traffic is still suffering from the recession.
Moreover, the Washington-Boston market is currently served by other carriers, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines. And the latter two carriers are currently positioning themselves to become even stronger in the Washington-to-Boston corridor.
Last week, Northwest signed an agreement in principle with the Trump Shuttle and its bankers providing for Northwest to manage the money-losing operation for up to 10 years, apparently with an option to buy. And the Pan Am Shuttle is one of the assets in the package for which Delta recently offered $310 million, up from an earlier $260 million bid.
One analyst, who would not speak for attribution, said USAir's announcement might be intended as a pre-emptive strike, to discourage Delta or Northwest from stepping up their Washington-to-Boston presence, beyond acquiring the shuttles.
Mr. Shipley insisted that USAir's new service is not a competitor to either shuttle, both of which require a change of plnes in New York for passengers flying between Washington and Boston. Also, the airplanes on the shuttle runs are used primarily for that purpose, while the USAir planes that will fly between the two cities beginning in September will probably originate elsewhere and continue to other cities.
USAir's strategy, Mr. Shipley said, is to look ahead. "We're positioning ourselves for when the economy turns," he said, "because the Northeast is a strong market."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
New York City Note Sale Today

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
New York City's budget woes and weak economy do not appear to have posed much of a problem for securities dealers as they prepared to bid today for $1 billion of the city's notes.
The city's difficulties have forced it to pay unusually high interest rates on long-term bonds, with rates well above 8 percent likely for 20-year bonds at a $750 million financing scheduled for next week. But today's short-term note sale is an entirely different matter. 
 The short-term notes -- called TAN's, for tax anticipation notes -- are expected to carry yields for large investors of slightly more than 5 percent, but less than 5.25 percent, securities dealers estimated yesterday. The exact interest rate will be known this morning when the city opens bids from up to 10 different securities firms, each of which will be bidding for $100 million or more of the issue.
 
Lowest Possible Bids Expected
 Securities dealers are eager to offer the city the lowest possible rates on the notes, in hopes that the city will then award them a bigger share of the city's bond sales, where profit margins are wider.
The perceived safety of the notes rests on the fact that they are secured by $2.8 billion of real estate tax payments the city expects to receive next January. Those payments are held in special accounts controlled by the state Comptroller.
The real estate tax payments are regarded by investors as far more certain than other forms of city income. For example, city notes backed by state revenue grants were offered in late April with a yield of 6.75 percent.
Most of the notes are expected to be sold to large institutions, like mutual funds, particularly those that specialize in New York securities. Notes sold to individual investors in amounts of less than $100,000 are expected to carry a lower yield of around 4.75 percent after fees and price markups by securities dealers.
 
Earlier Maturity of City Notes
 For competitive reasons, securities dealers are loath to say exactly what interest rate they plan to bid for the notes, but there was widespread agreement that the city's notes would yield considerably less than the 5.45 percent quoted yesterday for outstanding New York State notes due next March. "The city notes have better ratings than the state issue and a shorter maturity," said one note trader who asked not to be identified.
The Feb. 3 maturity for the city notes is an advantage, compared with the March 31 due date for the state notes because there is a dearth of other notes maturing in February. That earlier maturity helps attract mutual funds, which want a variety of maturity dates for their investments.
Mutual funds that call themselves "money market funds" because of their focus on short-term investments are also attracted because the shorter maturity of the city issue helps them comply with a recent directive from the Securities and Exchange Commission that they reduce the average maturity of their portfolios from a maximum of 120 days to a maximum of 90 days.
 
Highest Rating From S.& P.
 In the ratings competition with state notes, the city notes earned a clean sweep yesterday when the Standard & Poor's Corporation assigned them its highest rating of S.& P. 1+, while the outstanding state notes issued earlier this year were rated a notch lower, at S.& P. 1. Both are good-quality ratings, but when investors compare securities for differences of a few hundredths of a percentage point, even slight differences in ratings become important.
Richard Larkin, a vice president at S.& P., said the city notes deserved the highest possible rating "because at the time they fall due, the city will be in a very strong cash position."
He noted that New York State notes would not be in such a strong cash position when its notes fall due in March. "That's a time of year when the state is squeezed for cash," he said, "and in recent years it has been forced to do some emergency financing."
Tomorrow, the state plans to sell $191.3 million of general-obligation bonds in a long-term financing that is unrelated to the city's note sale or to the state's note sale last spring.
S.& P. yesterday also affirmed its medium-grade A- rating for city bonds. Mr. Larkin said the rating was held unchanged "because the city has made some tough decisions and produced a balanced budget plan with no substantial gimmicks."
Moody's Investors Service gave the city notes its highest rating of MIG-1, compared with MIG-2 for the state notes.
Fitch Investors Service, which gave the city notes its highest F-1+ rating on Monday, said then that "although the city's serious economic and budget problems persist, the likelihood of these problems interfering with the security of these TAN's is extremely remote."
 
Other Rates Fairly Flat
 Elsewhere in the credit markets interest rates were unchanged to slightly lower in quiet trading.
In advance of today's Treasury announcement about a $38 billion offering of securities due in 3, 10 and 30 years, securities dealers said there seemed to be enough customer demand to justify holding prices at current levels.
The outstanding issue of 7 percent notes due in 1994 was offered late in the day at 99 19/32, up 2/32, to yield about 7.16 percent, while the 8 percent issue due in 2001 was at 98 25/32, up 2/ 32, to yield 8.18 percent. The 8 1/8 percent bonds due in 2021 were at 97 9/32, up 6/32, to yield 8.37 percent, down from 8.39 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: About New York

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
New York City is home to more gay and lesbian people than any other American city. Many violate stereotypes and live in places far removed from Greenwich Village.
Like Jackson Heights, Queens. The other night, a group of gay and lesbian activists from Greenwich Village, probably this planet's gay epicenter, descended on the Queens community to provide a message of pride, promise and power. They took everything from strategies on political organizing to literature on gay nudist camps and boxing clubs to urgent information on AIDS. 
 A few of the 50 or so local residents in attendance had never attended any sort of gay function before but all seemed at ease in the basement of the Parish House of St. Mark's Episcopal Church at 33-50 82d Street.
"There is a togetherness here," said Lou Darling, who recently retired from managing a shoe store.
"It's very important we become more visible," said a lesbian who has lived with the same woman for 44 years and asked that her name not be used.
The gathering was staged by the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center. The organization calls such gatherings its "Orientation on the Road" -- periodic efforts to inform non-Manhattanites about its many services as well as to urge them to organize. Financing for the orientations comes from the New York Foundation.
"These are the people you just don't see," declared Jay Blocher, a center spokesman.
But starting on Monday, national gay and lesbian attention will be focused directly on Jackson Heights. The trial of the accused killers of Julio Rivera, who was fatally assaulted with a knife, hammer and wrench on July 1, 1990, will begin in Queens County Criminal Court.
Mr. Rivera was gay, lived in Jackson Heights and has become a bitter symbol of bigotry's stain. Hundreds have carried candles in his name.
The shocking fact is that even as more gay people come out of the closet, doing so seems to be getting more dangerous. In the last two years, reports of anti-gay and lesbian violence have more than doubled. Someone is shooting at people in Central Park's Ramble. "We're four times more likely to be victims of bias assault than any other group in the city," asserted Matt Foreman, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project.
So it was that many divergent trends came together in a Queens church basement. The sickeningly dark one, of course, is mounting gay-bashing -- so cruelly redundant when so many gay people are stricken with AIDS. But there simultaneously seems a greater sense of place for homosexuals -- socially, politically, economically. "This is a community the Mayor cares for very much," said Jan Carl Park, Mayor David N. Dinkins's representative.
And there seems less sterotyping, more chances to find one's own niche within the larger gay community. Tables were laden with a amazing array of pamphlets -- from gay bereavement groups to Seventh Day Adventist activities for homosexuals to lesbian wrestling clubs to an organization for chubby gay men to meet.
Topics were immensely varied. People who work with alcoholics and drug addicts said the incidence of homosexuals and lesbians dependent on alcohol or drugs is much higher than in the general population, largely because there are so few places to meet other than bars. Yvette Burton of the center offered help.
Daisy DeJesus of Las Buenas Amigas said, "Our platform has been to empower and increase the visibility of the Latina lesbian."
Mr. Foreman gave some advice on how to avoid attacks. 'Never yell 'Help!' " he said. "In New York City, that's a sure signal to some people to close their windows and look the other way. Yell 'Fire.' "
Susan Rogers, who works for a group that mediates disputes between homosexuals, gave legal advice. "We have to recognize that sex in a public place is a crime," she said. "We must curtail our sex in the subways, in the libraries, in the parks."
Stephanie Grant, the center's director of special projects, rose to say she first lived in Jackson Heights when she moved to New York. "My girlfriend and I got called faggots walking down the street," she said. Ms. Grant spoke of the opportunites provided by the new City Charter, which greatly increases the City Council's power. "There are a number of openly gay and lesbian candidates running," she said, urging block voting.
The evening ended with small talk. One man said he had never before heard about the AIDS Center for Queens County; now that he knows it's a 10-minute walk away, he thinks he'll volunteer.
Patrick Henriquez, manager of a linen store who helps out on the road shows, was pleased. "If we get even one person who feels better about himself, we've done a lot," he said.

HEADLINE: Crossland Will Seek A Merger

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Crossland Savings, one of the largest savings institutions in New York state, announced yesterday that its losses from bad loans had accumulated to the point that it had agreed with Federal regulators to seek a merger with a stronger company.
Until a partner is found, the Brooklyn-based savings bank will remain open for business, and its deposits will continue to be insured up to the maximum of $100,000 per account allowed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 Crossland, which changed its name in 1985 from Metropolitan Savings Bank to reflect its grand plans to expand nationwide, was a victim of the downturn in the New York real estate market. As developers defaulted on loans for projects, Crossland's cushion of capital to absorb additional losses all but disappeared.
 
Announces $123 Million Loss
 Yesterday, as a Federal bank examination neared completion, Crossland announced a second-quarter loss of $123.1 million, equal to $8.84 a share. Losses have totaled $741 million in the last two-and-one-half years.
The company was unable to replenish its capital base as outside investor groups, like the Coast to Coast Financial Corporation, controlled by the Pritzker family of Chicago, shied away. By yesterday, its capital shortfall was so great that a proposed plan to convert debt and preferred stock to new equity would not have been enough to meet minimum Federal standards.
Although Crossland is insolvent by the regulators' accounting rules, it will not be closed. "By allowing them to remain open we have learned that you can avoid the deterioration in values that normally occurs with a Government conservatorship," said a senior official in the Office of Thrift Supervision, who insisted that he not be identified. He added, "With core deposits of $6 billion, it is a very attractive company."
 
Large Cost to Government
 Because any buyer of Crossland would accept only the financially sound parts of its business, however, F.D.I.C. officials estimate that a merger would cost the Government agency $500 million to $1 billion, making it one of the 10 most expensive bank collapses in history.
Crossland, with $9.9 billion in assets, vies with the Dime Savings Bank, of Garden City, L.I., as the largest savings institution in the New York market.
Regulators predicted that a buyer for Crossland could be found in two to four months, and said that the Republic National Bank of New York had already expressed an interest, as had two other unidentified banks. Republic, which acquired the Williamsburg Savings Bank and the Manhattan Savings Bank on favorable terms in the late 1980's, is one of the strongest banks in the country.
"Any of the large banks in the city would be interested in their branch network," said Gary Gordon, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. Other banks will shun Crossland's holdings of troubled real estate loans, he said, but he noted that the institution's branches were extraordinarily effective at collecting consumer deposits, which average more than $200 million a branch and exceed $300 million at some branches.
 
Dim View for Shareholders
 Howard Rosencrans, an analyst at H. D. Brous & Company, a securities firm in Great Neck, L.I., said he expected that Crossland's value to common shareholders, as well as to holders of its $330 million of preferred stock, "will be wiped out by whatever merger occurs." Crossland's common stock fell 25 cents yesterday, to 50 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange, which plans to de-list the company's issues.
Mr. Rosencrans said that as losses mounted in the last two years, prospects of a rebound grew dim "and the main goal of management has been to prevent a run by depositors." Crossland's chairman, Maurice L. Reissman, who is 48 years old, will remain the company's top officer, at least until a merger is arranged.
The slide in Crossland's fortunes was swift. As recently as 1988, when the company was $15 billion in size and looking for more acquisitions, Mr. Reissman could boast that "we are one of the better banks in terms of asset qualtiy" and "one of the most profitable thrifts in America."
The company is planning to sell all of its operations outside the New York metropolitan area, including small savings institutions in Florida, Oregon, Virginia and Washington state, and a large mortgage-banking company in California.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW;
BUSH IS PLEDGING TO ACCORD SOVIETS BEST TRADE TERMS

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 30

 BODY:
Proclaiming the onset of "a new age of promise" at the start of his fourth summit conference with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Bush promised today that he would seek as soon as possible to put the Soviet Union on equal footing with the United States' other trading partners.
"We have good reason to hope," Mr. Bush said. "One by one, the cruel realities of the cold war flicker and fade and a new world of opportunities beckons us forward." 
 Mr. Bush said he would ask Congress to grant Moscow preferred tariff terms, known as most-favored-nation status, which Mr. Gorbachev has long sought as evidence of economic normalization between two countries that for decades led rival trading blocs. The President's action provided a political tonic for the beleaguered Soviet leader, though a largely symbolic one; the Soviet Union produces relatively little of interest to American buyers.
 
Bush's Sharp Words
 Mr. Bush also met with Boris N. Yeltsin, the newly elected President of the Russian republic. Mr. Yeltsin declined to meet Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev together, but he gave significant support to Mr. Gorbachev's attempt to give the Soviet republics more power by announcing he was ready to sign a new union treaty changing the power relationship between the Kremlin and the republics. He said he and Mr. Gorbachev reached agreement this morning after they worked out a complicated tax-sharing solution.
Mr. Bush offered sharp words about Moscow's attempts to rein in the rebellious Baltic republics and about its continuing aid to Cuba.
 
Question of U.S. Aid
 Speaking in the vaulted, richly embellished St. George's Hall, the largest room in the Kremlin, surrounded by the insignia of celebrated Russian military units, Mr. Bush praised Mr. Gorbachev for "instituting reforms that changed the world" and said that he had won Americans' "respect and admiration for his uncommon vision and courage in replacing old orthodoxy." [Transcripts of Bush and Gorbachev remarks are on page A10.]
"In the U. S.," President Bush said in response to a warm welcome from Mr. Gorbachev, "everyone now knows at least two Russian words: glasnost and perestroika. Here, everyone appreciates an English word, democracy."
The two leaders then moved into St. Catherine's Hall, an opulent chamber hung with pink silk and adorned with malachite pilasters that once served as Catherine the Great's throne room, to begin their negotiations. Today they concentrated on economic questions, especially the ticklish problems raised by the scope of Soviet changes and American aid.
Mr. Gorbachev and his aides tried to play down their differences with the United States on issues like the timing of full Soviet membership in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which Mr. Bush wants to delay. But the Soviet leader kept the pressure on, commenting at one point, "Cooperation between the superpowers should bring economic improvement to the people of the Soviet Union" -- his most pressing domestic political goal.
 
40 Minutes With Yeltsin
 President Bush spent four hours talking with President Gorbachev, but he also spent 40 minutes alone with Mr. Yeltsin. Reflecting the tensions between the central Government and its constituent parts, the republics, Mr. Yeltsin declined Mr. Gorbachev's invitation to join him and Nursultan A. Nazarbayev at a session with Mr. Bush.
Mr. Nazarbayev, the leader of Kazakhstan, took part in the talks, but in a reassertion of his independence, Mr. Yeltsin said he did not want to be part of a "faceless mass audience."
He told Cable News Network in an interview that according to the new, still unratified union treaty it was up to each republic to conduct its own foreign policy, with the union government headed by Mr. Gorbachev merely coordinating the actions of the republics.
American officials offered no support for that assertion, but Mr. Bush praised Mr. Yeltsin, a Siberian populist, and a State Department official said the key element in a technical cooperation agreement signed today by the two countries "specifies that we can deal directly with all levels of government in the Soviet Union, including the republics."
Mr. Gorbachev said in an interview Monday with ABC News that he had no fear of being eclipsed in popularity or power by Mr. Yeltsin.
"I'm the man who started all of this," he said of the changes sweeping his country.
Five separate agreements were signed by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Soviet officials, covering cooperation in fields like disaster relief, counterterrorism in civil air crises, emergency medical supplies and housing construction. The technical cooperation agreement sets up a framework for programs, agreed on at the summit conference of rich industrialized countries in London earlier this month, including food distribution, energy and converting defense production for civilian use.
The White House said it would seek Congressional backing for up to $20 million in economic help, a relatively small amount, in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
 
Arms Talks and the Mideast
 Mr. Baker announced no decision on a return trip to the Middle East, but a senior American official said he was likely to fly to Jerusalem on Thursday, while Mr. Bush visits Kiev in the Ukraine.
Mr. Baker will try to iron out the last major problem blocking a Middle East peace conference -- the composition of a Palestinian delegation. If he goes, the official said, he will almost certainly not be accompanied by Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet Foreign Minister, as some Soviet diplomats had suggested on Monday.
Speaking with reporters this afternoon, Mr. Bessmertnykh said little about the peace conference, but he indicated that the Soviet Union was more interested than the United States in pressing ahead with further arms negotiations once the strategic arms reduction pact is signed on Wednesday.
American officials have proposed a pause in arms talks, but Mr. Bessmertnykh said the Soviet Union thinks the process is still "somewhere in the middle."
He continued, "We believe that we should immediately go into another consultation and negotiations on further reductions of strategic arms."
He said the two countries should also discuss chemical weapons, nonproliferation, underground testing, "open skies" aerial inspection and "the space business" -- presumably a reference to the American program to develop a shield against nuclear weapons.
There were also other bits of evidence that even though the two countries have reached the end of "a long era as adversaries," as Mr. Bush said, serious problems remain.
Without in any way suggesting that the issues must be resolved before progress could be made in other areas, Mr. Bush mentioned Cuba, the Baltic republics and the Kurile Islands, which the Soviet Union disputes with Japan, as points of contention between Washington and Moscow.
"The United States poses no threat to Cuba," Mr. Bush said. "Therefore, there is no need for the Soviet Union to funnel millions of dollars in military aid to Cuba, especially since a defiant Castro, isolated by his own obsolete totalitarianism, denies his people any move toward democracy. Castro does not share your faith in glasnost. Castro does not share your faith in perestroika."
He called again for reductions in Soviet military spending that he said "will help you fill the shelves of your stores."
Mr. Bush made his long-anticipated announcement about sending the request for most-favored-nation status to Congress in his major speech of the day, delivered before a respectful but by no means enthusiastic audience that only partly filled a hall at the Moscow State Institute for International Relations this afternoon.
At last year's summit conference in Washington, the two countries signed a trade treaty embodying the change that will now be sent to Capitol Hill, where approval appears certain. The White House said Mr. Bush decided to submit the treaty to Congress after the passage by the Supreme Soviet on May 20 of emigration legislation meeting international standards.
 
More Costly Visa Applications
That legislation, Moscow newspapers said today, will be costly to Soviet emigrants. In connection with the more liberal rules, which are expected to result in a rush of visa applications, the one-time fee for a special foreign travel passport increases from 200 rubles to 1,000, more than triple the monthly salary of many Soviet workers.
Mr. Bush also said today that he would propose legislation to remove restrictions on Soviet eligibility for United States Government credit and credit guarantee programs, and promised to press for agreements covering taxation and investments.
Speaking to an audience largely composed of Soviet intellectuals, Mr. Bush reviewed what he and Mr. Gorbachev have agreed upon during the last two years, laying special emphasis on what he termed "the crowning proof that we are overcoming the old cold war animosities" -- the two countries' cooperation in the Persian Gulf.

Graphic: "A Day's Work: 5 Accords"
 
Aviation Security
 The accord sets forth prodecures to be followed in the event of an airline hijacking or sabotage in the territory of either county, including communications and assistance in criminal proceedings.
 
Disaster Assistance
 The accord will set up a system for "timely and direct exchange" of information, requests for assistance and joint-responses in the event of natural or man-made disasters.
 
Medical Supplies
 The agreement makes formal a program begun earlier by Bush that provides the Soviet Union with medical products in short supply. Administered through the private organization Project Hope, it has already provided $8 million in supplies to the Baltics, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, as well as a burn treatment center and AIDS clinic in Moscow.
 
Housing Construction and Finance
The program, to be carried out through the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has these goals:
 
* Converting government-owned housing to non-government ownership.
 
* Expanding the housing supply and homeownership opportunities.
 
* Encouraging construction by setting up and managing non-government housing finance institutions.
 
* Developing policies, including free-enterprose zones, to encourage construction and rehabilitation.
 
* Developing a private sector construction industry that supports private initiative.
 
Technical Economic Cooperation
 The agreement seeks to expand economic cooperation between the two countries to the areas of food distribution, energy, defense conversion, economic education and transportation. There is no financing yet for the program. The Bush Administration supports legislation that would provide $15 million to $20 million infiscal 1992.

Soviet Trade Favor Costs U.S. Little

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
President Bush's announcement that he would submit a trade agreement with the Soviet Union to Congress and reduce tariffs on Soviet imports is unlikely to result in a substantial, immediate increase in Soviet-American trade. But it could encourage foreign investment in the foundering Soviet economy, experts said today.
The United States accounts for less than 3 percent of all Soviet exports, and most of these exports consist of commodities that already enter the United States at very low tariff rates. "In the range of things we can do for the Soviet Union, this is symbolically important and economically inexpensive," said Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. 
 Although the agreement is widely described as a way to help the Soviet Union, some Administration officials privately contend that the United States may actually benefit more than the Soviet Union. The United States has fewer trade barriers to begin with, these Administration officials say, so an agreement to lower these barriers helps the United States more than the Soviet Union.
But over a longer period of time, perhaps one or two decades, access to the United States market combined with new economic policies in the Soviet Union may encourage foreign and domestic investment in an internationally competitive manufacturing sector, said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University economist.
 
From Pressed Board to Vodka
 In that case, a greater proportion of Soviet exports would benefit from the policy change. "When you do economic reforms, the whole mix of Soviet exports will change," Mr. Sachs said.
Many manufactured goods from the Soviet Union, even when up to international standards of quality, enter the United States at very high tariffs that make them uncompetitive. For example, importers of pressed wood fiberboard from the Soviet Union now pay duties equal to 30 percent of the shipment's value.
With most-favored-nation status, which President Bush said today he would grant to the Soviet Union, fiberboard importers would pay a duty of only 3 percent.
Similarly, the duty on a bottle of Stolichnaya vodka would drop to eight cents from $1.07, said John G. Swanhaus, the president of Pepsico Wines and Spirits, which imports the vodka and sells it to a retailer. The retail price per bottle is typically $13 or $14.
The United States grants most-favored-nation status to almost every country in the world. The status means that imports from those countries enter the United States under the lower of two sets of tariffs that exist for each product.
The duty on another Soviet specialty, caviar, would drop from 30 percent to 15 percent, which would cut the wholesale price of a can by as much as 10 percent.
 
Reassuring Investors
 Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said the trade agreement was a way to encourage American businesses to start exploring the Soviet Union, even if they are not ready for large investments. "What we're trying to do is bring the Soviet Union around to the point where American companies will feel comfortable investing there," he said in an interview.
President Bush's announcement that he would finally give Congress the trade agreement, which was signed last year, drew a mixed reaction from lawmakers.
Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who is the Senate minority Leader, praised the move and said he would seek quick Senate approval for the agreement. The pact will be considered by Congress under the so-called "fast-track" procedures that allow for the automatic approval of trade agreements unless both houses pass a resolution of disapproval within 60 days.
 
Standing Up for the Baltics
 Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, and Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, have been trying to organize opposition to the agreement because it includes the Soviet Union's three Baltic republics, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. The United States has never recognized the Soviet Union's annexation of the three republics, and technically has had separate trade agreements with each of them since the 1920's.
When the United States ended its trade agreement with Moscow in 1951, it only suspended the agreements with the Baltic states so as to prevent the Soviet Union from shipping goods through Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian ports at low tariffs.
Mr. Bradley has informally circulated a bill that would explicitly exclude the Baltic republics from the trade agreement discussed today, and would remove the suspensions of the original trade agreements.
Timothy A. O'Leary, a spokesman for the office of the United States Trade Representative, said that the inclusion of the Baltic states in the trade pact would only last as long as they were controlled by the Soviet Union, and did not represent any diplomatic recognition of that control.
The United States will also begin keeping track of imports and exports from each of the Baltic republics instead of including them in statistics for trade with the Soviet Union, he said.
Two disputes had prevented the trade agreement discussed today from immediately going to Congress of after its signing in Washington on June 1, 1990, by President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. One disagreement, concerning Soviet restrictions on emigration, was resolved late last year.
The other dispute, concerning Soviet protection for United States copyrights and patents, was not resolved until last week. The Motion Picture Association of America, an influential trade group, had withdrawn American films from the Soviet market to protest what it called the wholesale illegal copying of movies for profit in the Soviet Union.
Soviet officials have drafted a new copyright law that would provide greater protection to foreign movies.

Gorbachev and Bush Transcripts: Dealing With a Rapidly Changing World

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 30

 BODY:
Following are transcripts of the remarks made today by President Gorbachev, as translated by his interpreter, and by President Bush at the opening of their summit conference:
 
PRESIDENT GORBACHEV
 Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, I would like to extend a warm and sincere welcome to you on Soviet soil within the walls of our ancient Kremlin. 
 It has been a little more than a year since I visited the United States. This year has seen events of tremendous importance, both in our two countries and in the world.
For us in the U.S.S.R. it was a year that put to a daily test our capacity to act constructively at a critical time in the process of transition and our progress along the path of democratic transformations and reform.
It was also a challenging year for the international community. It, too, is going through a period of transition to a new, unprecedented system of international relations.
The beginning of a new era in history has been a tough test indeed for leaders of states, requiring enormous efforts, a sense of high responsibilities, strictest realism and vision. A great deal in world politics will continue to depend on how the Soviet Union and the United States interact with each other. For the first time ever our two countries have a chance to build their relations on the natural basis of universal human values and national interests.
We are beginning to realize that we need each other, that the security, internal stability and dynamic development of each of our two countries benefits both of them.
Not only our two nations, but the entire world needs this kind of U.S.-Soviet relationship. The world has realized this and has given us support in our joint efforts.
 
Strategic Arms Treaty
 Today and tomorrow we will be discussing with you, Mr. President, these and many other matters. The Soviet people welcome you as the leader of a great power, as a statesman who is making a great contribution to the shaping of new world politics.
Mr. President, in recent months and weeks, the Kremlin, a symbol of our nation's centuries-old history, has been the scene of events that will shape this country's future. Tomorrow it will witness another such event, the signing of the treaty on the reduction of strategic offensive arms.
It is more than just a major step in the process of disarmament. It is a sign of the growing irreversibility of the fundamental change for the better in world developments.
The results of the G-7 meeting in London further solidify this irreversibility. It was the beginning of a new type of international economic relations, which will form the material foundation for world politics in the 21st century.
All this, I hope will allow our peoples to benefit more directly from the improving Soviet-U.S. relationship.
Allow me, Mr. President, to assure everyone who will following our work with you in the coming days that we shall try to live up to the hopes of our fellow citizens, the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union.
Once again, Mr. President and Mrs. Bush, welcome to the Soviet Union.
 
PRESIDENT BUSH
 Well, first let me thank President Gorbachev, leaders that met us last night, people along the way, for their warm welcome here. We've been looking forward to this visit. And I'm honored to be in Moscow to meet with President Gorbachev for this historic summit at a time when tension gives way to a new season of hope. We need only compare the words of the cold war with our historic accomplishments in recent years to realize that a new age of promise has dawned. No visitor to this country can fail to see the signs of change.
Since my last visit in 1985, we've witnessed the opening of Europe and the end of a world polarized by suspicion. That year, Mikhail Gorbachev assumed leadership of the Soviet Union, put many monumental changes into motion. He began instituting reforms that basically changed the world.
And in the United States, everyone now knows at least two Russian words, glasnost and perestroika. And here, everyone appreciates the English word democracy.
Our nations have moved forward in every sphere, political, military and economic, and we stood together for the first time in 50 years to face down aggression in the gulf -- the Persian Gulf -- and this way we take, as the President just said, another historic step away from the cold war with the signing of the Start treaty.
 
Economic Cooperation
 In the next two days, President Gorbachev and I hope to build upon this beginning to forge a U.S.-Soviet agenda built not upon military confrontation, but upon economic and security cooperation. In the economic sphere, we hope to build upon the agreements we made in Malta to normalize economic relations and work toward helping the Soviet Union integrate itself into the international economy.
In the Middle East we see new prospects for peace where once there was only contention. And together we will work toward building a lasting peace between Israel and her Arab neighbors. And we'll also work together to resolve difficulties and conflicts in Afghanistan and Cambodia, just as we worked to build peace and democracy in Angola, in Namibia and Nicaragua.
No longer must all the world serve as a stage for superpower standoffs. Instead, let every place from Central America to Angola to Afghanistan offer new hopes, new opportunities. And let us pursue shared goals: a stable world, no longer polarized, mutually beneficial economic ties, cooperation on everything from weapons proliferation to environmental problems.
President Gorbachev has earned our respect and admiration for his uncommon vision and courage in replacing old orthodoxy with glasnost and perestroika, but more fundamental than the relations of leaders are the shared values of their people. And here, our common humanity offers the greatest hope for mankind.
And yes, we have differences, but this hope can enable us to address our differences -- differences over Cuba or the future of the Baltic states, or what Japan calls the northern territories. But let's conduct all our affairs in the spirit of enduring partnership, based on politics peaceful and democratic, on economies productive and free.
 
Democratic Changes
 You see, Americans want to work with all levels of Soviet society. Beyond our central governments, we look for greater interaction between the citizens of our states and your republics. And beyond government, we seek greater understanding throughout the broad spectrum of society, among businessmen, students, artists and scientists.
So I come here on a state visit to the Soviet Union, but I also come to discover a rapidly changing country. So for the sake of peace and new prosperity, on behalf of all Americans, I come here today to assure President Gorbachev, the leaders, the great people of this land and each of its republics, that we stand with you in your historic struggle for democracy and reform.
Fifty years ago we united as allies to fight a horrible war, a war that cost the Soviet Union hundreds of thousands of lives. So this week, let us come together to seek a newer world: more stable, more just, more peaceful. And thank you, and may God bless the Soviet people -- the sovereign people of this Soviet Union. We're delighted to be here, Mr. President.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
On the London Stage, a Feast of Revenge, Menace and Guilt

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Tyranny, torture and vengeance were the subjects of plays here this summer as England's continuing concern for political theater assumed as a global perspective. On various London stages there were outspoken plays from Chile, the Soviet Union and Trinidad, among other countries. England itself was represented by a brief sketch by Harold Pinter entitled "The New World Order," inspired by the war in the Persian Gulf. The intentionally ironic title of that piece resonated in a number of other works that questioned the results of sweeping geopolitical changes as well as revisionist history.
By far the most powerful of the plays was Ariel Dorfman's "Death and the Maiden," in the upstairs studio space at the Royal Court Theater. Through the years, the Royal Court has itself been a frequent setting for plays that address challenging issues by playwrights from John Osborne through Caryl Churchill and Timberlake Wertenbaker. 
 The new drama by Mr. Dorfman, an exiled Chilean novelist and playwright who lives in the United States, was the centerpiece of a monthlong political mini-festival within the annual London International Festival of Theater. Through the cooperative efforts of the Royal Court and the Royal National Theaters, "Death and the Maiden" was paired with a series of curtain-raisers. I saw it with "The New World Order."
It was Mr. Pinter who was instrumental in bringing the Dorfman play to the attention of the Royal Court. His own sketch, offering a variation on themes of oppression evoked in his "One for the Road" and "Mountain Language," set the ominous tone for the main play.
As tautly directed by Lindsay Posner and acted by a cast of three headed by Juliet Stevenson, "Death and the Maiden" proved to be a play of ideas in the guise of a political thriller. In it, Mr. Dorfman illuminates both the psychopathological results of torture on an individual and the corruptive effects of years of tyranny on a country's psyche.
"People can die from an excess of truth," warns a cautious liberal lawyer (Bill Paterson). He has just been appointed to a presidential commission investigating violations of human rights in a country like Chile. But as the lawyer's wife (Miss Stevenson) responds, the only way to salvage their communal soul is to face the truth of the past, regardless of the consequences. She speaks from her own excruciating experience as a victim of torture during the country's days of repression.
She has carried the psychological devastation of her ordeal with her for more than 15 years, even as the country has changed leadership. Democracy promises a new order, but having endured tyranny, she knows how easily it can return. Suddenly, the doctor who was her primary assailant re-enters her life, or so she thinks. She had been blindfolded during the interrogation and can only identify him through his voice and his mannerisms. Confronting him in the present, she plots a savage course of revenge.
Once past the contrived beginning -- the doctor is introduced in an act of peacetime good samaritanism -- the play moves through twists and turns, riveting the audience for an unrelenting 90 minutes. The suspenseful, cat-and-mouse drama is deepened by the political arguments, as conscience collides with temporal justice, as a desire for retribution conflicts with moral responsibility.
Though the play deals with a South American situation, it achieves a universality that extends beyond the political into an area that is movingly personal. Watching Miss Stevenson take the law into her own hands, one thinks of the anguish felt by victims of rape and other crimes who are unable to prove their case in court.
One of many paradoxes of the play is that the husband's human rights commission will limit itself to people who have died, implying that only death can certify true victimization. As the wife wonders, in any new world order what will happen to the walking wounded and the permanently impaired, like herself? Wisely, Mr. Dorfman leaves conclusions open, in a play that audiences will carry out of the theater and into life.
On this small stage, all three actors deliver knife-edge performances, Mr. Paterson as the temporizing husband, Michael Byrne as the captor turned terrified captive and, most important, Miss Stevenson as the avenging angel, a woman whose sanity is at stake along with a country's future. Coming after her deeply moving performances in recent London seasons as Hedda Gabler at the National Theater and opposite John Malkovich in "Burn This," "Death and the Maiden" consolidates her position as one of the most extraordinary of young English actresses.
 
'The New World Order'
 In his confession (which may or may not be true), the doctor admits to being seduced by his sinister work. In the Pinter sketch, two watchmen (Mr. Paterson and Mr. Byrne) stand guard over a blindfolded prisoner and insidiously threaten him. With Mr. Pinter, words wound along with deeds. Then Mr. Byrne reveals that his position of authority has given him a feeling of purity, of being able to keep "the world safe for democracy." In this fiendish cameo of menace, the author concludes that fascism does not have exclusivity in matters of injustice.
In an essay celebrating Mr. Pinter's 60th birthday, printed in the 1990 edition of The Pinter Review, Carlos Fuentes links himself to the playwright in having "failed dreams," and praises Mr. Pinter for opening "a terrifying chasm between memory and remembrance, reality and imagination, past and present." Those words also apply, in varying degrees, to other political plays on the London stage.
 
'Brothers and Sisters'
 Coincident with the series at the Royal Court, the London festival presented the Maly Drama Theater of Leningrad, with a production of "Brothers and Sisters," a six-hour, two-part epic adapted by the director Lev Dodin from a trilogy of novels. This is the play that canceled its New York engagement in 1988 because of a lack of financing.
"Brothers and Sisters" is a monumental chronicle about World War II and its aftermath. Simultaneously, it is bitter in its indictment of the Stalinist regime and revealing in its intimate portrait of a community at war with itself. Mr. Dodin's staging of this rich narrative tapestry is a model of economy and innovation.
 
'The Coup'
 Next to the intensity of "Death and the Maiden" and the breadth of "Brothers and Sisters," Mustapha Matura's new play, "The Coup," at the National, seems small in scale. It is a satiric comedy about the limits of revolution.
Mr. Matura can be a very comic writer, as he demonstrated in plays like "Meetings," and, to his credit, he kicks sacred cows. In the post-revolutionary environment of "The Coup," everyone is tainted, not only the strong-armed but also the high-minded, and the newly elected, newly imprisoned president (Norman Beaton). He is a smooth rascal who wins the audience's allegiance even though he is a master of extortion and more serious crimes against the state. With sharpening (in writing as well as performance), "The Coup" would cut deeper.
 
'White Chameleon'
 In contrast, Christopher Hampton's "White Chameleon," at the National, is not overtly a political play. But it is more socially conscious and more personal than other works by the playwright, who is best known for adaptations like "Les Liaisons Dangereuses." The new play is an autobiographical reflection on the failed dreams of the author's boyhood in Egypt, where his father was employed as an engineer during the Suez Canal crisis.
The core of the play, not fully developed, deals with the young Hampton's father-son relationship with an Egyptian servant (a probing performance by Saeed Jaffrey) who remains an Anglophile even to his own jeopardy. Beneath the family story and the tale of a writer's beginnings is commentary on Britain's colonialist past, as represented by the rude remark that "wogs begin at Calais." In other words, everyone beyond the boundaries of the British Isles is considered a member of a third (and lesser) world.
Mr. Hampton's wry response is that the mean-mindedness of his countrymen made them victims of their own insularity and doomed the empire.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Democrats Find Issue: Helping the Unemployed

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
After months of agonizing, the Democrats have found a way of translating their talk about helping the middle class into a serious legislative proposal: to provide more unemployment benefits for people who have been out of work more than half a year.
They are rushing to send a bill to President Bush before they go on vacation this weekend, but may still fail at that. Senate Republicans, who could thwart them, are uncertain how obstructive to be because they recognize the issue could put their party and President Bush at a disadvantage. 
 For the Democrats, this is not only an issue that helps burnish their own image as the party that cares about people. It also provides a rare opportunity for them to approach a domestic problem in a way intended to dent President Bush's greatest strength: his handling of foreign affairs.
 
A 'Dire Emergency'
 Their most telling argument, made today as the House Ways and Means Committee approved the $6.4 billion bill on a near party-line vote, was that helping unemployed Americans was a "dire emergency." .
Urging the committee to approve the bill, Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk, said the plight of Americans who had exhausted the regular 26 weeks of benefits was "every bit the emergency that the flood in Bangladesh was," adding, "It is every bit the emergency that the Kurds in the mountains of Turkey were."
Despite an unusually high degree of coordination between Senate and House leaders, the Democrats may fail in their effort to get both chambers to agree on a bill and send it to President Bush before going on vacation this weekend.
That depends on how hard Senate Republicans are prepared to fight the measure and risk the reputation of having stalled aid for more than a million unemployed workers. (No one has a close guess on just how many would be helped.) Some Senate Republicans would just as soon put Mr. Bush on the spot, and veto the measure if he wants, rather than take the heat themselves.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, has made it clear he will delay any votes until after the release of July unemployment totals on Friday, at the earliest. Today he exchanged threats with the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, about how long, if it seemed necessary, each could keep the Senate in session past the planned weekend adjournment.
But Mr. Dole's position is undercut by the fact that nine Senate Republicans have already announced their support for the bill before the Senate, proposed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat. The measure would pay for extended benefits by declaring the situation a budget emergency.
 
Appeal to Lawmakers
 Their reasoning is simple. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi said today that although the unemployment level in his state is 10 percent, it does not qualify for extended benefits under current law. A spokesman for Senator John Seymour of California said state officials had told him that the bill would provide benefits for 550,000 Californians.
One reason this issue appeals to Democrats and concerns Republicans is that, as Mr. Downey put it today, unemployment compensation is a "middle-class entitlement program."
About 40 percent of the unemployed are eligible for benefits, but they are the ones who have generally stable employment records. Isaac Shapiro, a senior research analyst at the Center for Budget and Priorities, a research organization here, said recent studies have shown that few of the long-term unemployed were below the poverty line before they lost their jobs, and that three-fifths of them come from families with incomes from $15,000 to $50,000.
Democrats have talked and talked about how they must identify with the middle class to reclaim voters lost to the Republicans on pocketbook issues and their hopes of legislation on income taxes and health insurance follow that desire.
Under current law, extended benefits are available in only three states, Alaska, Maine and Rhode Island, and in Puerto Rico. Half of the cost of the benefits is paid by the states and half by the Federal Government.
Both Senate and House bills would have the Federal Government pay the whole bill and change the standard of measurement for determining when extended benefits are paid.
Workers in every state would be eligible for some additional benefits, a device that gives every lawmaker some reason to support a bill.
Benefits now average $160 per week nationally and vary greatly from state to state. The highest state average last year was $217 a week in Massachusetts. The lowest was $79 a week in Louisiana.
The House bill is permanent legislation; the Senate's is temporary, and costs slightly less at $5.8 billion.
Each would pay the bill by declaring an emergency and increasing the deficit.
Until today, the House bill would have given Mr. Bush the option of choosing deficit financing or imposing higher payroll taxes on employers. But House Democrats, afraid to be caught voting for any kind of tax, backed off that option and amended the bill on a voice vote in committee so that the bill, like the Senate bill, now relies on deficit financing.
To Democratic contentions that the plight of the unemployed was a real emergency, Representative Bill Gradison, Republican of Ohio, insisted their approach showed, "We're not serious about deficit reduction." He said the bill would "punch a 6-billion-dollar hole in the budget agreement."
But only one Democrat, Representative Don J. Pease of Ohio, voted with Mr. Gradison. Two Republicans, Representatives Raymond J. McGrath of New York and Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut, voted for the bill. The vote was 24 to 12.
The House is expected to vote on the bill and pass it by a large margin on Thursday.
 
Bush May Play Role
 That will leave final passage up to Senate Republicans. Friday's unemployment numbers, and whether they go up or down from the June 7.0 percent total will matter to them. It would also be surprising if they did not ask President Bush, who will return from the Soviet Union on Thursday night, to play a role.
Until now, only only Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Lynn Martin, the Secretary of Labor, were raising the argument about the deficit and talking about the likelihood that recovery would make more benefits unnecessary.
Some Republicans who were deeply involved in last year's budget negotiations take those arguments seriously -- especially Mr. Gradison, Mr. Dole and Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, ranking minority member of the Budget Committee.
But others, like Eddie Mahe, a prominent Republican consultant, consider those arguments politically foolish. he said it was not only political, but also proper, to help the unemployed. But if Mr. Bush opposed the measure, he said, it would perpetuate the image of "Republicans acting like Scrooge, Democrats caring about people."
And Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina had a succinct piece of advice for his party on how to handle the Bentsen bill.
"Punt," he said.

Congress effectively gave its blessing today to a plan to close 25 major military installations and nine smaller ones when the House of Representatives voted 364 to 60 to uphold a Federal commission's recommendations.
But House members who complained that domestic bases were absorbing the brunt of Pentagon budget-cutting also won approval for a proposal that would give the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission new power to close overseas bases as well. 
 The House vote is likely to be the final action Congress takes on base closings this year, ending a four-month-long process that began with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's recommendations on April 12.
The Senate could still act separately on the commission report, but its action would now be a technicality even if it rejected the plan because both chambers would have to pass resolutions of disapproval to stop the shutdowns. Congress had 45 legislative days after President Bush approved the recommendations July 10 to act on the plan, which will push the deadline into some time in the fall.
 
Condemnation Continues
 Lawmakers who had opposed the commission's recommendations continued to condemn the decisions today even though they conceded it was unlikely they could save their bases.
Representative Curt Weldon, Republican of Pennsylvania, brought a giant rubber stamp to the floor of the House that had the word "RUSH" imprinted on its side. "It was a rubber stamp process from the beginning," said Mr. Weldon, who represents a district near the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, one of the bases selected to be shut.
But far more lawmakers conceded that their fight was over and urged the Federal Government to help local communities with problems after the bases are closed, including environmental clean-up and economic readjustment.
"All of us have to move beyond this vote," said Representative Leon Panetta, Democrat of California. "The challenge that faces 122 communties in this country is only beginning." Mr. Panetta's district includes Fort Ord in Seaside, Calif.
Mr. Panetta, whose district includes Fort Ord, voted against the commission report. In Connecticut, all three Democrats opposed the closings, while the three Republicans supported them. The commission report was also rejected by members of the Massachusetts, Pennsylvania Indiana and Louisiana delegations. Large bases are scheduled to be closed in each of those states.
The domestic closings, which would include reductions and consolidation at 48 other sites and within the Army Corps of Engineers would eliminate 80,000 military and 37,000 civilian jobs.
The base closings proposed by the commission would cost $4.1 billion from 1992 to 1997, but save about $1.5 billion a year after that. The Army Corps of Engineers reduction would eliminate 2,600 jobs for an annual savings of $112 million.
On the issue of bases overseas, the Pentagon announced today that it would close 72 military bases in Europe by 1995 and reduce the number of troops at seven others. Under current law, the Pentagon has sole power to decide which overseas sites should cease operation and Mr. Cheney had opposed today's Congressional action.
"We think that's a terrible idea," a Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said prior to the 411-to-14 House vote in favor of giving the commission the added power. "We think that would, in fact, make it harder to close facilities overseas."
Mr. Williams said the current process, in which the Pentagon notifies host counries of their plan to close installations, is beneficial because the Pentagon does not then have to "trot up to Congress and run this list past them."
But several lawmakers said they voted for the resolution on foreign bases, which the Pentagon opposed, as a way of stating their opposition to the base closing process.
"Here we are with all these installations in West Germany protecting West Germany from East Germany, except it's all one Germany, and all the East Germans are now in West Germany, shopping at the mall," said Representative Paricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado and chairwoman of the House Armed Services Committee's panel on military installations and facilities.
"I think the American people are getting sick and tired of being the 911 number for the rest of the world," Representative Schroeder said.
But there were some complaints that the proposal, which must also win Senate approval to become effective, was politically motivated.
 
 Pentagon Timing Intended
 Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon, Republican of New York, said the proposal called it a "political face-saving" maneuver. Mr. Williams conceded today that the timing of the announcement on the 72 new bases slated for closure was intended, in part, to sway Congress on the matter of foreign bases.
The overseas sites selected for shutdown today range from a major military airport in Berlin to barracks, ammunition depots, a bakery and gas station.
In all, the military will close 38 sites in Germany, 13 in Britain, 8 in Italy, 7 in Turkey, 5 in Spain and one in the Netherlands. The Pentagon will reduce its operations at seven other sites in Germany.
The Pentagon has said it plans to close or pare operations at 314 sites in Europe, with an overall goal to close about one-third of its 1,600 overseas facilities by 1995.
Today's announcement will affect 12,5000 military and civilian personnel over the next five years.
The base closing commission's chairman, Jim Courter, a former member of Congress from New Jersey, would not say whether he would welcome the power to shut down overseas bases. But he praised Congress' action approving the commission's report.

HEADLINE: Family Sought New Life Only to Find New Pain

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, July 30

 BODY:
In a white, neatly kept bungalow on this city's north side, the Sinthasomphone family grieves quietly for its youngest member. The family who had fled repression in Laos more than a decade ago is trying to make sense of the death of 14-year-old Konerak, said family members, whose dismembered body was among the 11 found by the police last week in the apartment of Jeffrey L. Dahmer.
Sounthone, the boy's 52-year-old unemployed father, sits listlessly in the kitchen smoking cigarettes, unable to speak about his son's death. His mother, Somdy, 50, has fainted three or four times since the news arrived, family members said, and early this morning was rushed to a local hospital by one of her sons because she was shaking uncontrollably. His four brothers and three sisters have existed in a numb world in which they quietly reflect about their brother. 
 "We don't have energy to do anything," said Anouke Sinthasomphone, a 27-year-old brother of the dead boy. "We can't sleep. We can't eat."
Mrs. Sinthasomphone has had all the photographs in their home of her son removed, except the one that adorns a small shrine in the living room.
 
Brimming With Hope
 They arrived in Milwaukee a decade ago, a new immigrant family brimming with hope and lured to America by other relatives and friends already living in the city's flourishing Laotian community of 7,000 people.
The family fled Laos in March 1979 because the communists threatened to take away Mr. Sinthasomphone's rice farm in a village near the Laotian capital of Vientiane, said Kongpheth Vonghasouk, who is married to Mr. Sinthasomphone's eldest daughter, Thaeone.
"The communists tried to get his land and that's why he escaped," Mr. Vongphasouk said. "They also tried to get him because they said he did something wrong, but he didn't do anything wrong."
Thailand, which offered a refugee for Laotians and Cambodians fleeing repressive regimes at home, lay just across the Mekong River. Mr. Sinthasomphone built a canoe and sent his entire family across the river late one night, with the youngest children drugged with sleeping pills so they would not cry and attract the notice of soldiers near the river, Mr. Vongphasoukh said.
A few days later, Mr. Sinthasomphone swam the river himself, and was reunited with the rest of his family in a refugee camp where they lived for a year. At the camp, the family made contact with representatives of American-based refugee relocation programs and, with the help of a relocation program supported by Catholic archdiocese in Milwaukee, the family moved to the city in 1980.
In the past decade, the Sinthasomphone children have become acclimated to their new lives and are fluent English speakers. Several of the older ones have taken jobs as welders, machinists or assembly line workers to support themselves and their parents. The parents have had a harder time adjusting to their new home and speak little English.
Their lives here have not been easy but they felt America offered more opportunities and a better quality of life than what they had left behind, said one son, Anouke, 27.
But since Konerak's remains were found in Mr. Dahmer's apartment last week, Mr. Sinthasomphone has been asking why he moved his family to America.
"My father-in-law said: 'I escaped the communists and now this happens. Why?' " Mr. Vongphasouk said. "I feel very sorry. I didn't think something like this would ever happen."
The Rev. Peter Burns, a Catholic priest in Sheboygan, Wis., who has known the family for most of their time in this country, agreed that this a difficult time for Mr. Sinthasomphone. "Obviously anyone who has gone through such a tragedy as this would wonder if they've chosen the right path for their lives," he said.
 
A Pain Hard to Bear
 Indeed, other family members said nothing about the harshness of their past could prepare them for the anguish they now feel about the details surrounding Konerak's death.
Neighbors called the police on May 27, when saw a young boy, now identified as Konerak, on the street near Mr. Dahmer's apartment building. He was naked, bleeding and disoriented, apparently because he had been drugged. Witnesses said the police returned the boy to Mr. Dahmer after Mr. Dahmer told the officers that they quarreling lovers.
Konerak's death, family members said, has been all the harder to bear since the family had been victimized before by Mr. Dahmer.
An older brother, now 16 years old, was sexually molested by Mr. Dahmer in 1988. Mr. Dahmer, who is charged with four counts of murder and is likely to charged with more, was convicted of that crime in 1989, but his eight-year prison sentence was stayed by State Judge William Gardner after Mr. Dahmer wrote a remorseful letter apologizing for the incident. He was released in early 1990 after serving one year of his sentence and put on probation.
The family refuses to talk about its first brush with Mr. Dahmer. "It is a touchy topic with them," Mr. Burns said, a Catholic priest in Sheboygan, Wis., who has known the family for most of their time in this country. And the family only reluctantly speaks about its second contact with the 31-year-old unemployed man, who lured Konerak into his apartment with the promise of money for posing for pictures, the police have said.
Family members said they wish they had been told about Mr. Dahmer's early release from jail. But a spokesman for the Milwaukee Police Department said the department did, tell the family that Mr. Dahmer had been granted probation.
The family has turned to their culture and faith for comfort. They have built a small shrine, with a photo of Konerak surrounded by burning candles and fresh flowers, on a small table in one corner of the room.
Small bowls of sliced cucumbers, fried rice and vegetables from the family's kitchen sat before the photo, where twice a day the family and visiting friends offer prayers for the young boy's soul.
"We will do this until we get his remains and bury him or create him," Anouke Sinthasomphone, one of the brothers, said quietly. A service is tentatively planned either for Sunday night or Monday night at St. John's Cathedral here, the church that helped sponsor the Sinthasomphone family's voyage to America.
While Anouke Sinthasomphone watched, two of his brothers and a cousin knelt before the shrine. They stared at Konerak's photograph. Not far from the photograph, a small card taped near the shrine offered some comfort, "Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Cuban Packs Fastball And Fires at the Pros

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 30

 BODY:
Until a few weeks ago Rene Arocha was in the starting rotation of Cuba's national baseball team, a right-hander with a 92 mile-per-hour fastball who was expected to help make his countrymen and their leader proud when the Pan American Games begin Friday in Havana.
Instead, the 27-year-old ballplayer was working out at a public park here last week, pausing occasionally to have his picture taken with one young admirer or to autograph the baseball cap of another. 
 As the first Cuban baseball star to defect to the United States, Arocha has acquired an instant following in a city where Cuban refugees and their children make up the majority of the population.
But since slipping away from his teammates and handlers at Miami International Airport on July 10, Arocha has been concentrating on gaining a foothold in professional baseball in America.
 
Cautious Scouts
 Several teams have sent scouts, but they are cautious about his prospects and deterred by immigration procedures that could keep him out of professional ball for up to a year.
"I've always wanted to play in the big leagues, and the freedom that exists in this country is very good too," Arocha said in an interview Thursday. "To leave Cuba was both a personal decision for my well being and a political decision."
From Fidel Castro's point of view, Arocha's defection could not have come at a worse time. Cuba is in the midst of an economic and political crisis that has no parallel in 32 years of Communist rule, and the Pan-American Games, which begin on Friday, are intended both to showcase the achievements of "socialist sport" and provide Cubans with a welcome diversion from the country's troubles.
If only because his wife and 8-year-old daughter remain in Cuba, Arocha has avoided attempts by the Cuban exile community here to enlist his support in the anti-Castro cause, saying "I know nothing about politics."
But he is fully aware that the decision to turn his back on the state sports apparatus that discovered and trained him constitutes a slap in the face to Castro at a very delicate moment.
 
No Reprisals
 "If I were there, or if I went back, I know there would be reprisals," he said. "But there have been no reprisals against my family, and even if we weren't on the eve of the Pan American Games, I do not think there would be. It's not their fault. They haven't done anything, and they didn't know anything."
Of his wife and child Arocha said, "I don't have the means right now to get them out, but I know this is something I have to do, because I miss them greatly."
It is not the first time he has been in such a position: his father fled Cuba during the Mariel boatlift in 1980, and Arocha did not see him again until they met at the Miami airport this month.
As the No. 3 starter on a squad considered to be one of the best in the world, Arocha enjoyed both celebrity and a certain degree of privilege in Cuba.
When the team competed abroad, he said, "We were paid in dollars, which gave us the right when we got back home to shop in the special hard-currency store." As a result he and his teammates could buy goods not available to ordinary Cubans.
"Even so, the life of a baseball player in Cuba is rather difficult," Arocha added. "In spite of their prestige, players have to put up with bad conditions and most of the same privations as the general population."
 
Professional Scale
 Nominally a physical education teacher, Arocha earned 211 pesos a month, the equivalent of about $300 at official rates of exchange but only $42 on the black market.
"Players earn not according to their performance but to their profession," he said. "If you're an engineer, you make what any other engineer makes, and if you're a garbageman, you make what garbagemen make. You don't get a cent more for being a ballplayer."
When asked if championship performances were rewarded with cash bonuses, improved housing or other prizes, as is the case in China and some other Communist countries, his eyes widened in surprise and he said: "Bonuses? What bonuses?"
On the road, he said, the national team stayed in dormitories attached to the stadiums where the team played.
"They were just like army barracks, with a lot of guys trying to use what few facilities there were," he said.
Players are recruited and developed, Arocha said, through an elaborate scouting system that spots the most promising players at the age of seven or eight and then tracks them through their childhood years.
 
American Highlights
 The best end up at the Commander Manuel Fajardo School, where they train during the day and attend classes at night. They then move on to major league competition, which consists of 118 games divided between two major tournaments each year.
A few American players, like Nolan Ryan, Roger Clemens, Don Mattingly, and Dwight Gooden are known to the most devoted Cuban fans, Arocha said. But the best-known big league star is Jose Canseco, who comes from Arocha's hometown of Regla, just outside Havana. Canseco invited Arocha to Oakland last weekend.
"We went out to dinner together and were together at the stadium for the series against the Yankees," Arocha said. "He introduced me to Tony La Russa, who said he would send a scout to Miami to look at me."
By seeing a big league game, Arocha did something the average Cuban fan can only dream about.
"On television, there are no games and no news of the big leagues, but some people listen to games on the radio from stations over here," he said. "The Government doesn't want to permit it, but it knows that nothing can be done to prevent it, so it doesn't interfere."
There is also an underground market for videotapes of American games. Arocha said he first became aware of Canseco through one such tape smuggled into the country.
 
'Excellent Control'
 Manuel Hurtado, who was Arocha's pitching coach in Cuba until defecting himself two years ago, said that scouts from seven teams, including the Mets and the Yankees, have already watched Arocha work out.
"He's always had excellent control and good speed," Hurtado said. "But now he has more experience, which has made him a smarter pitcher, and he's also developed a sinker to go with the fastball, curve, slider and knuckleball he already had. I think he's ready for the big leagues."
Roland Johnson, scouting director for the Mets, isn't so sure. "We're not real interested," he said. "He could probably play in the minor leagues, but we don't think he is a major league prospect.
Arocha has been a member of Cuba's national team for a decade, representing his country in tournaments "on every continent except Africa," as he put it.
One of his strongest performances at the Intercontinental Cup in Havana in 1987, when he compiled a 3-0 record and a 1.64 e.r.a., striking out 24 batters in 22 innings.
 
Discrepany in Age
 Despite those numbers there are a couple of concerns for major league teams. One is his age. Arocha says he's 25, but the International Baseball Association lists his date of birth as Feb. 24, 1964, making him 27.
In any case, league rules would prohibit teams from signing Arocha while he is still a Cuban national. To his frustration, he will be eligible only when he gains his American residency, a process that will take at least a year.
"I don't understand it," he said. "I have come here seeking liberty, and they are closing the door on me. I can only hope this case can resolve itself soon. I'm convinced that if I have to sit around waiting for an entire year, after a year I won't be the same."

Mr. Bush's Nightmare

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
President Bush has a nightmare: It's November 1992. Deficits climb so high that even Republicans notice. The Democratic Presidential candidate miraculously doesn't turn out to be an embarrassment. And worst of all, CNN is doing a special from downtown Baghdad, featuring a smiling figure in desert uniform.
The figure is not Norman Schwarzkopf. It's you-know-who, and he has just disclosed the existence of you-know-what's to Peter Arnett. 
 Sweating and trembling, Mr. Bush awakens and renders the Henry II line he learned so well at Yale: "Won't some guy bump off this turbulent Arab for me? Get me A. M. Rosenthal or Chuck Krauthammer!"
A year ago Mr. Bush set out to destroy most of Saddam Hussein's military striking power, and did so. But a year from now and in the heat of elections, that victory will loom small if Saddam remains in power.
As if to flag that awful prospect, U.S. intelligence reports are saying that Saddam is stronger inside Iraq today than at any time since his armies fled Kuwait. Worse still, Saddam has hidden away an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction as well as the missiles to deliver them -- in blatant violation of the U.N. cease-fire resolution.
Which is why one of George Bush's most important and closely guarded conversations with Mikhail Gorbachev was about Iraq. His aim was to gain Mr. Gorbachev's neutrality should Washington decide to enforce the U.N. resolution and strike Iraqi military targets.
The Soviet leader, I suspect, tried to trade his neutrality on Iraq for economic aid, the very aid denied to Moscow just two weeks ago at the London summit of industrialized democracies. Mr. Bush must have struggled to keep the two subjects separate by stressing the extent and gravity of Saddam's cheating.
He surely told Mr. Gorbachev that the U.S. knows beyond doubt that Saddam has failed to declare the following: a continuing capability to build nuclear bombs plus some actual nuclear material; nearly half his prewar chemical weapons stocks; most of his biological weapons, and in excess of 100 Scud missiles.
Mr. Gorbachev undoubtedly clucked sympathetically, but made no commitments. He knew he had the U.S. over a barrel. First, Saddam is solidifying his power internally, though U.S. officials argue over how strong he really is. Second, oil prices are going up as future demand is expected to exceed supply. This means worldwide pressure to let Iraqi oil flow abroad again, especially if Soviet oil exports continue to shrink. Third, U.N. pressure to relax sanctions against Iraq mounts as reports grow of dire food and pharmaceuticals shortages. Even the U.S. is considering a one-time exception for Iraqi oil sales to meet these needs. Fourth, most members of the victorious coalition are making noises against the use of even limited air attacks by the U.S. and Britain.
So it seems that Mr. Bush desperately needs Mr. Gorbachev's support to take military action. Or does he? Soviet silence would be helpful, but it is not necessary.
Mr. Bush takes the position that the existing U.N. resolution gives him all the enforcement authority he requires -- and he is right, which means he does not have to face a Soviet veto on a new resolution. Besides, he needs backing from West Europeans and Arabs more than from the Soviets. Europeans' and Arabs' resistance today is not much different from their hesitations in January. Mr. Bush prevailed on them then and can do so again.
The way to galvanize that support and shut Moscow up is to call for a formal U.N. finding that Saddam is in violation of the U.N. cease-fire resolution. No one can vote against such a finding, or be blind to its consequences.
As for the home front, Senator Dole will sponsor a resolution with Senator Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat, empowering the President to "use all available and appropriate means" to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The Democrats may seek to amend the language, but they will not make the mistake of saying no twice to a just and popular cause.
So whatever happens in the Bush-Gorbachev meetings, Saddam should be the one having nightmares. As Mr. Bush said about the Iraqi dictator the other day, he would be making "an enormous mistake" by cheating on the U.N. resolution.

HEADLINE: U.S. Said to Give Israel and Syria Private Assurances to Get Them to
Talks

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
The United States has given Israel and Syria private assurances to persuade them to attend the proposed Middle East peace conference, American, Arab and Israeli officials say.
 The most important of these, the officials say, is Washington's assurance to Israel that it would support Israel's insistence that no Palestinians from East Jerusalem or linked to the Palestine Liberation Organization would be allowed to attend the talks when and if Israel sits down with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to discuss self-rule in the West Bank. 
Some of the promises have already been divulged by Syria and Israel. Others remain unpublicized, but Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has promised all sides that all such assurances will be disclosed to the other parties before they agree to sit down.
 
U.S. and Golan Heights
 In its effort to bring Syria to the bargaining table, Arab and American officials said that the United States had assured the Damascus Government that it had never recognized the de facto Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights in 1981, when Israeli law was extended there, and that Washington believed that "all fronts," including the Golan, are subject to United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Those resolutions call on Israel to trade territories occupied in the 1967 Middle East war for secure and recognized boundaries with its neighbors.
 The Israeli Government argues that because Israel has traded the Sinai for peace with Egypt, it has fulfilled the territorial obligation of the resolutions. But the officials said that Washington had told the Syrians that while the resolutions applied to "all fronts," that did not mean that the United States was committed to Syria's getting back all of the territory it controlled in the Golan, as Damascus demands. How much it gets back must be subject to negotiations, the officials said.
 Mr. Baker has also acknowledged to the Israelis and to the Syrians that the Bush Administration will "fully honor and respect" a 1975 letter from President Ford to Yitzhak Rabin, then premier, stating that the United States "will give great weight to Israel's position that any peace agreement with Syria must be predicated on Israel remaining in the Golan Heights."
 
Palestinian Representation
 But none of the American assurances is causing more of a problem than those concerning Palestinian representation, according to the officials, who were interviewed in recent days.
 The Bush Administration decided several months ago that because the Palestinians were the weakest party in the equation and the one most desperate to change the status quo, and because the previous Israeli Government broke apart when pressed by Washington to agree to negotiate with Palestinians from Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, the United States would ask the Palestinians to compromise here.
 In a meeting in Jerusalem last week, Mr. Baker told two Palestinian leaders, Faisal Husseini and Hanan Ashrawi, that while the United States still did not recognize the 1967 Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem, the Palestinians would nevertheless have to accept the Israeli demand that no Palestinians from East Jerusalem could participate in the first phase of negotiations between Israel and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
 Under the American proposal, the peace conference would have several phases. The first would be an opening plenary conference sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union, with United Nations and European Community observers and the various Arab and Israeli participants. It would last one or two days and involve only speeches by the participants.
 The conference would then break up into separate talks between Israel and Syria, Israel and Lebanon, and Israel and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. The first phase between Israel and the joint Jordanian-Palestinian team would be limited to negotiating an interim arrangement for Palestinian self-rule under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 
East Jerusalem Question
 And the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, said in a concise statement of his Government's position: "We will not negotiate about Jerusalem and therefore we will not talk with any Arabs living in East Jerualem."
 Palestinian and other officials said the Palestinians argued to Mr. Baker that if no East Jerusalemites and no one with links to the P.L.O. were allowed to attend the conference, then he was making it politically impossible and potentially life-threatening for any Palestinian to take part.
 In response, the officials said the Administration had told the Palestinians that a Palestinian now living in Jordan, with a Jordanian passport, who traced his roots to Jerusalem, could come to the talks as part of the Jordanian half of the Jordanian-Palestinian team. There are several Jordanian Government officials who fit that description.
 The Administration officials also noted that all the parties had agreed that the first stage of negotiations would only be dealing with the issue of self-rule for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and not the final status of Jerusalem or the territories. According to the latest United States proposal for peace talks, the second stage of negotiations between Israel and the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation must begin no later than three years after self-rule goes into effect, during which the Israelis will have to discuss the final status with Palestinians.
 
U.S. and Palestinians
 The officials said that the Administration had assured the Palestinians that it had made no promises to Israel about keeping East Jerusalemites away from the second stage of talks. Indeed, they said, it has tried to persuade the Israelis to let them attend. Washington is also said to have suggested that the Jerusalem issue might be handled in a separate negotiation at which it would be logical for East Jerusalem Palestinians to be included.
 American officials have told the Palestinians not to waste energy fighting the symbolic East Jerusalem issue, where Washington agrees with Israel, but to concentrate on the substantive question of self-rule, where Washington agrees with the Palestinians. Ever since the Middle East peace plan proposed by the Reagan Administration in 1982, the United States has supported "participation by the Palestinian inhabitants of East Jerualem" in any elections by Palestinians for self-rule.
 Administration officials said they were now considering some sort of symbolic gesture toward the Palestinians that would give them at least some political cover for sending a non-P.L.O., non-East Jerusalemite delegation without simultaneously alienating the Israelis. Among the alternatives being tossed around, they said, is inviting Mr. Husseini to the White House for a meeting with President Bush, or issuing some sort of statement that would contain a qualified or restricted endorsement of the right of Palestinians to "self-determination."
 
Palestinian Self-Determination
 This latter option, which the Palestinians told Mr. Baker they would prefer, would have to be done very delicately because the United State has never explicitly acknowledged the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, since that implies a right to independent statehood, an outcome the United States has never favored.
 The officials said that the Syrians had told Washington that they were worried that talks between Israel and the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation would come up with an interim agreement and that the Syrian-Israeli talks would be deadlocked, and Damascus could be left with nothing. President Hafez al-Assad of Syria is said to want no agreements on one front implemented before agreements on other fronts were reached.
 The Israelis rejected this, the officials said, adding that the Americans finally told the Syrians that both the Soviet Union and the United States were committed to press all the negotiations to move forward at an equally vigorous pace, but without formally linking them. Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, has declared that Damascus has been assured by both Washington and Moscow that Israel will not be allowed to drag out the negotiations indefinitely.
 
Outsider Attendance
 The Syrians wanted the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Nations observer and the European Community observer to sit in not only at the opening, which is supposed to be attended by all the major parties, but also in the bilateral talks between Israel and Syria. The Israelis rejected this and the Americans told the Syrians that outsiders would only be allowed to attend if both Israel and Syria agreed.
 Israeli officials say Mr. Baker has assured them that they will be shown a draft of whatever invitation Washington and Moscow actually issue before it is sent out, so that they will not be confronted with objectionable language. The Israelis are said to be insisting that the invitation to the proposed joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation be sent to the Jordanians. They want the invitations to the Palestinians to be addressed to them as individuals, but apparently Mr. Baker has made no promises yet on this score.
 The officials said that Mr. Shamir had told President Bush, and American officials concur, that "we understand that the Soviet Union is meant to establish normal diplomatic ties with us before the opening" of the conference. At the moment, the Soviet Union has diplomatic relations with Israel, but only at the level of consuls general -- not full ambassadors.

Israeli-Egyptian Talks
 CAIRO, July 30 (Special to The New York Times) -- Foreign Minister David Levy of Israel spent several hours with senior Egyptian officials today, discussing ways to break the impasse over a United States proposal for convening a Middle East peace conference, but no progress was reported.
 Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt and other officials in Cairo are using the three days of talks here with Mr. Levy, the first senior Israeli official to visit Egypt in two years, to try to push Israel to compromise on issues that are still blocking the peace talks.
 Mr. Levy is scheduled to return to Jerusalem on Wednesday after a morning meeting with President Hosni Mubarak. Mr. Levy and Mr. Mubarak also met briefly on Monday night.
 But a senior Israeli official in Cairo said today that Mr. Levy had no intention of negotiating with Egypt over matters relating to the American peace initiative, including the question of Palestinian delegates in any talks. Israeli officials say those matters are to be resolved between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Mr. Baker.
 Israel yearns for more normal economic and political ties with Egypt, the only Arab country that maintains diplomatic relations with Israel. But relations between the two countries have soured in the 14 years since former President Anwar el-Sadat made his dramatic trip to Jerusalem, reflecting in part Egyptian disappointment with what it regards as Israeli intransigence in coming to terms with the Palestinian problem.
 President Mubarak has refused to agree to any meeting with Mr. Shamir. But with Israel still balking at accepting the terms of the American iniative, the meetings this week have taken on an extra meaning, since Egypt is the only Arab state that can talk both to Israel and the P.L.O.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 1, 1991, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A subheading yesterday about a Middle East peace conference referred incorrectly to a major point of contention. It should have said, "Who represents the Palestinians is the biggest issue, officials say"; it should not have said "Palestine."
